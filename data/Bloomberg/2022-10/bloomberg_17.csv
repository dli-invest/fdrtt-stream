15058," We would control. I mean, we, you know, we, of course, disagree with the premise of that. But I would say that we have very good controls with respect to the data that different employees sets are able to see. And by the way, I think that we can be better for sellers. You know, I think that, you know, we can have better tools from the get started. We can have better tools from the manage what they're doing across their different Amazon units. I think we can communicate better. There's a whole bunch of things we can do better. And we agonize over every single email or communication we get from sellers. And we do very regularly robust surveying. And a lot more sellers are happy with Amazon than unhappy with Amazon. And I think if you look at what they're able to do is, you know, as a business by virtue of selling on Amazon versus not, it completely changes what's possible. Businesses don't really long for e-commerce software. That exists in lots of places. And it's not very expensive. What they love about selling on Amazon is that they get access to our hundreds of millions of customers. And that completely changes what their prospects can be in terms of the businesses they're building. So we have a lot of work to do there. Like we do in a lot of other places. But I think we have a very strong partnership with sellers. What's the view of the supply chain right now and how much pain there is going to continue to be and for how long? Well, you know, I think that there's a lot of challenges in the supply chain still. I mean, it's gotten better than it was. But there are all sorts of challenges, you know, non-parasable goods, electronics, chips are still a really significant issue for all sorts of businesses. We have worked really hard to open a lot more points of presence in ports and increase our capacity and getting products in. But I think it's going to be something that companies battle with for some time. You made a huge mark on Amazon with AWS, obviously. What is the mark that you want to make still on Amazon? I mean, in this new role, what's going to define the Andy Jassy era? Well, I don't really think of it that way, Emily. I mean, I don't think it's really about any Andy Jassy era or any one person, you know, and by the way, AWS was not about any one person. You know, if you spend a time on AWS, that is an unbelievable team, not just an incredible leadership team, which it is, but just top to bottom. The number of inventors and people care about customers and operate, you know, something where it has to work almost like a doubt. It's always teams. And so I look at every single one of our businesses and, you know, take our retail business, there are consumer business, which is the oldest for our businesses. 85% of it still lives offline. I think we have a lot of upside and a lot of growth. And I think as much invention as we've seen the last 25 years, you know, the time I've been there, I think it's going to look small compared to the next 25 years. There is a lot for us to invent on behalf of customers. And so, you know, I'm excited to be part of the team that makes that happen. You know, we are continuing to, you know, to increase the amount that we give back to the communities in which we have big presence. And that really matters to me. I think we have a responsibility to do that. And so, you know, it's a long journey that we're working on, but I'm excited to be part of it and, you know, I hope you've started for a long time. Well, thank you for joining us and telling us about the way the journey is going so far. Thank you very much. Thank you.

15059,"ï¿½ When US jobs numbers are released, Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed and instant expert analysis. Nobody covers jobs day like Bloomberg. A lot of the satellites have propulsion systems they can kind of move to get out of the way of each other or change their orbit a little bit. It's a service that you guys offered to help these companies know how to maneuver their machines. Yeah, we offer a collision avoidance service. It's a subscription service. We'll send you an alert up to seven days in advance if your satellite is going to come dangerously close to a piece of debris or another satellite. Companies have been doing that for decades moving satellites around, but it's sort of like a harder problem now. The risk of a collision is a lot higher now. Just because we've installed so much more hardware into space, you have a big collision that creates a cloud of debris and now all the other satellites are flying through this whizzing mess of debris. As we add all of the new satellites into space, the risks of a collision, the likelihood of the collisions going up. It was meaningful. Thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for having me. What drives you? What drives me? Oh my God. I love the idea of as simple as this uninclusive world, a world where people see themselves reflective because I was supposed to be invisible by your accounts. I was supposed to not be where I am. I was supposed to have disappeared a long time ago and every turn in my life was about visibility. Yes, I will be this person who's not supposed to be here. Yes, I will fight through the hard times. Yes, I won't give up. Even though I was sort of the token black editor in the industry in the 90s, I knew even then that I needed to bring people up with me. I needed to bring other people up with me. So that's really been a part of maybe it's maybe it was growing up in a family of six, I don't know. When you run a team, how do you instill that work ethic that kind of answering emails at all time? I mean, you know, I think you see an example, you know, if you're an editor who leaves and has lunches and it's never in the office, you know, you don't really sort of instill faith. My team know that we're on a mission, we have to reflect the world we live in, we have to reflect the beauty of multiculturalism, we have to reflect the beauty in...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3345,2022-10-16 00:05:03
15060," We're on a mission. We have to reflect the world we live in. We have to reflect the beauty of multiculturalism. We have to reflect the beauty and diversity and inclusivity. So everybody takes it really seriously and we really have intense conversations about the side guys and the world. And so I'm very lucky to have a team who are as passionate and I can call my team. I can call somebody at 6 a.m. or they can call me at 6 a.m. and I'll pick up and they'll pick up. So you know, we have something very special that we built over the past sort of five years. But there were difficult moments, right? I think the first time one of your first issues, you thought that you could have been fired for it. I'll check that. Right? I mean, I lived in America for a bit and I was working for W Magazine and there was talk of Brexit and of course Americans were like your country's really xenophobic. So I came back and I thought, you know, I'm going to be welcome with open arms and they're going to love me and oh my god, literally back to them by fire. But I remember thinking, you know, I wanted to create a magazine where every woman could see themselves. You know, where every woman regardless of the backgrounds, regardless of their age could just literally see themselves. And at the time, now it looks like it's the norm when you look at other magazines. But in 2017, that was that was a radical idea. But I also remember thinking, you know, with my background, you know, I've lost so much and gained so much that I thought, if I knew, if I'm fired, I'd rather be fired for what I believed in. I'd rather be fired for creating a magazine that reflected the world as it was than try to sort of create a second-rate version of someone's vision. And that continues. I mean, there's this idea of always pushing forward. Yeah. Right? What's the end? How do you measure success? How do I measure success? I'm definitely not financial. I mean, I think it's more about, for me, when I'm really exhausted, when I'm really tired, when I'm really questioning if I can go on, you know, I walk on this street and I see a little girl, a little black girl who's seen the magazine. And it's the norm for them all. A curvy woman on a traitor palace, who's like, thank you for, you know, seeing me, you know, that makes it worth it. That for me is success. And anybody who knows or has known me for a while will witness that for me is success. You know, my job is done when that happens. Do you think people come up to you? They do, but it's always in a positive way. It's always thank you for seeing us, you know. But I can relate, because, like I said to you know, by all accounts, I was meant to be invisible, you know. So for me, shining in light on people and making them seen, it's natural for me. They say that the fashion industry is changing. You're changing it. Are others around you changing it? I mean, now, you know, you look at other magazines and seeing real women in there, it's no longer a radical act. Seem, you know, people of color, women of color on covers is no longer a radical act. So it's been normalized. It's been normalized. And for me, I'm quite happy when I see that. You know, when you put Dame Judy Densch on the cover, and she's 85 years old, and the world just laughed it. Yeah, nobody questioned her, you know, should she be on the cover or you put, you know, a girl with a hijab on the cover. And it's not a problem. That for me shows that, you know, we're advancing. We're progressing. So, you know, progress for me is very important. Which is important. And so how do you take care of your team? How do you build a team around you? My team, I mean, somebody said to me once, when you build a team, make sure you employ people, you like people. When you see them working towards your office, you're just so excited to see. That was it. Being good at your job and sort of a connection. And being excited to see, you know, team members, because you only have to do as your team. You know, no man is an island. You know, I don't create the magazine on my own. And so it's great to have a team who, you respect and who's views you respect. You know, and who respect yours. So, do you think you're seen by your team? Do you have to be fearful? Do you have to be...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3346,2022-10-16 00:09:28
15061," Team who you respect and whose views you respect, no, and who respect yours. How do you think you're seen by your team? Do you have to be fearful? Do you have to be also terrible? I mean, you know, I'm a worker. I work very hard. But I think I'm pretty open. You can have conversations with me. You know, ultimately the final decision rests with me. But I do listen. I like conversation. I like interaction. So that's, I mean, that's how I hope they think I'm a good boss. And that's, you know, really all you can hope for because, you know, they work on a very good magazine. They can get other jobs anywhere. So the fact that they have made me think that they must be happy. Edward, how do you see the publishing world changing? So people buy less magazines. You've been, I mean, you've been doing pretty well in terms of selling more. But in five years, how does it look? How does it look? I mean, I was like, you know, five years ago, I, you know, even, I mean, let's go back to ID when I was 18, you know, I inherited a magazine, you know, which will come out. I was all about club kids and you have to be out there. And the only way you could see street fashion was through ID. And then 2017, I inherited, you know, I inherited a magazine. But now I oversee a brand, you know, the magazine is so that the magazine is sort of the highest or the high, the best paper, you know, the best photographers, the best, you know, cultural messages. But at the moment, you know, when you manage a brand, it's not just about that. It's about digital. It's about video. It's about audio. It's about events. So for somebody who's so forward looking, it's so great for me. And people always ask, oh, it's a magazine instead. When we launch a cover, Instagram is our cover, essentially. So I've, you know, found a way, we found a way of sort of making it work hand in hand. And it's so great for me, you know, I think, how do I just been doing the magazine? I probably would have been bored. So magazines aren't dead. Are they going to go down? No, I mean, yeah, but they're going to work in hand with digital platforms. You know, but also I'll tell you something, new readers of folk, young readers don't necessarily come to us through the new stands. They come through that, you know, did they sell platforms or, you know, audio or videos we put out. So yes, now it's increased 10 folds. So yeah. Well, do you think that will change the kind of readership that you will court the either age of your readers, but also where they come from? Yes, I mean, at the moment, you know, I think the readership is getting younger because of, you know, the whole digital landscape. And I hope that, you know, as we move forward, it kind of, yeah, we have new readers. And we also keep our loyal readers, you know. Edward, do you think there's ever a time where actually we won't have print magazines anymore? No, I think print will always exist, sort of a long-side digital, but it'll probably be something more precious, sort of better paper, something more collectible that you want to keep in your house, almost like artwork. So no, I don't think print is going to die. So, so fewer copies. See a more, more quality. More quality. You know, almost like a book. The table book. I love that. Right now. So what's the best investment advice you've ever been given by anybody? The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance, and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day. And if you keep at it and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's not just interest. It was always said about compound interest returns, compound business returns, compound human returns. They're all very additive because you'll learn every day. And if you keep at it, it's very, very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make selling at the wrong time? And they sell when the prices go down? Yes, or yes. Not keeping, but people have conviction or if they invest for the right reasons, just keep at it.

15062," Market's are preparing to close, but the day is not over yet. Stock that is now up about 45%. A lot of volatility, right now. You need the power of the Bloomberg terminal to get you market moving data before anyone else. There's numbers much higher than expected. Upgraded today to overweight. You need top analysts to bring you exclusive global insight into cross-asset markets. The Meany Bond market. The Chinese are really big focus. Bitcoin ain't going along today. It's going to be short term. Bloomberg markets the close. It's a big day on Bloomberg. Welcome to the world of decentralized finance. Bloomberg's covering all things crypto. The people, the transactions and the technology. Bloomberg crypto Tuesdays. You're recently on TikTok. Yes. Is that fun? I'm so much fun. I literally have to be held back. But the brilliant thing is, I'm so curious. I mean, I like all the digital platforms. I really like to keep my finger on the pulse. I'm not one of those people that leaves work and just shuts themselves in. I really want to be out there seeing the world as today. All is beauty. So, I'm very curious. I have a very curious mind. I'm glad. I'm glad. It keeps everything moving and exciting. Is that for Gen Z, is that a commercial purpose to get closer to that? No, it's just out of curiosity. I've always been like that. I've always wanted to know what's next. I didn't want to be the one that's just being told, you're 50 or whatever. I pay attention to everything. But the world is such a beautiful place for me. Any of those back to my childhood again. will be your biggest challenge to grow the brand in the next five years. Because we still keep it relevant. We have such great digital traffic almost 6 million every month to British vote. But I'm really excited about overseeing the European votes as well, Spain, Italy, Germany and France and mentoring a whole new generation of editors. When there was this whole about the nation, the whole world thought there was a global view that was going to dominate, but it's very much about local conversations as well as global conversations. So I learned from these content leads and I hope that they also learned. So the local global conversation I'm very excited about moving into the future. Do you think it changes if we're in a recessionary environment? So you have such a glamorous lifestyle or what you sell is so glamorous. Is it impacted by the cost of living or inflation or what we can live through? I mean, you know, I remember a few years ago I put Taylor Swift on the cover and the bioline was by better, by less. And it was a radical concept at the time. But now we all talk about sustainability. We know we can't keep shopping every day. We know we have to buy things that last, things that help the planet, things that we can pass on to sort of other generations. So I think that really is a conversation on the fashion industry is having right now that I find so exciting. And it's going to be sort of, you know, people are going to have less money so they have to buy things that last. And I'm really excited. And these are real changes. It's not just real changes. Real changes. It's not just conversation. It's actually happening. And do you think fashion brands always need to have a political point of view when they're great injustices? I think fashion brands can do more. I feel that having a black model in your show or having, you know, a feed on your Instagram posts, it's not enough. We need diverse voices behind the scenes. I always say that I talk to sort of all the CEOs. I know we need to employ more people from, you know, from diverse backgrounds because that's the only way you can even reach out to more people, you know.

15063," Employ more people from, you know, from, you know, diverse backgrounds, because that's the only way you can even reach out to more people, you know. A variety of voices, always better than just, just one. And I always also say, you know, let's not just have interns, let's have people in all different levels. And that's what I keep talking to people about. Do they listen? Some listen, but I think, since, you know, the George Floyd was murdered, more and more companies sort of made pledges to people of colour and, you know, it's a slow, it's a slow process, some have taken it seriously, and some are still working their way through it. But, you know, we have to keep on. The problem is that you can make a pledge and then follow through. Right? You know, so you have to really sort of focus and keep asking that question for people to follow through. And so do you feel like you're a guardian of, also, of that, of making sure that when you get promised something, they'll do it, and you'll hold them into account. I mean, yes, if they promise something, you know, that I ask for, then I will literally wear you down. I'll literally chase you until you keep your promise. That's just who I am. And we actually have one of the diverse, diverse cabinets here in the UK, with Liz Truss. Is that important to you? It is so important, as somebody who came from another country and was sort of welcomed by the UK, it's very important to have a diverse cabinet. That's how change happens. You know, going back to what we discussed before, that's how you understand people who are on the periphery or who've been avid. Yeah. It's so important to have a diverse cabinet. But this you think in terms of policies and what they can bring to the table or just also seeing a daily a diverse cabinet. I hope they can have an effect on policy. I hope they can have an effect on the parties themselves, as well as policy. For me, it's about policy that makes people's lives better. I know you're also very close to Ghana still. I mean, there's a pretty scandalous anti-LGBT bill getting through. I mean, it's so funny, I was invited back to Ghana a few years ago by the president. It was the year of the return. And I remember the last time we were in Ghana, we were fleeing. And I really supported the changes. I love the changes that we're going through, but yes, they do have an LGBT problem. Some friends and I signed a whole, I don't know if you saw it. And we're doing what we can to change things on the ground. I think you can't also sit in the West and tell a country what to do. So it's about sort of forming alliances on the ground and seeing what is needed and how we can help. Rather than standing on our soap boxes, going, do this, do that, do this. So that's through what grounds, I mean, ground work, trying to change from with it? Yes, from with it. Trying to change from with it, you know, talking to LGBTQ members and asking them what they need and what we can do to help. Rather than, you know, I say, do this. This is how you do it, because we don't live there. You have a memoir out. Why put it down on paper? You know something about when you turn 50. Well, something about when it's your fifth year at Vogue. You know, I got married this year. I'm normally not someone who looks back all the time, but it felt like the right time for me to do that. And also, you know, I just felt that a lot of young people sort of see people like you and I and they think, you know, we just got here. We were always here and for me was really important to share the story of a journey about, you know, successors and, you know, failures. And, you know, that's the reason why I got here. So I just wanted to share that story with them. Sort of young people, as well as people who, you know, feel like they're on the outskirts of, you know, the outside of the industry, really. Do you feel like an outsider? I think I'll always feel like an outsider, but as I said before, you know, I grew up African in an African household in England.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3349,2022-10-16 00:22:22
15064," I always feel like an outsider, but I just said before, you know, I grew up African in an African household in England, you know, different languages, different foods, and I now go to school and I've been in England. So I've always been about duality, I've always seen myself as an outsider, I was also an insider, and even when you know, I took the job at Britishville, I was the black gay working class outsider, but you know, I'd been in the industry since I was 18, so I was, in essence, an insider, so that's really, it's the other duality that plays out in my life. What, who do you think made you the person you are today? I know you left home twice, right, Ghana, but also you had to leave your home. Yes. I mean, the puzzle made me, who I mean, really is my mother, I mean, I mean, I loved my mother, she taught me about sort of beauty, she taught me about clothes, about fascism, she also taught me that beauty came in all forms, that, you know, women were beautiful, no matter what shaped they were, no matter what color, what religion, and so that really stayed with me, and I guess that my creativity comes from her, and of course I also had a military father, so the idea of precision and organization and sort of thinking ahead also comes from him, so the best of both worlds. How did your father, I know you had a difficult relation with your father, how did your father shape the person you are today? It's a funny, I should ask this question because I never thought I was like my father growing up, you know, I was very shy, very sensitive, you know, a little, a little spacey, I prefer the company of women, to men, my dad was sort of, you know, a sort of, a sort of fair and disciplinary and, you know, you had to, you know, be home at a certain time, you know, he rogues on iron fist, and I thought, you know, I'm never going to be like him, you know, he kicked me out of the house, you know, when I was 18, and but I found out that over the years when it comes to work and discipline, and sort of organization that is him to a T. So really a reminder isn't it just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade, we did see some pressure on the U.I. and we did see some pressure on the futures, that is now being reversed. Bloomberg surveillance, be informed, be prepared, be ahead of the game. So at some point you lose your eyesight, what was that like? Yeah, um, basically I have sort of very high my opias, I've never had great eyesight, and I went through a series of sort of retinal detachments for to be exact, and with each detachment I'll sort of have to end up looking down in a contraption for about three weeks, and in the dark room, and it was very harrowing, it was very harrowing time in my life, but I always say, you know, you don't have to have vision to have vision.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3350,2022-10-16 00:25:57
15065," And in the dark room, and it was very harrowing. It was very harrowing time in my life. But I always say, you know, you don't have to have vision to have vision. So in those dark rooms, my imagination was even bigger. You know, I dreamt bigger. And I came out to sort of the last surgery and the cover I did was for W. Magazine with Rihanna, the Queen, with a golden eye. And all right, look back at it, Rihanna. Oh my god, there are the eyes. I'm liminally. So, yes, it was very challenging. And even to this day, you know, I go for checkups to make sure my eyes are okay. They're great right now. And, you know, once the more I look after myself, the better. The better I'll get. But it's amazing, you power through adversity. Do you ever think actually this is too much? Have you ever thought this is too much? I mean, there have been times when I felt this is too much, and it might have a cabriot to start. It's not in my DNA to start. You know, I am my mother's son, my father's son. You know, the edge to move forward is always there. And that's why, you know, when I was young, I would always get up and work. I had a reckoning touch when I still got on a plane to go shoot the Hollywood portfolio. But now I'm learning to say no. Now I'm learning I can't do that job. I can't fly. No. It takes time, but it comes with age. It takes courage to say no. Right? Definitely. So when you look at all your covers and there's so many beautiful ones, is there one that's special to you? Well, I say to someone, they're like my children. You always have a favorite child. But I'm especially proud of the covers we did in lockdown, you know. When the world had essentially shut down, you know, the teams were sort of scattered all around London. And I had to go back to the days of I did when, you know, you had to really create and use your imagination. And we had a series of four covers, Judy Dant, when they said, you know, anybody over 60, she stayed at home, the essential workers cover a cover of landscapes, just so people could take a breather. And the activists cover when George Floyd was murdered. And I really think we create covers that, you know, in years time people can look back and see what the time that period was like for me, an artist always has to reflect their times to paraphrase Nina Simone, and that's really important for me. I mean, there was a bit of controversy with Linda Vanjolista. Yes. Yes, I mean, you know, there was a, there was a complaint that, oh, you know, she should, she should have looked a certain way, you know. And for me, I've no Linda in the 90s. I've known this incredible icon who really defined what a model should be. And I also saw my friend go through really dark days, you know, due to the complications for surgery, literally disappear from the world, really not the Linda the world news. So when we were doing this cover, it was the collaboration. She wanted to be that Linda that everybody knew. She wanted to feel good about herself again. And I wasn't going to deny her that act. And also, you know, whatever I would like to say, whatever a woman wants to do with her body, it's up to her. So, you know, I'm very proud of Linda and I'm very proud of that cover. I mean, sometimes you're almost like an activist. Is that how you, you're like a fashion activist or a political fashion? I'm a male actor, but I'm definitely a creative. But, you know, I've always believed, you know, look at my, my life story. In my book, you know, I wasn't like I kept saying I wasn't supposed to be here. You know, had my dad not left, I don't know, even what would have happened to my family. So even when we ended up in a room, two rooms in a voxel, six of them, we were so happy to be there, Penny less, but so happy to be there. So, you know, every day, I just, you know, I'm an optimist. And I know it's not the most fashionable thing, but that's why I'm sitting here with you today. Bye. Edward, thank you so much for your time today. Thank you. When the price of anything goes up, the consequences reach far beyond what you'd expect. But perhaps most of all, when it comes to food. Come on, come on, have a more.

15066," When the price of anything goes up, the consequences reach far beyond what you'd expect, but perhaps most of all when it comes to food. In 2010, surging food prices helped spark the Arab Spring. Lives were lost, regimes fell, and the consequences are still with us. Once again, food prices are rising and fast. Energy costs, broken supply chains, and surging demand were just some of the factors that have driven food prices to their first record high since the Arab Spring. And that's all before a war between two of the world's biggest food producers. Ukraine is called the Bread Basket of Europe, and taken with Russia the two account for about a quarter of global wheat trade. They produce more than half of the world's sunflower seeds in oil, nearly 20% of the barley. Now throwing rising energy prices and processing, transporting, even refrigerating food gets more expensive. Plus, fertilizer production is extremely energy intensive. Less fertilizer means lower crop yield and prices rise even more. The pandemic revealed how complicated and fragile global trade systems are. Global agriculture, perhaps even more so. Unlike metals, for example, food goes bad. And crops take months to grow and are vulnerable to unpredictabilities like the weather. Rising food prices will be felt everywhere, but the poorest countries in the world will be hit the hardest. And as all these factors compound, the real fear is that record high will lead to record high and ultimately to a global food crisis with vast consequence. Okay, so you're moving in on me quick. Just trying to me with your fancy hands. I'm going to deal with your night because it's really bothering me. My nights. Yeah, he's a troublemaker. Yeah. What did you get up to this weekend? You know, just robot stuff. A lot of chess. I was practicing for you. I know you're pretty good. Ooh, I don't like that. I will take this. Put it over here here. Not cool. Not cool. All right, I will, I will concede. I can see. You got me, Bid. Very good game. Well played. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Welcome everybody to the inaugural NIL Summit and NIL Awards. In July 2022, Atlanta hosted what might sound like a boring legal seminar. A conference on the new rules around name, image, and likeness in sports. But far from dry and academic, the first annual NIL Summit was in fact a flashy star-studded event put on at the College Football Hall of Fame. And Mingling amid the biggest current and former names in sports and media, there was a crucial cohort. The player is poised to redefine what it means to be a modern college athlete. And the winner of male athlete of the year goes to Chase Griffin. Among those up-and-comers, UCLA's Chase Griffin. The UCLA quarterback is among the students becoming as well known for making deals as making plays. And even in that group, Chase stands out. My name is Chase Griffin. What's up everyone? It's Chase Griffin. It's your favorite quarterback, it's favorite quarterback, Chase Griffin. When you look at it as an empowerment equity opportunity, it's really been unmatched in the sports world for any point in time since Title IX. After hardly a full year of name, image, and likeness deals being a reality, he already has more than 20 deals with major brands, venture, and charitable groups. All the while balancing graduating undergrad in just two years and fighting for playing time on the field. Chase Griffin, out of the gun. We are joined by UCLA quarterback, Chase Griffin. Not just UCLA quarterback, but name image likeness superstar. I am Sight for this one. This kid could actually be the president of the United States someday. Chase isn't the starting quarterback for UCLA. He's not even the backup quarterback. But back on campus in LA, his nickname is president Chase.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3352,2022-10-16 00:35:03
15067," the United States someday. Chase isn't the starting quarterback for UCLA. He's not even the backup quarterback, but back on campus in LA, his nickname is President Chase. And after spending a couple days talking about his approach to business, sports and equality, it's not shocking to think he might someday hold that office. His level of focus and maturity at the stage, I only wish I had. If you want to buy stock in human being, buy stock in Chase company. When it comes to building generational wealth, it's not about the money that you make in college. I'm very excited that I made the amount of money that I made last year. I am even 10 times more excited that I know how to make that money. Summer on any college campuses, mostly for the athlete, who are unlighter, but still regimented schedules. Attending classes, working out, a little bit of hanging out, and then more working out on their own time. Chase is no exception. The 21 year old is a backup, albeit an impatient one. In the topsy-turvy past couple of seasons, dotted with fan-less games and COVID protocols, he's been able to start three games for the Bruins. Griffin, gonna throw to the end zone. Wide open again, touchdown, UCLA. Beating Arizona and narrowly losing to both Stanford and Oregon. That was inches away from Chase Griffin and UCLA, being in full fledged comeback mode. For Chase, UCLA felt like destiny. He was born just a few miles away before his family moved to Texas when he was a toddler. But beyond being a sort of homecoming, the school's history of athlete activism was a massive draw. I always expected from myself to have some sort of impact, that was beneficial for more people than I interact with on a daily basis. And choosing UCLA, a lot of that went into me seeing myself as someone who reflected the same want to make things better, that so many of the people that UCLA pride itself upon being the home for it have done in the past. The legacies of former UCLA greats, like Arthur Ash, Jackie Robinson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Jackie Joyner Cursey, have had a wide-ranging impact on society well beyond the Westwood campus. Chase reveres these people, but he's perhaps most keenly aware of the activism of a more recent Bruin alum, the basketball player at O'Bannon. At O'Bannon, who was an ace-meth player of the year National Champ, UCLA sports legend, is also a legal hero. I think NIO could be the next installment, where we look back in 30, 40, 50 years, and God willing, if we give him the roses he deserves, we add at O'Bannon to that list of UCLA greats. O'Bannon, who played at UCLA from 91 to 95, initiated a lawsuit that's widely credited for finally opening up the possibility of college athletes being paid for use of their name, Image and Lightness. He sued the NCAA in video game publisher EA for anti-trust violations, arguing that athletes should be entitled to financial compensation when schools used their likeness for game. In 2014, a judge ruled in his favor. I don't think he was congratulating you. What was your call? And then, on an episode of the shop, surrounded by O'Bannon, Diana Terossi, and LeBron James, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed the first ultimately successful legislation to allow athletes to receive endorsement deals. The Fair Pay to Play Act led other states to follow suit, and ultimately led the NCAA in 2021 to relent, seemingly reluctantly. And I.L. payments were officially allowed as of July 1st, 2021. Today is the last day where name, image and likeness laws will not be on the books and kids will not be, if you will, not allowed.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3353,2022-10-16 00:39:33
15068," 21. Today is the last day where name image and likeness laws will not be on the books and kids will not be if you will not allowed to make money off of their name image and likeness. Making money from Jersey sales and endorsement deals is a way for players to share in the massively lucrative world of college athletics. This NIL thing is the wild, wild west. The NIL change felt like many things that happened very slowly and then it happened very fast. And I wonder for you having contemplated that maybe this was coming at some point how prepared were you what was your mindset when the switch flipped? Right. I mean I still think everyone's trying to get prepared for the industry is still sort of like a wild, wild west. I wasn't really expecting anything. I was more just thinking about honestly getting ready for that season and and and capitalizing on on everything that was happening. When NIL hit and it turned out I had action and I was like oh okay well after this degree deal which was fantastic. I was like okay I see how I can be a staple in this game and I see how I can get better over time. That's why I teamed up with my friends at Shell. Then Shell deal hit and then boost my whole deal hit. Then you keep on building clear cover. You keep on building and you get better in the meetings and most of all you start seeing where your value can be best placed in these new opportunities. The headlines and storylines in the aftermath of the NIL change introduced visions of instant millionaires strolling campuses across the nation. You might think the NIL athlete of the year lives in splendor or at least in one of those athletic palaces that put most of our coach dorms to shame. Well it's all relative to chase. Alright Jason. So here we are world headquarters. Yep this is where it all happens. There's the kitchen right here. I actually really enjoy cooking. Oh yeah. Yeah this gas oven gets really hot really fast. I make pizzas in there. This is the best appliance since the iPhone Air Fry. You play anything in there. I need to do these dishes right here. So no trappings of success yet. More a pretty average college dorm room. The fridge filled with leftovers, a well used PS4 and of course the requisite Godfather poster. It's a far cry from the lifestyle seen in some local news reports for NIL athletes during this first year. These are Robins and made headlines with an NIL deal with Lamborghini Austin. Lamborghini's tend to make more headlines that Muhammad Ali are Bruce Lee pictures. Some athletes are living in mansions driving Lamborghinis. As far as I know you're doing either of those things I see where you're living right here and it is with all due respect not a mansion. Okay. How much of that is a conscious choice and what does it say about your approach to that? Right. I mean first I look at this is my own room. I got everything I need. I'm cool with that. I'm cool with living below my means. I think it's important to remember that the volume of financial gain is completely overstated. That's what it y'all is following the media. Yeah. And someone hears about a 5 million or 10 million dollar deal. You got to report it like oh my goodness people are going to read this. Hey I'd count two things like how many kids are even getting these deals and then for the kids that do get it how much of that is in liquor cash and how much of it is in assets. If you pay for a $2 million house out here in LA for a kid to stay in the college that's great but as soon as they're graduated they're not going to have that $2 million house. I say the same thing you know for the kids who are driving around and Lamborghini's and stuff like that. That's awesome. Like that's super dope and I know some of those kids but you know someone paying for your lease is different than someone actually giving you the value of that lease every single month you're investing in saving it for a 1k etc. I say all that just to mention that product deals and stuff like that are over hyped by the media and they also can land kids in some trouble if they're not paying taxes on it. That's one of the distinctly unsexy and easy to overlook elements of the new rules. Even if an athlete's not getting cold hard cash from a deal.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3354,2022-10-16 00:44:08
15069," That's one of the distinctly unsexy and easy to overlook elements of the new rules. Even if an athlete's not getting cold hard cash from a deal, the value of any products given are subject to state and federal taxes. So suddenly, what a player sees as free gear in return for some social media posts actually equals taxable income. And that requires the same forms you'd fill out as an independent contractor getting a check. I made a fair amount in NIO deals and I invested all of it. In my opinion, NIO is great. Doing all this is great. Making money now is great. But the most valuable thing I've gotten from all of this is, in the fact, I'll always know how to make money off of myself. All told, Chase has done more than 20 deals with major brands like Degree, Shell, and Boost Mobile, along with venture-stage companies including Discord, Duffel, and Creative Juice. He's also made a point to work with charities like the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, where he's already raised funds for almost 60,000 meals. Imagine simply climbing a cable into space. The concept is known as the space elevator. Not only could it significantly change how we leave planet Earth, but it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space. And they're a scientist who think we could have already built it. We have the material, we have the technology, we have the lasers, we have the climbers, we have all of them. If a private entity wants to build it, or a government, they can build it. It'll change society. We have no clue how colonizing in the space, how really spreading out in the space, really change our society over the next 50 to 200 years. It'll be completely different. Access the financial world on demand. Be alive and on demand webinars, only from Bloomberg. Start exploring to see what's moving the markets. You will put a woman on Mars. You will bring forth global cooling. You will be the first chief crypto officer. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer, disrupt, before you change the world, Bloomberg. This is a song by Javion. I heard the opening. I just took that opening and I pitched it slow, or I think I sped it. At his desk when he's not making music, another side project, he's either networking with CEOs or investors he seeks out or who seek him out or negotiating new deals. This is an average NIL deal.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3355,2022-10-16 00:47:37
15070," I'm doing well. I'm turning on my camera right now. You have no worries. This is an average NIL deal. A brand approaches an athlete who can help spread their message to a demographic they believe the athlete can help reach. In this case, direct TV is looking to market their NFL Sunday ticket to college students. It'd be two posts, one post late August and one post on the first week of September. And the compensation would be 1200 per post, so it would be 400 total. Right, are they video posts or are they, you know, picking captions? They can be either. It's up to you guys. That was pretty good. 400 above, but they had originally asked. So that's a win. So yeah, I mean, at this point after I do a Zoom or something like that, I get to chill out, go back to land down if I was watching a movie or something or, you know, go to YouTube just start looking for more samples. It's a pretty simple interaction for Chase and for direct TV, negotiated over a couple of emails and Zoom calls and papered with a contract Chase will have his dad look over before he signs. And Chase, who's made himself as much of a student of the new NIL marketplace as he has a public policy at UCLA, says he understands why it's working. A brand ambassador with ship with an athlete is more attractive to these brands announced rather than terminal investment than even a post by a famous actor. If there's any place to learn that sports are deep in the hearts of Americans, it's on a high school football field in Texas. Friday night lights in the Lone Star State might be the great iron equivalent of Frank Sinatra's New York City, making it there needs your something special. Chase Griffin quarterback class 19, Hato, Texas. And Chase didn't just make it, he excelled. Let's talk about some of the top quarterbacks in the state. And when you look at that list at the top of it, you got to talk about Chase Griffin. I was lucky to play three years as a quarterback for Hato High School, which is a one horse town. We have great success. And so the town really shut down and came out and supported us every Friday night. Chase, from the back, Steve James, right there. I'd open it if he could catch it tonight. He does touch it on the pitch. Chase, one word to describe that finish that game. God, that's it. I'm in from a town like that where football is so prioritized. It has its pros and cons, but I think on the pros side, I learned how to win, how to get better. And most importantly, what it's like to build a team where everyone gets better. Emulating his UCLA alumni like Robinson, Jorner Cursey, and Abdelger Bar. Chase is looking at the impact NIL will have not just for him, but the athletes that will follow. When the predecessors who have come before you have changed the world and made life better for everyone today, you can't help but ask yourself how the actions that you're taking now, and the companies and brands and the NIL space that you work with, are all cumulatively building something greater than any of us could foresee. I've actually never moderated, so this will be my first time. It should be fun. I know my handwriting's terrible. The last day the conference chase was asked to co-moderate a panel with Monique Nelson, the CEO for UNI World Group. All right, I'm excited to be here. UNI World Group is one of the longest standing multicultural advertising and marketing agencies in the United States. The firm works with brands like Ford, Home Depot, and Johnson and Johnson to help reach the black and brown communities. And they have big ambitions in NIL. For UNI World Group, the idea of this was pretty epic in that because we serve the undervalued, overlooked, and the underserved, we knew that",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3356,2022-10-16 00:52:24
15071," was pretty epic in that because we serve the undervalued, overlooked, and the under served, we knew that this particular group of people would fall into that category. And we plan on being the premier practice for NIL athletes that are looking to do purpose-driven, media advertising, community level engagement work. UWG launched a program called the NIL to help black student athletes partner with major brands, but to help them understand how to do that, they brought on chase to serve as a student-athlete executive in residence. For me, I do nothing without tremendous amounts of data for all of our clients. I really wanted to be thoughtful about this practice being very athlete-centric. If I were to build it or anyone on my team were to build it, it would not have the athlete at the core. When you're 18, 19, 20, 21, 20, to the best way to have credibility is confidence, and the only way for confidence to be authentic. I'm actually learning on the job. I'm learning about the brand side of NIL, but I'm also trying to make sure that empowerment equity is built in, especially for black student athletes in the NIL world. ROI, return on investment. Both Chase and UWG see NIL deals as something much more than making money for students. It's also a potential investment in a community long overlooked. I think we're getting ready to stop boxes, kind of feed the people with L.A. A piece of each of Chase's NIL deals go to his belief brand campaign, which has raised more than $13,000 for meals for the L.A. Food Bank backpack program. But athletes giving back is only one side. I'm here with legal zoom to give you five tips on the NIL game plan. UWG and Chase believe having brands investing in the athletes, especially athletes of color, can be a force multiplier for these historically marginalized communities. When you look at the revenue, jet and rating sports for the bomb ass, 88% of those athletes are black. So when you're doing stuff to empower student athletes in the NIL space, you're also helping to deliver on your promise. Now student athletes are not the only ones who should receive this by any means. But statistically, by doing that, you're going to be delivering on your mission. Additionally, student athletes on average come from lower levels of income. So you're also delivering on that promise. And a lot of these student athletes are first generation, their first gen college students. Some of them first gen high school diploma. Some of them first time receiving the amount of money that they receive in their families. This has been a wild first year in NIL. We all knew that there would be bags of cash around, right? There's always been bags of cash. There's cash everywhere. What we know is that that's not sustainable. We know that athletics has an expiration date on it. So for us, inclusion ultimately means this is just a part of you. It is a tremendous part of you and we are going to celebrate that part of you. But we also know that you're bigger than that. So we want to empower you to live past your expiration date for this part of your life. And quite honestly, have equity in everything that you have poured yourself into as an NIL athlete. It may still be the Wild West days for the NIL industry. But in the first year, about a billion dollars in business was done with NCAA athletes. For the early leaders in the NIL space like Chase, they're striking a precedent for athletes that follow them. And that's important because collegiate athletes don't have that much time to profit. Only an estimated 2% of NCAA athletes go on to the pros. Even the hardest working are often limited by things they can't control. For Chase, it's been his height. I'm 5'10 now in high school after my sophomore year went up through for 3,000 yards. I was probably like 5'10"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3357,2022-10-16 00:56:44
15072," I'm 510 now in high school after my sophomore year went out through for 3000 yards. I was probably like 565. I mean, I could already say I'm one of the best in the history of Texas high school football. But you know, I've gone through the height test where they'll call you out of class, shake your hand, look at you up and down. You're like nice to meet you, you go back to class. It's a sad but timeless story for student athletes and for Chase, his story is something he's not shyed away from, but embraced when it comes to his and I.L. deals. I'm frequently the smallest person on the football field, but I always strive to be the most impactful. My middle school coach taught me that I would never play in high school. Chase's deals with degrees breaking limits team and clear covers inspired underdogs allowed him to capitalize financially from football, even the last season he never saw the field for UCLA. I play football because I love the game. I play the football because I'm a good competitor. I love to compete and I play football because I'm good at it. At the end of the day, I don't play football for my livelihood, which is important to remember when it comes down to identity. I myself changed Griffin as long as I'm that. I got something in this world. As he moves into the new season and focuses more on football than business, Chase doesn't see much of a differentiation between the two in terms of his mindset. I wouldn't be surprised if I wasn't playing football in five years and it was running in Fortune 500 company, but I also wouldn't be surprised if I was winning a Super Bowl for five or ten years from now. Either way, I'm going to keep on working at the tools that would align myself and my future with both. At the end of the day, you're always going to have yourself. If you can make profit off of yourself and know where you add value in any world you're in, you'll be able to adapt and find ways to generate wealth through yourself. What I love about business is you get to build things from nothing. I don't have any investors. All this is all money and this is me just building it. It's pretty much full service shadow banking with nobody in charge. What are the moon shots at Amazon that are capturing most of your time and attention? Well, you know, we have a unique way that we go get big new investments and I'm not sure it's right or wrong. It just happens to be our way. And we ask ourselves when we're considering something for questions. We ask if it's successful, can it be big and move the needle in Amazon? Is it being well served today? Do we have a differentiated approach and do we have confidence there and if not, can we acquire quickly? If we like the answer to those questions, we'll go pursue it with a single threaded team that isn't distracted by the rest of the business. When it comes to the stock, it has fallen significantly. Do you think investors are missing something or has tech just been overvalued? I have never tried to predict what the stocks are going to do. In any time, I've tried to a little bit. I've been wrong. I do really believe that in the short term, the stock market tends to be a voting machine and the long term it tends to be a weighing machine. We have a concept we talk about a lot of Amazon inputs and outputs. You know, in the ultimate output for a company, a share price. You know, in that other big outputs are free cash flow or profit or revenue. You can't really manage the outputs. You have to manage at the input level.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3358,2022-10-16 01:01:02
15073," The output for a company is share price. You know, and then other big outputs are free cash flow or profit or revenue. You can't really manage the outputs. You have to manage at the input level. And that's where we spend all our time. And so if you do the right things for the business long term, things tend to work out. I think we've had very good returns for investors. And I expect that to be true again. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. Like just be honest, we've had sort of a shift in our way in some sort of circulation fears. Moment, people were talking about that all day yesterday. We make it very transparent to the shopper before they accept an order. What's the order is going to look like? How much work on a pays them and how much consumer is paying them. And so they can decide whether they take an order or whether they refuse it. And that's a kind of flexibility. That's our shoppers really value and the kind of transparency that they want. Are you seeing a labor shortage right now? And what are you doing to come back at? It's different in different places. All demographic of shoppers is completely different from food delivery and right sharing. We're 70% women and half of them are moms. And that's because a lot of the job at Instagram is very different and just being in a car with strangers. It's about like going to the store, doing a good job of customer service of really picking the right products for the consumer. And we are seeing that being very appealing to women. This is the steve young you most likely remember. He was a defining athlete of his generation building a career out of defying expectations. From being eighth on the VYU Depth Chart to a record usfl contract. To sitting behind the great Joe Montana for years, young ultimately became a Hall of Fame Super Bowl winning quarterback. Known for his pinpoint passing accuracy and a pension for dynamic runs. Trouble is going to be a sack no gets away. He runs gets away again to the 35 to the 20 to 15 to 10. He got a touchdown for the Niners. I played 18 seasons. There's a few that have played more. Tom Brady's now 23, but I got as many as maybe anyone who ever played. And I still did have half of my life that I wanted to be productive. And what could you do with another half of a life? Turns out a lot. Steve Young didn't just make a name and a fortune from his NFL days. Armed with a law degree earned while he was still a player and a front row seat to the tech revolution in Silicon Valley, he's quietly built an investment firm that's sun wore than 50 billion dollars in deals over the past two decades. I mean, I look I my previous life was amazing. You know throwing Jerry Rice a touchdown or a French on in front 80,000 people and winning games like there's nothing like it. It's not 80,000 people watching it, but it feels familiar. And I think that's why there is magic in privately. This is the Steve Young many haven't seen the player turned investor. I recently got to spend a few days trying to keep up with Young, from his offices in Silicon Valley to a Scottsdale golf club and lots of places in between. What started as a straightforward story about an athlete's successful transition to business turned out to be something much more. A tale of a relentless guy intent on finally marrying his playing and investing careers with an eye to a gratitudely changing both deal making and athlete's lives in the process. Hi. This is a tough decision. But I know that I've made the right one and I really feel it in my heart and I can't deny it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3359,2022-10-16 01:05:14
15074," This is a tough decision, but I know that I've made the right one and I really feel it in my heart and I can't deny it. And so I retire from the great game of football today. Lots of players have managed to move from the locker room to the board room, taking largely titular roles as advisers and rain makers to companies or investment firms. Few can say they've committed as much as Steve Young, studying investment in them as the same way he studied the Niners playbook. Alright, dental, Pat. On your horse. Young's firm, HGGC, sits in one of the most fascinating corners of Wall Street, private equity. Once upon a time, that industry was relatively hidden. Now it's one of the most influential engines of the global economy. It feels like anecdotally I'm hearing more like, oh, private equity consolidated this practice of medicine. Talking about acquiring dental practices may not be as captivating as throwing game winning touchdowns, but it's a fast growing, very lucrative business. Collectively, private equity firms control more than $6 trillion in assets according to McKenzie. The founders of the biggest firms, guys like Henry Kravison, Steve Schwartzman, they are billionaires many times over. So let's talk for a minute about the basics of private equity. Think of it like buying and selling houses. Basically, PE firms use a mix of cash from investors and money barred from banks to buy companies, make them more profitable and sell them down the line. And just like with houses, some people own them for a few years, take really good care of them and sell them for a nice profit. Others, they're more like flippers who look to do the minimum to make a quick buck. Fiat firms have been rightly criticized over the years for shuddering plants and cutting jobs and pursuit of those massive profits, especially in recent years when it comes to medical practices owned by private equity firms. Some practitioners have complained that it forces them to choose between profits and patience. So as they've grown in stature, so too has the scrutiny and the sense of responsibility beyond the bottom line. Young and his partners, they're more than cognizant of that historical reputation and they're aiming to be more nurturing than swash buckling. They're operating at a smaller scale than the big firms in the so-called middle market. I'm companies worth $50 million to $500 million. That's still a pretty big business. HGGC, they've raised four funds towing almost $7 billion. For Steve Young, it's unquestionably one of the most successful second acts of any former athlete. And while Steve may live in the same neighborhood in Silicon Valley as Mark Zuckerberg, you might not know it from his ride. Vans are the best cars on the road. If you don't have a van and you have kids and you don't have a van, you're an idiot. Yeah. I mean, how do you not go 14 cup holders and six outlets? I can run everything right here as they come. Like a rocket ship. 87 was when I lived here for the first time. Silicon Valley was kind of up to full speed in 10 years, so by 1997. Yeah. So in the last 20 years or so, 25 years even, it's changed in that the biggest companies in the world that weren't here 20 years ago are now here. Right. But what hasn't changed is Stanford's down the street. Silicon Valley has always been kind of an entrepreneurial place. Back when Steve was playing in the early 90s, the technology boom was really just cranking up. Just a few miles from where the 49ers played at Candlestick Park. We're watching Silicon Valley just explode around us in Santa Clara, three calm, Cisco, name any business, any big business. And I don't know who had the first idea. I can't give it to anybody that knows who said it. It was like, let's bring him in the locker room. And we'll tell him, look, we'll trade the some access to the locker room because that's what we have. Right. Because everyone wanted that, right? The 49ers at that time. It'd be like right now, who named it? Like the Patriots or the Warriors, the Rams or anyone else. So we had 10, 15 different companies, $10,000, $15,000 each, which splitted all up. And that would just started to come pretty regularly. Those investments and relationships were critical of Steve's own transition into the world of investing. But access to money and deals while playing isn't a guarantee of financial success.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3360,2022-10-16 01:09:51

This is the firm's sweet. Sweet. Playing the game and what we all been through, players don't realize how useful that can be if you paid attention. They don't realize the resources they can be as junior said we're all kind of frozen and I want them to know by definition of what you've been through you have something to add to the conversation. I began preparing for my future beyond football probably earlier than I wanted to because my dad kept packing at me about the rest of my life what are you going to do what's your plan what your plan what your plan what your plan. And I was like my plan is to play football and it's like that's not a plan. That motivation pushed me to go back to school at the same time he was playing running from Super Bowl's to law school for six years in 1994. The same year he was league MVP. He also graduated with a law degree from Brigham Young. Without a law degree, I wouldn't have been able to get the opportunity to get into direct investing. Now did I have the NBA that everyone had out of Harvard? Did I do this four years of consulting or banking? No. But I think I was given the opportunity because I had that in my pocket. I wouldn't have gone to law school if my dad had not had driven it in my head that you better have a plan. As his professional career wound down, he would use those relationships forged in the locker room to find ways into the world of business. He sat on the board of Power Bar after becoming a huge fan of the product as a player. He used to just down them on the sidelines. Like Niners teammates Ronnie Lot and Harris Vartan, Young had become more invested in investing. He initially from Northgate Capital with some ex teammates and then went on to Sorensen Capital where he first worked with his future partner Rich Lawson. I actually started my career at Morgan Stanley prior to business school in the Mergers and Acquisitions department and slept under a desk in New York and in Tokyo, Japan for Morgan Stanley. We started as direct investors at a firm called Sorensen Capital and that was probably 20 years ago. The two eventually decided to create their own firm alongside two high caliber private equity mentors Bob Gay and John Huntsman Sr. What looked like a winning partnership among the four of them initially called Huntsman Gay Global Capital didn't last. Gay opted to take a job with the Mormon Church and Huntsman who planned to join after his company was bought never joined when that deal to sell his company fell through. So no Huntsman, no Gay, but Young and Loss and opted to press ahead as HGGC. So this is the inner sanctum. I like it. We did not clean it up for you Tom. I apologize. This is a working day. It's great. And I do. I love the helmet. The firm's offices are filled with sports memorabilia, much of which is used for prizes and charity work that Steve and the firm participate in year round. But Steve is quick to point out that it took a while for him to embrace being surrounded by his past. When I retired from football Roger Stovak was my hero and we developed a relationship and I asked him, Roger, you were one of the greatest transition guys in the history of the NFL to go do something else. Yeah. Give me some tips and his number one tip was run. And I go, what do you mean run? He goes just get it run away. Yeah. And he said, because it'll never leave you, you always have football in the history of the NFL and all the things that happened. But you need to run. You also, and I don't think this is a stretch, had some hesitation about being X football player investor. You wanted to be an investor. Is that fair? It's very fair and I think the more famous you are as a player, the more accomplished you are, the more I thought the difficulty would have to actually have people take you seriously. And I wanted my fame to be a tool. I didn't want it to be a weapon and so easy to weaponize, right? You can bring in and just slay the room and that's not the way I wanted to do it. But certainly when I started, I held myself back in some ways. So integral to that transition as it were in that evolution is Rich Lawson, your partner. And we actually, I talked to him last week about this very topic. So I want to show you something. All right. His tag on it. Bring some drama.

15076," I talked to him last week about this very topic. So I want to show you something, his tag on it. Bring some drama. We have a very long hallway leading to our shared office that I can't seem to get my own wall. And every week I would put up his jerseys from his various different accolades, the USFL or the 49ers, it'd be why you. And it would be strange because one day they'd be there and then I would come back from a trip and they'd all be gone. So I think for years he wanted to minimize what his past was as opposed to embrace it. It's been really critical to our business. It's given us a bit of a defining characteristic in addition to being good investors because no matter how successful you are in other venues, if you're not delivering great returns for your investors, it doesn't matter. It's great. All true. Every bit of it. I'll call it immaturity on my part. But it was born out of this desire to try to make sure that what I was doing I wanted people to know I was serious about. And that meant grinding it out on deals, doing the work to find by and fix companies. HGGC has completed more than 500 portfolio investments, transactions with an enterprise value of nearly $50 billion. Young and Lost's Playbook, it's one of cultivating relationships over long periods to consummate deals. As time went on, the sports memorabilia and Wall Street deal toys, those loose-site mementos of companies bought, sold, or taken public, began to share space. You can see the four-night room is the main conference room. Okay, we get it. Someone joked, I said, we promise to put you over Joe, is the only place I ever get. It's funny, I was sneaking around your office earlier. I saw that picture of you and Montana, very intimate portrait of. We all agree that it was awkward. And never it wasn't awkward. In fact, the ATT did a commercial on it recently. Pretty good. But it was always profitable. And I think that was that creative tension that it had in a part of it. And I'll always honor my time with Joe. I hated watching. But I love watching Joe. Do you think about that in the context of business and CEOs and succession? Like, you got to, right? So much of this business is classic relationship. Tag on the product may read made in the USA, but the sign on the CEO's door often says made in India. Alpha Beth Sundart Pichai, Microsoft Sacha Nadella, IBM's Arvind Krishna, Micron Technologies Sanjay Mayhotra, and that's just the start. Add in the chief executives of Adobe, Deloitte, Gap, VMware. And that doesn't count Indians running companies all over the world. Why have so many Indians risen to the top? For no coastal points to India's incredibly competitive education system, if you can survive the pressure it takes to get into one of the Indian institutes of technology, it gives you confidence to handle American universities and later the business world. Meanwhile, the belief in India's ability to produce so many tech wizards is reinforced every year. Indians make up about three-fourths of the immigrants receiving coveted H1B visas for the US.

The proceeds of that day go to his philanthropic organization for every young. For nearly three decades, that served children facing significant physical, emotional, and financial challenges. I love golf. I love thinking about it. I just don't play it very often. But I believe that if you love golf and you don't play very often, you can get better kind of in your backyard. That's my theory. And it has proven untrue. Music",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3362,2022-10-16 01:22:11
15077," Better, kinda in your backyard. That's my theory, and it has proven untrue. Hahaha. Steve's ability on the course may not be etched into any record books, but following him around, it's clear that it's not the lack of trying. Oh well. Alright. Off we go. We were constantly hustling behind him as he caught up with executives in the portfolio companies and reminisced with former and current players. Here's a day trader, he's on himself, self-made day trader. And so he's on the bus after a game in New England, and he's day trading on the bus and Bill, Bill checked season and caught some on the spot. The season that they went to the Super Bowl, day trading got him caught. In many ways it's a convention, right, of the people that I don't see maybe once a year, we're half the field or more from our own portfolio and our own firm. And so it's kind of all come together. My firm, our charity, our fundraising efforts, and then the friends that are around. My dad and my brother, it all happens right there as a confluence of all these parts of my life that have found its common center. It's me, Andy. This is Andy in the black hat here. He was seated. They sound right, but these personal relationships and conversations that Steve has with folks in the golf course, it's actually similar to his and the firm's approach to private equity. For them, the art is in the relationships built across the negotiating table and even in the days, months, decades leading up to being at that table. Rather than excel-based financial models ground out by young analysts and men having skyscrapers, more typically associated with buy-out firms. If you could leave the hubris behind that that says, I love that business, but it would be so much better, I ran it, right? To me, the more profitable way to do it, not just in returns, but in kind of legacy and abundance is to approach it kind of looking at the person across the table as your strategic partner. Help me understand how you fit into the family. One of the HGGC's best partnerships was with Brian Adams, the founder and CEO of an insurance technology company called Integrity. So we had an advisor that linked us up in the beginning and the first thing, everybody thinks of Steve as a football player and you're intimidated by this idea of this Hall of Fame quarterback, but what you really see quickly is how humble Steve is, how normal he is. Integrity is part of an auction in 2016. And where 19 others were bidding. And while HGGC didn't put off the highest monetary offer, it was the relationship that Steve had struck up with Brian that helped them win the deal. Steve and I got to know each other and got to become friends and we started really kind of aligning our values for us. It was a lot of this kind of value alignment. It was like we've got to figure out how to become partners and it's been an incredible rise for us. After HGGC took a minority stake in Integrity, Steve was appointed chairman of the board. In six years, the company grew from a few hundred employees to more than 5,000. That's in large part due to acquiring 125 companies through M&A. Most recently, Integrity got a new round of funding, $1.2 billion from Silver Lake, one of the biggest firms out there. We've returned the fund and more with just one investment off of a faith and a relationship really more than anything and a belief in each other. Integrity is also an interesting example of something notable and again somewhat radical that you do around compensation and ownership and something that you've extended that idea even into your own firm in it in a different way. So walk me through that. Brian had the idea that he had 3,000 employees at the time and you know what, the equity owners of the business, the people that have the stock are making incredible amounts of money, but the employees are getting paid their salaries. What if we gave them stock? In 2019, Integrity would do something almost unheard of for a company of their size and potential. They distributed partial ownership in the company to their employee base.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3363,2022-10-16 01:26:01
15078," In 2019, integrity would do something almost unheard of for a company of their size and potential. They distributed partial ownership in the company to their employee base. He did that as a private business and I thought that's a way to solve for a lot of the ills of a corporate world and how people see the world as building equity inside the employee base. And I love that and I think we've done in our firm as well and kind of more distributed partnership and trying to give equity out ownership not just held by two people because what that does is it allows for generational mindset. Steve's work with growing players into business people mirrors the work he's doing at his own firm. They're he and loss and are nurturing the next generation of investors at HGGC and they're thinking of how his legacy will live on in the world of private equity through those younger executives. This is a place where there are 25-ish investment professionals and every single one of us is welcome to bring our ideas to the table and those ideas are heard. So we meet every Friday for investment committee and it's not just the investment committee. It's not the five or ten partners that meet. It's the entire firm and a lot of places that's not the case. Good friend, ran a famous private equity firm nearby and he said your culture is what I want our firm to be like what do you do? I said well the first thing you got to do is your founders need to put all of their relationships in the middle and no one owns anything and you don't fight over those relationships they're the firms. The 15 seconds he's like yeah that's not going to work. So it's like the culture has to be kind of in the roots and that resonates with people. Passing down the spirit of abundance approach to private equity all came from Steve's playing days and his Hall of Fame coach Bill Walsh. I watched him do it in the late 80s. There's a guy with a camera, the old school, you know a big thing on his back and he'd follow Bill around everywhere. Filming Bill as he spoke to the team went out on the practice field, installed the offense in the lunch room and I kept asking what is this like a museum they're doing or what are they doing a special documentary? Like no one knew. Well what it was was he was creating a physical toolkit of video based audio based of all speeches and all of his playbooks and all of his installations everything paper based that he had and essentially wrapping it all up as a toolkit to hand it to his assistant coaches that he wanted to go have success in the league. Who takes all their secrets all the things that makes them great at the height of their greatness three or four generations ahead of everybody else in the league and wraps it up and hands it to the people who are leaving to go coach other places and then says to them you know what I'll see in the championship game and it happened. There's a spirit to legacy. There's a spirit to and so I watched it and I said to him Bill why would you do that? He said Steve we've got to give opportunity I want these men to succeed and I thought that's a heck of a statement because of course you do but who does the actual work to give them the opportunity to go succeed and giving away what you own that is most valuable. That great business you can make your argument maybe that is the great business that we need to be in. When you think of cutting edge technology at sea you might be thinking of stuff like this but there's an incoming revolution on the high seas that isn't quite as sexy but could be significantly more impactful.

We've got the information and insights from businesses most influential and instrumental. It's a level of uncertainty that we've had to deal with. We've got the information and insights from businesses that we've had to deal with. It's hard to think of any athlete better known or more polarizing than Alex Rodriguez. A three-time MVP, 14-time All-Star and World Series champion, he retired in 2016 as the highest paid player in MLB history. Fourth all-time on the list of home runs. But his playing career isn't likely to be remembered by those statistics or by who he is or isn't dating. A record suspension tonight for baseball star Alex Rodriguez over his use of performance enhancing drugs. While it was the most painful time of my life, it may cost me the hall of fame. That's on me. Nobody else. I think in a weird way I'm going to look back and say that's one of the best things that happened. Five years after his retirement, Alex Rodriguez, this CEO, is getting back into sports this time as an owner of a proboscopal team. And he wants to build more than just a franchise, but a legacy, maybe, with a dose of redemption. The mistakes made in baseball are done and I can't go back and fix them. I want to keep a clean record of the father as a friend, as a business person. And because those mistakes, I think I have an opportunity and I'm having a time of my life doing it. Hey Rod, Alex Rodriguez is buying the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Minnesota links. The purchase price is expected to be in the range of $1.5 billion. For me, I think making the transition from player to owner, something that's very exciting to me, I'm really excited to bring my experience both in business, and in sports, and in locker room, and do really, really exciting things and bring a world championship to the city.

15080," Civ clubs around, folks who own a pro sports team, and while his name and his fame made the headlines, it was his business empire that allowed him to actually close the deal. The easy to remember name, A-Ride Corp, it's grown into a diversified investor and operator, taking a cue from mega firms like Blackstone and KKR. A-Ride Corp has taken a real estate portfolio and expanded into venture capital and private equity and media, and like any business in 2021, it's on SPAC. I was more lucky than smart. I started investing very smart in real estate, simply as a hedge to, as my earning power would close, my real estate would not only appreciate what would create more cash flow. And then I would say that cash flow, and I would buy more real estate and other private equity type investments were generated more cash flow. So as my Yankee income went to zero, hopefully my real estate and my businesses would grow over time. And while players nowadays are becoming better and better business brands, few are able to achieve the scale as A-Ride Corp has in such a relatively short amount of time. But understanding how that growth happened in business, just like baseball, has to start at home. Part of what I love about business is you get to build things from nothing, right? Like nothing. So I had two hip surgeries and I never wanted to be the old guy that couldn't get up, you know, this there. So I built a flat house, all entertainment on that side, my room, your dad and the girls on this side. But it had to be one story because I am always forgetting things. And B, I wanted to be like, oh my god, I can't get up the steps because of these tips. You know, I walk around here, I mean, first of all, the arts are beautiful, but tons of pictures of you and the girls. And I mean, you've really made a family life for yourself here. Tell me about that. Well, tell you what I'm not at home. I'm not a cleanup hitter and I'm not a CEO. It's very good to remind me every day that I work for them. Yeah. You can see why you play big songs. You always ask me, what are you doing your life? And I say the three Bs, I do baseball and I basketball too, business and my babies. And that's kind of, that's my happy zone. It's funny through pandemic. We spent so much time here and in my 46 years, the toughest time in the world that I've witnessed. On the other side of that, we were in here and we felt safe and we felt loved. And it was like 90 days of breakfast, lunch, and dinner with my girls. It was a dream come true. They got so sick of my dad jokes. So sick of my dancing. It's actually a leisure TikTok. I've been begging trying to bribe out to do one with me. She was daddy. You have no swag, no drip. I'm not doing anything with you. A-Rod's dancing may not get his daughter's approval, but his following on social media is huge with nearly 4 million followers on Instagram alone. That number is larger than his new basketball team. The Yankees or the Red Sox, not to mention any other single baseball player, current or former. Who has better taste in music? Whose room is decorated nicer? What is it that makes you engage the way you do in social? You know Jason, a lot of that came through my time during my suspension. You know, I spent a whole year serving a suspension. And in that time, I had an opportunity to turn the lens inward and understand why I was making some of the good choices, the poor choices, the bad choices, and understand kind of conversation, understand storytelling. And it's something that I'm enjoying. It's still fairly new. We're not experts by any means. But every time we look at companies or opportunities or partnerships is data driven and social driven and it's been quite a tool for us. That suspension, which obviously people will forever associate you with. And there's an interesting choice you make there at that moment and then in subsequent moments to not lean out, to not retreat, but to lean in to some extent. And especially in the last couple of years, tell me about that. Have you think about Mike?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3366,2022-10-16 01:38:58

If you think about my career, sure I've hit home runs and been part of a World Championship team, but I'm also, I'm fifth all time in the history of strikeouts. I mean, that means that only four people in the history of mankind have failed more than me. But I think as a result, I've been, you know, PhD in failing, but also an MBA of getting back up. Looking around at his house and his selection of cars, it's hard to say that A-Rot has ever really failed. But it's striking what he has built, considering where he came from. More information,SPEAKS far sÃ©aguÃ©sREIDE Back in 1997, I was interested in the following question. There are a bunch of dinosaurs called sauropod dinosaurs which had really long skinny necks. So a podosaurus is an example. Now, I said really long skinny tails. So I made a computer model that showed that in fact the tail of these sauropod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip, a bullfip. Now the way a bullfip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. And that crack is a sonic boom. I think the way they got a date was to impress the females by making loud booms. I was born in New York, raised in Miami. So when I got to Miami, I was around 8 and a half and 9 years old. My father left when I was around 10. And at home, my brother Joe and my sister Shouzi took the role of my brother became the secretary of sports. My sister became the secretary of education. And my mom just had to make enough money to pay her bills. I think my father leaving us at 10 left a huge vacant spot. And I think I needed to then fill that void by having a collection of mentors. One of those earliest mentors was his baseball coach, Rich Hoffman, right here at Westminster High School. See Vox do this area a few times. This brings back some pretty cool memories. If you hit a home on here, it goes to the basketball courts and the pool. And I kind of like it. It's kind of like this Fenway, kind of Wrigley. Set of the Green Monster, you have the Green Palms. Yes, exactly. Well, it's really where I really started to understand the power of mentorship and dreaming big. And if you think about it, I have one of the most important conversations with Coach Rich Hoffman. And that happened at 15 the first day I walked on campus. He goes, look, Alex, you're going to come in this year. You're going to have a good year. And then you're going to the June.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3367,2022-10-16 01:43:09

He goes, look Alex, you're gonna come in this year, you're gonna have a good year, and then you're going to the junior Olympics to represent the US, you'll do well there, you get much stronger. By that time you'll be like the top junior in the country, and then your senior year, you're gonna be the number one pick in the country, and then you're gonna be off to the big leagues. Coach, you're talking to me? He goes, yeah, I'm talking to you Alex. And Jason, I went home that night, and I believed him. It just like, it changed my complete vision on me and my future. And then I did everything in my power, and that's how they coached down. So I'm the leader today when I have young people. It's my job to not only give them the opportunity, but to push them and push them to a level where they now see the world in a different way about themselves. That prediction came true. In the 1993 MLB draft, Rodriguez was selected first overall by the Seattle Mariners. And while his playing career was just getting started by the age of 22, he'd invest in his first piece of real estate. It was what I knew best. My mother, she was in a homeowner. She was, we were renters, right? We were tenants. And every 18 months we would move because the landlord would always raise the rent. And I remember as a young kid saying, boy, if I can ever trade places with the landlord and they can be the tenant, that would be amazing. I bought my first duplex and that I owned that for a few years. I sold it for double by four plaques, eight plaques, 60 units, and off we went. When it came to those first investments, you know, whenever he does something, he's going in at 100%. This is Jose Gomez, everyone calls him Pepe. Along with Jose More, he's the co-CEO of Newport Property Construction and also a childhood friend of Rodriguez. From 2004 to 2007, we ended up acquiring 50, 100 units between Florida and Texas. We renovated him. He would buy him. I would renovate them and, you know, the rest was history. Being a real estate investor, especially in high growth markets like Florida, well, it hasn't been a straight line up for the past two decades. Miami's high-rise condos are monuments to a burst property bubble, while most half of Florida mortgages are underwater. We had this run-up to 2007. Prices were going up like this, and then it just fell off a cliff. The Great Recession crushed owners and developers alike. Few were immune, except those that had other sources of income to take advantage of falling prices. Income like, say, one of the richest baseball contracts in history. Our huge advantage was that Alex had W2 income coming in from playing, and we had that staying power. So we were able, even when things started going, you know, south for some people, we were able to grow within those difficult times. Monument capital management has done within 60 deals since 2012 worth more than $900 million. The extent of that ambition in real estate is evident here at Grand Station in downtown Miami. The 30-story residential tower, complete with a sprawling amenity floor and pool, has sweeping views of downtown. It's a bet on Miami's growth, and it's a bet that's looking smarter as Wall Street firms and other companies look southward. People always question Miami, why do people live there? There's not any great jobs, you know, we don't have a lot of financial services here, we don't have anybody manufacturing anything, but that's changing. People see this as a very cool place to live, and work. Now, before it was always a cool place to live, but where are you going to work? Now it's okay, the jobs are here first. Cool place to visit in the past. Right, yeah. And now each pocket is being built out. I think our Basel years and years ago started that, and then there have been a course of events that have followed that continue to enrich Miami, and I would say we're still early as a city. But while Miami may be home base, Rodriguez's most aggressive current real estate project is buying, renovating, and renting out single-family homes and markets across the country.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3368,2022-10-16 01:47:46
15083," On Miami maybe home base, Rodriguez's most aggressive current real estate project is buying, renovating, and renting out single-family homes in markets across the country. And in this case, he's not just emulating some of the world's biggest investors, but also getting into business with them, including real estate legend Barry Sterneley. Just as behemoths like Blackstone who've been mass single-family homes, Rodriguez, through the Tuber Capital Group, has snapped up 5,000 homes so far. We think we're still in the early endings of single-family housing, rents are going up about 18 to 19 percent. Once we find something, then this I learned from Warren Buffett is, you know, be disciplined, but when you find your pitch, you know, don't go for a single or double, you know, going and going big. And that's exactly what we've done multi-family, and now with single-family houses. Going big has required Rodriguez to build a team around him, and he's opted for a delicate balance of homegrown and outside hires. On the one side, friends dating back to childhood and adolescence, including Aaron, Pepe, and Jose, on the other newer additions such as Kelly Laferrier, Stuart Zuck, David Becker, and Lisa Pire. Managing the chemistry among the small and growing team, is akin to the elusive intantables Rodriguez saw in clubhouses when he was a player. Getting it right, well that's the difference between being a champion and an also ran. Lisa, take it away. Sure. So I think next we're going to have David on table from Kelly, and we think he has a relationship with the loads and the glen. Cool. So teams 11 and 11, and one exciting development is the 12-17 game in selectors is going to be on the Eastman. So we were not on the Eastman's table in New York. At the A-Word Corp offices, you'll notice the memorabilia, the pictures of famous athletes, the real-time social data being displayed on the TV wall. But you'll also see pictures of Rodriguez with some of the biggest businessmen in the world. Alex has become a sponge, and he started that as an active player when he was on the road. He would go and visit the Jerry Ryan's Dwarfs of the world in his uniform and ask them business questions, and he's surround himself with really good smart people. The wide network is critical in sourcing deals, including in the venture world, where the A-Word portfolio has included more than 60 companies, brands like Hems and Hers, GoPuff, and UFC Gems. But having the best team doesn't mean you win every at bat. Their SPAC, Slam Corp, was recently negotiating a roughly $3 billion deal to merge with collectible company Pininni. That didn't materialize after Pininni stumbled. Slam's still in search of a target. But Rodriguez's belief in taking swings, striking out and hitting big, is also the same way he would end up with his own sports franchise.

15084," on the SO season sponsor Bank of America. JLo and A-Rod are angling to buy the New York Mets. They're not just angling. I mean, they are in the process of putting the money together. Rodriguez along with a group that included his then-girlfriend, Jennifer Lopez, entrepreneur Mark Lurian several others, mounted a bid against frontrunner and hedge fund billionaire, Stephen A. Cohen. These guys are all rich, you know, as far as we go, they've made millions and millions of dollars, but we're talking about billions here. The very public process ultimately landed A-Rod and JLo's consortium as the runner-up, with Cohen by the team for $2.4 billion. We have a little bit depressed about it. We don't like to lose and, you know, we really started getting really excited and thinking about what could be. And so when it just sort of came to a complete halt, it was sort of like the shock to the system. We were sort of depressed and down. Mark Lurian is a New York-born businessman who most recently had been a senior executive at Walmart. He got in there by selling his company, Jet.com, to the mega retailer and stayed on to run that division. And while A-Rod's partnership with JLo would come undone, he formed a close business and personal connection with Lurian. That's last. I told you, no one's high as man. He's my favorite type. We grew up in a sort of very similar way and from very, very humble beginnings. I love Mark. I love him like a brother and he's a great partner and a great friend. And, you know, he's used to my house. I sleep at his house. And we both have this drive and this mission that I want him to win in the worst way. And I think he does the same for me. I want to show you this clip because it spoke to me a lot about the depth of your relationship. Yeah, I think this is getting a little bit deeper now, but I think it comes down to our dads. You know, they both felt like, you know, we had something to prove in order to sort of feel love, really. And when you did something spectacular, you felt, oh, maybe, you know, like, and I think he similarly had felt that too, where if you wanted to feel love, you had to do big things. What do you make of that? I never thought about it that way, but I know that when my father left at 10, it left a huge hole in my heart and my stomach. And I knew that I had to do better. And I think before therapy, it was probably better for the wrong things. I think post and current, I look at it as just my purpose. But I also know that I'm enough now. And probably before that, I, that I wasn't. The deep connection with Lori led to a new $400 million venture fund called VCP and notably allowed them to quickly pivot to a successful deal in sports ownership. They were pursued at the Minnesota Timberwolves and Minnesota links. He called me and he said, hey, are you serious about this? He said, I won't do it unless you're serious about it. I said, I'm serious about it. Are you serious about it? And again, a minute conversation. We're both in and we probably got the deal done in six or seven days. NBA ownership has radically transformed into the past decade. It's tech executives like Steve Balmer and Joe Sy and Wall Street investors like Mark Clasery, Josh Harris and Tony wrestler have snapped up teams. There's a supply demand imbalance where and you want, you know, most people if they could would own a professional sports team. And there's, you know, very high barriers to entry and, you know, very limited supply. In the case of the Timberwolves, Glenn Taylor bought the team in 1994 for $88 million. The sale to Rodriguez's group values the franchise paired with the four time WNBA champion links at $1.5 billion. And that's relatively affordable. A Rod's old team, the Yankees, is worth more than $5 billion, according to several estimates. And while ownership is changing, so too are the players. I think players today want more in every sport. They're into fashion. They want to be good investors. They want to learn about...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3370,2022-10-16 01:56:20
15085," I think players today want more in every sport. They're into fashion. They want to be good investors. They want to learn about venture. The NBA players today that I've been around, some of them are more prepped at 20 than some of the guys that I played with at were 50. And meeting with our athletes and talking about business and them reaching out to me, it's great, it's humbling and it's really impressive. And if anything, their ownership has maybe gotten too close to the players. The team being fined $250,000 for violating league rules within offseason workout in A-Rod's hometown of Miami. The buying of basketball team instead of the meds might accomplish a goal he thought was unreachable, actually making him cool to his daughters. I recently went to a six years game and my little one Ella, who's 13, she goes, that is really like this basketball thing. Like one day, maybe I get to run the business here one day. Really? And I was like, oh my god, that's like the greatest thing I've ever heard. And she goes, you know, it's like, you know, baseball's a little slower, but this stuff, I can really get into it. I said, whoa, baseball's great too. You know, it's more of a thinking man's game. It's like chess, not checkers. And she goes, yeah, yeah, whatever. This basketball thing, I have like real passion is like the entertainment and I have thoughts and I have ideas. And she thinks much more like a producer, she likes dancing. And I mean, to me, that's just like, boy, that's the great thing about sports and music. It brings people together. And it's certainly that that for us that night. You have built this, this amazing business. And there are people who are watching this. Just like this guy, you know, it's like, that they'll always remember you for your baseball career and a baseball career that was controversial to say the least. You could be a little bit on an island somewhere. You don't have to do this. I thought about tapping out a bunch of times. I would wake up in the middle of the night and be in tears going like, how in the world do I get pocket aces and figure out a way to screw this up? That was a very painful time for me. And I think the year's suspension allowed me to not only put lipstick on the house and paint it and fix the windows. It allowed me to tear the entire house down and start building it one brick at a time. And in that process, I became even closer to my daughters. And when I think about those mistakes and the lessons learned, I think about, okay, but you know what? That was baseball. And I had good moments and I had very tough moments. But clean slate when it comes to being a father, to being a partner, to being a businessman, to being a friend. So I draw some incredible motivation through, man, something that sucked, something that I did to myself. I say to myself, in the darkest hour, boy, if I ever get another opportunity, I'm not going to screw that up again. And I'm trying my best not to do that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3371,2022-10-16 02:01:10
15086," This is a market that over the past few weeks has made it clear it wants to go higher. It got a little spooked by the idea that geopelittle potential rises. Big, expensive cities have a lot going for them. But if you live in one, you've probably noticed that these big, expensive cities keep getting more, well, expensive. You could always move away. You might have just started working remotely, so there's really nothing keeping you there. But then again, moving is a hassle. Well, what if someone paid you 10 grand to do it? What if they threw in free office space, a bicycle, or a gym membership? Programs and cities and states around the US are doing exactly that. And they're getting a lot of interest. We've had over 50,000 applications. About 90,000 applications. We've had over 1800 applicants from all over North America. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them? Or are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns for places looking for an injection of fresh talent? Oh, good. How are you? It's so great to see you. Thank you so much for doing this. What do you think about all this love getting into crypto? I think that I think was more last year. I think it's kind of a way of that past. No, I don't think so, but I think it's like any time that frankly, it's when a lot of other people get into crypto, right? Other audiences too. It's when it's in the news a lot. And when does that happen? A lot of times when the prices are going up. She was a federal prosecutor going after gangs and the mob before being handed for next assignment, taking down Bitcoin. Katie Han soon realized this new technology was much more than a tool used by criminals. She dove deep and became a crypto convert, swapping her prosecutor hat for a board seat at Coinbase, became the first female general partner at Ventur Ferb and recent Horowitz. Han, now a prolific crypto investor, recently launched her own fund with one and a half billion dollars to deploy. It's the largest fund ever raised by a single investor. Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0 CEO and founder of Han Ventures, Katie Han. Katie, it's so great to have you. Great to be back here in the studio with you, Emily. I want to start with a vibe check. Okay. What state of the crypto cycle are we in right now? It was hot. Yeah. And then it got pretty cold. Hmm. Well, look, Emily, zooming back because I've been in crypto for a decade, if you can believe it, we've seen crypto be really hot and then all of a sudden not. And so we've seen this before. However, I think one of the things that's a little bit different now is with each new crypto cycle, more and more people come into it. And so it's more and more pronounced each cycle. And I would push back on it's not. I think it depends on what area of the ecosystem you're looking at. We think developers think crypto and Web 3 is still really hot. I am seeing a lot less of those. We're all going to make it hashtags. I'm seeing a lot less of them too, although I am spending less time on Twitter. So maybe that's why. But with each cycle, there are new acronyms. What hasn't happened is a crypto winter in the midst of kind of really serious global macro conditions. So we have inflation, kind of it record highs for our generation in our lifetime. And then we have also a war that's broken out in the Ukraine. And we have a number of other factors going on here. So that's very different. There was some serious carnage out there. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3372,2022-10-16 02:04:53
15087," war that's broken out in the Ukraine, and we have a number of other factors going on here. So that's very different. There was some serious carnage out there. Yeah. Socius, Luna, three-houros. What's been your takeaways from what that? I don't want to sit here and tell you that algorithmic stablecoins are bad, because I actually think they're really interesting. However, I think what happened is you had, in this case you mentioned Luna and Tara, you know, that was an algorithmic stablecoin that was getting pretty widespread adoption relative to what the tech could do. I didn't realize you spent your teenage years living in Egypt and learning Arabic. Yeah. Tell me about your upbringing. I was always uprooted. My dad worked for a large company, and we were always moving just when I would get comfortable in one space. And I think actually that's pretty important if you fast-forward and look at my career. I'm comfortable being in uncomfortable situations. I didn't know a lot about venture when I got into it initially. I didn't know a lot about crypto when I got into it initially. And I was okay asking questions. I was okay not knowing the local acronyms or the Namanclature of a particular field. And I'm taken right back to my teenage years in Cairo, moving from Houston, Texas one day to downtown Maddie in Cairo the next day. You studied law? I did. You clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. That's right. You became a federal prosecutor. You were taking on prison gangs and the mafia. That must have taken a really thick skin. I was doing it at each 25. And now if I kind of take a step back and you know I think that happens at different points in your career. Like, whoa, if I would have analyzed that a little more at the time and I'm kind of in some ways glad I didn't. I just dove right in. Because I found it fascinating. There was a human aspect to it and people's stories. And I felt like those stories mattered. So I was drawn to criminal law and became a federal prosecutor and I did cases involving violent crime but then really mistriing cases, being back in the courtroom, being before the grand jury. Like the prosecutor you would see on TV going to try those murder cases. Doing those two hour closing arguments. That's right. And so moved out here to California. I indicted the largest prison gang in the world at the time, outlaw motorcycle gangs, hostage taking. Bank robberies, armed bank robberies. There was really not a kind of criminal case by that point in my career. I hadn't done it. It was right around that time. 2012, one of my bosses came in and said, let's have that same energy that you brought to those gang cases, to those murder cases. And let's go ahead and have you investigate this new criminal technology that we really need to look into and possibly shut this down. So you created the first cryptocurrency task force. How would you describe it? Fortunately, several of us in the government realized at the time, it's not possible, also not desirable, because Bitcoin is not an entity. It's not a person. It's a protocol. And it would be like saying, let's go shut down cash. Let's go shut down the internet. It's not possible. Probably wouldn't be a good idea, either. I was using crypto and technologies like the Bitcoin blockchain, because that's all that existed then. This is 2012, 2013, to actually uncover criminal activity. So I didn't think that that technology was bad. Frankly, it was a tool that helped me uncover the various activity. And by the way, it was a step-level function improvement better than compliance by banks. I'll just go ahead and say it. That's a little bit controversial. But I had spent a decade subpoenaing large financial institutions, and five times out of 10 didn't get back what I needed. One case I worked on, and people always say, oh, you shut down the Silk Road. What actually happened? I was looking into something completely, not having to do with anything at all of the Silk Road and came across some, what looked to be some kind of odd activity. And it turns out that a couple of federal agents on the Silk Road Task Force out of Washington, DC, were croaked. And that is the case that I ended up in dining, and I ended up prosecuting those agents, and they both went to prison. So that's the aspect of what the Silk Road case that I worked on. I would never, never have been able to uncover that criminal activity by those agents, because they were federal agents, they knew how to cover their tracks. Had they not used Bitcoin blockchain. Right? So that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3373,2022-10-16 02:09:37
15088," Cover that criminal activity by those agents, because they were federal agents, they knew how to cover their tracks. Had they not used Bitcoin blockchain. Right, so that technology right there, if they had just used wires or cash or bank wires, we would never have uncovered that. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund in front of scratch? Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world recalibrates. After decades of stagnation, Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation. Corporate giants, policymakers and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that. Every week on Japan ahead, right here on Bloomberg Television. The tape is crucially important, and I think we've moved from this attitude, from its indulgence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s, and so it makes that a really exciting field, because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harness to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize that makes you smart. If you can spit back a lot of facts, but if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what you bring to use out while you're sleeping. So you became kind of a crypto convert after this. You joined the board of coin base. That's right. Very early on, how did you and coin base and Brian Armstrong come together? I hosted an event here in San Francisco at the Federal Reserve Bank and believe it was there that it wasn't just Brian. It was a lot of what I'll call legitimate actors and crypto who wanted to usher in this new wave, this new ecosystem. And then we brought together the heads of all kinds of agencies. Really in an effort to kind of talk about building bridges, you know, the government and the crypto industry. We're never going to see eye to eye on a lot of things, but we did think there were some commonalities. Coinbase is a company that has. Suffered they've been losing share. The valuation of the public markets has plummeted. Why do you think that is and how do you think it can be fixed? Yeah, well, I think again a few things it's tied to. One, a large aspect of Coinbase's business now, of course, is trading revenue. And that's down when prices are down. And you know, the company's been very transparent about that long before going public. I mean, also if you look at its S1, it specifically identifies that. And just how volatile crypto cycles are. So I think that's part of it. It's judged by public markets as a technology stock or as a financial services company. By the way, I think it's both. I think it's not just a financial services company. I think it's so much more. I think it's really a portal to this whole new ecosystem. You were also on the board of OpenC until recently. There's an insider trading situation or accusation going on there. Coinbase has also had employees accused of insider trading. How much is this happening within crypto companies and within the industry? How big a problem is? I think crypto is under the microscope. So where you have a case, two cases, three cases in crypto ecosystem, which now is a trillion dollar industry. I think multi-billion approaching trillion dollar industry, you're always going to be able to find examples like that. So I don't want to make too much out of a handful of cases. That said, the company Coinbase OpenC, take these things incredibly seriously. Along with your position at Coinbase, you became a partner at one of the most storied venture capital for American Silicon Valley and the United East and Eastern Horowitz. What was your experience at A16Z-like? There I met Chris Dixon and I met Ben Horowitz and I met Mark Andreessen. And I had worked with them for just about a year, maybe a little bit over when they asked me to come and co-run their crypto funds at A16Z.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3374,2022-10-16 02:13:45
15089," or when they asked me to come and co-run their crypto funds at Andreessen Hearts. Again, I jumped at that chance, and I think really that speaks to the fact that, as I said before, things are a hell yes or there are no, and it was a hell yes for me. So Andreessen Hearts is the kind of place where if you make partner, you don't leave. Yeah. How did Mark and Ben respond when you said, yeah, I want to leave to start a crypto fund of my own. As you might know, Emily, they're an anchor. They're an anchor check into my fund, and I'm very grateful for that. You know, Mark and Chris and folks like them are also personal LPs. So I felt very supported when I shared that decision. And I will say that it was not running away from Andreessen Hearts. It was running to another opportunity. And you know, crypto is not, what do they say? It's not a spectator sport. It's like, you're in it. It excuse very young. It's 24-7. It's global. And it's hustle. And at this, and that's a trade-off. It's a life trade-off. And at this point in my career and in my life, if I was going to continue to make that trade-off, I just wanted to do it and do it in a way that was really true to me. So you struck out on your own? Yes. To launch on ventures. What gave you the courage to do that? What was the spark that lit the fire? Yeah. That got you to say, I need to do this and do this now. Sure. What I set out to do was to continue to invest in this ecosystem that I think is so broad that decision was very purposeful, and the timing was very purposeful. We have an early stage fund that does seed stage, series A, even series B. And then we have what we call an acceleration fund, which is not a growth fund. It's a crypto growth fund. And I think those are different things. But it's later stage. It might be crypto-publics. Certain kinds of public tokens were set up to hold tokens to participate in the token ecosystem. Or later stage companies. I mean, there are now several crypto, many crypto unicorns. Space has become really competitive. Even though you say, crypto's had its ups and downs, the thing is a lot of people in some of those last cycles have seen the kind of venture style returns that can be had in crypto. And so you've had a lot of new funds enter the space. And that's driven up competition. So what differentiates on ventures then from all of these other crypto funds, or even more traditional venture capitalists, like entries in Harowitz or Sequoia? They also have crypto funds now. Well, I think a lot of traditional venture capital funds now have crypto funds. It used to just be like a regulatory designation. It was like, are you an RIA, which is registered investment advisor? I would say for crypto founders today, it's not enough to just be an RIA, right? They, frankly, I don't even know if a lot of them care. That's a regulatory designation. What crypto founders today want to know is do you live and breathe crypto? Do you inhale the discourse? Are you part of the community? Do you participate in governance? Are you going to be staking these crypto verbs out there? And if you're not really in this space full time, I think it's very hard to run a successful crypto fund. We don't have a hedge fund component. So we're not sitting here buying and trading and selling. That's a hedge fund structure. And there are crypto hedge funds. We're not one. We're making seven to 10-year bets. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund from scratch? You know, it's hard, but it's not impossible. We don't have a crystal ball. I don't know. I can't predict cycles, but I knew that we were in a cycle where you saw so much for an excitement around the space. And I already talked about what makes this different, but I think one thing also is we are a nimble strike force. We don't fish in the same pond. We have the crypto natives. We have a fish and execution. We have operators, seasoned operators who really know how to stick the landing. And I think that's reflected on our culture. I would say the only thing that's changed in our strategy as a result of the market correction is really more of a focus on early stage, but we still have our late stage fund. And when we see valuations, which I think will still see correct, spoiler. I think we'll continue to see some corrections. And so we might deploy our later stage fund a little bit more slowly. It might not be on an even 50-50 cadence. And that's OK. Long-term, our strategy hasn't changed. Long-term, we're committed to this space. How much do you think valuations are going to correct? You know, it's just, I can't give you a one-size-fits-all answer because crypto is not a monolith. You have some crypto companies that really follow more of an enterprise-sass business model. You have others that are layer one protocols. You have.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3375,2022-10-16 02:18:21
15090," Because crypto is not a monolith. You have some crypto companies that really follow more of an enterprise SaaS business model. You have others that are layer one protocols. You have still others that are consumer facing applications. And I think one of the things we're seeing right now is the infrastructure layer. And that's where we're spending a lot of our time, by the way. And we think more and more use cases will come about when the infrastructure layers in place. So my own view is we are not rushing to deploy. We're certainly not getting caught up. I think we're going to get VC FOMO and have you avoid that. You know, look, I think it's very easy to get into that mindset, right? It's because it's a competitive sport. It's a competitive space. And I think I'd be lying if I said that that doesn't influence anyone. I try to, what I do, and I think I do differently, is I try to take stock of that. Oh, that's the FOMO mentality kicking in. That's bad. Again, you don't want to over-correct, though. What we look for is we look for amazing founders. It doesn't matter if I think valuations will correct if they're amazing founders. There's a huge tam. We also look for what's your regulatory plan. If you're launching a token, what's your plan to comply with the law? What's your plan for security, by the way? We've seen a lot of hacks in the space. We want to really dive in there and make sure that the founders have been thoughtful about, especially if they're custodian customer funds, keeping those funds secure. If it's a cross-chain bridge, what are the exploits? Have you changed your strategy at all, given the downturn? Have you backed out of any deals or decided not to do certain deals? Because the conditions have changed, don't you raise the phone? We have decided not to do certain deals. We've never backed out of a deal. We have decided not to do a few deals. Because we think that pricing was ahead of progress candidly. We might have been wrong about that, Emily. We might have been wrong about that. But I think if we were wrong not to do a couple of deals, better that we might have been right. Because if we were wrong about that, I think we can find a way to still invest in those projects later. Well, one thing I'm hearing is that a lot of dry powder has just sucked up. Because all these funds raised a lot of money raised. What was the biggest fund ever for a single person, not just a woman? Anyone? Are you confident you're going to have a place to put all that money? I am, but if I don't have a place to put it, I'm not just going to go willing, nearly deploy it. One of the things that we told our LPs even during the period when we raised our fund, which was when crypto was undeniably still on a bull run, we said that we are going to be pretty steadfast sticking to a tier deployment cycle. And I think one thing that's changed is that might have lengthened. It certainly hasn't shortened. But we will, again, we feel very good that we have the capital to back great teams when we see them. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. We're falling behind. We are global business authority. What about NFTs? Are you concerned about the declining demand? We are going to increasingly live in a digital world. And I happen to think that if you live in a digital world, you're going to want to own digital goods in that world. We're not just going to be satisfied to rent them, which is what we do now.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3376,2022-10-16 02:22:16
15091," And I happen to think that if you live in a digital world, you're going to want to own digital goods in that world. You're not just going to be satisfied to rent them, which is what we do now. We buy our content from walled gardens without digital scarcity, which is what NFTs unlock. You don't really own anything. You're subject to the whims of a platform. And I think NFTs and digitally scarce goods fundamentally change that. I think you'll see NFTs back again. But we are spending a lot of time in the infrastructure layer, like I tell you, zero knowledge, technology, scalability. We think of that as the plumbing, if you think of the fiber-optic cables. Remember, you couldn't have had YouTube and Netflix with dial up. You couldn't have streamed content. The same is true of crypto use cases. We think that there will be a lot of new use cases unlocked when the infrastructure is there, when it's more efficient, when it's more user-friendly. And so we're spending a lot of our time there. President Biden issues this crypto executive order. There are a number of ports that are coming due. What do you want to see from the administration when it comes to regulation? And are you optimistic that we will get there? Yeah. We were so delighted to see that executive order. It's not something you should normally be delighted about. But why we were is because it was to us a real recognition that this is a US government saying, this field isn't going anywhere. This field is growing. It's growing so much that we are going to direct every single agency in the federal government to come up with a plan here. I think we take a step forward, but then you see, we're a big government. We're a big system. We have states. We have local entities. So we take a step forward with the EO. And then we take some steps back sometimes, too. And I think what I see as crypto founders are confused by that. They're starting to think, well, I could go to this jurisdiction where there's a single regulator. And you don't have 50 states with different rules. It's the US government that needs to start taking stock of the fact that right now, Emily in China, there's a quarter of a billion, ECNY wallets, a quarter of a billion. We're still talking about whether there should be a government central bank digital currency. We're still studying that. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind China. And we're falling behind. What are the dangers of falling behind China and the rest of the world? This is years ahead. So I don't want people to take a headline and say, oh, I think the US dollar will be no longer the global currency, reserve global currency. I'm not saying that now. But fast forward decades. And if you no longer need to use the dollar because you have an alternative, I think that's a real problem. What would we use instead? Well, I think that there are going to be stable coins out there that people who have access to a smartphone will use. There is a demand for it. We see our 285% year-over-year growth of stable coins. So people are clearly liking the idea of this. Now, again, there have been some spectacular failures, too. But not all stable coins are created the same. But I think the important thing is that we really do need to not just quash innovation. What do you think of how Gary Gensler, the chair of the SEC, and how he's approaching it? One of the things that I hear from founders is that they're very confused because they get told, come in, register, just come in and talk to us. But you have the one company who's done the ultimate act of going in and registering coinbase, file the S1. And still, there's a lot of saber rattling still going on, I think. And again, I don't want to single out the SEC. And I don't want to suggest that anything they're doing is bad. I do think, though, that right now there's a lot of confusion. And one of the pieces of confusion stems from the fact that it started with the ICO mania back in 2016, 2017. I can't even remember which year now, where the SEC was very loud about securities. A lot of them were securities. But the space has changed. And so to still view it through the ICO lens, when so much has happened over the last five years in the space, I think is a mistake. What do you have to say to the skeptics out there who just don't believe in the future of Wem 3? And don't see where this is going. I would say don't judge the current state of innovation by the end state of innovation. I hear from a lot of these skeptics. And by the way, I'm friends with a lot of these skeptics, too. I don't only want to live in a crypto bubble. They want to see the use cases, especially if they're not technical. Well, when am I going to use it? What will I use it for?

15092," want to live in a crypto bubble, they want to see the use cases. Especially if they're not technical. Well, when am I going to use it? What will I use it for? And I think one of the things that's not appreciated is how quickly the infrastructure here is catching up. And once you have really scalable blockchains that can handle a lot of thorough put and are very efficient, I think that unlocks a whole lot of use cases. People are spending more time on screens. That curve is up and to the right, whether we like it or not, that is the future. I mean, those who have kids know that kids spend more time online. They want digital things too. And I think to dismiss it, it is a bit generational. I do find not always, but it is a bit generational. If you talk to kids about being able to have money online, they instantly get that concept. They're comfortable not having to hold something in their hand to think it has value. Take us to the end state. Do Google and Amazon and Facebook and Apple still exist? I believe they will still exist. I mean, it depends what you talk about when you talk about the end state. I mean, I think that, I think for decades, those companies will still be around. But the important thing is, I think this new ecosystem is going to represent a challenge to them. I do think that those entities, decentralized forces, are coming and will cut into those entities, profits, and revenues. So we have a little rapid fire section.

Ask a question or visit Search Go to find answers now There's an old saying in finance that cash is king But when it comes to payments, the debt is suggests that it's no longer exactly the case According to the latest world pay report, cash now figures in less than 20% of in-person transactions around the world The payment center is true from the beginning, because it's really focused on getting people to use electronic forms of payment In fact, if you look at the US, for example, you basically have been moving around 2-3% of payments from cash and check to some form of direct electronic Just about every single year Total card volume is extra in it today at $20 trillion And there's another $14 trillion worth of cash and check left to digitize Even at 80% level, card penetration is growing So yes, we are moving towards a cashless society A new technology is promised to kick these trends into a higher gear The terminal on the till of the merchant Depending on how old one is, one is used to that At least in the developed world But that is not everywhere, but everyone has a phone So electronic payments can end up in a super simple way in everybody's hands And for our business, that's a massive growth opportunity Mastercard is already seizing that opportunity After dipping in 2020, revenues shot past pre-pandemic levels in 2021 Driven by a rebound to consumer spending CFO Sachin Mehrad knows this boom is likely to fade And he's set on finding ways to keep the momentum going The key to being successful in this kind of an environment is to have a diversified portfolio You've got to be nimble from an expense standpoint, you've got to be very disciplined As a finance officer, what I've got to do is I've got to make sure that We are investing in those resources, which are currently in demand from a customer standpoint But at the same time, I'm not losing sight of the long term CEO Michael Meebak, Council on Mehrad, do more than just oversee the balance sheet The top line for me is advisor and confident You're a conciliary Yes, he's quite happy pushing back and saying, uh, vice versa The role of the chief financial officer has actually changed very dramatically Over this 20 plus year tenure that I've had You know, in the past, it was more of a function of, you know, let's make sure the numbers are good Let's make sure we get a great control environment, let's make sure we're actually able to Close the books on time, let's make sure we've got all the financial elements of the business in order The job of the CFO in our view, in my view, is a function of Making sure we're creating the right linkage between what the purpose of the business is But the strategy of the business is and delivering on the financial returns for the company Or while driving long term shareholder value We're in the business of leading beyond the numbers It's great that we know what the numbers are How do we use those numbers to better drive execution of the business To a accomplishment of the strategy of the company",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3379,2022-10-16 02:35:10
15094," Execution of the business to accomplishment of the strategy of the company. MasterCards Core Business is no surprise, cards. Carded products currently account for over half the company's revenue. The company said ambitious growth targets it is 2021 investor day, committing to expand this core and to diversify beyond it. We've been on our six-year strategy to be a multi-rail company in plain English that means whichever way you pay people enable that. Despite the fact that card is in our name is essentially any type of payment. We have the reach so I think we're reasonably well positioned. I mean you've just got to recognize not only where the consumer is today but where they're going to go because a lot of what we've got to do takes time to implement. And is it difficult? You'll get some you'll get it right sometimes, you'll get it wrong sometimes but hopefully you're getting it right more often than you can get wrong and you're working with through that. Forecasting preferences is complicated by an uncertain economy. Consumer confidence has been plunging to historic lows and recession calls are getting louder. Still a slowdown isn't likely to cause a crisis for MasterCard and its peers. Contrary to what people often perceive I think payment as an industry will be quite resilient in a downturn. Generally speaking even during a recession the amount that consumers spend actually does not go down. It continues to grow. I think the thing that people are worried about more in the payments industry is kind of how does the mix of spending change. The first thing that typically happens if you're going into a recessionary environment is people tend to pull back on discretionary categories of spend. They move into the non-discretionary categories of spend. They pivot into food, they pivot into rent, those kinds of payments which are most important for them to meet. But the real still stay the same. So the real which run debit and credit are exactly the same. The technology is the same, the distribution models the same. So those areas don't necessarily change by virtue of moving into more of a debit or credit environment. One area that MasterCard has been moving vigorously into is B2B payments. A market expected to reach 25 trillion dollars by the end of the decade. We think this tremendous promise in the B2B area. The card business as in the elements of the B2B space which are served by Cards are doing well. Are they doing very well and it's in the small business space and the mid market. It's in the large corporate space. All of them do really well. On the accounts payable site I would say we're in the built case and here we're about building an open loop environment to enable payments on accounts payable rails. Whereas the opportunity in that space is different to consumer payments where there is a global standard. The global standard is MasterCard. The global standard are card payments because that's been established. That isn't quite established yet in B2B and I think the more benefits we bring into the payments that are easier than just making a really complicated cross-border payment. I think we will find out away there and we're going to see an explosion of creativity and a lot of other companies coming in and using those rails innovating on top of them. Pursuing new opportunities takes capital. MasterCard has spent billions acquiring companies that add capacity and diversifies infrastructure. Acquisitions and partnerships have helped MasterCard offer more value-added services to their clients tapping into a lucrative revenue stream. What we call services which includes data, insights, consulting, managed services, loyalty and our fraud capabilities is roughly 35% of the revenues of this company. Wow. Yeah. So it's not insignificant. So oftentimes people think MasterCard and think card. Very important but there's a very different part of MasterCard as well. From a balance-chef perspective MasterCard has maintained a healthy leverage ratio even as it's put more resources into acquisitions and taken on more debt given the company flexibility to continue investing. We don't go in and say well right now valuations are low at and they were a year ago let's go and buy something that is that is an opportunistic approach it doesn't work for us. For me it always starts what are we trying to accomplish from a strategy standpoint? What are inherent capabilities we as a company have? What are the gaps in our inherent capabilities to meet that strategy and then for those gaps is...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3380,2022-10-16 02:39:39
15095," What are inherent capabilities we as a company have? What are the gaps in our inherent capabilities to meet that strategy? And then for those gaps, is it best to build by or partner? And then we're out there and we're trying to find the right companies together and it's going to make sure that we have a clear view on short and long-term synergies and so forth. And then we both talk to shareholders and to investors to explain what we're doing and why we're doing it and why it's good. Shareholders have reason to appreciate MasterCard's capital allocation strategy. It's included annual share buybacks, and steadily increased dividends. How do you prioritize the amount of money that you put toward innovation and toward building out different businesses versus share buybacks and dividends because MasterCard has traditionally had robust program in rewarding shareholders? Right. First call of capital is towards growth of the business. After we have done that, it's about making sure we're being goods to its capital and returning excess cash to shareholders with a bias to its share buybacks. And then once you start to come to say, I have dealt with my strategic priorities. I either have invested in my organic growth or in acquisitions. Then, excess cash, we will return back. Generally with a preference for buybacks over dividend because I give a small flexibility. But that's been a good model for us. It's been working well and it's been well received by the market. Coming up, how the tap has taken MasterCard places that the swipe alone could not. What it's really made a difference on has been in terms of how it's driving a shift from cash to electronic forms of payment, particularly on the small ticket items. And later, how MasterCard has staked out a place in the volatile universe of cryptocurrencies. In the crypto world, we play the role as an on-gram. This is Bloomberg. Watch Bloomberg surveillance early edition for the news you need when you need it. I'm at a little of Kayleigh Lyme's in New York and N-Edwards in London. Australia's Central Bank raises interest rates twice as much as Bulkars. Then, surveillance for in-depth analysis. Besides some keen and Lisa Brown with some Jonathan Ferro, the RPA fronts and cents. How does Japan get away with not raising rates? Can it sustain? It's normal at a time when everybody else is facing a very different reality. Bloomberg surveillance. Be informed. Be prepared. Be ahead of the game. Such in Merra, joins MasterCard as group executive in corporate treasure in 2010. Over the next decade, he took on several different roles before being appointed Chief Financial Officer in 2019. That's a very different path than the one he started out on. I grew up in India. I went to school there. I went undergrad there. I went to the family business there. It's a tax service business, which my grandfather started. My dad and my uncle took over. And then my brother and I got into. And I worked with him for three and a half years. Then I came here for business school. The moment of truth came on graduation day. My dad got on the phone. He congratulated me. He said, well done. He graduated. I'm looking forward to having him back home. My brother was older than I am. Went to business school. He was well and went back home and worked with my dad. Got on the phone. He congratulated me and said, so such and what are you going to do with your life? And I'm going, well, why are we having this discussion? Dad wants me to come home and work with the family business. He's like, yep, that's what dad wants you to do. What do you want to do? And then it really got me thinking. And I said, hey, given a chance, I'd love to work in finance in the US. Merit took the chance, even though it took him six months to land his first job at General Motors, where he worked for over a decade. Then it was on to the energy industry at Hes Corporation before finding his way to MasterCard. Today, my dad couldn't be proud of the fact that, you know, I chose the path I did. Obviously, he misses the fact that we're not there as a family, but that's just part of life, right? We've all got to grow in Blasmen Group. Did he accept it at the beginning? It took him all of 30 minutes to get there. When Merit gets together with his team in the employee cafe at MasterCard's campus, it's clear that he's in his element. Well, more important, more fun stuff. What's the plan for the weekend? And of course, the cafe provides a demonstration of the tap and go technology that's changed the game for payment companies. Could I just go and regular call for you at home?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3381,2022-10-16 02:44:06
15096," And of course the cafe provides a demonstration of the tap and go technology that's changed the game for payment companies. Can I just go to regular coffee with one? With both please, yeah. Okay, that would be 571. You got it? All right, we're going to make this work. There we go. I think contactless is a very powerful catalyst for accelerating gas demand conversion. In the last two years, what we have seen in the US is God penetration could rotate and you'll be has doubled versus what was the average in the prior five years. The pandemic was one of the reasons people didn't want to touch cash. And there's a lot of e-commerce purchases. The contactless definitely contributed to this growth as well. It's made a change. It's really made a difference. What it's really made a difference on has been in terms of how it's driving a shift from cash to electronic forms of payment. Particularly on the small ticket items, which is really, really important. Because at the end of the day, our model is as much about converting the dollar value of the spend as it is about the number of transactions we can get over our network. And even though it happens to be a $2 transaction, a transaction, a transaction on which we may cravenly, on which we can deliver services. And that's really important. Mastercard introduced PayPass, its first contactless payment system in 2002. But the technology took some time to gain traction. I would say we first invested in this many, many, many years ago. The adoption rate on this in the early part, even in markets like the UK, Canada, Australia, was fairly slow in the early part. The inflection point of when it really started to hit its right was when it was used in the transit vertical. So what we figured is, let's get all the transit systems around the globe, enable for contactless technology. That will create muscle memory for the consumer who will like the experience in transit and will use it elsewhere. How do you judge the revenue proposition for Mastercard with an innovation like that and the adoption and the pace of it? Look, I mean, for us, we're agnostic as to whether somebody's using the chip technology or the contactless technology or using the MagStrike, which was the old way of doing business. We own revenues which are quite similar across both of those. The revenue potential and upside for us comes from the fact that now more spend is being done on card-based form of payment than was being done in the past. So we're converting that cash over the electronic forms of payment, which is where the incremental revenue comes from. If contactless payments is the current revolution sweeping the payments industry, what's the next one? I think pay with you smile. So, biometrics, I think that's where it's going to go. And I think we've reached that point and people are sick of too many passwords. People are sick of typing in stuff. And there's also too many wallets and other IDs and stuff that is around. So why don't you just, everybody has a smile. So just play with your smile. There you go. How much are you investing in that? How quickly do you see that becoming the next tap and go? Yeah. So look, I think this is going to take a while. These things have an adoption curve, which typically is fairly flat in the early part and then you start to see some level of steepness. MasterCards next breakthrough may be borne in one of its global tech hubs. The company has opened innovation centers in Australia, India, Europe, Canada and the United States. These are spaces where we draw in customers, where we draw the local community. We have them in big cities, where the latest technologies and the players are all around us. In New York City, it's in Tech Alley and everybody in the tech industry is around us. It's a point where people want to work and be attracted to the best talent. And we go and this brings us back to the CFO. We go and look at our vitality index. So how are our revenues looking? What is generated from new products? What do we see? Is there real momentum? Is there real growth? And if you overlay that and link that back to our tech hubs in these regions where we have them, clearly that is what driving our new solutions. From an investment standpoint, we try and make sure we've got our foot in the door and all of these new and emerging technologies. What we don't want to do is play favorites with one versus the other. We want to make sure we're investing just appropriate amounts of money to have skin in the game to know that if this thing is got legs to it, we want to be at the inflection point for them to write out. In your tech hubs, can you act like Bond, James Bond? And what are the key?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3382,2022-10-16 02:48:29
15097," game to know that if this thing is got legs to it, we want to be at the inflection point for them to write out. In your tech hubs, can you act like Bond, James Bond? In one of the Q movies and like the laboratories we walk in and they, you know, you sort of face off and clear the system and they sort of do this. There are some people who have privileged in this company who can do that, not everybody can. And I'm not one of them. I can tell you that. No, that's not me. Coming up, how MasterCard has embraced the brave new world of cryptocurrency with all its ups and downs. So long as we follow our principles, we think we're in really good shape. And Sachin Merra tells me what advice he'd offer a CFO just starting out in the job. I think it's important to stay calm. I think it's important to recognize that change is going to happen. You can't fight change. This is Bloomberg. Hydrogen has a very special place in the universe. It's the first element on the periodic table. It is the most abandoned element in the universe. And when clean energy advocates think about what can we find which would be as easy to use as fossil fuels, they think about hydrogen. The fuel that will, when burn, only produce water. We like to imagine that if we just built enough of these and these, we could ditch fossil fuels and save the planet. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. There are some things where you just need a good old-fashioned combustible fuel. Now startups around the world are betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century.

Like many of its counterparts in the payments and financial services industry, MasterCard has developed products and partnerships that bring cryptocurrencies into its networks. I think from the payments and payment system perspective, the players and members that make up that ecosystem are really agnostic. To them, crypto is just another occurrence, literally. Just another asset. At this point, the overall revenue contribution is still so small. It's very early. But if I'm a hard company, it's better to invest and also lean in and partner with some of these companies for future revenue growth rates versus kind of sitting on the sidelines. Crypto is a term that encompasses a number of different projects, including central bank digital currencies and private sector stablecoins. Also, digital assets like Bitcoin, whose volatile valuations and susceptibility to fraud, have raised plenty of anxiety among investors. MasterCard's long-term plans to stay in the space have it wavered. We're not really in the crypto hype of investing around crypto. We like the fundamental technology and the promise that it brings to solve problems that have not been solved. If we see more revenue coming out of B2B solutions, that leverage blockchain technology, for example, tokenized bank deposits just to throw out one example, cross-border payments, whatever it might be. In the crypto world, we play the role as an on-gram. So people use MasterCard hard products to buy crypto, or debit and credit products. So that's the on-gram if people want to spend money as in fiat currency to buy crypto and react as the off-ramp. The off-ramp is...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3383,2022-10-16 02:52:37
15098," To buy crypto are debit and credit products. So that's the on-gram if people want to spend money as in fee currency to buy crypto and react as the off-ramp. And the off-ramp is when people want to incasher, we help them actually gain access to be able to use their crypto balances everywhere, MasterCards, except it. We engage with central banks on central bank digital currencies. We engage with governments on how a policy could look like, how regulation could look like. We engage with the startup community and say, come on in, let's sit around the table in one of our tech hubs and we discuss what solution actually is needed by whom and how we can bring it together. They have the greatest idea, but the greatest idea needs a path to scale. That's what we can bring. Is there a potential liability because of volatility, because of how Bitcoin and certain other cryptocurrencies have been painted? Is there any liability for MasterCard? Yeah, well, so long as we follow our principles, we think we're in really good shape. And the principles we care deeply about are stability, as in stability of the currency in question. Point number two, it must meet consumer protection requirements. And it must meet the laws of the land. And this is not new news to us. We've done this in this space for the last 50 years. For everything we've been working with regulated financial institutions on. And so which is why when we got into this space, the first thing we did was to find principles. And we will keep abiding by those principles and what we do. And we have to feel happy because we're in the discussion. We're shaping the ecosystem. And then one day it'll look like what we have done in many other spaces over the past years. Such in Merra is a leader within a company that has the power and reach to shape ecosystems. And he'll be making strategic and financial decisions to shape the business. I wanted to know what he sees when he looks ahead. What's the opportunity for MasterCard in the next 10 years that most excites you? There still remains a very sizable consumer payments opportunity, which we stand very well poised to actually capitalize on. This is the trend of the shift from cash to electronic forms of payment. If you think about it globally, there's still a ton of cash, which remains to be electrified. And that opportunity is huge. The second pillar for me is around we have identified over the past few years a sizable total addressable market in what we call new payment flows. Bucket number three is around services. It goes back to our insights, analytics, our fraud management capabilities, and everything we're doing in that space. And then the last piece around new networks, which is around open banking and digital identity. What are some of the challenges for MasterCard over the next 10 years that keep you up at night? It's around staying plugged in on what's going on from a technology innovation standpoint. And making sure we're leading from the front, not turning our back to it and saying, we're going to walk in the other direction. We've got to engage with people who could potentially be disintermediators, competitors to let them know what value we can bring while they're executing on their strategy. So that's number one. Number two is, look, I mean, the world is getting more and more into a regulatory environment where regulators are playing a bigger role. Nationalism is playing a bigger role. It's important for us to continue to do everything we're doing by being deemed local. It's important to be a global company, but be deemed local. And that's going to be important for us to execute on. Because at the end of the day, sitting in my role as the CFO, strategies grade, visions fantastic, but what really matters is, can you really deliver and execute? And we've got to stay focused on execution. And that's what we do every day. What's the biggest change that you see a role having over the next 10 years? I had a really good question. Honestly, I'm not really in the business of predicting that much as it relates to how it's going to change. What I can see happening is greater emphasis on making sure we're leading from the front on executing, but also failing fast. And that's where a CFO can play a big role. And by that, I mean, you're not always going to win. There are things you're going to do. Hopefully, you'll get more right than wrong, but recognizing things which are not working out, and making sure you actually fail fast on them and get out of them. Because you can fall in love with stuff, keep doing it, keep wasting resources, don't realize that it's not going to pay off. And I think the emphasis around that is going to only increase for the CFOs in the scarce capital resource environment. What advice would you give a CFO today? I think...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3384,2022-10-16 02:57:13
15099," It's not going to pay off. And I think the emphasis around that is going to only increase for the CFOs in a scarce capital resource environment. What advice would you give a CFO today? I think it's important to stay calm. I think it's important to recognize that change is going to happen. You can't fight change. What really matters is how you can get up and actually deal with that change. That's super important for a CFO. Being really clear and crisp in your communications. The outside world wants to hear in very simple terms what exactly this company stands for and why they should believe that you are a good investment. And notice I've said nothing about financials and I've said nothing about necessarily financial infrastructure and systems because I do believe as a CFO. Those things are taking steps. You've got to make sure that stuff happens. You've got to level up your technology. You've got to drive efficiency in the business. You've got to get the numbers right. You've got to have a good control environment. So what's going to call you apart is the other elements we check for. If MasterCard can meet ambitious goals for growth in its core business and build on strategies that are taking payments to the next level such in Merrill will deserve a lot of the credit. I'm Lisa Abramowitz. This is Bloomberg. So is there more pressure when you're trying to win a basketball championship than when you're trying to please investors? Where's the greater pressure? I think it's definitely trying to win a championship. It's hard because when you invest and you know this, when you're investing you can control a lot more things. When in a basketball court you can't control whether somebody's going to make a shot, you've got to get lucky. And what's the greater pleasure making five times your money on a Distress Dead investment or winning the NBA championship? They're both fabulous. I wish I could do one each year. That would be great. But I think it was a great feeling and being right on an investment that you've done a tremendous amount of work and you've made money for your clients which I think is great. I think winning a championship is, it's a very surreal feeling because there's a whole city or state that is actually behind you. We had 70,000 people at the finals and we had them all outside. We had 17,000 in stands and then literally like 60,000 people outside. And when we won, just the joy that you had brought to the city was phenomenal. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if you're not going to win if every car on the roads today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building across America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels, we want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. We will put a woman on Mars. You will bring forth global cooling. You will be the first Chief Crypto Officer. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news.

15100," An inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer, disrupt. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. Every Friday with 30 minutes dedicated to fixed income, I'm Jonathan Ferro, this is with Berk Real Yield. Welcome to the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit. I'm Froncing Lockwell here at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. This event, powered by Bloomberg featured finalists selected by the Earth Shop Council, launched by Prince William, is a global initiative that drives innovation on solutions to climate change and environmental issues in the following categories. Protect and restore nature. Clean our air, revive our oceans, build our waste-free world, fix our climates. So over the next half an hour, we'll bring you all the highlights from this most important gathering. This is Bloomberg. Protect and the environment was of course close to my grandmother's heart. And I know you should have been delighted to hear about this event and the support you're all giving our Earth Shop finalists the next generation of environmental pioneers. Together in this room are the people and organisations who will help us to achieve the Earth Shop mission, to repair, restore and rejuvenate our planet within this current decade. That mission is not simple. This is President John F. Kennedy, so famously said, as he challenged the United States for America to unite behind the goal of putting man on the moon. We choose to do these things not because they are easy but because they are hard. I know that the world is an uncertain place right now, that many families and communities across the globe are facing unimaginable challenges, from conflicts to energy crisis and food shortages. While addressing these in the short term, we must also remain resolutely focused on tackling the greatest challenges that threaten our tomorrow. Because if we don't, the changing climate will only serve to entrench these immediate challenges into fundamental global issues, severely impacting the lives of each and every one of us. That is why our collective mission is so urgent, but there is huge reason to be optimistic. The 2021 cohort of Earth Shop winners and finest is evidence that we can succeed. That we can protect our world for our children, our grandchildren and the generations that will follow them. These pioneers exemplify the leadership needed in this decade of change. They include inspiring activists, brilliant innovators, afford thinking city and even an entire country making a real difference. But they cannot do it alone. This must be a team effort. We must come together behind their innovative solutions to ensure they reach their full potential with peace and scale. While my message today is one of gratitude and encouragement, I also acknowledge that you cannot succeed in isolation. As governments, we have a responsibility to create the incentives and the space for you to flourish. A receptive environment for change and the accountability that comes with guardianship. In many nations, the foundation for this approach has been flayed for us long ago if we choose to listen. Where I come from, I'll tear our New Zealand a beautiful place. You must visit. Our indigenous people hold a world view that every single living and non-living thing is connected. Our people, our plants, our animals, descendants of Ranganoi the Sky Father and Papa Tuanuku the Earth Mother.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3386,2022-10-16 03:05:29
15101," It's connected. Our people, our plants, our animals, descendants of Ranganui, the sky father and Papa Tuanuku, the earth mother and their children. And so it follows that people and nature are kin, are family. And we must careful on another in the spirit of Kaitiaki Tanga, which translates into guardianship by the people of the land for the next generation. In short, kÅ ahÅ te tÄau, kÅ te tÄau, kÅ ahÅ, I am the environment and the environment is me. Our life source, our economy, our future. Now I've seen this in action first hand many times, not least in my own backyard, the Pacific, where the ocean is a source of protein, income, culture and connection. Now that is a source of challenge, as it rises up and begins to inundate small island nations. It can be confronting to hear and see the stories of just how real these challenges are, but none of us are here because we have given up, but because we believe there is a way to change the future. We are not only part of the nature, but we are nature. Nature is living element. For indigenous people, nature is whole. Our planet is alive. The rivers are her blood. The trees are her hair. The soil, her skin, the wind, her breeze. And indigenous peoples, our planet they know, they are the doctor. We are protecting 80% of the world's biodiversity. Because our way of life do not harm nature at the opposite. We are strengthening ecosystems. We improve biodiversity by cooperating with the birds and trees, listening to the winds, observing the cloud, learning from even the little insect. We protect nature by setting up our own limits. We don't take more that mother earth can give and we give back. We protect the sacred trees. We don't destroy the field of the medicinal plants. We choose, pre-susely, the animal that we can kill to just keep the balance of the ecosystem. As all of us know in this fight, no one can afford to sit on the sidelines. No one can claim that climate change is somebody else's problem or to forget of for future generations to address. We are all affected by a warming planet. We see that every day. And decisions being made right now will determine our shared tomorrow. So we must choose and we must act as united nations ourselves. Our progress depends on collective action, on collective ingenuity. If we stick together, we can make fixing the climate the greatest project and greatest achievement of our lifetimes. We have the science, we have the solutions. Now all the world needs is political will. Together we can create a future where rampant carbon is removed from the atmosphere, where green buildings and green business transform the livability of communities, where easy access to renewable energy enables greater equity, where sustainable agriculture feeds a growing global population. The needs are urgent and the costs of inaction are worse than any nightmare. But let us not be driven by, let us be driven by hope not fear, by optimism not despair. Because hope is not passive. Hope is the ultimate source of renewable energy pushing us forward every day to try and try again. Today, the earth shop prize innovation summit in partnership with Mike Bloomberg and Bloomberg Philanthropies will ask each and every one of us what we can do to accelerate progress to repair our planet this decade. And offer solutions on how to collaborate to drive this ambitious.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3387,2022-10-16 03:09:46
15102," One of us, what we can do to accelerate progress to repair our planet this decade. And offer solutions on how to collaborate to drive this ambitious but essential climate agenda. We will continue to drive impact around system changing climate solutions and amplify the earth shop prizes call to accelerate progress to repair our planet through collaboration and innovation. But most importantly, we will remind ourselves what can be achieved when we turn pessimism to optimism and optimism into action. Coming up, but more from the panelists and finalists here at the earth shop prize innovation site. This is Bloomberg. So what's the best investment advice you've ever given by anybody? The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day and if you keep added and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's not just interest. It was always said about compound interest returns, compound business returns, compound human returns. They're all very additive because you learn every day and if you keep at it, it's very, very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make? Selling at the wrong time. And they sell when the prices go down? Yes, or yes. Not keeping, but people have conviction or the investor, if they invest for the right reasons, just keep at it. You will shed light on dark matter. You will make aging optional. You will turn 5G up to 11 because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer, disrupt. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. Innovation, money and power collide in Silicon Valley and beyond. Bloomberg technology with Emily Chan. Weekdays at 5 p.m. in New York and 2 p.m. in San Francisco. Welcome back to the best of the earth's shop prize innovation summit. The guests featured ranged from heads of state to leaders of grassroots environmental organizations. Well, amongst them was philanthropist and Microsoft founder Bill Gates. Yeah, it's too bad you can't do things overnight in either mitigation or adaptation. When I last went through Europe, people were the leaders were all saying, hey, give me technologies. So I can tell Putin to get lost. And I said, hey, in five years, you're going to be able to call him up. And they were like, no, we'd like it. Now. It's a year now. Okay, that. How's your planning permission regime and all the, you know, planning and planning? For that, that future grid seeds typically between the timing start and they get out in the farmers fields. It's about eight years. Now we have a pipeline of innovations. You know, we've been funding the CG system for 20 years now. It's funded about a billion year. It's if people care at all about adaptation, that thing will be funded at two billion a year. I mean, there won't be anything close to the end of the year. And there won't be anything close to the impact of climate related seeds, climate related maze, rice, wheat, sort of a millet. And thank goodness because of human genetics, we know how to do the editing. Thank goodness because of AI, we know how to find the alleles because of drones. We can measure stuff in the field. So there's huge advance in terms of how the whole seed ecosystem moves at at full speed. The timing is very tricky here. The warming doesn't stop the day you get to zero.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3388,2022-10-16 03:14:15
15103," system moves at full speed. The timing is very tricky here. The warming doesn't stop the day you get to zero emissions. There's a lag in this system. It's about a 20-year lag. So you haven't seen that Earth temperatures not equilibrated to the atmospheric CO2 content. So when you get to zero, it's not like 2051. Take my air conditioner away. No, it starts quite a bit later. And so you have to look at what the peak is. And you can't just plan for OK, 2030, 2030 is where your main production in central Africa is down 25%. By 2050, it's down 70%. And you will have switched in most of those areas from a fairly heat-sensitive crop to Sorghum. Now Sorghum productivity is super low. So we'll get people to do better maize for these next 15 years. And then they are going to have to switch to Sorghum. It is tough when you see the floods in Pakistan. I mean, nobody expected that. If the goal of climate was to make us pay attention, wow, that is way beyond expectation. So some adaptation money literally will just be disafferable recovery money. The boundary of what is also pretty confusing. I mean, what is food aid? If climate's causing some food production losses, all world-proof program money is that all climate adaptation money? It's certainly the need for it's going up. That's a system that's about six and a half billion a year, so relative to the systemic solution, which is the research piece, it's relatively larger. But the demand for that piece, which is the acute half of Pakistani rice, got flushed away. And so you're going to have malnutrition problems if you don't go in for that. That's also a type of adaptation. And so I do think we're going to bring some rigor to this because the pressure now, the goal of doubling the adaptation money from, they say, 20 billion here to 40 billion here, the pressure on that is the growth. Still peanuts. No, it's very small. I mean, literally, yeah, if you start sticking food aid in there, you can use it up very quickly, rebuilding after hurricanes. I mean, we had hurricanes before, but the costs there are absolutely gigantic. There are ways to stop you, wildfires that are ways of dealing with sea level rise. So the innovation agenda, not just on seeds, the innovation agenda is going full speed on mitigation. That's where there's 100 companies break through energy's funded. And by mitigation, you mean mostly energy, you mean everything to do with energy. You mean generation of energy, you mean batteries, you mean transport, you mean all of the new, and there's some renewables that are already traditional, but more that need to come on. So that's the package that you're talking about mitigation. Or are you also talking about agriculture as mitigation? Yeah, so every area of emissions, the world tends to focus on past and your cars and electricity. That's not a third of emissions. And so the focus on the easiest third, now 4% of new cars are electric. So that's the field that we're further still long. About 4% of energy generation is wind and solar. And as you triple the size of your grid, you want that to be say, some people would say 100%. Other people might say 70 to 80%. The amount you have to build, we're not within a factor of 5 of the build rate of those. But those are the easy sectors. Cement, clean cement costs over twice as much as the way we make cement today. And it's partly the heating energy. It's partly the basic thing, remember in chemistry, when you take calcium carbonate and heat it, you get calcium, that's what makes cement. But the thing that goes away, that's CO2. And so we have to have a way of making cement.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3389,2022-10-16 03:19:23
15104," Revenant heat it, you get calcium, that's what makes cement. But the thing that goes away, that's CO2. And so we have to have a way of making cement, which a number of these innovative. And a steel and iron. Yep. There's a whole family of hard to obeyed sectors. That's true. If you get a dead industrial sector, if you get green hydrogen that's cheap enough, it actually solves quite a large number of those. Some of the industrial processes should go straight to electricity. And some you go through, you do your reduction using the hydrogen, where you would have used some hydrocarbon concept before. For steel, we actually have companies doing both. We have electros steel and others doing electricity is the way of replacing the blast furnace. And then we have others that take hydrogen. And if you get the hydrogen cheap enough, you get the super magic thing, which is that the green product doesn't cost more. That's called green premium equals zero. And then your adoption scale is utterly different. If we try to subsidize steel and cement, say rich countries say, OK, we want to get rid of that, which those two are 15% of emissions, that's greater than all foreign aid budgets put together. So over 200 billion foreign aid never will pass that number. It's just not politically possible. It's a number that's at about 170 and going down today. Coming up, put more from the panelists and finalists here at the earth's shop prize innovation side. This is Bloomberg. OK, so you're moving in on me quick, just stradding me with your fancy hands. I'm going to deal with your night, because this is really bothering me. My nights. Yeah. He's a troublemaker. Yeah. What did you get up to this weekend? You know, just robot stuff. A lot of chess. I was practicing for you. I know you're pretty good. Ooh, I don't like that. I will take this. Put it over here here. Not cool. Not cool. All right. I will. I will concede. I can see.

Welcome back to the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit. Finalists of the annual award appeared alongside special guests, including worldwide business leaders, philanthropists and non-governmental activists. Now while the 2022 finalists have been announced, our panelists have their eyes on the future and here's what they have to say. This is the Earth Shop Decade. We are in a race to repair and regenerate the planet. Some will focus on policy, some will focus on activism. We are focused on supporting the game changers, the innovators, the entrepreneurs and the problem solvers. We believe in the power of human ingenuity, grit and determination to create solutions that if scaled could repair the planet. We have only 8% of the ocean protected today.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3390,2022-10-16 03:23:30
15105," could repair the planet. We have only 8% of the ocean protected today. And our earth shot is, as Pati said, 30 by 30. 30% of the ocean at least, 30% of the ocean protected by 2030. And we know that if we protect the right 30%, not only will we prevent the extinction of many marine species, but also we will produce more fish. There's going to be these protected areas are going to produce a spillover that will exceed the forgon catch. So we're going to have more fish to eat, food security, livelihoods for people. And we know that for every dollar that we invest in a protected area in a marine reserve, that produces 10 dollars in economic output and creates more jobs. So it's a triple win for marine life, for food security and for climate, and of course for the economy. So that's the goal, the mission, to in the next 8 years, and that's where the earth shot is really, it's pretty crazy. In the next 8 years, we need to quadruple all the ocean protection that has ever happened in human history. Are you optimistic that I can be done? I am optimistic there's no choice. I've seen firsthand the potential that a breakthrough idea can hold. And if we start seeing more of these transformative solutions across all the challenges facing our planet, then suddenly our earth shot won't seem so improbable. The work will be difficult. It'll take extraordinary resources, determination, partnership. But we've got all the essentials right here in this room. So what is the challenge? It's the speed, scale, and cost of making these green hydrogen generators. Well, that's exactly what we are working on. Because to make green hydrogen the fuel source of the future, it needs to be cheaper than fossil fuels. And that means, electrolyzers are going to need to be really, really cheap. If you want to take a solution around the globe as quickly as possible, you need to make it standardized, mass-produced commodity. A product that is easy to make and quick to build and cheap as well. And so, while some believe electrolyzers need to be large machines, we believe the electrolyzer should be a standardized, mass-producible product that can make green hydrogen anywhere for anyone. In 2030, we imagine millions and millions of projects on restore. And not just places on earth where we see nature being brought back, but all of the other nodes that are key to ensuring success. So the technology providers, the nurseries, the seed banks, the funders, the government incentive programs, so that we have an ecosystem that really allows us to leverage the many, many connections within the nature-based solution space. And in 2030, we have been focused on another key area which is cities. And cities require data and insights to take action on climate and to preserve nature, to create more nature and tree canopy. So we've set a goal that we want to- We have more nature in cities, exactly. Exactly, right. And so we've been partnering with cities like Los Angeles to give them insights, utilizing AI and geomapping on where all the places that you can create more tree canopy, which reduces urban heat islands, improves air quality sequesters, carbon. So we want to bring data and solutions to bringing nature into cities, as well as of course preserving and restoring nature. And so one of the goals that we've set is we want to enable over 500 cities around the world. I know we're going to hear from the mayor of Paris after this to reduce a gigaton of carbon emissions by 2030. And so that's through data, tools, insights, whether that's evolving transportation systems or planting new tree canopy. So that's a big bold target that we want to see achieved by 2030. Anyway, I guess I'm in the wrong place. I came here to invite all of you to the Grouch Convention, but it turns out you're all about my least favorite thing, helping. Oh. You've got me, Oscar. I do like helping people learn how to reuse repurpose and recycle.

Sorry, my God, I gotta get going to that convention, but uh, just between us. Yes. I do have a recycling bin right next to my can. But no, I think it out okay, it'll ruin my image. But my father believed in the power of the idea. And over time, the vision, the purpose, the courage, it embodied has inspired each generation to take on its own challenges. Not because they're easy, but because they're hard. President Kennedy understood that the effort to land on the moon would bring out the best in us that everyone would have to contribute, that it would require innovation, creativity, teamwork, commitment, and faith. And that world would be better because of it. The Earth Shot Prize has inspired the same spirit of optimism and ingenuity on a global scale to tackle the most pressing challenge we now face, repairing the planet. My family and I are so excited that the Prince of Wales will honor this year's Earth Shot Prize winners in partnership with the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, a city that is committed to scientific excellence, environmental justice, and the fight against climate change. We're proud that President Kennedy's moonshot legacy still inspires hope, and we look forward to welcoming all of you who are working to ensure a better future here on Earth.

I'm Francing Lackwap from New York, and this is Bloomberg. I'm going to name a couple of your babies. I don't know if I'm asking you to choose amongst your children, but you know some of the most recognizable buildings by you, of course, the Millennium Bridge, London City Hall, the Reichstag, and the Great Court British Museum. What was your favorite project to do? The Reichstag does stand out because, first of all, it's an energy manifesto. So it transformed something that was dependent on fossil fuels. It uses all the technology to produce something which is essentially carbon neutral, and there's a public building. That's sustainable. It's a symbol of a city. It's a symbol of a nation. It incorporates works of art. It's recycling and existing building, which as I mentioned earlier, is the ultimate in sustainability. If you can give a new life to a building, it also creates public space at the roof level. It's the most visited parliament in the world, so it puts the public above the politicians who are answerable to them. And that, of course, was made possible by the politicians. So it's a demonstration of democracy in action. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. The pressure cooker just got far too hot in banning them for the government to handle.

15107," h Bloomberg's covering all things crypto, the people, the transactions, and the technology. Bloomberg crypto Tuesdays. Thank you, Andy, so much for coming down. It's really wonderful to have you here in person. It's my pleasure to be here. Thanks, Patrick. And I just found out we actually lived in the same dorm in college just a few years apart. So it's been almost a year since you took over from Jeff as CEO of Amazon, and it's been a year of first, the first stock split since the.com boom, the first vote to unionize an Amazon warehouse, your first Bloomberg technology conference. Thank you. I want to start with a quick report card. In February 2021, Jeff Bezos shocked the world by announcing plans to step down as Amazon CEO. A few months later, he passed the reins to Andy Jassy, his longtime top lieutenant, the architect of one of the company's biggest profit engines, Amazon Web Services. Bezos has stayed on as executive chair, leaving Jassy to navigate a critical inflection point in Amazon's history. How does the company manage market turmoil, rising inflation and regulatory scrutiny, and a push by some warehouse workers to unionize, all while keeping customers coming back? Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, Amazon's second CEO, Andy Jassy, he joined us from our flagship Bloomberg technology summit in San Francisco. I'd like you to grade your view of Amazon's performance, and we've got time later to really dig in. But quickly, how would you grade Amazon's performance over the last year with customers? Well, I think we've, you know, I'm not sure I'm the right person to grade myself during the year or not. But I'll give you my take. I think with respect to customers, I think we've done a lot of good. And I think if you look at during the pandemic, which really has extended till the early part of this year, so much as the PPE and food and essential items and people equipping their home offices were bought from Amazon. And to scale the way we needed to. Remember, in 2020, we grew 39% year over year on a $245 billion revenue run rate. I mean, it's unprecedented. It's never happened before. But it was really hard to do that. And we had to take the really big footprint of the fulfillment center footprint. We built the first 25 years of Amazon and double it in 24 months. We built out that transportation network in just a couple of years. You know, we nearly doubled the size of our workforce during that time. And I think you saw it in other businesses. AWS is a really big part of helping companies and governments have business continuity during the pandemic. And so many companies and organizations in the last year made the strategic decision that they were going to stop running their own infrastructure technology and disproportionately chose AWS to help them move to the cloud. And we spent a lot of time helping them make that transformation. So what about investors? I mean, the stock is down significantly from a peak last year. Obviously, there's broader market turmoil. Yeah, I think, you know, for investors or financially, I'd say it's mixed. You know, I think we have some businesses that are growing really strongly. If you look at AWS in 2021, grew 37% year-over-year. It's not a $74 billion revenue run rate business. It's a pretty unusual growth. And we grew 58% year-over-year in our advertising business. You know, what's a $32 billion revenue run rate business? So some businesses growing really strongly. And, you know, we've continued to grow in our retail business despite pretty crazy comparables during 2020. But I think the real challenge for us there is on the cost side. And there have been several things that have happened, some of which are more controllable than others. You know, I think the part that's less controllable is really around inflation. And I think we thought that inflation would start to attenuate in 2022. And with the war in Ukraine, it just went the other way. And it has significantly accelerated. And so the cost...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3393,2022-10-16 03:37:04
15108," and with the war in Ukraine, it just went the other way, and has significantly accelerated. And so the cost of trucking and line haul, and ocean, and air, and fuel has just substantially gone up. And I think that will attenuate at some point. No one knows how long that'll take. I think the more controllable areas for us are really around fulfillment center capacity and productivity. It was taking about 24 months to build new fulfillment centers during the pandemic. And so we had to make decisions, you know, in the mid-2020 and early 2021 on how much demand we were going to plant for it. And so, you know, we end up with more capacity than we need right now. And there's a number of things that we're working on. We've stopped building on properties where we don't need it yet. And we've let a number of leases lapse. And not a small number, you know, of both those things. We've had a lot of occasions in our history where we've worked on productivity and made improvements. And we have a lot of clearly defined niches. And I'm confident we're going to get back to the right level of profitability. You are going to sublease 30 million square feet of space. Is there a mistake in the execution there? Because of the overbuilding? Again, because you have to make these decisions two years in advance. And again, if you put yourself back in 2020 where we were growing 39% year over year on a $245 billion revenue run rate, it's very hard to know what's the right amount to build. And you have to make a decision. And we made the decision to err on the side of our consumers and sellers. Now, how would you grade Amazon's performance with employees, your colleagues? There has been some high profile. Yeah. I think that when I started in this gig, we had just created a new leadership principle to strive to be Earth's best employer. And I think we're, you know, we spend a lot of time trying to think through what that really means is broad. And I think we've made a fair bit of progress, but it's still early, in my opinion. But I still think there are many areas that we can keep improving. And I think, you know, the first one I'd mention is safety. I think that in our fulfillment centers, that is the top priority. And you know, when you get into the details and numbers and outside of all the spin of it all, you know, we're about average there, but we're not trying to be average. You know, we want to be the best in the industry and the best in the world at it. And that's a high priority and an area that I'm passionate about and the team is passionate about. And I think we have a lot of work we can do to make our employees everyday lives easier. And we've identified kind of a top 100 list of areas that we can be better at, that we're just metronomically stepping through. And so we've made a lot of progress, but we've a lot of work to you still. Elon Musk just came out saying he has a super bad feeling about the economy, Tesla laying off 10% of his staff. Jamie Dimon says he's preparing for an economic hurricane. The World Bank just slashed its forecast for global growth. How do you feel about the economic climate? Well, I wasn't planning on giving any guidance to the camera. Please. But, super bad or super super bad. I think there's some things that are related to Amazon that are useful to remember. I think the first piece is remember that 85% of the worldwide retail market segment share is offline. And if you believe that that equation's going to flip at some point, which we do, I think it will flip over a long period of time. If you look at different downturns, should we have one at some point? And we've been through a few, obviously, in the 25 years that I've been at Amazon, customers change their habits. And so I also think there's those two reasons, those two factors give me some optimism that even if we have a downturn that we have the potential to still grow up, we have a roadmap that's probably three to five years long. And we're going to continue to invent, we're going to continue to be insurgent. And we have a lot of work to do to get to where we think we ultimately can get for customers. Now, when it comes to the stock, as I mentioned, it has fallen significantly. Do you think investors are missing something or has tech just been overvalued? And this also, of course, matters to employees who are significantly paid in stock? Well, you know, look, I haven't been at Amazon for 25 years. I arrived at the company three weeks before we went public. I have never tried to predict what the stocks might do. And any time I've tried to a little bit, I've been wrong. So I think it's pretty hard to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3394,2022-10-16 03:40:44
15109," public. I have never tried to predict what the stocks going to do. And any time I've tried to a little bit, I've been wrong. So, you know, I think it's a pretty hard to, pretty hard to predict what's going to be in any short period of time. I do really believe that Benjamin, you know, that Benjamin Graham Maxon that in the short term, the stock market tends to be a voting machine and the long term it tends to be a waiting machine. And I think if you, you know, we've been through a lot of points in 25 years of Amazon, where the macro factors are off and stocks are down. Our stock is down. But you can't really control that. You know, we have a concept we talk about a lot of Amazon inputs and outputs, you know, and the ultimate output for a company is share price, you know, and then other big outputs are free cash flow or profit or revenue. You can't really manage the outputs. You have to manage at the input level. And that's where we spend all our time. And so if you do the right things for the business long term, things tend to work out, I think we've had very good returns for investors. And I expect that to be true again. Do you see Amazon strategy as fundamentally different from Netflix and Disney and if so, how? Is crucial important. And I think we've moved from this attitude from its indulgence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure for something as universally important to human life as sleep. Mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s, and so it makes that a really exciting field because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harnessed to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts. But if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what you bring figures out while you're sleeping. What are the moon shots at Amazon that are capturing most of your time and attention? What is going to define the next era of Amazon? I mean, is it is it Astro the home row butter? Is it something else? Well, you know, we have a unique way that we look at big new investments. And I'm not sure it's right or wrong. It just happens to be our way. And we ask ourselves when we're considering something for questions. We ask if it's successful, can it be big and move the needle in Amazon? Is it being well served today? Do we have a differentiated approach? And do we have confidence there? And if not, can we acquire quickly? If we like the answer to those questions, we'll go pursue it with a single threaded team that isn't distracted by the rest of the business. And sometimes that leads to innovation investments that seem pretty obvious. Like, you know, when I got to that company was a book's only retailer and then we expanded to music and video and electronics and toys, it seems obvious to people. Other times that process does not lead to investments that seem obvious to people. I mean, AWS was something that people externally and internally thought was a little bit nutty at the time. But just imagine what Amazon would be today without AWS. And I think that you see the same thing here, you know, that there are so many significant investments from making that I'm excited about. I'm going to have to constrain myself to a few. But, you know, I'm really excited about what we're doing in the prime video space. I think we're clearly on the right track there and building a significant business. That's interesting because Netflix also just announced some layoffs. Yeah. First subscriber loss in a decade, Disney cutting back on costs. Do you see?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3395,2022-10-16 03:44:46
15110," building a significant business? That's interesting because Netflix also just announced some layoffs. Yeah. First subscriber loss in a decade, Disney cutting back on costs. Do you see Amazon strategy as fundamentally different from Netflix and Disney and if so, how? Well, we're very bullish on it. And remember, all the models are a little bit different, but for Prime Video, we have 200 million plus Prime subscribers who are, you know, get that entertainment for free by being part of Prime. And so, we have a little bit different pricing model than some of the others, but I'm incredibly encouraged by what we have coming. If you look, I mean, we launched this show, Reach Your Earlier on the Year, was a huge hit. We, you know, we had the New Maisel season. We just launched the new Boys season, which is our biggest fan. Are you a Bay Boys fan? I am a big boy. Because Amazon bought. It's very good. Of course, we have, what are the rings coming up, you know, in September, in Thursday, in football. So, I'm very bullish about it. We also, you know, we're excited about what we've done with MGM. You know, I think some of the assets there will go very well with the rest of what we're doing entertainment-wise. And so, if you look at Warner Brothers' discovery in Paramount and Stars and Global, they're building really significant subscription businesses. So, I'm very bullish about that business. I'm optimistic that we have a chance to build a significant grocery business, which is, you know, early stages for us. I am excited about Kuiper, which is our low-earth orbit satellite that we're building. You've got to remember there are 300 to 400 million people in the world who have limited to no internet connectivity. I mean, just think about how different the world is when you don't have that type of connectivity. And so, I think that's a really significant opportunity that has some AWS characteristics to it. I continue to be very optimistic about Alexa. You're building the world's best personal assistant. We have a 200 million endpoints already that are using Alexa. We're clearly on to something there. And then, you know, our autonomous driving, ride-hailing service and zoos that we're building, you know, here in the Bay Area. I just think with the way auto-consumption is evolving, I think that also is a chance to be a really significant business. Now, I don't know if all of them are going to be successful, but if any one of them becomes the fourth pillar for us on top of Marketplace and Prime and AWS, we're a completely different company. And we're when AWS became successful. So, I think they're very worthwhile investments and bets and I'm optimistic about them. We didn't mention Astro, obviously, though, powered by Alexa. You mentioned Astro, yeah. But I mean, our home robot's going to be moving where I don't yet. Where is it? It's not really widely available for sale. What's the status? I hope you get one. Okay. Thank you. Everyone's very curious about Jeff's role these days. What kind of executive chair he really is. He said when he left that he'd focus his attention and energies on initiatives that he really cares about as at Amazon, but from the outside, it looks like he's really focusing on philanthropy. He's focusing on space. What kind of an executive chairmen is he? Well, Jeff is always going to be involved and he has, you know, I feel very lucky to have been in Amazon for 25 years. I feel very lucky to have worked directly for Jeff for 20 of them. And we have a really close relationship and have for a long time. And I think we share a lot of the same values about customers and how important it is to optimize for customers and how high standards they need to be, you know, given how easy it is for people to switch and the importance of invention and speed. And so, you know, I just feel very lucky to have had the chance to work so closely with them. So is your relationship, I mean, he was your only boss for 25 years, right? Is your relationship fundamentally different than it was when you were the head of New York? Yeah, of course. You know, every single job you have, the relationship is different. You know, remember, the first couple of years I worked for Jeff, I worked as what we called his shadow then, which is really like a teeth of staff. And that was different than when I was starting AWS, which was different from when we got AWS going and it was, you know, a business that was starting to do well. And it's different when I'm in the CEO role. But, you know, the constant has always been that we have a great relationship and we collaborate really well. Amazon has poised to become the biggest private sector employer in the world. Second only, right now Walmart is in that spot, but Amazon will probably soon surpass it. It's up to you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3396,2022-10-16 03:49:35
15111," here in the world. Second only, right now Walmart is in that spot, but Amazon will probably soon surpass it. First vote to unionize at an Amazon warehouse. I know you've been spending a lot of time at warehouses. When you look at someone like Chris Smalls, who I think some people look at as this modern day hero who got fired, pulled off this union vote, what's your message to someone like him? Your message to the folks who think, maybe we should join a union. Well, I think that the first thing to be clear about is that employees get to make that choice, whether they want to have a union or not. They always have had that choice, and it continues to be their choice. And we happen to think they're better off without a union for a number of reasons, including the fact that, it's much harder when you have a union to have a direct relationship with your manager and to get things done quickly. So if you see something on the line that you think could be better for your team or you, or customers, you can't just go to your manager and say, let's change this. There's a whole process in bureaucracy that you have to go through to be able to do that. And when there's a union, we're going to get the feedback filtered by what the union decides is worth bringing up. And we'd much rather hear from every employee whatever is on their mind. And so I think if you want to continue to have the structure that we've had for all this time, you have to have really competitive benefits. And then I think if you look at Amazon's, they're very unusual in this space. We championed the $15 minimum wage several years ago. The starting salary is now over $18 an hour, which is more than double the federal minimum wage. You get full health insurance and 401K and up to 20 weeks of parental leave. And if you want to get a college education, you haven't had one. We have a career choice program that lets our fulfillment center associate be able to do so. That is a very unusual and compelling set of benefits. And those were all accomplished without a union. So I think that we realize that we have to continue to work on the relationship with our employees. And we need to continue to provide the right benefits. And we need to continue to work on safety. And that's our intention. You made a huge mark on Amazon with AWS, obviously. What is the mark that you want to make? Still. No one covers the world like Bloomberg.

The FTC has revamped its antitrust inquiry into Amazon. And by some accounts is accelerating it. Are you preparing for an antitrust lawsuit from the FTC? If you are a large company that's growing to a significant extent like we have, you have to be prepared to be scrutinized. And we have known this for some time, many years. And we have tried to run the company with that in mind. And knowing that if somebody would look, that we would stand up to that scrutiny. And I think that's what we've tried to do in running the business. We can't control whether organizations bring different suits.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3397,2022-10-16 03:53:32
15112," and up to that scrutiny. And I think that's what we've tried to do in writing the business. We can't control whether organizations spring different suits against us. But I think if you look at our business, if you actually look at the fact, if you take out of the equation that there may not be the most objective leadership when it comes to Amazon in that organization, if you look at the facts in our retail business, we're about 1% of the worldwide retail market segment share. And remember, 85% of us is still offline. And if you look in our AWS business, we, you know, about, depending on you measure at 95% of the worldwide global IT spend is on premises. And then we have a cloud business and then we have a portion of that, you know, we're leading market segment share in the cloud part of this. But we operate, you know, who we compete with, AWS is really on premises, IT in addition to the cloud. So, you know, these are relatively small percentages of the entire pie. And you can kind of step through all the businesses. And I think simply because you've been successful in a few different businesses, doesn't somehow mean that you have unnatural market power. It just means you've been successful in a couple of different customer experiences. But we still have a relatively small amount of market segment share in those areas. What about the SEC or being sued by them over third party data and how you've used it? Do you think in the past Amazon made mistakes with letting employees internally see how those third party sellers were doing? Well, we have pretty good control. I mean, we, you know, we of course disagree with the premise of that. But I would say that we have very good controls with respect to the data that, that different employees sets are able to see. And by the way, I think that we can be better for sellers. You know, I think that, you know, we can have better tools from the get started. We can have better tools from the manage what they're doing across their different Amazon units. I think we can communicate better. There's a whole bunch of things we can do better. And we agonize over every single email or communication we get from sellers. And we do very regularly robust surveying. And a lot more sellers are happy with Amazon than unhappy with Amazon. And I think if you look at what they're able to do is, you know, as a business by virtue of selling on Amazon versus not, it completely changes what's possible. Sellers don't really long for e-commerce software. That exists in lots of places. And it's not very expensive. What they love about selling on Amazon is that they get access to our hundreds of millions of customers. And that completely changes what their prospects can be in terms of the businesses they're building. So we have a lot of work to do there. Like we do in a lot of other places. But I think we have a very strong partnership with sellers. What's the view of the supply chain right now and how much pain there is going to continue to be and for how long? Well, you know, I think that there's a lot of challenges in the supply chain still. I mean, it's gotten better than it was. But there are all sorts of challenges, you know, non-parasurable goods, electronics, chips that still really, you know, a significant issue for all sorts of businesses. We have worked really hard to open a lot more points of presence and ports and increase our capacity and getting products in. But I think it's going to be something that companies battle with for some time. You made a huge mark on Amazon with AWS, obviously. What is the mark that you want to make still on Amazon? I mean, in this new role, what's going to define the Andy Jassy era? Well, I don't really think of it that way, Emily. I mean, I don't think it's really about Andy Jassy era or any one person. And by the way, AWS was not about any one person. If you spend a time on AWS, that is an unbelievable team, not just an incredible leadership team, which it is, but just top to bottom. The number of inventors and people care about customers and operate something where it has to work almost like a doubt on it. It's always teams. And so I look at every single one of our businesses and take our retail business or our consumer business, which is the oldest for businesses, 85% of it still lives.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3398,2022-10-16 03:57:56
15113," single one of our businesses and you know take our retail business or our consumer business which is the oldest for our businesses 85% of it still lives offline. I think we have a lot of upside and a lot of growth and I think as much invention as we've seen the last 25 years you know the time I've been there I think it's going to look small compared to the next 25 years. There is a lot for us to invent on behalf of customers and so you know I'm excited to be part of the team that makes that happen you know we are continuing to you know to increase the amount that we give back to the communities in which we have big presence and that really matters to me I think we have a responsibility to do that and so you know it's it's a long journey that we're working on but I'm excited to be part of it and you know I hope to start it for a long time.

15114," Thank you for having me. What drives you? What drives me? Oh my God, I love the idea of... I mean, as simple as this uninclusive world, a world where people see themselves reflected, because I was supposed to be invisible by your accounts. I was supposed to not be where I am. I was supposed to have disappeared a long time ago and every turn in my life was about visibility. Yes, I will be this person who's not supposed to be here. Yes, I will fight through the hard times. Yes, I won't give up. And even though I was sort of the token black editor in the industry in the 90s, I knew even then that I needed to bring people up with me. I needed to bring other people up with me. And so that's really been a part of... Maybe it's maybe it was growing up in a family of six, I don't know. When you run a team, how do you instill that work ethic, that kind of answering emails at all time? I mean, you know, I think you see an example, if you're an editor who leaves and has lunches and it's never in the office, you don't really sort of instill faith. My team know that we're on a mission, we have to reflect the world we live in, we have to reflect the beauty of multiculturalism, we have to reflect the beauty and diversity and inclusivity. So everybody takes it really seriously and we really have intense conversations about the side guys and the world. And so I'm very lucky to have a team who are as passionate and I could call my team, I could call somebody at 6 a.m. or they can call me at 6 a.m. and I'll pick up and they'll pick up. So we have something very special that we've built over the past five years. But there were difficult moments, right? I think the first time one of your first issues, you thought that you could have been fired for it. That, right? I mean, I lived in America for a bit and I was working for W Magazine and there was talk of Brexit and of course Americans were like your country's really xenophobic. So I came back and I thought, you know, I'm going to be welcome with open arms and they're going to love me and oh my god, literally back to them by fire. But I remember thinking, you know, I wanted to create a magazine where every woman could see themselves. You know, where every woman regardless of the backgrounds, regardless of their age could just literally see themselves. And at the time, now it looks like it's the norm when you look at other magazines. But in 2017, that was, that was a radical idea. But I also remember thinking, you know, with my background, you know, I've lost so much and gained so much that I thought, if I'd lose, if I'm fired, I'd rather be fired for what I believed in. I'd rather be fired for creating a magazine that reflected the world as it was than try to sort of create a second-rate version of someone's vision. And that continues. I mean, there's this idea of always pushing forward. Yeah. Right? What's the end? How do you measure success? How do I measure success? I'm definitely not financial. I mean, I think it's more about, for me, when I'm really exhausted, when I'm really tired, when I'm really questioning if I can go on, you know, I walk on the street and I see a little girl, a little black girl who's seen the magazine and it's the norm for them or a curvy woman on a traitor Paris who's like, thank you for, you know, seeing me, you know, that makes it worth it. That for me is success. And then anybody who knows or has known me for a while will witness that that for me is success. You know, my jaw is done when that happens. Do you think, I mean, do people come up to you? They do, but it's always in a positive way. It's always thank you for seeing us, you know, but I can relate because, like I said to you know, by all accounts, I was meant to be invisible, you know. So for me, shining in light of people.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3400,2022-10-16 04:06:44
15115," But I can relate because, like as I said to you know, by all accounts, I was meant to be invisible, you know. So for me, shining in light on people and making them seen, it's natural for me. They say that the fashion industry is changing. You're changing it. Are others around you changing it? I mean now, you know, you look at other magazines and seeing real women in there, it's no longer a radical act. Seeing, you know, people of colour, women of colour on covers is no longer a radical act. So it's been normalised. And for me, I'm quite happy when I see that. You know, when you put Dame Judy Dengue on the cover, and she's 85 years old, and the world just laughed it. Nobody questioned her, you know, should she be on the cover or you put, you know, a girl with a hijab on the cover. It's not a problem. That for me shows that, you know, we're advancing, we're progressing. So you know, progress for me is very important. Which is important. And so how do you take care of your team? How do you build a team around you? My team, I mean, somebody said to me once, when you build a team, make sure you employ people, you like. People, when you see them working towards your office, you're just so excited to see. That was it. Being good at your job and sort of a connection. And being excited to see, you know, team members, because you only have to build up your team. You know, no man is an island. You know, I don't create the magazine on my own. And so it's great to have a team who you respect and who's views you respect. You know, and who respects you. How do you think you're seen by your team? Do you have to be fearful? Do you have to be? I'm a worker. I work very hard. But I think I'm pretty open. You can have conversations with me. You know, ultimately the final decision rests with me. But I do listen. I like conversation. I like interaction. And so that's, I mean, that's how I hope they think I'm a good boss. That's, you know, really all you can hope for because, you know, they work on a very good magazine. They can get other jobs anywhere. So the fact that they're there makes me think that they must be happy. Edward, how do you see the publishing world changing? So people buy less magazines. You've been, I mean, you've been doing pretty well in terms of selling more. But in five years, how does it look? I mean, I was like, you know, five years ago, I, you know, even, I mean, let's go back to ID when I was 18, you know, I inherited a magazine, you know, which would come out. I was all about club kids and you had to be out there. And the only way you could see street fashion was through ID. And then 2017, I inherited, you know, I inherited a magazine. But now I oversee a brand. You know, the magazine is so that the magazine is sort of the highest of the high, the best paper. You know, the best photographers, the best, you know, cultural messages. But at the moment, you know, when you manage a brand, it's not just about that. It's about digital. It's about video. It's about audio. It's about events. So for somebody who's so forward looking, it's so great for me. And people always ask, oh, it's a magazine instead. When we launch a cover, Instagram is our cover, essentially. So I've, you know, found a way we found a way of sort of making it work hand in hand. And it's so great for me, you know, I think how I just been doing the magazine. I probably would have been bored. So magazines aren't dead. Are they going to, you know, but they're going to work in hand with digital platforms. You know, but also I'll tell you something new readers of old young readers don't necessarily come to us through the new stands. They come through that, you know, did you sell platforms or, you know, audio videos we put out. So yes, now it's increased 10 folds. So yeah. Well, do you think that will change the kind of readership that you will quartz the either age of your readers, but also where they come from? Yes, I mean, at the moment, you know, I think the readership is getting younger because of, you know, the whole digital landscape. And I hope that it, you know, as we move forward, it kind of, yeah, we have new readers and we also keep our loyal readers, you know. Do you think there's ever a time where actually we won't have print magazines anymore? I think print will always exist. So far.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3401,2022-10-16 04:10:59
15116," We read this and we also keep our loyal readers, you know. Do you think there's ever a time where actually we won't have print magazines anymore? No, I think print will always exist, sort of a lonesight digital, but it'll probably be something more precious, sort of better paper, something more collectible that you want to keep in your house, almost like artwork. So, no, I don't think print is going to die. So, fewer copies. But more quality. More quality. You know, almost like a book. A cable book. I love that. I like that. You need to. Imagine simply climbing a cable into space. The concept is known as the space elevator. Not only could it significantly change how we leave planet Earth, but it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space. And there are scientists who think we could have already built it. We have the material, we have the technology, we have the lasers, we have the climbers, we have all of it. If a private entity wants to build it, or a government, they can build it. It'll change society. We have no clue how colonizing in the space, how really spreading out in the space, really change our society over the next 50 to 200 years. It'll be completely different. Markets are preparing to close, but the day is not over yet. It's stocked. It is now up about 45%. A lot of volatility, right? You need the power of the Bloomberg terminal to get you market moving data before anyone else. There's numbers much higher than expected. I'm upgraded today to overweight. You need top analysts to bring you exclusive global insight into cross-asset markets. The mini-bond market is a really big focus. Bitcoin ain't buying it all today. It's going to be short term. Bloomberg markets the close weekdays on Bloomberg. Everything you need to get set for the start of U.S. trading. Bloomberg, the open with Jonathan Terrell. Drilling down on the numbers and preparing you as only Bloomberg can. Weekdays on Bloomberg. You're recently on TikTok. Yes. Is that fun? I'm not so much fun. I literally have to be held back. The brilliant thing is I'm so curious. I like all the digital platforms. I really like to keep my finger on the pulse. I'm not one of those people that leaves work and shuts themselves in. I really want to be out there seeing the world as today. It's all as beauty. I'm very curious. I have a very curious mind. I'm glad. I'm glad, you know, keeps everything moving and exciting. Is that for Gen Z? Is that a commercial purpose to get closer to that? No, it's just out of curiosity. I've always been like that. I've always wanted to know what's next. I didn't want to be the one that's just being told, oh, you're 50 or whatever. I pay attention to everything. But there was such a beautiful place for me. And it goes back to my childhood again. Well, the biggest challenge to grow the brand in the next five years. We still keep it relevant. We have such great digital traffic. Almost almost six million every month to British vote. But I'm really excited about overseeing the European votes as well. Spain, Italy, Germany and France, and mentoring a whole new generation of editors. You know, when there was this whole agonization, the whole world thought there was a global view that was going to dominate. But it's very much about local conversations as well as global conversations. So I learn from these content leads. And I hope that you know they also learn. So the local global conversation, I'm very excited about moving into the future. Do you think it changes?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3402,2022-10-16 04:15:08
15117," It's, and I hope that you know they also learn. So the local global conversation, I'm very excited about moving into the future. Do you think it changes if we're in a recessionary environment? So you have such a glamorous lifestyle, or what you sell is so glamorous. Is it impacted by the cost of living or inflation of what we can live through? I mean, you know, I remember a few years ago, I put Taylor Swift on the cover, and the by-line was by-better, by-less. And it was a radical concept at the time. But now we all talk about sustainability. We know we can't keep shopping every day. We know we have to buy things that last, things that help the planet, things that we can pass on to sort of other generations. So I think that really is a conversation on the fashion industry is having right now that I find so exciting. And it's going to be sort of, you know, people are going to have less money so they have to buy things that last. And I'm really excited. And these are real changes. It's not just real changes. Real changes. It's not just conversation. It's actually happening. Do you think fashion brands always need to have a political point of view when they're great injustices? I think fashion brands can do more. I feel that having a black model in your show, or having a feed on your Instagram post, it's not enough. We need diverse voices behind the scenes. I always say that I talk to sort of all the CEOs I know we need to employ more people from, you know, from diverse backgrounds. Because that's the only way you can even reach out to more people, you know. A variety of voices always better than just one. And I always also say, you know, let's not just have interns, let's have people on all different levels. And that's what I keep talking to people about. Do they listen? Some listen. But I think since, you know, George Floyd was murdered more and more companies sort of made pledges to people of color. And, you know, it's a slow process. Some have taken it seriously and some are still working their way through it. But, you know, we have to keep on. The problem is that you can make a pledge and then follow through. Right? You know, so you have to really sort of focus and keep asking that question for people to follow through. And so do you feel like you're a guardian of, also of that, of making sure that when you get promised something, they'll do it and you'll hold them into account? I mean, yes, if they promise something, you know, that I ask for. Yeah. Then I will literally wear you down. I'll literally chase you until you keep your promise. That's just who I am. And we actually have one of the first diverse cabinets here in the UK with Liz Truss. Is that important to you? It is so important. As somebody who came from another country and was sort of welcomed by the UK, it's very important to have a diverse cabinet. That's how change happens, you know, going back to what we discussed before. That's how you understand people who are on the periphery or who've been avid. It's so important to have a diverse cabinet. But this you think in terms of policies and what they can bring to the table or just also seeing how deviate a diverse cabinet. You know, how they can have an effect on policy. I hope they can have an effect on the parties themselves, as well as policy. For me, it's about policy that makes people's lives better. I know you're also very close to Ghana still. I mean, there's a pretty scandalous anti-LGBT you'll get through. I mean, you know, it's so funny. I was invited back to Ghana a few years ago by the President. It was the year of the return. And I remember the last time we were in Ghana, we were fleeing. And I really supported the changes. I love the changes that we're going through. But yes, they do have an LGBT problem. Some friends and I signed a whole. I don't know if you saw it. And we're doing what we can to change things on the ground. I think you can't also sit in the West and tell a country what to do. So it's about sort of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3403,2022-10-16 04:19:35
15118," For it. Yeah. And we're doing what we can to change things on the ground. I think you can't also sit in the West and tell a country what to do. So it's about sort of forming alliances on the ground and seeing what is needed and how we can help, whether than standing on our soap boxes, going, do this, do that, do this. So that's through what grounds, having ground work, trying to change from with it? Yes, from with it. Yeah. And then we're going to change from within talking to heads of LGBTQ members and asking them what they need and what we can do to help. Rather than, you know, I say, do this. This is how you do it because we don't live there. You have a memoir out. Why put it down on paper? You know something about when you turn 50. What? You know something about when it's your fifth year at Vogue, you know, I got married this year. You know, I'm normally not someone who looks back all the time, but it felt like the right time for me to do that. And also, you know, I just felt that a lot of young people sort of see people like you and I and they think, you know, we just got here. We were always here and for me was really important to share the story of a journey about, you know, successors and, and you know, failures. And, you know, that's the reason why I got here. So I just wanted to share that story with them sort of young people. As well as people who, you know, feel like they're on the outskirts of, you know, the outside of the industry, really. Do you feel like an outsider? I think I always feel like an outsider, but as I said before, you know, I grew up African in an African household in England, you know, different languages, different foods. And I now go to school and I've been in England. So I've always been about duality. I've always seen myself as an outsider, but I was also an insider. And even when, you know, I took the job at British folk, I was the black gay working class outsider, but, you know, I've been in the industry since I was 18. So I was, in essence, an insider. So that's really, it's about the duality that plays out in my life. Well, who do you think made you the person you are today? I know you left home twice, right, Ghana, but also you had to leave your home. Yes. I mean, the person made me who I mean, really is my mother. I mean, I mean, I loved my mother. She taught me about sort of beauty. She taught me about clothes, about fascism. She also taught me that beauty came in all forms that, you know, women were beautiful, no matter what shape they were, no matter what color, what religion. And so that really stayed with me. And I guess that my creativity comes from her. And of course, I also had a military father. So the idea of precision and organization and sort of thinking ahead also comes from here to the best of both worlds. How did your father, I know you had a difficult relation with your father, how did your father shape the person you are today? So I finally should ask this question because I never thought I was like my father growing up. You know, I was very shy, very sensitive, you know, a little spacey. I prefer the company of women. To men, my dad was sort of, you know, a sort of, I thought we were there in disciplinarian. You know, you had to, you know, be home at a certain time. You know, he roared with an iron fist. And I thought, you know, I'm never going to be like him. You know, he kicked me out of the house, you know, when I was 18. And, but I found out that over the years, when it comes to work and discipline and sort of organization, that is him to a T.

Believe me? for about three weeks and in the dark room. And it was very harrowing. It's very harrowing time in my life. But I always say, you know, you don't have to have vision to have vision. So in those dark rooms, my imagination was even bigger. I dream bigger. And I came out to sort of the last surgery and the cover I did was for W Magazine with Rihanna, after Queen, with a golden eye. And all right, look back at it. They have the other, oh my god, there are the eyes, I'm liminally. So yes, it was very challenging. And even to this day, you know, I go for checkups to make sure my eyes are okay. And they're great right now. And you know, the more I look after myself, the better. The better I'll care. But it's amazing, you power through adversity. Do you ever think actually, this is too much? Have you ever thought this is too much? I mean, there have been times when I felt this is too much, but it's not in my vocabulary to start. It's not in my DNA to start. You know, I am my mother's son, my father's son, you know, the edge to move forward is always there. And that's why, you know, when I was young, I would always get up and work. I had a reticent attachment. I still got on a plane to go shoot the Hollywood bookfolio. But now I'm learning to say no. Now I'm learning I can't do that job. I can't fly. No. It takes time, but it comes with age. It takes courage to say no, right? Definitely. So when you look at all your covers and there's so many beautiful ones, is there one that's special to you? Well, I say to someone, they're like my children. I'm always having a favorite child. But I'm especially proud of the covers we did in lockdown, you know, when the world had essentially shut down, you know, the teams were sort of scattered all around London. And I had to go back to the days of I did when, you know, you had to really create user imagination. And we had a series of four covers, Judy Dant, when they said, you know, anybody over 60, she stayed at home, the essential workers cover, a cover of landscapes, just so people could take a breather. And the activists cover when George Floyd was murdered. And I really think we create covers that, you know, in years time, people can look back and see what the time, that period was like for me, an artist always has to reflect their times, to paraphrase Nina Simone, and that's really important for me. I mean, there was a bit of controversy with Linda van Gelista. Yes. Yes, I mean, you know, there was a, there was a complaint that, oh, you know, she should, she should have looked a certain way, you know. And for me, I've not lived in the 90s. I've known this incredible icon who really defines.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3405,2022-10-16 04:28:18
15120," She should have looked a certain way, you know. And for me, I've known Linda in the 90s. I've known this incredible icon who really defined what a model should be. And I also saw my friend go through really dark days, you know, due to the complications for surgery. Literally disappear from the world. Really not the Linda the world means. So when we were doing this cover, it was the collaboration. She wanted to be that Linda that everybody knew. She wanted to feel good about herself again. And I wasn't going to deny her that act. And also, you know, whatever I would like to say, whatever a woman wants to do with her body, it's up to her. So, you know, I'm very proud of Linda and I'm very proud of that cover. And I mean, sometimes you're almost like an activist. Is that how you're like a fashion activist or a political fashion? But I'm definitely a creative, but you know, I've always believed, you know, look at my life story in my book, you know. I wasn't like I kept saying I wasn't supposed to be here. You know, had my dad not left, I don't know even what would have happened to my family. So even when we ended up in a room, two rooms in a voxel, six of us, we were so happy to be there, penniless, but so happy to be there. So, you know, every day, I just, you know, I'm an optimist and I know it's not the most fashionable thing, but that's why I'm sitting here with you today. Bye. Edward, thank you so much for your time today. Thank you. Oh. So as you look back on your career, what would you say is the best investment advice you've ever received? Probably the best investment advice that I never received, but that I've lived my whole life around, is surround yourself with really good people. I thought about it just today. Like I do many times, you know, what makes a great investor? A great investment firm is comprised of people who are optimists and pessimists and realists, because in the intersection of the debates that go across that wide range of personalities is where you find truth. It's part of the reason I'm so focused on freedom of expression. I see it my own four walls, the robust and fulsome debates around how we commit our capital, what defines a good idea, what businesses to build or pursue. That's what drives the success at Citadel. And I've been very fortunate in life to have always had a group of friends who really push me, who make me better. And here I get to work with three and a half thousand colleagues who in their ways make me better each and every day and collectively as a team, we've had the opportunity to have an incredible impact on the financial landscape around the world. We make it very transparent to the shopper before they accept an order, what the order is going to look like, how much work on a paysam and how much like the consumer is paying them. And so they can decide whether they take an order or whether they refuse it. And that's the kind of flexibility that our shoppers really value and the kind of transparency that they want. Are you seeing a labor shortage right now? And what are you doing to combat that? It's different in different places. All demographic of shoppers is completely different from food delivery and our right sharing, where 70% women and half of them are moms. And that's because a lot of the job at Instacart is very different than just being in a car with strangers. It's about like going to the store, doing a good job of customer service of really picking the right products for the consumer. And we are seeing that being very appealing to women. Before the COVID pandemic upended the way the world does business, logistics was one of those industries that might have been taken for granted. That's not the case anymore. Due to all the turbulences of the last two years, customers are now realizing how important it is to have a reliable logistics partner on their side. Our people are doing business.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3406,2022-10-16 04:32:35
15121," to have a reliable logistics partner on their side. Our people are doing a quite complex job. People think, oh, they just delivered passes somewhere. That's an easy thing. If you think about what our people are doing, it's quite complex. Businesses and consumers are suddenly thinking a lot more about how things they need reach places where they're needed. It's thrust the sector into the spotlight. Logistics and supply chain has become a household need. It's dramatically different than pre-pandemic. Yes, it's grown, whether that's in market power. Revenue, profitability, investor interest. For Deutsche Post DHL Group, that's created opportunity to build on momentum and set ambitious goals for service and performance. When you look at our footprint, we're the most international logistics company there is. We want to become more digital and we want to be much more sustainable than we have been. DP DHL's revenue has soared since 2020 with full-year profit nearly doubling in 2021. CFO Melanie Christ is a key leader of the team that's delivered these results. She views her role as much more than just a number cruncher. There are unfortunately these clichÃ©s that finance is boring and it's been counting in the back office to be successful in finance. You have to have the financial expertise, right? But we also have to be credible business leaders in order to really impact the business and steer the direction. She is extremely smart and bright. We need somebody who is able to digest a lot of information that rapidly and can distinguish what is important and what is less important. She has tremendous skill in that. And she's not afraid to call people out, to call out other members of the executive team if she feels that something isn't being. She does that in a very nice way, actually. She helps me tremendously in steering of a company because she is highly regarded by my other colleagues in the senior team. And typically if they have a problem they share first with her before they come to me. When I think about the conversations I have with Frank, the shortest part is actually about the analysis and the facts. It's more the debate about, okay, on that basis, what are the options? What can we do? My role is essentially saying in three sentences, what is working well in this company, where do we have challenges and what should we do going forward? Deutsche Post DHL Group consists of five divisions. Express Germany's Post and Parcel Service, global forwarding and freight, supply chain and e-commerce solutions. Each of these segments has seen revenue growth in the last four years, while the surge of e-commerce volume during the pandemic has had a direct impact on the trajectory. Have you seen e-commerce as a very structural and fundamental growth driver for us as a company? What we now saw under the pandemic was a structural acceleration. It took us forward to a point in terms of e-compensation, which we probably would have reached on the normal circumstances in three years' time. So it was a big step forward. DP DHL was well prepared to take this step. The company's strategic plan recognized e-commerce as a growing trend in the logistics landscape, but no one could have forecast the speed and breadth of the transformation. We are now seeing that also another pandemic, not only domestic e-commerce has taken a faster growth trajectories and anticipated, but also cross-border e-commerce. We see that very clearly in our express network, but also in our e-commerce solutions division. What are the other big structural shifts that you see on the horizon? Is it e-commerce B2B? Is it increased trade as globalisation restructures? What are the shifts that you're seeing? The board B2B e-commerce is still at a very early stage, so we believe that there will be a huge cause opportunity there. We also see that when we are talking to our customers now, I guess everybody has been now realised that being dependent on just one supplier in one province in one country is probably not a good idea. So they want to build more resilience into the supply chain. I think our international footprint, our gl-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3407,2022-10-16 04:36:57
15122," Liar in one province in one country is probably not a good idea. So they want to build more resilience into the supply chain. I think our international footprint, our global strengths, is really something we can leverage for the benefit of our customers. Another factor in the company's favour is its balance sheet. Since Melanie Christ became CFO, cash flow has improved significantly. One of my priorities over the last years has been to really focus the whole organisation on better cash generation. It's not just a finance job, making sure that ultimately revenue converts into EBIT and into cash in the bank account, it's the responsibility of the whole organisation. She says, we can't be successful as a company. If we are not collecting the cash for our services, we have provided. And she has not missed one single opportunity to talk about that. I think it's a very comfortable situation, particularly in the current environment, to have a strong balance sheet. I think in that respect, I'm very conservative and I'd rather have a bit more on the balance sheet and a bit more buffer. Spell out for us what the priorities are, the longer-term priorities, in terms of putting some of that cash to use for you. The first priority here is organic growth. We clearly indicated also this our CAPEX budget, 12 billion for the next three years, that we will keep investing into organic growth. We are very focused on our regular dividend payment. And then, if there is something left, which is, fortunately, the case at the moment, we will think about inorganic opportunities, and we will also think about other means to allow our shareholders to participate. That is why we are currently running a 2 billion euro share-bite programme. Inorganic opportunities include M&A, like the recent purchase of beverage shipper, Hila Brand. But deploying cash is always subject to careful consideration. Does Melanie ever turn around and say, no, when you're pushing through or pushing for a particular package of spending? Yes, she does that quite often, because she has... She is a person and that's great if you have a CEO who is risk-abuse, because you need somebody. The business is always too optimistic. Melanie might be something too pessimistic, but that's a very healthy discussion. And if we then jointly come to the same conclusion after a debate, then we are probably in the right spot. How often do you find yourself saying no to divisional heads? So when I was promoted into the CFO position, my team gave me a stamp with rejected. It sits on my desk. I think the fact that people know it sits there, already has instilled quite a lot of discipline in the organisation. So I think when I get a proposal, it has already gone through a number of iterations and is normally of such a high quality that I don't need the rejected stamp too often. For the time being, Christ should be able to keep that stamp in a drawer. CEO Frank Appell has expressed a commitment to service quality and confidence that customers will accept higher prices that come with it. If you are too expensive, you will be out of business, but if you don't provide the right quality, you will be out of business as well. So we want to be, we will never be the cheapest in town. That's not doable. We are the premium provider. That's our strategy. Of course, it's also more challenging for us when our customers are under pressure. At the same time, I think, over all the last two years have shown that a reliable high quality supply chain comes at a certain price tag. I definitely see that inflation is having a huge impact on the logistics industry. And there's been substantial price increases in the last few years. I do not see that changing. There's a lot of innovation happening. And I don't see the inflation necessarily going away. It might level out a bit, but it's not going to go away. The logistics companies may have pricing power with customers, but their stock prices haven't been so robust. I think that the issue there is the increase in interest rates has made everyone rethink and be concerned about the level of inventory that is out in the system, if you will, and with the level of disruption. I think what's happening more.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3408,2022-10-16 04:41:22
15123," It's not about the level of inventory that is out, you know, in the system, if you will, and with the level of disruption. I think what's happened more in the last, that this pre-months, is the more of a view that we're actually heading into. Certainly, an economic slowdown may be a recession. With more than half its revenue coming from Europe, investors may see DP DHL as more exposed to recession risks than its global peers. The company insists it can meet its revenue targets in the event of a downturn. It's counting on diversification as a cushion. I'm not so pessimistic that there is really a deep recession at our doorstep. But even then, our portfolio is very much balanced. We are everywhere in the world, but not going entirely in a recession. Would it be a stretch to suggest that DP DHL is, to some extent, recession proof? I wouldn't go as far as to say recession proof, but I think we are very well positioned to deal with all different types of recession scenarios due to the breadth of the portfolio. The balance of the portfolio really gives us a lot of resilience against any type of headwind. Coming up, a look at DP DHL's investments in action. Melanie Christ shows me around the company's state-of-the-art logistics hub. What I love about this building is it actually shows the big mega trends which fund our strategy 2025. This is Bloomberg.

As the chief financial officer of one of the world's largest logistics companies, Melanie Christ has made her mark in global business. That's not what she originally attempted to do. I really wanted to go into research. I wanted to become a physicist and that was where my passion was. But then during my studies, some friends of mine started doing this strange thing. They went into management consulting. I didn't even know how to spell it. I had no idea what it was about. But what they told me was quite interesting. I ended up doing an internship with a consulting firm. I learned more in the two months there than I had in the last two years in my physics job at university. That is how I ended up in consulting. She started her career with three years at McKinsey, then spent four years in private equity with APAC's partners in London. Before joining, Deutsche Post DHL Group in 2004. I was brought into the company to do international M&A project. That was at the time around 20 years ago when we were really building the company in the current shape, acquiring lots of logistics companies around the world. The M&A part was the first thing. I then wandered into a more mainstream finance field here in the group, becoming the CFO of our digital express division. So from then on, it was more leading towards the CFO role eventually. Malenny Christ now heads the finance team with around 11,000 employees. Success in this role is as much an art as a science. If you do the greatest piece of analysis and you see it all and you know it all, but you can't convey that message and you can't convince the rest of the organisation that we should move into a certain direction, it's useless. DP DHL is sending a consistent message with its investments. The company spent 123 million euros to upgrade its logistics centre at the Cologne-Born Airport, designing it around key strategic goals. What I love about this building is it actually shows the big mega trends which formed our strategy 2025, which was inaugurated in 2019 when this building opened. So globalisation connecting the roads.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3409,2022-10-16 04:45:31
15124," The team wins this building opened. So, globalization, connecting the world. E-commerce, we have a lot of sortation facilities here for smaller e-commerce shipments. Sustainability, it's a very sustainable building, there's solar panels on the roof and everything, and digitalization, and well, you can obviously see that it is quite automated. How did the team pitch this investment to you initially? And how hard was it as a sell for them? How quickly did you turn around and say, yes, this is worth the 123 million euros? Of course, you always have to make sure that you have the right capacity for the growth in the network. And at that time, they came and said, hey, we will really see a strong growth in e-commerce volumes on top of the regular B2B growth. We need more sorting capacity, we need this building. And of course, there are always debates, does it really have to cost 123 million euros and so on? But fortunately, they convinced us, because then with COVID and the volume search, we urgently need a capacity. At the same time as COVID accelerated demand for logistics services, disruptions in the labor supply hurt productivity. Advances and technology like this digital sauter have helped offset some pressures, but automation also raises questions. Does this tell us that this is the business grows? This is going to become a more automated business, that it's going to be less need for labor for workers. Well, you still see people here, and I think what you can nicely witness here is the combination of technology which supports people. So for example, when you look at the customs area, it used to be a very manual and sometimes confusing process. Now the people are supported in picking the right shipments for customs inspections by lights and they are automatically sorted in this sauter to go to customs inspections. So it is also helping the people with the jobs they're doing here every day. We've been working on the service for over 20 years. We might get one-third less jobs in the current setup until 2030, if we digitalize the organization, but we are very sure that our company will be at least 50, maybe 100% bigger and we will have more jobs to offer than that. At the beginning of a couple of years ago when we started that journey, people said, oh, I might lose my job. I haven't heard that in the last two years as a question in any tone hall. This airport hub also showcases DP DHL's aviation fleet which both small than 320 dedicated cargo aircraft. The biggest chunk of our aircraft, but we also have short and medium and long term leases and with the growth in our business, we anticipate that the people keep going. You've talked about investing, of course, in sustainable fuel. Yes. When does that come online? How significant is it? Is it just the critics might say that's just window dressing around a part of the business that is, of course, very carbon intensive? At least a lot of emissions. Yes. So you absolutely write the problem with our beautiful aircraft is the CO2 emissions. And when you look at our overall CO2 emissions, two-thirds are from aviation. It is about flying these birds with more sustainable fuel. And we said that we're really willing to spend billions on it. We now really hope that we will see the uptick in supply over the next years. Spending billions isn't vague hyperbole. The company has pledged to put seven billion euros towards sustainable technologies and fuels by 2030 with a goal of climate neutral logistics by 2050. Sustainability makes good business sense anyway, especially if you are in a business that is energy or fuel hungry as a compliance element that not just operators in the logistics sector need to consider but also their customers. So being transparent becomes part of the service about their impact on the globe. We had a lengthy discussion. Should we make a financial commitment? How much we want to invest for the next decade in our sustainability? We had a long debate, is it right, to say we want to invest seven billion to 2030. There were pros and cons. But that was a very intense discussion melody in I-hat where we finally came to the conclusion that this is a right number. This is a right approach. We convinced our colleague and that's the reason why we are where we are seen as somebody who really commit. They're not that many companies who have quantified their future investment.

Still ahead, how one of the business world's most influential women is working to strengthen gender equality within her company. I think the great thing is that now across the board, in finance, but also in the group overall, we have role models which show young female talent that everything is possible. This is Bloomberg. This is Bloomberg Daybreak, but links are on Bloomberg. Welcome to Deadbreak Australia. This is Bloomberg Technology. Welcome to Bloomberg Crypto. Back in 1997, I was interested in the following question, which is there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called Saurapod dinosaurs, which had really long skinny necks. So, Apatosaurus is an example. Now, I said really long skinny tails. So, I made a computer model that showed that in fact, the tail of these Saurapod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip, a bullfip. Now, the way a bullfip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. And that crack is a sonic boom. I think the way they got a date was to impress the females by making loud booms. You will put a woman on Mars. You will bring forth global cooling. You will be the first chief crypto officer. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge, and inspiration to feed your ambition. So, before you invent pioneer, disrupt. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. Deutsche Post DHL Group's CFO Melanie Christ is often named to lists of the most powerful women in business. And while men still outnumber women as finance heads of large companies, there are signs that the balance is shifting. The number of female CFOs across major US companies has risen to an all-time high, according to a study by Chris Colder Associates. And executive search firm Cohen Partners reports that 36% of new CFOs hired by notable companies in the first half of 2022 were women. I asked Melanie Christ if she's encountered obstacles as a woman rising through the executive ranks. I have to say, I have not made many negative experiences. Maybe I was also a little bit in the even-not-thinking about these challenges so much. So, I mean, when I studied physics, there weren't many women, so I was somehow always used to it. And it can also be an advantage when you're kind of like the only girl in the room. I mean, the boss at the end remembers your name and not the 19 guys who all kind of like were at oxywoods and white shirts and look alike. So, I never experienced it as an external stress factor. I have to say for me personally, it was more balancing my own expectations around kind of like getting family and the job combined. But that was probably more of a pressure I put on myself, thinking that I had to be perfect in every dimension and not something where the pressure was put on me from my male colleagues. Hmm.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3411,2022-10-16 04:54:02
15126," That was probably more of a pressure I put on myself, thinking that I had to be perfect in every dimension, and not something where the pressure was put on me from my male colleagues. So how do you take that experience and put it to play in terms of how you advance the role of women in this organisation? I think the great thing is that now across the board, in finance, but also in the group overall, we have role models which show young female talent that everything is possible. In finance, we have a share of women in management of 32%, so we are ahead of the group. We want to get to 35% by 2025. I think we are now at a position where if we have a vacancy, I want to have at least one woman on the shortlist, because we have enough female talent, so every shortlist should contain a woman, and then the best person in the race should win. CEO Frank Appell says Christ sets an example for the entire organisation, and he believes her success may influence the entire industry. She has proven that she is an outstanding CEO for all, and she is definitely a role model in many dimensions that you know, what I like about there, she is still you know, a very warm and nice person, and that makes such a big difference. So you can get to that level without compromising on how nice you are as a person. I think she is a great role model, and I hope that this has had positive impact for many of us. From the big picture down to the smallest operational details, Melanie Christ is fully engaged in guiding DP DHL into the future. I wanted to know what she sees when she looks ahead. What juice is the biggest opportunities for DP DHL over the next 10 years? I think we have a fantastic portfolio, and we just have to leverage the growth opportunities, which are there both on the ECOM side and also on the traditional B2B side. And the key differentiators for us will be digitalisation, sustainability, and our great people. As you look ahead 10 years, what are some of the challenges, what keeps you up at night as you think about the business going forward? I think we have to keep this focus and the ability to adjust in a very agile way. Sometimes when you kind of like think about all the risk of the risk of the loss, like think about all the risk controlling and stuff, people tend to create the impression that you can pre-plan everything. That's clearly not the case. So I think we have to stay focused and keep the ability to react in a very agile way. But looking at what happened over the last 24 months, I'm very optimistic that we will also be able to cope with whatever happens next. And how do you see your role changing in the years ahead? It is changing at a very rapid pace, which is a great thing because it never gets boring. Those elements I just mentioned for the group, overall, digitalisation and sustainability are also hugely relevant for the finance role. It's like a new language you have to learn. And you learn the vocabulary, but then you also have to develop a feeling if I kind of like put so much capital into this decarbonisation measure, I get so much in terms of return out of it. But that's a fascinating opportunity where we can make a huge difference for finance and for the group overall. As you look to the future, Melanie, what do you think is going to be the skill sets, the knowledge bases, they're going to be essential to the success of future CFOs? Yes, probably the two most essential new skills will be to get even better at lifelong learning because we will have to learn so much new stuff every year. Be it in the digitalisation area, be it on sustainability. So this ability also has a 50-year plus old person to keep learning and keep the curiosity. I think that is going to be super essential. And the second element will be being a great team player. The word is complex, you can't know it all. So you really have to work even more strongly with your team. What advice would you give to someone who's just recently been appointed CFO? That's a great question. I think I would probably simply say, be curious and ask as many questions as you can. Try to learn as much as possible, not only in the finance area, but get close to the business. Try to really understand the business because only when you are close to the business and you understand.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3412,2022-10-16 04:58:44
15127," possible, not only in the finance area, but get close to the business, try to really understand the business, because only when you are close to the business and you understand the fundamental profit drivers will be a really great CFO. I'm Tom McKenzie. This is Bloomberg. You're one of the most fascinating entrepreneurs because you also started with the young. What did you learn? Did you always think that you'd be an entrepreneur? Probably, yes. I think, which is a bit sad. From age what? Five? It is. I'm not sure. I come from a family of entrepreneurs, so even I probably can spell the word and still can't decadent. It's sort of in my blood, but it's, it's, it's, it's really fun starting a business. It's, and fun growing a business. I feel it's a real privilege. And I started my business officially at 18, but I think I knew I wanted to do it very differently from about 15. But I'm sure it's, you know, you, if you're surrounded by it, it feels very natural. So, so yes, it's, it's fun. And it started how you started by making, you want to Florence. It was an Italy and you started handbags. Yeah, so I, I knew I was actually given a handbag by my mother when I was about 61 of her old handbags. And I remember how it made me feel. And I think fashion is fascinating for the mood changing, the confidence boosting aspects. There's a tribal aspects of what fashion does. And so I went at 18 to Florence knowing that was the home of, of, of Lebhagus, which is what interested me. I just wanted to learn actually and be surrounded by craftsmen who are making things as important. And that's going to be very interesting, I think, over the next sort of 10 years. I think the on-shoring of craft and manufacturing is going to be fascinating. Actually, I mean, I watched the off-shoring, I literally saw it. And I think we're going to be seeing that coming back to local. We have to, when we're looking at objectives in terms of carp and, you know, proximity is going to be key. Big, expensive cities have a lot going for them. But if you live in one, you probably noticed that these big, expensive cities keep getting more, well, expensive. You could always move away. You might have just started working remotely, so there's really nothing keeping you there. But then again, moving is a hassle. Well, what if someone cade you 10 grand to do it? What if they threw in free office space, a bicycle, or a gym membership? Programs and cities and states around the US are doing exactly that. And they're getting a lot of interest. We had over 50,000 applications. About 90,000 applications. We had over 1800 applicants from all over North America. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them? Or are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns for places looking for an injection of fresh talent? So before you invent, pioneer, disrupt. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. So in real life, you're the CEO of Roblox, but on Roblox, you're Builder Man. You know that name? We just thought it up when it was maybe two weeks after we launched, and we were all picking our own user names. And everyone picked one. I just said, Bill, they're man. So you've had the same avatar since 2004. That's right. That's awesome. Do you still play? I do. I wish I could play the whole day. I have to be a CEO. So how often do you play? I'm probably on every day, but not as much as I would like. I have four kids. I have a nine-year-old son who's on Roblox. A lot. He said, his favorite games are the tycoon games? Oh, lumber tycoon theme park tycoon. I love those. I love all of those. I have a bit of a theory. I have four kids. Oh, you do? Yeah, they're now, they've grown up watching me do this.

15128," I love all of those. I have a bit of a theory. I have four kids. Oh, you do? Yeah, they're now in. They've grown up watching me do this. Yeah, another they're pretty savvy social media people, but I'm optimistic someday They're gonna be using robots for some other reason like communicating or more working or something like that And then they're gonna be like gosh as like forced to be on Roblox. It's a portmanteau of robots and blocks where users can build and play games in a 3d world Roblox has boomed into a global online gaming juggernaut that kids are obsessed with to the tune of 10 billion plus hours a quarter In fact, Roblox was building the metaverse long before Mark Zuckerberg claimed a new name for Facebook But what does the future metaverse really look like and how do we cultivate a civil digital society within it that keeps kids safe? Joining me now on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0 Roblox CEO and co-founder David Bozuki David's so great to have you here. I really appreciate it. It's wonderful to be with you Well, I'm a parent. I'm a mom and so I'm been really excited To have this conversation for parents and anyone out there who still doesn't quite understand What exactly are kids doing on Roblox? Yeah Kids on Roblox aren't just playing. They're learning. They're hanging out together When they can't be together in real life. They're hanging out on Roblox. They could be playing hide and go seek They could be pretending they're running a store or a pizza parlor They could be making the next big game or adventure So it's really a wide range of things and it involves doing things together pretending you're together So right now it's mostly Games or experiences for kids by kids. How old are these players? How old are these developers? We have young players who are getting interested in coding who are getting interested in designing things But more and more of the community on Roblox has blossomed into this super rich ecosystem Thousands of developers making a living on the platform some of these developers are making tens or 20s or 50 millions of dollars a year So how many of these developers are really kids and how many of these developers are now grown-ups? Yeah, well think two million plus developers a lot of them are grown-ups and more and more In addition to the natural organic people that started on Roblox We're starting to have studios come in on the platform as well Professional game developers who are developing on other platforms starting to take a look at it So our developer demo naturally leans a little bit older although we've had kids as young as 13 Is there something about preserving the ability for young kids to be able to make games for other kids? I mean because obviously if you have you know fancy studios muscling in um Does that change the dynamic of the platform? I think it does one of my favorite experiences is natural disasters It's been on the platform forever By one of our early developers. It's not the kind of thing that I think a normal studio whatever think of But when developed by a young creator You know, we're gonna be we're gonna be hanging out together and there's gonna be a hurricane and we got to like run away from it Or there's gonna be a lightning storm like that kind of stuff We see a lot of that creative gameplay coming from the younger developers. What were you into as a kid? Were you a gamer? I was kind of a nerd when I was a kid. I was studied really hard I luckily grew up in Eden Prairie, Minnesota at the time. It was out in the boonies from Minneapolis Minnesotas there were sand pits and so we did a lot of model rockets and we built go carts and we you know It's kind of one of these idyllic childhoods The one key thing that happened to me very early on is we had a computer lab in the school And then my parents bought me an apple two at the time and that kind of got me interested in this I also heard you were the captain of your high school TV quiz team Yeah, so think of think of Minnesota in the 1970s and 80s where every weekend And two different schools compete for students from each school, you know, in a really funny four by four",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3414,2022-10-16 05:07:28
15129," Vendees in 80s where every weekend two different schools compete for students from each school. You know, in a really funny four by four configuration on a quiz bowl thing. And so yeah, Eden Perry had a pretty good quiz bowl team. You eventually made it to Silicon Valley, you went to Stanford. You started a company called Knowledge Revolution in the 80s where users could create and test physics experiments. That's right. So the science kid and you coming to life. Yeah, you know, went to school, had a couple hard years with jobs that weren't really that exciting. Took a few months off and I got really excited about there's this whole blossoming educational software marketplace. The Macintosh had just been introduced and it was just really interesting and exciting. I did a survey of all of that and a lot of the educational software was very pre-canned. So when we looked at physics it was a whole different idea. Could we make a wide open laboratory where you could build anything. Any physics experiment, bring it to life, measure it, see what it feels like. You sold that company, made some money, became an investor and you invested in Friendster. Oh yeah, wow. I had a Friendster account. I'm dating myself a little bit here, but I had a Friendster account. I'm curious what you learned from the early days of social media. Yeah, so one thing I learned is it was really fun to invest, but it's not my sweet spot. Like my sweet spot is trying to build and create things. I remember I think having account number 79 on Friendster and just seeing that wonderful thing of finding other people, friend of friend, playing around with that early user interface. It's a little bit almost thinking of interactive physics where we were simulating the world and then friends, they're seeing how important social is. Those are a couple of the components that have come together in Roblox. So when you started Roblox in 2004, what was the idea back then? The feeling of this new category, for me, started feeling almost inexorable. It's a category that people have been talking about in sci-fi for many, many years. We've seen futurists talk about it. We've seen a lot of movies. We were thinking, yes, immersive 3D co-experience. Kids flocked to Roblox during the pandemic. We went public in the middle of the pandemic. 2021, 45 billion dollar market cap. We spoke on that day. Even you have said that kind of growth won't keep up. What kind of growth can we expect from Roblox in normal times? We believe it's going to be a part of all of our lives. It's going to be the way we communicate how people get to go to school and they can't get into school. So they're going to go to school in Roblox? If I happen to be taking my science class and I can't get into the classroom and we're dissecting a frog, we'll probably dissect a frog in something like Roblox on a simulation, which I think is going to be very, very powerful. And for our company where there's a lot of people that are going to end up working all around the world, some of us will be in the office, some won't. Having a common 3D place where we can have those water cooler conversations where everyone has a desk, but we get that serendipitous thing where we both happen to go over and chat. I think also is going to be very big. Your goal is to build an entirely new category of human co-experience. How do you moderate that on such a massive scale? The company is now getting hundreds, maybe even thousands of applications. So software has come in to automate the process. You want to write your resume for Roblox, not for humans. The only job your resume has is to be comprehensible to the software that is reading it, because that software or robot is going to decide whether or not a human ever gets their eyes on it. These things are programmed by us.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3415,2022-10-16 05:11:42
15130," Comprehensible to the software that is reading it because that software or robot is going to decide whether or not a human ever gets their eyes on it. These things are programmed by a certain segment of the population that might not be totally inclusive or not be fully aware. Concerns about how this technology could exacerbate discrimination. For the FTC, I think foremost, the FTC needs to be making sure that we're fully understanding this technology. We don't trust companies to self-regulate when it comes to pollution. We don't trust them to self-regulate when it comes to workplace comp. Why on earth would we trust them to self-regulate AI? Everybody is talking about the metaverse as something that's going to happen in the future. But there's an argument to be made that Roblox has already built a metaverse. What do you think? I think we've started. It goes back to how exciting it is to have a company in this space that I think has ultimately got so many years of growth to it and is a new category following other types of technologies. There's still so much innovation to be done and there's so much invention to be done in this category that it's mind-boggling. The critics think that metaverse, the term, is just marketing. How do you respond to that? This type of technology is much more difficult than the net or the web, which was another huge thing that we saw predicted and has started to come. I think we're seeing early signs of it. When Mark Zuckerberg announced his plan to own the metaverse and change Facebook's name to meta as if it was something new, did that kind of bother you? No, of course not. It's really hard to predict in five to ten or twenty years. What are the companies that really figured out? There's so many elements of innovation that are needed. Having a UGC community, one of our strengths. We think that's like a huge starting point for us, but we're early in our quest for innovation here. Roblox has built a huge business selling, Robux. Does this evolve into a much bigger marketplace? It was this revelation that people would ultimately make a living on platforms like this that started this digital currency. It's very Roblox-centric in that we're a systems company or utility. It has formed this robust economy. It's allowed us to keep Roblox free for the vast majority. What Roblox ever partner with some of these other companies working on the metaverse, whether it is meta or unity or epic or Microsoft? The core technology of how are we going to ultimately support 50,000 people in real time on a phone, going to a concert together and waving at your friends? I think that's going to be a lot of engineering work that each company is going to be working on and it's going to be really hard. As far as ultimately can an avatar go from one place to another? I think there'll be lightweight ways of starting to think about that. So what role do you think Apple and Android should play in the metaverse? Would their policies need to change to really support this vision? The biggest thing we would take advantage of if it were to happen is a change in those store fees. We stay out of it. We let Google and Apple kind of run their businesses. But when we think about more and more developers making a living on platforms like us and having to build stuff. If those store fees were to change, we would move most of that money back to our developers. Your goal is to build an entirely new category of human co-experience. The next phase of human interaction. How do you moderate that on such a massive scale? Are you doing a good enough job? In the third week when we were live, you can go imagine Eric and myself back in our small office. Eric and I said, oh my gosh, safety and civilities. We're going to have to do it. We had maybe 100 people at the time chatting on Roblox. We saw a few not that egregious but early signs and we just made the call. This is going to be the foundation of what we do in the early years of Roblox. As we've gotten bigger, we've gotten to the point where there's thousands of moderators, every image that goes on our platform gets human.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3416,2022-10-16 05:16:01
15131," Early years of Roblox, as we've gotten bigger, we've gotten to the point where there's thousands of moderators, every image that goes on our platform gets human reviewed. We filter texts very stringently, especially for 13 and under players. We use a lot of AI and ML to help do this. We're always getting better, but it is a key thing for us. How optimistic are you about AI and tech being able to do that? I'm really actually optimistic. We would never compare to the real world because our standards are so much more stringent, but I do believe this will just keep getting better and better. I think over time it will get to the point where if a six-year-old is on our platform, it's literally as if the parents wanted to be there with them watching everything will be able to offer that type of thing. Now a lot of parents are terrified. They're terrified of a future metaverse. They don't understand the parental controls. Do you understand that feeling? We do. We actually have to, I think it creates a higher standard for us because I think we can't assume every parent is going to get that involved with their kids. There have been some serious content challenges, you know, stories about Roblox being a playground for virtual fascists. There was just this story about Kim Kardashian's own child seeing an ad for a game that claimed to have a sex tape of her. What happened there? That was very unfortunate. There was a text blurb at very shortly that very, very few people saw. We took the place down. We moderated that user and they're off our platform. It was not the video was never on our platform. There was no imagery on our platform. It was a very short mention. But very unfortunate. And well, you know, our vision is to be the most civil place for everyone. I asked in Derpachai the CEO of Alphabet and Google this question about kids and tech habits and screen time. And he said it's something that even stresses him out. You know, this is the guy who runs one of the most powerful technology companies in the world. I have four kids. You have four kids. Did it stress you out? Like how did you deal with your kids? I think it highlights how much it's a responsibility of both platforms like us as well as parents. You know, we're all trying to figure this out. I think the one thing that we're very encouraged is that the time spent on Roblox tends to be more like hanging out together, or being on the phone together, or doing stuff together. And a lot less of it is isolated either consuming content by myself or grinding away at something by myself. So we do like the fact that most of this is either social or involved in creation. What about entertainment? Would Roblox ever make a Netflix show? Lots happening on Wall Street. I think Cheypahol said things that were indefensible. Need to catch up. This is Bluebird Wall Street week. I'm David Weston. We've got the information and insights. We think that's the next secular shift from business is most influential and instrumental. It's mocking it at the bullfrog. It's a challenging dynamic. This is a level of uncertainty that we haven't had to deal with. Bluebird Wall Street week live Friday with replays all weekend on Bluebird Television and Radio. Mercedes Benz is on a path towards the eternal troll mobility. So we have picked the switch there and really we're going to step by step electrify everything. And what does that mean? Combustion and your sketch electrify. You've been investing in high fidelity graphics. What is the end game here for more human, more realistic avatars? I'll look way out like a science fiction writer and talk about it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3417,2022-10-16 05:20:14
15132," What is the end game here for, you know, more human, more realistic avatars? I'll look way out like a science fiction writer and talk about it. And what I'm talking about now is super difficult. The end game, sometimes we talk about, we would go together to a rock concert or whatever concert you like. We would be there with 50,000 other people. It would feel like a movie. It would feel like real life. So are you pushing towards something like meta horizon worlds? Does that sound, you know, more experiences like that for adults? We sometimes think of Roblox ultimately as fading into the background as a utility like the electric grid. Even though it's photorealistic and there's all these awesome avatars and connection and identity around the world. The things we start seeing built on this are a wide range of things. So you imagine this not just for kids, but for everyone. Adolescent. Absolutely. What about entertainment? Would Roblox ever make a Netflix show? We would love it if one of our developers made a Netflix show. So we would feel much more authentic if one of the creators on Roblox who's coming up with avatars and stories and ideas and characters. Like we want them to be in the limelight. Roblox shares took a dive on the back of Netflix results, which obviously plummeted. Our investor's reading too much into the connection there. I think our company is somewhat unique. And what is very exciting to go to work and be the CEO is being in a market like this, you know, where we think ultimately billions of people are going to use this type of technology. And the other exciting thing about this market, there are so many big inventions that still have to happen. It feels like we're pretty mature, but inside our company we realize like there's six or seven big inventions we need to make. To get to that next step. Would Roblox ever consider more in-game advertising? Yeah, there's a funny trivia note I would share to all the Roblox fans out there. There was a time, the very first way we monetized was advertising. And then there was also a time when we had pre-roll video on Roblox. That's all gone now. It's gone for a couple of reasons. We didn't want it to interfere with the user experience. And also our virtual economy has become such a powerful way to power this, that we are able to take that down. In the future though, I think there's a certain type of advertising that is kids safe, that is immersive, that doesn't get in your way. And how do you make sure that doesn't take away from the ethos of what makes Roblox great? Yeah, I think the people on Roblox, you know, they're there to authentically connect with their friends. And as long as what we're doing with these brands is very clear, non-deceptive, appropriate for those ages. I think they'll figure out the balance of how much time do we go into a store, or is this how much time do we go to a crazy adventure tycoon, and you know, build an amusement park together. So either way, this could be a huge new revenue stream. I believe it's an awesomely huge revenue stream. And at the same time we've been very gentle towards it. So as you look ahead, what do you think are the biggest challenges Roblox will face? If our vision plays out, which we hope it does, and we have people of all ages on the platform, and we're around the world, I think maintaining that civility as we grow, as we have older people who might want to go to a political rally, thinking ways to do that in a systemic way, that's a big challenge. It takes a lot of thought. I think thinking through the technology, I really like we're very technology driven company. So it's fun to be running a company where we have to do these seven big inventions. And you know, what we're doing right now isn't going to cut it. So knowing that technology challenges, super interesting. We do a little rapid fire section just to get this. Okay. I'm going to try to be as spontaneous as I can. First question.

15133," You looked at my YouTube history. It's this weird mechanical stuff, off-road vehicles and rockets and ships and big waves. Best life hack. I think it all gets down to the joy of health, really. Like if I'm not, you know, feeling centered, both sleep, exercise, diet, all of that, everything else just completely falls. You used to have a talk radio show. Yeah. Now that I've met you in person, I get this. No way. I see how you'd be. You're kidding. You're pretty fun to listen to, yeah. What was your style? Like, what was your jam? So my jam was, I would say, starting in college when I would have insomnia at 2am, I would turn on talk radio. And you know, all those famous KGO people, Bill Wattenberg, Ray Taliafero, all that just listened to the people calling in. So I, after a knowledge revolution was acquired, and I had a year, I had a little time to dabble. My jam was really trying to talk about outrageous topics, you know, gambling, other controversial things. It was in a small market in Santa Cruz. I would typically, it was really hard to get people to call in. Yeah. It's like calling your mom. It's cool. So it's really scary if you're a DJ and no one's calling you. In fact, I made it really controversial. I have people come on and debate interesting topics. If you could have dinner with Steve Jobs or Walt Disney, who would you pick? Both. You can't pick both. I guess I would have to slightly lean Disney, just because he was not just the usher of the innovation, but actually was kind of part of the sum of the innovation. But I think Steve leaned much more on finding the people to drive that innovation. Best advice for your 20s. Don't freak out if between the age of 22 and 25, everything is a disaster. Best advice for your 40s. Life is short. It's such a valuable commodity. Every day, what you do, your friends, your time, your family, is so important. So how do you define work life integration? I don't like the word balance. Yeah, I would say, can I make my Roblox job better than anything else I would do? Like, can it be better than retiring? Can it be better than a hobby? Can I figure out what my unique job as a CEO, every CEO job is different? Like, I like doing it. So can I figure out what my role is? You mentioned your co-founder, Eric Castle earlier, who died tragically of cancer in 2013. If he was here today, what do you think he would think of the Roblox that Roblox has become? Wow, I think he'd be proud. It's a good question. Like, I think he would, you know, his, both of his sons have worked at the company a bit. So yeah, I think he'd be very proud. Seems like you miss him. He's just such a brilliant partner. Yeah. And he also set the standard for taking the long view on how we engineer things. A lot of the technology at Roblox is still, like, you know, his vision lives on. And it goes back to your advice for your 40s life is short. It is. So in five years, will the metaverse exist in the form that you imagine or is it going to take much longer? Like, what's the time horizon? Well, it's really interesting, right? Because we're right in the middle of it right now, in a sense, with 50 million people every day on our platform. It's already here. And at the same time, what is ultimately going to be possible could be 5, 10, or 20 years out. So it's, it's all, the metaverse really has existed since online dial-up muds, really 2D, very simple text. You could call that the metaverse. It's existed in multiplayer gaming, world of work craft. It exists now with more people. And in 10 or 20 years, it'll exist photorealistically with 50,000 people. You clearly have so much passion for this job. Is Roblox your final stop on your journey? Well, it's definitely my final stop. But I think there's a lot of time ahead of me here.

And it's a safe bet that some of them will eventually find their way to the C-suite. When Adrian Mitchell became Macy's chief financial officer in November 2020, he focused firmly on the company's future. Because the present for department stores in general seemed bleak. Macy's was in a position where they had really gone through a pretty tough period in 2020, but as we approached the back half of 2020, the question was, what are we going to be? Where are we going to go? Adrian stepped into this role after a period of many years of department store struggling, and I think he moved into the seat right at a point when investors were really questioning viability. I would say that the depths of the negative sentiment were kind of right at the moment that Adrian stepped in. It was a student body left. I mean, everyone realized they couldn't get you to operate through where they were. The primary mission became survival. The time was right for transformation. Looking beyond the immediate COVID crisis, Mitchell saw that the iconic retailer needed to drive forward with a fresh approach. We had the opportunity to really define who we are and who we want to become, to really think about the path to recovery and how we're going to actually do that in a different way, and really challenge ourselves on the kinds of things that we lived with pre-pandemic as a legacy department store.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3420,2022-10-16 05:33:12
15135," vaccine shots started going into people's arms. Those feet started going right back into the retail of destinations that they knew and loved. And I think it reinforced one fact for us about American culture that shopping is entertainment. In 2020, US retailers closed over a thousand more department stores than they opened. But those closures slowed dramatically in 2021. Macy still has stores slated to shutter in 2022 under its Polaris plan, but has said it may delay. When you shed real estate, you shed customers. You're firing customers when you lose a store. Having stores really amplifies what you do in digital. Having an app connects all of it. You know, customers are doing research. They're doing price checking. They're checking with influencers. They're putting things on their social feeds. They're figuring out ways to be able to use technology to understand what works for them and brands better be there. We continue to be very impressed with the relevance of stores. You know, all the math indicates that markets do best and customers are most productive when they shop multiple channels. When we think about our store portfolio, it's about repositioning that distribution channel. We're looking at ways to really make our mall based stores more relevant. A lot of that is around fulfillment services within those bigger boxes. But the real unlock is new store growth in this all-femalt format. And so you think about a 30 to 50,000 square foot box that historically has been 200,000 square feet or bigger where you have a simplified experience, high velocity, self-through, great engagement, clear sight lives across all the categories. In power centers, where in the neighborhoods and convenient locations where customers live and shop, it's really exciting and we're into early innings of that. It's very clear that all retailers will have both bricks and mortar present and e-commerce presence. Even Amazon, the ultimate e-commerce retailer increasingly has bricks and mortar present. It's very clear that this was what was going to happen. And in a way, we have to keep in mind though, that is a ticket to play, but it's not a ticket to win. Wall Street seems to endorse the TAC Macy's as taking. Shares have rallied since Mitchell became CFO in November 2020, and that mirrors the trend for department stores in general, which were one of the highest performing groups in retail in 2021. I think that the market got proven a bit wrong that these aren't dying in decaying dinosaurs, right? But these actually still have a relevant place in the broader ecosystem of retail, and to the credit of the department stores in particular Macy's and Coles, they activated some really important changes in their business. The whole notion of Polaris strategy at the core from my perspective is how do we unlock value for our shareholders? The biggest thing that we had to accomplish in 2021 was financial health. The economy is going to have its ups and downs, but we needed to make sure that we had the financial health, the strength of the balance sheet to be able to weather that storm, and that's where we are today. And now we have capacity to return valued back to shareholders in the form of dividend and share buybacks. How did you decide, right, this is the right moment to be paying back debt. How did you ensure that the money was there, the right opportunity, the right financing to pay down that debt when was necessary? There are three key steps. The first is, do we have a strategy coming out of the pandemic going into 2021 that's going to work? So we have to listen to the customer and make sure that we have the right strategy. Executing the wrong strategy doesn't get you much, so we have to execute the right strategy. The second thing was a relentless focus on margin expansion. Whatever the level of sales that we needed were expected to have in 2021, it had to come with a much more profitable business than we'd seen in 2020, and certainly even pre-pandemic. And then the third thing is you got a control inventory. You cannot be a successful retail business by having inventory get out of control. But as we got into the first half of 2021, we also had to make some bets. Yes. We saw demand exceeding our expectations. We also saw COVID variants disrupting our supply chain and we made the bet. Give it to us early. And that really has paid off for us. You know, we took all of that cash flow. We got, we restored our balance sheet. We made further investments and we now as a company are stronger, you know, out of the pandemic than we were going into it. Macy's continues to hold the lead in market share among U.S. retailers, but she future officer, Adrian Mitchell, is under no illusions. The road ahead is not going to be easy.

15136," Air among U.S. retailers, but she future officer, Adrian Mitchell, is under no illusions. The road ahead is not going to be easy. To apply chain challenges, we believe it's going to be prolonged into 2020, to end to 2023. Labor challenges, we have to win talent, we have to fight for talent, we're making investments. But that's just, our mindset is that's the new normal. That's not a disruption, that's the new normal for the near term and the medium term. Our mindset is continuous improvement, new ways of working, fresh ideas that are relevant for the future and letting go of the things that may have worked in the past but are no longer relevant, but that we may have been willing to live with pre-pandemic. We're not willing to live with it today. Coming up, Adrian Mitchell takes me on a tour of Macy's flagship store, where the company's making big bets on some new categories. You have to invest in R&D, you have to invest in experimentation. This is Bloomberg. Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world recalibrates. After decades of stagnation, Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalise the nation. Corporate giants, policymakers and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that. Every week on Japan ahead, right here on Bloomberg Television. Adrian Mitchell's route to the CFO position at Macy's had unconventional beginnings. I studied chemical engineering at Louisiana State University, had a great experience and one of the things I loved about that was just problem solving and what I also realised is that I didn't want to be a chemical engineer. He took a job at McKinsey after college, stepping away for a couple of years to earn an MBA at Harvard. When I think about the Harvard Business School experience, what was most impactful about that was translating the engineers' minds and on problem solving into a business context. That was a really magical experience, but I think some of the most formative years were really at McKinsey, where I had the opportunity to, for the vast majority of that experience, work with clients on large scale transformation in the consumer space. And when I joined my first retail study, game over, I loved it. Absolutely loved it. It was tangible, it was real, but it was also ripe for opportunity. His first operational opportunity came at Target, where he led a redesign of the company's digital and mobile platforms. From there, it was onto the C-suite at Creighton Barrel, a CFO, with a stint as interim CEO as well, followed by a TORR as CEO of furniture and home decal retailer, A house. And then the season leader took his talents back to consulting as a managing director and partner at Boston Consulting Group. I really created a space for myself at BCG, which was really at the intersection of retail operations and digital data and advanced analytics. And then Macy's comes knocking. One in brand and iconic brand like Macy's comes calling and the opportunity to reimagine a 162 year old business to be relevant for the next decade plus what a great challenge. There's no better place to explore how Macy's is meeting that challenge than inside its flagship store in New York's Herald Square. The building dates back to 1902, but Adrian Mitchell sees it as fresh territory. We're investing a lot in a lot of different capabilities and features that makes the in-store shopping experience that much easier, that much more compelling, whether it's price check, browsing inventory in this store so that we can really make that experience as convenient and as simple as possible. Convenient, simple. That's sort of what people have needed in the age of COVID. Is that here to stay or do we go back when finally we all hope that the pandemic will be behind us in some way? Do our changing shopping habits go back again? What's really interesting about retail in my 20 plus experience is that convenience never reverts itself. Now the form of convenience has shifted, where as saying 2000, 2010, a lot of convenience was driven by more stores nearby. Now it's stores in addition to digital. There's nothing closer than the phone in your hand.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3422,2022-10-16 05:44:33
15137," A lot of convenience was driven by more stores nearby. Now it's stores in addition to digital. There's nothing closer than the phone in your hand. And there's so many more touch points. There's social shopping. There's curbside pickup. There's at your service. There's on your phone shipped to home. This real estate does not come cheap, but it's integral, right? It's integral. You know, the physical footprint is integral to Macy's success as an omnichannel retailer. For all of Macy's focus on convenience and simplicity, there's no decline in variety. While women's shoes, accessories, cosmetics, and apparel have traditionally led the company's revenue mix, there's a commitment to expand into new categories. Case in point, the pet department. Where Chief Merchandising Officer Nattadvier joined us. One of the things that we observed in the pandemic is that customers were giving us permission to sell a lot more than what we traditionally have as a Macy's department store. And so as we think about the opportunity for us to extend into toys and extensions and hair care in other parts, pets was clearly an act and a category that's large and growing. We're really focused on bringing in the millennium mom and all the things that they're shopping for and many times those families also have pets. How do you know the best way in which to do it from a financial perspective, which is, do I build this wholeheartedly organically, do we part now? What are those conversations like? Well, we do a lot of research, and there's some experimentation and there's some vets. I think the thing that's exciting for us is you have to invest in R&D, you have to invest in experimentation. And so having that strong financial performance to make these choices, make these vets gives us that flexibility. Pets has done well. Also doing well, the revamped toy department but trust by a partnership with Toys or Us, it launched in August as a store within a store. They are expanding into categories that are part of that fluency exercise within Omni-Tenile and Toys is a great example of that. The investments that we're making, that Adrian was really helpful to help figure out how we support and how we really invest in a category that will take years to kind of really drive the type of volume that we're looking for it to drive, starts with a big investment. And so that's what I'm excited about is, the investment in the future of Toys starts now and we start reaping those benefits over the years to come. One of the most important functions of Macy's stores is an obvious to customers. They're becoming fulfillment and distribution centers, hubs for shipping and pick up that lower the costs and increase efficiency across the business. We have all these stores across the country with a lot of real estate. How do we use a portion of that real estate in order to be in market with the product to reduce the distance that a product has to travel which means they get it faster? The idea of shipping from a distant fulfillment center in the middle of a warehouse district is just not as efficient and certainly not as fast as it needs to be in an environment where customers expect greater speed. And we have to do it economically because so many customers want low or free shipping. So we really did it through brute force prior, but now we're being much more deliberated using lean processes and six sigma technology tools and better information to make this process rival the efficiency of what you would see in an upstream fulfillment center. Some of the merchandise here is marked for in store and curbside pickup. And that touchpoint, so critical in an omnichannel world, is getting a makeover. So this is the re-imagined view of our at-your-service. Given the categories that we're in, we have a number of returns, particularly through digital purchases that come back to the store. So it's really important for us to be able to have an at-your-service counter that's fast, that's efficient, that allows the customer to come in very seamlessly. But it's also your pickup spot for your biomein pickup in store offer. So last year, as we're going through the recovery, we invested in a number of stores to be able to kind of reimagine what this experience looks like. And just percentage wise, how many customers use this? Hundreds of thousands of customers that will be used this every year. The reality is that creating a seamless experience for returns is critical. A large part of our business is apparel. And apparel by its very nature is a business that has a high return rate. And those returns come back to our stores. So making sure the seamless, efficient experience is available in every store is really critical for customer engagement, customer loyalty. Making returns easy is a really important dimension of that. Coming up.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3423,2022-10-16 05:49:03

Coming up, retailers across the US are facing shareholder pressure to spin off their digital businesses. Adrian Mitchell discusses the pros and cons. We have to take into account the benefits of that evaluation, the cost. And he tells me that his biggest challenge in the next 10 years might be just keeping up with a pace of change. As a management team, the notion of a five year strategy doesn't really exist anymore. This is brilliant back. The peak is crucially important and I think we've moved from this attitude from its indulgence a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s and so it makes that a really exciting field because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harness to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts. But if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information and that's what your brain figures out while you're sleeping. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. The pressure cooker just got far too hot in banning them for the government to handle. You foresee two-thirds of the crypto hedge funds will disappear. Are we close? The UK will support and defend Ukraine's territorial integrity. With unmatched reach in resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, you are global business authority. In March 2021, Sachs Fifth Avenue split into two units. This parent company, Hudson Bay, spun off its e-commerce division from its bricks and mortar business. Since then, other retailers like Coles, Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom have reportedly been mulling similar moves. In October, Macy's was urged by activist hedge fund Janne Partners to consider a split. The company is harder consulting firm to help analyse its options. This financial re-engineering staff is being driven by a fundamental truth that the internet business and many of the bricks and mortar is a pretty darn good business and makes it growing and strong e-commerce business. These businesses could theoretically carry higher multiples than the company as a whole. The fundamental question you have to ask is, will the market actually do that over the long term? Will they simply value the e-commerce business very highly and then value what remains? The remain code at a very low value. We end up averaging out where he started to begin with. Nobody knows the answer to that. These are companies that have spent the last 15 years integrating two disparate businesses and really honoring the consumer in finding one company, one NACs, one calls. And so now to have two separate entities and to have a spider web of transaction service agreements and try to maintain some degree of integrity in that consumer experience, there are some very serious risks. On all scenarios, the customer experience cannot be disrupted. The customer experience has to be respected, whether the synergies are a frictional cause of operating separate businesses with inter-company agreements and we also have to also understand the execution risk because the key thing is we have to be agile in the way that we actually navigate the business. It's constantly changing. Adrian Mitchell isn't just navigating change, he's driving it. I asked Macy's chief future officer what he sees when he looks ahead. How do you see Macy's from your perspective as CFO in 10 years' time?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3424,2022-10-16 05:53:06
15139," Macy's chief future officer what he sees when he looks ahead. Where do you see Macy's from your perspective as CFO in 10 years time? In 10 years time we will be a business that is highly relevant, very much digitally led, with a distribution model of physical assets around the country more than what you see today. And we're excited about that. It's all about customer relevancy. And so continuing to listen to the customer, think about different ways that the customer is going to be shopping is really important. We have to let go of the traditional legacy department store habits and evolve with the customer in a way that's productive and profitable and good for us shareholders. Are those backward looking habits the challenge or what are the challenges do you see in the next 10 years that maybe keep you up? I think the biggest challenge is pace. It's really pace. If you think about the level of disruption that we see in retail, we've been living with this for 10 years and the pace just continues to move faster. In addition, consumer expectations are evolving and elevating and changing as fast if not faster. And so as a management team, the notion of a five year strategy doesn't really exist anymore. You have to be responsive in the moment. You have to know directly where you're going, but you may need to shift left or right at a few things to the strategy, take some things out, make some adjustments as you go. And that's the agility that Jeff and I in the management team have been doing with Polaris. We're constantly challenging the assumptions of our strategy. We're constantly making adjustments. But most importantly, our test-learned deployment has to prove out that the strategies we're pursuing are working. How are you adjusting your own role? How will the role of a CFO change in the next 10 years, do you think? I strongly believe that a CFO has to look around the corner. A CFO has to think not only about the finances and the capital allocation, but also about the strategy, about getting to know the operation. The thing that I encouraged my teams and my colleagues within Finanity was get into the supply chain, walk the store, work with the digital team to understand what they're doing on the website, click that you have to understand the operation in order to actually manage capital allocation effectively. So when we think about our role in finance, it's really being shoulder to shoulder with the operators and also engaged in having a seat at the table when it comes to the strategy. That way we can deploy capital most efficiently and effectively to maximize return. Is digital the new skill set that a CFO needs as well? I think it's more data science, it's analytics, being able to understand all the permutations and scenarios that can happen operationally and financially, and being able to help the organization create a system that can actually move with agility. Simple example, when you think about our technology platform, if you think about our history, we have a data technology platform that's highly fragmented. Should we invest in simplifying our technology stack? Absolutely yes. It may not have their financial ROI as investing in digital marketplace or enhanced experiences or small format, but strategically you can't compete with agility if you've got to deal with fragmented systems that take too long to get information and make better decisions. So we're simplifying our data architecture to be able to create that agility for the operating business to generate great results. That kind of strategic and operational mindset is going to be necessary to get the numbers to work and for the returns to be there. So you're a piece of advice to someone who's about to take on the role of a CFO? Yes. What would it be? Get to know the business and challenge the strategy. Do you, if you put yourself in the role of the consumer, believe that that strategy is what's going to make you more profitable for that business, more engaged, shop more frequently and choose that company over the competition and get into the operation. There's lots of opportunities in the operation. Basic things like the store staff appropriately, inventories in the right place. The basics of retail still matter, the fundamental still matter, you have to execute well on the fundamentals to create the capacity in the room to be able to invest in innovation.

We call them tags. And they have a signal within them. And when you stare at that, your eye responds to it in a particular way. The way in which that eye response occurs is a signal that we pick up on the visual cortex of the brain at the back of the brain. So the sensor is looking for the signals we create here that come through the eyeball, through the brain, and then onto the visual cortex. Once we've got it there as a signal, we can grab that. We understand what that signal looks like, and we turn that into a command, whatever we're trying to control. So you'll need to keep it. There's multiple places where we think this technology could be applied. Perhaps in, I don't know, driving or commanding and grand vehicles or unmanned naval vessels. Perhaps providing a menu selection and control within a control room environment, maybe in a nuclear power station. All those kinds of things are perhaps in the value of this technology.

Some like Ron Baron, the mutual fund manager and investor with more than $50 billion on her management started investing as a teenager. If my partner, I was interested in stock market because I had friends of mine who had been given stock from the grandparents who were prosperous. In Eastman, Kodak and Polaroid. I said, I want to do that. My father said, we can't invest in stocks. We've never done that. Family. In fact, one of the ideas behind my business is the idea was I wanted to be able to have people like my parents be able to invest in the stock market. I saw that and then he said, well, I had $1,000 at the time and he said, well, if you show me why you want to invest in a company and you put all your money into one company, then and show me why. Then I'll let you do that and open account for you. I did research. I would go to this brokerage firm and it was called McDonald's Company or from Cleveland and they were right by Asbury Park High School. I would go there after school, sports and girls and stocks. I would go there after school and all these guys, old guys, 40, 50 years old. They're sitting there on these green chairs and looking at a tape that hardly moved. I think the New York Stock Exchange was 25 million shares a day and maybe American was a million or two million shares a day. I got a report on this Mama County National Bank and I started reading it and it was around the corner where I lived in Allenhurst outside of Asbury Park and I told my father why I wanted to invest in it and he let me invest and the stock was $10 a share, 100 shares. Then the stock every day for the next six months, seven months, every day you'd stay the same or win up an eighth and it was printed to 15 stocks and then Asbury Park Press and everybody would say the same. Then it got acquired at $17 a share. My $1,000 became $1,700. I said, man, there's nothing to do if I want to do that. So I was interested. Hedge Fund billionaire Ken Griffin also turned an early affinity for math and computers into an early career in stock trading. Let's talk about your background before you started Sadeil. You're born in Florida? I was born in Daytona Beach. My father worked on the space program back in the 1960s. But I spent my formative years in middle school and high school in Buck or Tone, Florida. You were a pretty good math student and I'm told a computer nerd as well. Is that fair or unfair? Well, I appreciate the compliment because to be a computer nerd has obviously turned out to be a pretty good place to be in life. And yes, I was very interested in both mathematics and programming in high school. It's defined my career and has had a very important role in my life. So you went to Harvard College. Most students there are taking courses or their athletics, but you were doing that. You were also trading.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3427,2022-10-16 06:06:21
15142," important role in my life. So you went to Harvard College. Most students there are taking courses or their athletics, but you were maybe doing that, but you were also trading securities. Is that true? That is true. I started up a small partnership my second year at Harvard to engage in convertible bond arbitrage, which was a bit of an off the beaten path occupation for a kid in college. But I had a great fascination with markets, and I had an opportunity to invest capital markets in my college days. And it was an incredible opportunity. It was a really great learning experience. But in those days, it wasn't common to be able to get stock prices instantly. You had to get a special terminal or special intended to let you get the stock quotes. Is that right? So it's amazing is you know, I love the line people go, well, that's how we've always done it. And I get to think back into the early days of Citadel. We're always did it. We used a fax machine, which you and I of course have memories of. And the fax machine was revolutionary. In the 1980s, real-time stock prices were actually difficult to receive. And I put a satellite dish on top of the dorm room. So I would have access to real-time stock quotes in managing the portfolio that I manage. And what did the Harvard people say? Interestingly enough, back in the 80s, Harvard had a general prohibition on commercial activity in your dorm rooms. So I had to go to the building superintendent to get an exception to put the satellite dish on the roof of the building. And fortunately, he was willing to grant me that exception. But not every investor saw their future in finance early. Real estate, Titan, Sam Zell, and myself studied the law, became lawyers and hated it. I was always a good enough academic to get from here to there. So when I wanted to go to law school, I got seven A's. But I didn't get very many A's before that. And I basically used the four years of being an undergraduate to build a real estate business and build other businesses. And I just had a great time. So you were doing some real estate on the side while you were in college. And then you went to University of Michigan Law School. And to please your mother or father, you said, I'm going to go to law school. But you weren't that interested in being a lawyer? No, never. As a matter of fact, I ended up graduating and becoming a lawyer and I practiced for four days. Four days. That's, I didn't realize you practiced that long. Four days. So in the morning of the fifth day, I went to see the senior partner and as only a 24 year old could do, I looked in and I said, I just don't think this is a good use of my time. He said, okay, there's the door. Well, actually, when he said is, what are you going to do? And I said, I'm just going to go back to doing deals like I did when I was in law school and in the real estate business in Arbor. And so he said, one, did you stay here and will do the legal work and will invest in your deals? And so that's what we did for a year. And then there's activist investor Nelson Peltz, who didn't see the point in studying it all. What I really wanted to do was ski. So I left Wharton and I went up to Maine and became a ski bump. What did your family say? Nelson, we really wanted you to go to Wharton and be a good student. You're one of ski. I mean, that's not what you're supposed to do. That's correct. They did say that. What did you do? You said I was skiing. My father was an amazing guy. He wasn't happy that I left Wharton. He wasn't happy that I was a ski bump. And he wasn't happy that I grew a beard. But I did all of those things. And there's snow melted in late spring and came back and I had a summer job offered to me a Mount Hood Argon to help them teach racing to young kids in Mount Hood Argon. And I needed some money to get out there. I asked him if he'd give me a job on a truck a hundred bucks a week, two weeks. That was all I needed. He said, find shave your beard off and do it. I said I would. It was only temporary. So I shaved my beard off. And after about a week on the job, I started telling things that I thought that were missed opportunities. And he set me up beautifully. He said, why don't you stay here and do what you want to do instead of going out to Mount Hood Argon? Well, I did. And that's what I-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3428,2022-10-16 06:10:37
15143," a year and do what you want to do instead of going out to Mount Hedarkon. Light did and that's what happened. There are also great investors like Paula Volent, one of the country's most successful endowment heads who came to investing after a completely different career. I studied paper conservation, restoring prints and drawings. I worked at the New York Historical Society for a while there. I then went to work at the Palace of Fine Arts in their Conservation Lab and then I went to Los Angeles where I worked at the LA County Museum. I did scientific work at the Getty and then I set up my own conservation studio where I worked with contemporary artists like Sam Edruchet, Sam Francis. And I was running my own business and I realized I needed to know a little bit about finance because I was working with very expensive works of art. I was running a studio and so I started taking a couple business classes at UCLA and through that I got introduced to Yale School of Management. But I got into Yale School of Management at the same time I got offered a fellowship at the National Gallery of Art where you and I both serve the Leicester Fellow and I worked in the paper conservation lab there combining paper and paintings techniques for conservation on contemporary works of art. So you did that for a while then you went to Yale School of Management? My husband and I had been trying to have a child and it wasn't kind of works. It wasn't happening so he said, okay, well let's move to New Haven. And of course that was instant and my daughter was born after my first semester. So I took a break and while when my daughter was probably two months old I went to David Swenson and knocked on the door and said hi I want to learn about endowment because I'm going to work at a museum. And this is about David. David looked at my resume, there was no finance at all. And he took me in and I started filing and helping organize things and little by little I got projects to do. I remember he had me do a big research on soft dollars. That was one project I worked on. And little by little I became incorporated into the investment office. Coming up we hear about the extreme intelligence and intention to detail that it takes for success on Wall Street. One of Sam's favorite Samisms is we suffer from knowing the numbers. Hydrogen has a very special place in the universe. It's the first element on the periodic table. It is the most abundant element in the universe. And when clean energy advocates think about what can we find which would be as easy to use as fossil fuels they think about hydrogen. The fuel that will when burn only produce water. We like to imagine that if we just built enough of these and these we could ditch fossil fuels and save the planet. Unfortunately it's not that simple. There are some things where you just need good old fashioned combustible fuel. Now startups around the world are betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines the reality is that even if every car on the road today won electric it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total US greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building across America burn fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need we want to do 100% clean energy all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels. We want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3429,2022-10-16 06:14:49
15144," Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels. We want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of US greenhouse gas emissions. Another trait of great investors that shouldn't surprise you is they all tend to have a high degree of intelligence, many excelled academically. But true success as Mary Eardos, the CEO of JP Morgan Asset and Wealth Management, points out, comes from training and continuing to educate oneself. So training on Wall Street, but specifically in Wealth Management, is a very, very long process. We have 2200 analysts starting today and they're going to be working through the summer. We have 3600 analysts across JP Morgan Chase that will start at the very end in the September time period for their full time role. And we work very hard to go through in depth training and then to work through which ones actually are good at stock investing, which ones are good at M&A transactions, which ones are good at helping people understand things in a more simplistic matter. That's a two to three year training program. But that's pretty fast. If you think 10,000 hours is about what you need to master any subject. If someone comes in and has a regular eight hour a day job, five days a week, it's going to take you about five years to have a base level mastery. On Wall Street, it's more like 12 hours a day, six days a week, that cuts you down to about two and a half years before you become mastered in something. Once they've got that under their belt, they can then join a team. And if they've been successful going through the analyst program, joining a team, then the team will work through how that works. But it is a constant education each and every day. Every morning we start with an eight o'clock meeting and I call it like a mini university. And it's not just about what you've read in the newspapers as to what happened overnight. It's about understanding how all of those components fit together in a client's portfolio and then what might be right for you would be different than somebody else. And you're synthesizing all that information every morning and then you're going out and you're figuring out how to apply it to each situation. On Fitzpatrick, the investment sheet for George Soros is of a similar mindset to Erdos. For her, the constant pursuit of new ideas and new voices keep her ahead of the game. So I read a lot, you know, in the morning I'll skim through two or three different papers. During my days I'm meeting with a lot of smart investors and smart people running companies. You learn a lot from there. I talk to peers. But I think part of the trick of this big business is being able to really aggregate and assimilate information. And one of the other tricks of this industry is trying to find sources of information that are different than the other people in the business because you don't want to get crowd thinking. I think that happens a lot in this business. Everyone's talking to the same people and a view becomes consensus that might not be really grounded as well as it should be in facts. Attention to detail also sets great investors apart as described by two real estate legends, Sam Zell and John Gray. You know, one of Sam's favorite samisms is we suffer from knowing the numbers. I think we've managed to tip through the two loops for the last 50 years by never allowing ourselves to get swept up in the enthusiasm of whatever the current event might be. And I think by maintaining that level of discipline, yeah, we made mistakes, and that's to be expected. But we've all been, quote, controllable. No one mistake was ever catastrophic. The first deal I worked on was a shopping center in Chesapeake, Virginia, the Great Bridge Shopping Center. It was a $6 million transaction. We borrowed four. It was a $2 million equity.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3430,2022-10-16 06:19:13
15145," Center in Chesapeake, Virginia, the great bridge shopping center. It was a $6 million transaction. We borrowed four. So it was a $2 million equity check. And you would have thought I was buying the island of Manhattan. I mean, I was down there for three weeks. I met every tenant. I was counting the car traffic. I was learning the business. And it was an amazing experience because I was the chief bottle washer. I was the waiter. I was the matredee. Because we were this tiny little business and I was learning it firsthand. Now one of the most famous things in the real estate world is location, location, location, meaning that the location is everything. And also you might say it's local, local, local because most people make in real estate investments kind of in the area they know. You've made investments all over the world. How do you sitting in New York know about the value of real estate in Europe or in Asia and how hard has that been to build a global business? So I think the key to that is to have a global footprint, to have hundreds of people all over the world. And it took us a long time to do it. I mean, we've been at this for 30 years and you really need talented people on the ground. You need local people who know the markets. The one thing I'd say though that is advantageous about real estate is so many of the trends we're seeing, particularly driven by technology, are the same around the world. So when we started buying warehouses back in 2010 and we noticed that there were these e-commerce tenants showing up and we started buying more in the US, it wasn't a big leap of faith to say the same thing is going to happen in Canada, it's going to happen in the UK and continental Europe and across Asia. So my view is that if you have the skill set, you can evaluate plus you travel a lot like you, I'm on planes a lot. I no longer run the real estate business day today. My colleagues Ken Kaplan and Kathleen McCarthy have done an amazing job, but they have teams around the world on the ground and we're local in those markets and I think that's really important. You cannot buy real estate and Mumbai the way we have flying in and flying out of New York. Next, we look at how skilled investors evaluate risk. We are 100% confident every time we make the investment that it's going to be a big company. We are wrong a lot of the time. Bloomberg has enhanced search on the terminal to deliver what you need when you need it. Now you can simply type phrases in everyday English in the command line.

The US jobs numbers are released. One of the easiest paths in life is to accept and follow conventional wisdom. But what great investors have found is that path doesn't lead to easy returns. Often the biggest wins come from going against the grain and taking a risk, especially if you're a leading venture capital investor like Mark Andreessen or Vinod Kostler. Each top and venture firm has its own bar. So it has its own set of criteria for things that deals should be done or not. The top tier venture firms as a group have a collective bar, which is a top tier venture firm going to fund this company or not. It's actually easier to answer that second question than it is the first question. If you've been in the business for a while, you tend to have a sense of like, okay, this is going to get funded by a top and venture capital firm or it's not. If it is going to get funded by a top and venture capital firm, and if my firm doesn't think it's a good idea, you do wonder who's right, because the other firms are quite smart. So this is one of the regular discussions that we have, which is like, okay, if another one of these top and firms is interested in it, that might be a very...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3431,2022-10-16 06:23:32
15146," idea you do wonder like who's right right because the other firms are quite smart. And so this is one of the regular discussions that we have which is like okay if another one of these top firms is interested in it that might be a very that might be a very positive substantive signal. If the other top firms have looked at it and all passed that might be a substantive negative signal that said some of the best deals in history have been passed on by a very large number of people. It's in one of the class examples Uber was passed on by a very large number of venture capital firms. Uber was actually available to be invested in on the site called Angelist where literally anybody with a checkbook can invest. And so every once in a while you get these outliers and it's fundamentally a game of outliers like the money is made on the aberrations. And so I say you want to be generally open-minded and humble about your conclusions about what all these different signals mean. Now a famous economist Herb Stein once said if something can't keep going on forever it won't. In other words at some point things settle down. Do you worry that because the economy might soften at some point if interest rates are raised or just because of the business cycle the wonderful world of venture capital will slow down a bit and is that a worry for you? So it's a cyclical business for sure. It has a history of boom bus cycles you know basically just like any other sector of the economy. That said I guess I would say we we do not have a great track record in our industry of predicting these cycles. And I think most of what we I think most of how we either perform or fail to perform is micro not macro which is to say it's based on the successor failure of individual companies. And if you just look at the history of venture capital and startups many of the best companies have been formed during the hot periods but also many of the companies have been formed during the cold periods right and they're pros and cons of those periods. And so look it's it's possible there's another cyclical boom and bus cycle you know our plan for that cycle would be basically be to just keep going keep working with our existing companies help them through it keep investing in new companies all the way through and basically bet on these sort of micro level fundamental technological and economic changes that continue to happen. Most of what we do is uncharted territory. I would say the one piece that works really well in art business is go for higher risk higher consequences. So most people in business reduce risk increase the probability of success which is reduce risk but at the expense of making the consequences of success relatively inconsequential you might make two times your money or something. I for art business what works is I don't mind the 90% probability of failure if there's a 10% chance of changing the world and that's very much the philosophy it also goes with it's it's the right way to make huge impact. It's not just venture capitalists taking risks. Columbia's endowment head Kim Lu also says gains are not without calculated risks. I think the best investment advice I've ever received is the fact that we are in the business of taking risk and so if you want to produce return you have to be willing to take risk and you have to be willing to analyze and mitigate that risk the best you can and to make sure that the return potential of an investment is equal to the risk but you can't avoid risk. Now what do you think the most common mistake investors make generally? I think the most common mistakes is following the herd and just doing what everybody else is doing and not making sure that an investment is appropriate for your institution and making sure that the analysis that someone else has done is not appropriate for you or is not congruent with the way you think about the world. I think there are a million ways to make money. I think there are a million strategies that can work not every investment is consistent with your strategy and so I think there's a lot of herd mentality and that's a huge mistake that happens. Now sometimes risk don't pan out and mistakes are made. Now I might sit and stew over the loss for a decade or two but a truly great investor like Cliner Perkins Chairman John Doer has the ability to admit a mistake, cut his losses and move on. When I first came to Silicon Valley I hung out at Stanford on the second floor of Margaret Jacks Hall and down that hall was Andy Bechtel-Schheim who founded Sun Microsystems, John Hennessey who became president of Stanford, founded MIPS Jim Clark of Silicon Graphics. What I didn't do is go down into the basement where Len and Sandy were starting Cisco so that was a miss on my part. More recently I had the opportunity to invest in an electric vehicle company.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3432,2022-10-16 06:27:59
15147," Sandy were starting Cisco, so that was a miss on my part. More recently, I had the opportunity to invest in an electric vehicle company. And the conventional wisdom was venture capitalists, not to invest in electric vehicle companies, not new car companies at all. There have been 400 new car companies in the nation's history. Every one of them but one has gone bankrupt. But I was still very attracted to the market. And we had the choice of backing a brilliant car designer by the name of Henry Fisker, or ambitious, slightly crazy entrepreneur by the name of Elon Musk. Tested. Well, we made the wrong decision. But Tesla did very, very well and so did electric vehicles. So when I make a mistake, I only think about it for the next 10 or 20 years. How long does it take for you to get over these things? Well, I don't obsess on these, but I won't ever forget. This is a market that over the past few weeks has made it clear it wants to go higher. It got a little spooked by the idea that geolphe little potential to rise it. What do Formula One cars and your local supermarket have in common? Well, strange as it sounds, they might both be using the same technology. A lot of innovation has trickle down from the world of high tech engines and it hasn't just found a new life in road cars. F1 cars have long been thought of as the peak of cool and technology in them is also helping to pull down our produce aisles. Engineers from Williams are using their knowledge from nine constructors championships, working with company Aerofoil to help reduce the energy consumption of supermarkets. The device they're building is based on the design of an F1 cars rear wing. It attaches to fridges to keep more cool air in the unit. They estimate it can reduce supermarket energy consumption by 25%. One innovation from F1 is also helping hybrids reduce their carbon footprint. That's curves or the kinetic energy recovery system. In common parlance, it's known as regenerative braking and works by storing energy of the car decelerating in a battery for later use. That's not enough. F1 is now looking at hers or a thermal energy recovery system looking to harness the heat produced from braking and the engine exhaust that could allow cars to generate the same power using 30% less fuel. So while F1 may have a reputation as a gas guzzler, some of its innovations in the name of speed are helping in the everyday fight against climate change.

15148," Welcome to the Earth's Shot Prize Innovation Summit. I'm Francing Lacqua here at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. This event powered by Bloomberg featured finalists selected by the Earth's Shot Council, launched by Prince William, is a global initiative that drives innovation on solutions to climate change and environmental issues in the following categories. Protect and restore nature, clean our air, revive our oceans, build our waste-free world, fix our climate. So over the next half an hour we'll bring you all the highlights from this most important gathering. This is Bloomberg. Protecting the environment was a course close to my grandmother's heart and I know she would have been delighted to hear about this event and the support you were all giving our Earth's Shot finalists the next generation of environmental pioneers. Together in this room are the people and organisations who will help us to achieve the Earth's Shot mission to repair, restore and rejuvenate our planet within this current decade. That mission is not simple. Just as President John F. Kennedy so famously said, as he challenged the United States for America to unite behind the goal of putting man on the moon, we choose to do these things not because they are easy but because they are hard. I know that the world is an uncertain place right now that many families and communities across the globe are facing unimaginable challenges, from conflicts to energy crisis and food shortages. While addressing these in the short term we must also remain resolutely focused on tackling the greatest challenges that threaten our tomorrow. Because if we don't the changing climate will only serve to entrench these immediate challenges into fundamental global issues, severely impacting the lives of each and every one of us. That is why our collective mission is so urgent but there is huge reason to be optimistic. The 2021 cohort of Earth's Shot winners and finalists is evidence that we can succeed. That we can protect our world for our children, our grandchildren and the generations that will follow them. These pioneers exemplify the leadership needed in this decade of change. They include inspiring activists, brilliant innovators, a forward thinking city and even an entire country making a real difference. But they cannot do it alone. This must be a team effort. We must come together behind their innovative solutions to ensure they reach their full potential with pace and scale. My message today is one of gratitude and encouragement. I also acknowledge that you cannot succeed in isolation. As governments, we have a responsibility to create the incentives and the space for you to flourish, a receptive environment for change and the accountability that comes with guardianship. In many nations the foundation for this approach has been flayed for us long ago if we choose to listen. Where I come from, I'll tear our New Zealand a beautiful place. You must visit. Our indigenous people hold a world view that every single living and non-living thing is connected. Our people, our plants, our animals, descendants of Ranganoi, the sky father and Papa Tuanuku, the earth mother and their children. And so it follows that people and nature are kin, are family. And we must care for one another in the spirit of Katiaki Tanga, which translates into guardianship by the people of the land for the next generation. In short, koha ho te tayao koha ho. I am the environment and the environment is me. Our life source, our economy, our future. Now I've seen this in action first hand many times, not least in my own backyard, the Pacific, where the ocean is a source of protein, income, culture and connection. Now that it is a source of challenge as it rises up and begins to inundate small island nations. It can be confronting to hear and see the stories of just how real these challenges are. But none of us are here because we have given up. But because we believe there is a way to change the future.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3434,2022-10-16 06:36:28
15149," The stories of just how real these challenges are, but none of us are here because we have given up, but because we believe there is a way to change the future. We are not only part of the nature, but we are nature. Nature is living element. For indigenous people, nature is whole. Our planet is alive. The rivers are her blood. The trees are her hair. The soil, her skin, the wind, her breeze. And indigenous peoples, our planet, they know, they are the doctor. We are protecting 80% of the world's biodiversity because our way of life do not harm nature at the opposite. We are strengthening ecosystems. We improve biodiversity by cooperating with the birds and trees listening to the winds, observing the cloud, learning from even the little insect. We protect nature by setting up our own limits. We don't take more that mother earth can give and we give back. We protect the sacred trees. We don't destroy the field of the medicinal plants. We choose, precisely, the animal that we can kill to just keep the balance of the ecosystem. As all of us know in this fight, no one can afford to sit on the sidelines. No one can claim that climate change is somebody else's problem or shrug it off for future generations to address. We're all affected by a warming planet. We see that every day. And decisions being made right now will determine our shared tomorrow. So we must choose and we must act as united nations ourselves. Our progress depends on collective action, on collective ingenuity. If we stick together, we can make fixing the climate the greatest project and greatest achievement of our lifetimes. We have the science, we have the solutions. Now all the world needs is political will. Together we can create a future where rampant carbon is removed from the atmosphere, where green buildings and green business transform the levability of communities, where easy access to renewable energy enables greater equity, where sustainable agriculture feeds a growing global population. The needs are urgent and the costs of inaction are worse than any nightmare. But let us not be driven by, let us be driven by hope not fear by optimism not despair. Because hope is not passive. Hope is the ultimate source of renewable energy, pushing us forward every day to try and try again. Today, the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit in partnership with Mike Bloomberg and Bloomberg Philanthropies will ask each and every one of us what we can do to accelerate progress to repair our planet this decade. And offer solutions on how to collaborate to drive this ambitious but essential climate agenda. We will continue to drive impact around system changing climate solutions and amplify the Earth Shop Prize's call to accelerate progress to repair our planet through collaboration and innovation. But most importantly, we will remind ourselves what can be achieved when we turn pessimism to optimism and optimism into action. Coming up, but more from the panelists, and finalists here at the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit, this is Bloomberg. So what's the best investment advice you've ever been given by anybody? The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance, and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day, and if you keep at it and don't quit.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3435,2022-10-16 06:40:39
15150," A goal of business, finance and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day. And if you keep at it and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's not just interest. It was always said about compound interest returns. Compound business returns. Compound human returns. They're all very additive because you learn every day. And if you keep at it, it's very, very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make? Selling at the wrong time. And they sell when the prices go down? Yes, or yes. Not keeping. But people have conviction or they invest for the, if they invest for the right reasons, just keep at it. You will put a woman on Mars. You will bring forth global cooling. You will be the first chief crypto officer. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer, disrupt. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. Welcome back to the best of the earth's shop prize innovation summit. The guests featured ranged from heads of state to leaders of grassroots environmental organizations. Well, amongst them was philanthropist and Microsoft founder Bill Gates. Yeah, it's too bad you can't do things overnight in either medication adaptation. You know, when I last went through Europe, people were, the leaders were all saying, hey, give me technologies. So I can tell Putin to get lost. And I said, hey, in five years, you're going to be able to call him up. And they were like, no, we'd like it. No, it's a year alone. Okay, that, how's your planning permission regime and all the, you know, planning for that, that future grid? Seeds typically between the timing start and they get out in the farmers fields is about eight years. Now, we have a pipeline of innovations. You know, we've been funding the CG system for 20 years now. It's funded about a billion year. It's if people care at all about adaptation, that thing will be funded at two billion a year. I mean, there won't be anything close to the impact of climate related seeds, climate related maze, rice, wheat, sort of a millet. And thank goodness, because of human genetics, we know how to do the editing. Thank goodness, because of AI, we know how to find the alleles, because of drones, we can measure stuff in the field. So there's huge advance in terms of how the whole seed ecosystem moves at, at full speed. The timing is very tricky here. The warming doesn't stop the day you get to zero emissions. There's a lag in this system. It's about a 20 year lag. So you haven't seen that Earth temperatures not equilibrated to the atmospheric CO2 content. So when you get to zero, that's not, it's not like 2051. Take my air conditioner away. No, it starts quite a bit later. And so you have to look at what the peak is, and you can't just plan for, okay, 2030, 2030s, where your maze production in central Africa is down 25%. By 2050, it's down 70%. And you will have switched in most of those areas from a fairly heat sensitive crop to sorghum. Now sorghum productivity is super low. So we'll get people to do better maze for these next 15 years, and then they are going to have to switch to sorghum. It is tough when you see the floods impact us down. I mean, nobody expected that. You know, if the goal of climate was to.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3436,2022-10-16 06:45:06
15151," and they are going to have to switch to Sorghum. It is tough when you see the floods in Pakistan. I mean, nobody expected that. If the goal of climate was to make us pay attention, wow, that is way beyond expectation. So some adaptation money literally will just be disaffirming the recovery money. The boundary of what's also pretty confusing. I mean, what is food aid? If climate is causing some food production losses, all world food program money, is that all climate adaptation money? It's certainly the need for it's going up. That's a system that's about 6.5 billion a year. So relative to the systemic solution, which is the research piece, it's relatively larger. But the demand for that piece, which is the acute half-a-pactostani rice got flushed away. And so you're going to have malnutrition problems. If you don't go in for that, that's also a type of adaptation. And so I do think we're going to bring some rigor to this because the pressure now, the goal of doubling the adaptation money from, they say, 20 billion here to 40 billion here, the pressure on that is the problem. We still peanuts. No, it's very small. I mean, literally, yeah, if you start sticking food aid in there, you can use it up very quickly, rebuilding after hurricanes. I mean, we had hurricanes before, but the costs there are absolutely gigantic. There are ways of stopping wildfires that are ways of dealing with sea level rise. So the innovation agenda, not just on seeds, the innovation agenda is going full speed on mitigation. That's where there's 100 companies break through energy's funded. And by mitigation, you mean mostly energy. You mean everything to do with energy. You mean generation of energy. You mean batteries. You mean transport. You mean all of the new. And there are some renewables that are already traditional, but more that need to come on. So that's the package that you're talking about mitigation. Yeah. Are you also talking about agriculture as mitigation? Yeah. So every area of emissions, the world tends to focus on passenger cars and electricity. That's not a third of emissions. And so the focus on the easiest third, now 4% of new cars are electric. So that's the field that we're furthest along. About 4% of energy generation is wind and solar. And as you triple the size of your grid, you want that to be say, some people would say 100%. Other people might say 70% to 80%. The amount you have to build, we're not within a factor of 5 of the build rate of those. But those are the easy sectors. Cement, clean cement costs over twice as much as the way we make cement today. And it's partly the heating energy. It's partly the basic thing. Remember in chemistry, when you take calcium carbonate and heat it, you get calcium. That's what makes cement. But the thing that goes away, that's CO2. And so we have to have a way of making cement, which a number of these innovative. And a steel and iron. Yep. There's a whole family of hard to obeyed sectors. That's true. If you get a dead industrial sector, if you get green hydrogen that's cheap enough, it actually solves quite a large number of those. Some of the industrial processes should go straight to electricity. And some you go through, you do your reduction using the hydrogen, where you would have used some hydrocarbon concept before. For steel, we actually have companies doing both. We have electric steel and others doing electricity is the way of replacing the blast furnace. And then we have others that take hydrogen. And if you get the hydrogen cheap enough, you get the super magic thing, which is that the green product doesn't cost more. That's called green premium equals zero. And then your adoption scale is other.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3437,2022-10-16 06:49:58
15152," Actually, the thing, which is that the green product doesn't cost more, that's called green premium equals zero. And then your adoption scale is utterly different. If we try to subsidize steel and cement, say rich countries say, OK, we want to get rid of that, which those two are 15% of emissions, that's greater than all foreign aid budgets put together. And so over 200 billion foreign aid never will pass that number. It's just not politically possible. It's a number that's at about 170 and going down today. Coming up, but more from the panelists and finalists here at the Earth Shop Prize Innovation side. This is Blue Bright. OK, so you're moving in on me quick. Just trying to be with your fancy hands. I'm going to deal with your night because it's really bothering me. My night? Yeah. He's a troublemaker. Yeah. What did you get up to this weekend? You know, just robot stuff. A lot of chess. I was practicing for you. I know you're pretty good. Ooh, I don't like that. I will take this. Uh, put it over here here. Not cool. Not cool. All right. I will, I will concede. I can see. Ah. Got me, Bid. Very good game. Well played. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Welcome back to the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit. Finalists of the annual award appeared alongside special guests, including worldwide business leaders, philanthropists, and non-governmental activists. Now, while the 2022 finalists have been announced, our panelists have their eyes on the future, and here's what they have to say. This is the Earth Shop Decade. We are in a race to repair and regenerate the planet. Some will focus on policy. Some will focus on activism. We are focused on supporting the game changers, the innovators, the entrepreneurs and the problem solvers. We believe in the power of human ingenuity, grit and determination to create solutions that if scaled could repair the planet. We have only 8% of the ocean protected today, and our Earth Shop is, as Pati said, 30 by 30. 30% of the ocean at least, 30% of the ocean protected by 2030. And we know that if we protect the right 30%, not only will we prevent the extinction of many marine species, but also we will produce more fish. There's going to be these protected areas are going to produce a spillover that will exceed the foreground catch. So we're going to have more fish to eat, food security, livelihoods for people. And we know that for every dollar that we invest in a protected area in a marine reserve, that produces 10 dollars in economic output and creates more jobs. So it's a triple win for marine life, for food security, and for climate. And of course, for the economy. So that's the goal, the mission, to in the next 8 years, and that's where the Earth Shop is pretty crazy. In the next 8 years, we need to quadruple all the ocean protection that has ever happened in human history. Are you optimistic, Doug?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3438,2022-10-16 06:53:43
15153," In the next eight years, we need to quadruple all the ocean protection that has ever happened in human history. Are you optimistic that I can be done? I am optimistic, there's no choice. I've seen firsthand the potential that a breakthrough idea can hold, and if we start seeing more of these transformative solutions across all the challenges facing our planet, and suddenly our earth shot won't seem so improbable. The work will be difficult, it'll take extraordinary resources, determination, partnership, but we've got all the essentials right here in this room. So what is the challenge? It's the speed, scale, and cost of making these green hydrogen generators. Well, that's exactly what we are working on. Because to make green hydrogen the fuel source of the future, it needs to be cheaper than fossil fuels. And that means, electrolyzers are going to need to be really, really cheap. If you want to take a solution around the globe as quickly as possible, you need to make it standardized, mass-produced commodity. A product that is easy to make and quick to build and cheap as well. And so, while some believe electrolyzers need to be large machines, we believe the electrolyzer should be a standardized, mass-producible product that can make green hydrogen anywhere for anyone. In 2030, we imagine millions and millions of projects on restore. And not just places on earth where we see nature being brought back, but all of the other nodes that are key to ensuring success. So the technology providers, the nurseries, the seed banks, the funders, the government incentive programs, so that we have an ecosystem that really allows us to leverage the many, many connections within the nature-based solution space. And in 2030, we have been focused on another key area, which is cities. And cities require data and insights to take action on climate and to preserve nature, to create more nature-entry canopy. So we've set a goal that we want to- We need more nature in cities, exactly. Exactly, right. And so we've been partnering with cities like Los Angeles to give them insights utilizing AI and geomapping on where all the places that you can create more tree canopy, which reduces urban heat islands, improves air quality sequesters carbon. So we want to bring data and solutions to bringing nature into cities, as well as, of course, preserving and restoring nature. And so one of the goals that we've set is we want to enable over 500 cities around the world, and we're going to hear from the mayor of Paris after this, to reduce a gigaton of carbon emissions by 2030. And so that's through data, tools, and sites, whether that's evolving transportation systems or planting new tree canopy. So that's a big bold target that we want to see achieve by 2030. Anyway, I guess I'm in the wrong place. I came here to invite all of you to the Grouch Convention. But it turns out you're all about my least favorite thing. Helping. Oh, you've got me, Oscar. I do like helping people learn how to reuse, repurpose, and recycle. Together, everyone in this room can build a world where nothing goes to waste. And that includes even you. Me? Sorry, my guy. I got to get going to that convention. But just between us. Yes. I do have a recycling bin right next to my can. But no, let that get out okay. It'll ruin my image. But my father believed in the power of the idea. And over time, the vision, the purpose, the courage, it embodied, has inspired each generation to take on its own challenges. Not because they're easy, but because they're hard. President Kennedy understood that the effort to land on the moon would bring out the best in us that everyone would have to contribute, that it would require innovation, creativity, teamwork, commitment, and faith. And that world would be better because of it. But the earth shot prize has inspired the same spirit of optimism and...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3439,2022-10-16 06:58:08
15154," Commitment and faith, and that world will be better because of it. The Earth Shot Prize has inspired the same spirit of optimism and ingenuity on a global scale to tackle the most pressing challenge we now face, repairing the planet. My family and I are so excited that the Prince of Wales will honor this year's Earth Shot Prize winners in partnership with the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, a city that is committed to scientific excellence, environmental justice, and the fight against climate change. We're proud that President Kennedy's moonshot legacy still inspires hope, and we look forward to welcoming all of you who are working to ensure a better future here on Earth. And that's all from the Earth Shot Prize Innovation Summit. You can find complete coverage of the event, including full interviews and articles on Bloomberg.com. I'm Francing Lackwap from New York, and this is Bloomberg. At some point you had to fight for the trademark, right, for the red soul. Is that stressful? Very stressful. Very stressful. Especially, we are a small company in a way, and we have to fight people who have those huge companies who put you 27 lawyers on your back for something which is very stressful. I wish it didn't happen. Everything which happened to me is a lesson in a way that are good, and once it's done, it's done, and I'm happy about it. That thing I could have definitely avoided. It's done. Did you realize at the time when you started the company that you would become so successful? And actually so big. No, no. You know, when I started the company, I wanted to have a shop in Paris, which is my hometown, and I wanted to do pretty shoes for pretty girls. That was my goal. Now you look back and you say, actually, I still make pretty shoes, but for many more women. Yeah, absolutely. Do you think you would have been so successful without the red soul? I think the red soul definitely, of course, participates to my work, but also to the fame of my shoes because it's instantly recognizable. But then, you know, the design is very important. But definitely, when you have such a strong sign of recognition, it participates to, yeah. You will shed light on dark matter. You will make aging optional. You will turn 5G up to 11. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer, disrupt. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world recalibrates. After decades of stagnation, Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation. Corporate giants, policymakers and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that. Every week on Japan ahead, right here on Bloomberg Television. One of those industries that might have been taken for granted, that's not the case anymore. Due to all the turbulence over the last two years, customers are now realizing how important it is to have a reliable logistics partner on their side. Our people are doing a quite complex job. People think, oh, they just deliver parts of somewhere, that's an easy thing. If you think about what our people are doing, it's quite complex. Our businesses and consumers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3440,2022-10-16 07:02:23
15155," A quiet complex drop. People think, oh, they just delivered passes somewhere. That's an easy thing. If you think about what our people are doing, it's quite complex. Businesses and consumers are suddenly thinking a lot more about how things they need reach places where they're needed. It's thrust the sector into the spotlight. Logistics and supply chain has become a household need. It's dramatically different than three pandemic. Yes, it's grown, whether that's in market power, revenue, profitability, investor interest. For Deutsche Post DHL Group, that's created opportunity to build on momentum and set ambitious goals for service and performance. When you look at our footprint, you're the most international logistics company there is. We want to become more digital and we want to be much more sustainable than we have been. DP DHL's revenue has soared since 2020 with full-year profit nearly doubling in 2021. CFO Melanie Christ is a key leader of the team that's delivered these results. And she views her role as much more than just a number cruncher. There are unfortunately these clichÃ©s that finance is boring and it's kind of like been counting in the back office to be successful in finance. I mean, you have to have the financial expertise, right? But we also have to be credible business leaders in order to really impact the business and steer the direction. She is extremely smart and bright. You need somebody who is able to digest a lot of information that rapidly and can distinguish what is important, what is less important. She has tremendous skill in that. And she's not afraid to call people out, to call out other members of the executive team if she feels that something isn't being. She does that in a very nice way, actually. She helps meet tremendously in steering of the company because she is highly regarded by my other colleagues in the senior team. And typically, if they have a problem, they share at first with her before they come to me. When I think about the conversations I have with Frank, the shortest part is actually about the analysis and the facts. It's more the debate about, okay, on that basis, what are the options? What can we do? My role is essentially saying in three sentences, what is working well in this company, where do we have challenges, and what should we do going forward? Deutsche Post DHL Group consists of five divisions. Express Germany's Post and Parcel Service, global forwarding and freight, supply chain and e-commerce solutions. Each of these segments has seen revenue growth in the last four years, while the surge of e-commerce volume during the pandemic has had a direct impact on the trajectory. Have you seen e-commerce as a very structural and fundamental growth driver for us as a company? What we now saw under the pandemic was a structural acceleration. It took us forward to a point in terms of e-compennatration, which we probably would have reached on the normal circumstances in three years time. So it was a big step forward. DP DHL was well prepared to take this step. The company's strategic plan recognized e-commerce as a growing trend in the logistics landscape, but no one could have forecast the speed and breadth of the transformation. What we are now seeing that also under the pandemic, not only domestic e-commerce has taken a faster growth trajectories and anticipated, but also cross-border e-commerce. And we see that very clearly in our express network, but also in our e-commerce solutions division. What are the other big structural shifts that you see on the horizon? Is it e-commerce B2B? Is it increased trade as globalisation restructures? What are the shifts that you're seeing? The would be to be e-commerce is still at a very early stage, so we believe that there will be a huge post opportunity there. And we also see that when we are talking to our customers now, I guess everybody has been now realized that being dependent on just one supplier in one province in one country is probably not a good idea. So they want to build more resilience into the supply chain. I think our international footprint, our global strengths, is really something we can leverage for the benefit of our customers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3441,2022-10-16 07:06:57
15156," It's really something we can leverage for the benefit of our customers. Another factor in the company's favour is its balance sheet. Since Melanie Christ became CFO, cash flow has improved significantly. One of my priorities over the last years has been to really focus the whole organisation on better cash generation. It's not just a finance job, making sure that ultimately a revenue convert into EBIT and into cash and the bank account. It's the responsibility of the whole organisation. She says we can't be successful as a company if we are not collecting the cash for our services we have provided. She has not missed one single opportunity to talk about that. I think it's a very comfortable situation, particularly in the current environment, to have a strong balance sheet. I think in that respect, I'm very conservative and I'd rather have a bit more on the balance sheet and a bit more buffer. Spell out for us what the priorities are, the longer-term priorities, in terms of putting some of that cash to use for you. The first priority here is organic growth. We clearly indicated also this our CAPEX budget, 12 billion for the next three years, that we will keep investing into organic growth. We are very focused on our regular dividend payment. And then, if there is something left, which is fortunately the case at the moment, we will think about inorganic opportunities and we will also think about other means to allow our shareholders to participate. That is why we are currently running a 2 billion euro share-bite programme. Inorganic opportunities include M&A, like the recent purchase of beverage shipper, Hila brand. But deploying cash is always subject to careful consideration. Does Melanie ever turn around and say no when you're pushing through or pushing for a particular package of spending? Yes, she does that quite often, because she has... She is a person and that's great if you have a CEO who is riskabrous because you need somebody. The business is always too optimistic. Melanie might be something too pessimistic, but that's a very healthy discussion. If we then jointly come to the same conclusion after a debate, then we are probably in the right spot. How often do you find yourself saying no to divisional heads? When I was promoted into the CFO position, my team gave me a stamp with rejected. It sits on my desk. I think the fact that people know it sits there already has instilled quite a lot of discipline in the organisation. So I think when I get a proposal, it has already gone through a number of iterations and is normally of such a high quality that I don't need the rejected stamp too often. For the time being, Christ should be able to keep that stamp in a drawer. CEO Frank Appell has expressed a commitment to service quality and confidence that customers will accept higher prices that come with it. If you are too expensive, you will be out of business, but if you don't provide the right quality, you will be out of business as well. So we want to be, we will never be the cheapest in town that's not too big of a premium provider. That's our strategy. Of course, it's also more challenging for us when our customers are under pressure. At the same time, I think, over all the last two years have shown that reliable high quality supply chain comes at a certain price tag. I definitely see that inflation is having a huge impact on the logistics industry. And there's been substantial price increases in the last few years. I do not see that changing. There's a lot of innovation happening. And I don't see the inflation necessarily going away. It might level out a bit, but it's not going to go away. The logistics companies may have pricing power with customers, but their stock prices haven't been so robust. I think that the issue there is the increase in interest rates has made everyone rethink and be concerned about the level of inventory that is out, you know, in the system, if you will, and with the level of disruption. I think what's happened more in the last. The premiums is the more of a view that we're actually heading into. Certainly any comics slow down, maybe a recession.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3442,2022-10-16 07:11:18
15157," Last, the next pre-mance is the more of a view that we're having into. Certainly, in the coming slowdown, maybe a recession. With more than half its revenue coming from Europe, investors may see DPDHL as more exposed to recession risks than its global peers. The company insists it can meet its revenue targets in the event of a downturn. It's counting on diversification as a cushion. I'm not so pessimistic that there is really a deep recession at our doorstep. But even then, our portfolio is very much balanced. We are everywhere in the world, the world will not go entirely in recession. I doubt that. Would it be a stretch to suggest that DPDHL is to some extent recession proof? I wouldn't go as far as to say recession proof, but I think we are very well positioned to deal with all different types of recession scenarios due to the breadth of support for you. The balance of support for you really gives us a lot of resilience against any type of headwind. Coming up, a look at DPDHL's investments in action. Melanie Christ shows me around the company's state-of-the-art logistics hub. What I love about this building is it actually shows the big mega trends which formed our strategy 2025. This is Bloomberg. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. The pressure cooker just got far too hot in burning them for the government to handle. You foresee two-thirds of the crypto hedge funds will disappear. Are we close? The European Union will support and defend Ukraine's territorial integrity. With unmatched reach and resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. As the chief financial officer of one of the world's largest logistics companies, Melanie Christ has made her mark in global business. That's not what she originally attended today. I really wanted to go into research. I wanted to become a physicist and that was where my passion was. But then during my studies, some friends of mine started doing this strange thing. They went into management consulting. I didn't even know how to spell it and I had no idea what it was about. But what they told me was quite interesting. And so I ended up doing an internship with a consulting firm and I learned more in the two months there than I had in the last two years in my physics job at university. That is how I ended up in consulting. She started her career with three years at McKinsey, then spent four years in private equity with APAC's partners in London before joining Deutsche Post DHL Group in 2004. I was brought into the company to do international M&A project. That was at a time around 20 years ago when we were really building the company in the current shape, acquiring lots of logistics companies around the world. The M&A part was the first thing and I then wandered into a more mainstream finance field here in the group becoming the CFO of our DHL Express division. So from then on it was more leading towards the CFO role eventually. Maloney Christ now heads the finance team with around 11,000 employees. Success in this role is as much an art as a science. If you do the greatest piece of analysis and you see it all and you know it all but you can't convey that message and you can't convince the rest of the organization that we should move into a certain direction it's useless. DP DHL is sending a consistent message with its investments. The company spent 123 million euros to upgrade its logistic center at the Cologne-Bahn Airport designing it around key strategic goals. What I love about this building is it actually shows the big mega trends which formed our strategy 2025 which was inaugurated in 2019 when this building opened. So globalization connecting the birds. Ecomers we have a lot of sortation facilities here for smaller ecomers shipments. Sustainability it's a very sustainable building. There's solar panels on the roof and everything.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3443,2022-10-16 07:15:35
15158," First, we have a lot of sortation facilities here for smaller e-commerce shipments. Sustainability, it's a very sustainable building, there's solar panels on the roof and everything, and digitalisation, and well, you can obviously see that it is quite automated. How did the team pitch this investment to you initially? And how hard was it as a sell for them? How quickly did you turn around and say, yes, this is worth the 123 million euros? Of course, you always have to make sure that you have the right capacity for the growth in the network. And at that time, they came and said, hey, we will really see a strong growth in e-commerce volumes on top of the regular B2B growth. We need more sorting capacity, we need this building. And of course, there are always debates, does it really have to cost 123 million euros and so on? But fortunately, they convinced us, because then with COVID and the volume search, we urgently needed the capacity. At the same time as COVID accelerated demand for logistic services, disruptions in the labour supply hurt productivity. Advances and technology like this digital sauter have helped offset some pressures, but automation also raises questions. Does this tell us that this is the business grows? This is going to become a more automated business, that there's going to be less need for labour for workers. Well, you still see people here, and I think what you can nicely, what you can see is the combination of technology which supports people. So for example, when you look at the customs area, it used to be a very manual and sometimes confusing process. Now the people are supported in picking the right treatments for customs inspections by lights and they are automatically sorted in this sauter to go to customs inspections. So it is also helping the people with the jobs they're doing here every day. We have the set here in 2019-20. You know, we might get one-third less jobs in the current setup until 2030, if we digitalise the organisation, but we are very sure that our company will be at least 50, maybe 100% bigger and we will have more jobs to offer than that. At the beginning of a couple of years ago, when we started that journey, people said, oh, you know, I might lose my job. I haven't heard that in the last two years as a question in any tone hall. This airport hub also showcases DP DHL's aviation fleet, which both small than 320 dedicated cargo aircraft. The biggest chunk of our aircraft, but we also have short and medium and long-term visas and visit growth in our business, we anticipate that the people keep going. You've talked about investing, of course, in sustainable fuel. Yes. When does that come online? How significant is it? Is it just the critics might say that's just window dressing around a part of the business that is, of course, very carbon intensive? At least a lot of emissions. Yes. You absolutely write the problem with our beautiful aircraft is the CO2 emissions. And when you look at our overall CO2 emissions, two-thirds are from aviation. It is about flying these birds with more sustainable fuel. And we said that we're really willing to spend billions on it. We now really hope that we will see the uptick in supply over the next years. Spending billions isn't vague hyperbole. The company has pledged to put seven billion euros towards sustainable technologies and fuels by 2030, with a goal of climate neutral logistics by 2050. Sustainability makes good business sense anyway, especially if you are in a business that is energy or fuel hungry as a compliance element that not just operators in the logistics sector need to consider, but also their customers. So being transparent becomes part of the service about their impact on the globe. We had a lengthy discussion. Should we make a financial commitment? How much we want to invest for the next decade in our sustainability? We had a long debate. Is it right to say we want to invest seven billion until 2030? There were pros and cons. But that was a very intense discussion melody in I-Hart, where we finally came to the conclusion that this is a right number. This is a right approach. We convinced our colleague and that's the reason why we are where we are, where we are seen as somebody who really commit. They're not that many companies who have quantified their future investment.

I think the great thing is that now across the board, in finance, but also in the group overall, we have role models which show young female talent that everything is possible. This is Bloomberg. Why do the biggest names in business choose Bloomberg? That would be great questions. It's a great question. Great question. I guess question I get all night. Bloomberg, top experts, great questions. Imagine simply climbing a cable into space. The concept is known as the space elevator. But only could it significantly change how we leave planet Earth. But it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space. And there are scientists who think we could have already built it. We have the material. We have the technology. We have the lasers. We have the climbers. We have all of it. If a private entity wants to build it, or a government, they can build it. It'll change society. We have no clue how colonizing in the space, how really spreading out in the space, really change our society over the next 50 to 200 years. It'll be completely different.

Deutsche Post DHL Group's CFO Melanie Christ is often named to lists of the most powerful women in business. While men still outnumber women as finance heads of large companies, there are signs that the balance is shifting. The number of female CFOs across major US companies has risen to an all-time high, according to a study by Chris Coulder Associates. And executive search firm Cohen Partners reports that 36% of new CFOs hired by notable companies in the first half of 2022 were women. I asked Melanie Christ if she's encountered obstacles as a woman rising through the executive ranks. I have to say, I have not made many negative experiences. Maybe I was also a little bit in the even thought thinking about these challenges so much. So when I studied physics, there weren't many women, so I was somehow always used to it. And it can also be an advantage when you're kind of like the only girl in the room. I mean, the boss at the end remembers your name and not the 19 guys who all kind of like were to suit and white shirts and look alike, right? So I never experienced it as an external stress factor. I have to say for me personally, it was more balancing my own expectations around kind of like getting family and the job combined. But that was probably more of a pressure I put on myself thinking that I had to be perfect in every dimension and not something where the pressure was put on me from my male colleagues. So how do you take that experience and put it to play in terms of how you...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3445,2022-10-16 07:24:05
15160," Redimension and not something where the pressure was put on me from my male colleagues. Hmm. So how do you take that experience and put it to play in terms of how you advance the role of women in this organisation? I think the great thing is that now across the board, in finance but also in the group overall, we have role models which show young female talent that everything is possible. In finance, we have a share of women in management of 32 percent. So we are ahead of the group. We want to get to 35 percent by 2025. I think we are now at a position where if we have a vacancy, I want to have at least one woman on the shortlist. Because we have enough female talent. So every shortlist should contain a woman and then the best person in the race should win. CEO Frank Appell says Christ sets an example for the entire organisation. And he believes her success may influence the entire industry. She has proven that she is an outstanding CEO for all. And she's definitely a role model in many dimensions that you know what I like about there. She is still you know a very warm and nice person and that makes such a big difference. So you can get to that level without compromising on how nice you are as a person. I think she's a great role model and I hope that this has had positive impact for many others. From the big picture down to the smallest operational details, Melanie Christ is fully engaged in guiding DP DHL into the future. I wanted to know what she sees when she looks ahead. What juice is the biggest opportunities for DP DHL over the next 10 years? I think we have a fantastic portfolio and we just have to leverage the growth opportunities which are there both on the ECOM site and also on the traditional B2B site. And the key differentiators for us will be digitalisation, sustainability and our great people. As you look ahead 10 years, what are some of the challenges? What keeps you up at night as you think about the business going forward? I think we have to keep this focus and the ability to adjust in a very agile way. Sometimes when you kind of think about all the risk controlling and stuff, people tend to create the impression that you can preplan everything, that's clearly not the case. So I think we have to stay focused and keep the ability to react in a very agile way. But looking at what happened over the last 24 months, I'm very optimistic that we will also be able to cope with whatever happens next. And how do you see your role changing in the years ahead? I think it is changing at a very rapid pace, which is a great thing because it never gets boring. Those elements I just mentioned for the group overall, digitalisation and sustainability are also hugely relevant for the finance role. It's like a new language you have to learn. And you learn the vocabulary, but then you also have to develop a feeling if I kind of put so much capital into this decarbonisation measure, I get so much in terms of return out of it. But that's a fascinating opportunity where we can make a huge difference for finance and for the group overall. As you look to the future Melanie, what do you think is going to be the skill sets, the knowledge bases, they're going to be essential to the success of future CFOs? Yes, probably the two most essential new skills will be to get even better at lifelong learning, because we will have to learn so much new stuff every year. Be it in the digitalisation area, be it on sustainability. So this ability also has a 50 year plus old person to keep learning and keep the curiosity. I think that is going to be super essential and the second element will be being a great team player. The world is complex, you can't know it all, so you really have to work even more strongly with your team. What advice would you give to someone who's just recently been appointed CFO? That's a great question. I think I would probably simply say, be curious and ask as many questions as you can. Try to learn as much as possible, not only in the finance area, but get close to the business, try to really understand the business, because only when you are close to the business and you understand the fundamental profit drivers will be a really great CFO. I'm Tom McKenzie.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3446,2022-10-16 07:28:34
15161," We understand the business because only when you are close to the business and you understand the fundamental profit drivers, will you be a really great seeker? I'm Tom McKenzie. This is Bloomberg. We don't have enough women, founder CEOs who are getting funding. So basically less than 2% of VC funds go to women, less than 1% go to women of color. And so in this innovation space, I said to myself, what's the best way to use capital to move things for women? And that's when I started to say, okay, I actually need to move some money into the venture capital space. And I want to do it smartly. I mean, the first goal is to make money. I'm not putting my money out as a social impact. I'm putting it out to make money. But I wanted to go behind funds like aspect ventures that's run by Theresa Gao and Jennifer Fondstadt, who are looking at these opportunities. And they have a thesis around my gosh. There are so many opportunities there if we go towards funding some of these women businesses. Some LPs have said to me, all we care about is returns. Some of the best investors may not be the best people, but they have the best returns. What do you have to say to those people? I have to say you're investing in what you know. And so you need to look at what trends are coming in the nation and how you're going to dress them. Women are 85% of consumer dollars spent. Women control 70% of financial decisions in the house. So if you're not investing in products that go towards females or women led company, you're missing an opportunity because you just don't see it. We make it very transparent to the shopper before they accept an order. What's the order? It's going to look like how much we're going to pay them and how much the consumer is paying them. And so they can decide whether they take an order or whether they refuse it. And that's a kind of flexibility. That's our shoppers really value and the kind of transparency that they want. Are you seeing a labor shortage right now? And what are you doing to combat that? It's different in different places. Or demographic of shoppers is completely different from food delivery and our right sharing. We're 70% women and half of them are moms. And that's because a lot of the job at Instacart is very different and just being in a car with strangers. It's about like going to the store, doing a good job of customer service of really picking the right products for the consumer. And we are seeing that being very appealing to women.

I guess this week is the Pulitzer Prize winning American photographer Lindsay Adario, Ukraine, Afghanistan, South Sudan, to name but a few, she has been there with her camera at the majority of the conflicts in the 21st century. I want to hear about the stories behind those images and what it's like living, working, existing on the front lines of these waltz. Lindsay thank you so much for joining me and joining all of our viewers. I know it's rare for you to be sitting in a seat safely. Away from what you're covering normally with your camera. You've come to the world attention many times with your work over the years but very recently at the beginning of this year, in fact just a few weeks after the war started in Ukraine. You did come to the attention.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3447,2022-10-16 07:32:58
15162," many times with your work over the years, but very recently, at the beginning of this year, in fact, just a few weeks after the war started in Ukraine, you did come to the attention of many people because you took a photo of a Ukrainian family, of for trying to cross a bridge who had been killed and that photo ended up on the front pages of the New York Times. Can you tell me a bit about how you came to that scene? So I went and I went directly to the east and was covering the east for about 10 days before the war started. When the war began, I went to Kiev and immediately was covering sort of daily missile strikes and the destruction and those who had been killed and injured. And so one day I was watching images come out from the wires and others who went to the European Bridge and there were, you know, hundreds of civilians crossing the elderly, women, children crossing out of your peen and all of those suburbs. And so we made our way toward the bridge through side roads and as we approached, there were injured, the territorial defense soldiers were taking injured over to sort of a brick wall off to the side. So we ran across the street and almost as soon as we got behind that wall, a round came in. So it was either a mortar round or a tank shell, we're not sure. It came in and hit sort of off to the distance. And then the Ukrainian military fired back. And so my security adviser said, would you like to go? And I said no because everyone knows this is a civilian evacuation route. And they're not, those rounds are probably going toward a Ukrainian base that's off in the distance. But how wrong I was. The next round came in closer. And so we dove for cover. And as soon as we pop back up, the next round came in right next to us essentially. And it was sort of equidistant between us and a mother and her two children and a church volunteer that was helping us for them to safety. It was very chaotic. And obviously we were all sort of in shock because the round had landed very close to us. Everything was very dusty. And our security adviser immediately went to the aid of the injured and to a soldier who was nearby. And by the time he called us over, you know, the protocol as we wait to be told, you know, it's clear you can come. And so by the time he called us over, I ran across the street not knowing what to expect. Obviously I knew there was someone injured, but I anticipated it being a soldier. And although there were civilians crossing steadily and even during the strike, I mean because nothing was shielded. So people had to continue to move. And so when I got there, I came upon these four lifeless bodies. Of course, I didn't know if they were dead or alive at that point. I noticed sort of the tiny little moon boots of a child. And as a mother, that was sort of a sort of incredibly jarring and devastating moment. And I was trying to survey, but I was also kind of in shock. And I one side of my brain was sort of saying, you have to start photographing. And you have to take these pictures because I knew that I had just witnessed, you know, something that was an intentional targeting of civilians. And so I took a few photographs, but rounds were still coming in. So we were, our security adviser Steve was saying, you know, hurry up, work very quickly. And we have to leave. And so I kind of moved around the scene and taking a few photographs, thinking in my head also, I have to be respectful. And you know, perhaps I shouldn't show the faces. So I was trying to take pictures that show the faces and that didn't show the faces. So that we had some options. Well, the image you, I'm talking about, certainly the version I've seen, you don't necessarily look at the faces actually the way now you've said that, the way that you look at the image. You can, I can't see them, but you can't see them. It's more you look at the scene of a family. Exactly. And so I've been doing this for, I've been covering war for over 20 years. And I know that there are so many images I've taken that have never been published because there.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3448,2022-10-16 07:37:17
15163," I've been doing this for, I've been covering war for over 20 years and I know that there are so many images I've taken that have never been published because they're, they're graphic. And so I was thinking of that as I was shooting as horribles, that sounds because obviously I've just witnessed the most devastating scene, but I'm also a photojournalist and that's my job. And so I was, I was trying different angles and frankly I, I didn't think the picture could ever be published because it was civilians. Do you know, do you know the impacts of that photo? Yeah, I mean, it's been used by the, by I think the United States ambassador to the United Nations to talk about the intentional targeting of civilians. It's been used repeatedly as proof that civilians were targeted because I was there. I witnessed the run up and I, and I know that whoever was firing those rounds was bracketing onto that position.

But there's an incoming revolution on the high seas that isn't quite as sexy but could be significantly more impactful. The key component of global trade, about 80% and 90% of all the world's goods are transported to sea at some point. But there's a significant unseen cost to the modern era of global commerce. About 3% of all the world's CO2 emissions come from shipping. 3% may not sound like a lot, but that's roughly comparable to the entire CO2 output of Germany. Since reducing trade isn't a likely option, what about a technological improvement? To help reduce the emissions from these well stock maritime behemoths. You mentioned being a mother. Has that changed? The job... Yeah, I mean, it's definitely changed the job in the sense that I'm more cautious now than I was before I had children. I think to a normal person who doesn't do this for a living, they probably can't see that. But for me making decisions on a minute-to-minute basis in a war zone, I know I'm being more cautious. I know I'm not going all the way to the front or as far forward as some of my colleagues might be going. You also are now seeing, perhaps, when you see an image... When you see the reality of a child who is dead in front of you, would have always affected you. I imagine. Has it changed, though? Yes, it has changed. I think I photographed... I have photographed children dying in Iraq, in Afghanistan, in Somalia, during the Horn of Africa drought in 2011. And it was always devastating. But I think now as a mother, the first thing I do is sort of put myself in the shoes of that mother. And I know, you know, I live in constant fear that something will happen to my children. So you're trying to keep yourself safe, but you're also trying to document at the same time. Of course. I'm perhaps processing it in a slightly different way. I mean, are you... Would you say you have...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3449,2022-10-16 07:41:31
15164," yourself safe, but you're also trying to document at the same time. Of course. And perhaps processing it in a slightly different way. I mean, would you say you have become desensitized, though? No. I do have to be in any way. No, not at all. I mean, I think I have ways of dealing with my emotion in that moment. But part of that is just really focusing on the task at hand, which is making photographs and looking through the viewfinder that definitely helps me focus on taking pictures. But I'm not desensitized at all. I mean, I cry pretty much all the time when I'm photographing. I get very, very emotional. And that's OK. I mean, I don't have an issue with that. I don't know what my colleagues think of me, but I think it's normal. I mean, I'm a human being. And do you think you talk about hanging back because of the risk as well, not necessarily going straight to the front? And yet, when I asked you about that particular image, it sounded like it's very instinctive. When you know you're not where you need to be and you are heading towards danger. Correct. And that's obviously what I struggle with because if I'm close and something happens a little closer or a little further from me, but closer to the front line, I'll likely go. But I think where I'm positioning myself is sort of a little removed back and then making judgment calls every day. If I hear that the school has been hit and 30 children have been killed, I will go. If I hear that a building has been hit on the front line, but no civilians were killed, I'm likely not to go. So I'm weighing sort of what will I gain from risking my life? Although that building's been hit, but no civilians have been killed. I mean, this talks to the idea of not you per se, but a criticism of those in your field of being war junkies, trying to find the very worst to document. And being in places they don't need to be, sometimes causing perhaps more risk. What do you say to that? You know, for me, the highest hall of war is civilian casualties. So that's not being a war junkie. That is documenting reality. And the reality is we are in a situation where one country has invaded another and every civilian who dies is on account of that invasion. And so I think that if I'm in a position and civilians are being killed, I have to document that. That is a very important part of the job of someone who covers conflict. I'm presumably that for you in this work that you do, you don't obviously just cover war, you cover humanitarian disaster, climate change, the effects on the planet on that. But when it is about civilians, it sounds like the justification you have to make to yourself, to your family, and to those who could be critical, is that you are providing evidence. Yeah, and that evidence has been used already by the United Nations. Have you taken pictures of people killing others of the actual killers before? Yeah. I mean, I've taken pictures of people who have been accused of killing others, but I have not been there sort of in the moment. I just wonder what that's like as well. You know, seeing people do the very worst they can do to each other. I think people are very smart about journalists. You know, they obviously don't allow us access to things when they are killing civilians. You know, I think that there was a time in the Korngall Valley. I was with the American troops, the 173rd Airborne. I had spent two months living on the side of a mountain with the 173rd, me and a colleague Elizabeth Rubin for the New York Times magazine. And the point was to understand the nuances of the war and why so many civilians were dying in Afghanistan. And in fact, Lieutenant Colonel Oslohn, who was the commander of the Korngall Valley, was very smart because he had this philosophy of transparency because he believed that journalists needed to understand sort of the nuances of war to understand why civilians were being killed. And so we were in Operation Rock Avalanche, which was in the movie The Documentary Restrepo, I don't know if you've seen it, but it's extraordinary. And so we were in that operation where we've jumped out of helicopters in the middle of the night into the heart of Taliban territory, literally walked with everything we own.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3450,2022-10-16 07:46:03
15165," And so we were in that operation where we've jumped out of helicopters in the middle of the night into the heart of Taliban territory, literally walked with everything we owned for six days, and eventually we were ambushed by the Taliban. And we were ambushed from three sides, and there was a huge gun battle, three soldiers were shot, one was killed, and in the retaliation of the American troops, I was standing with some of the soldiers, everyone was very shaken up, of course. And one of the soldiers said, look, they're using Afghan women and children as human shields, and he literally had me look through the scope of his gun, and there were women and children on the roofs of the building where they were shooting from. And that is a case where it was incredible to witness, and I could only have witnessed that if I, because I had spent so much time with these troops, and really was willing to risk my life and to be there in the middle of Operation Wakabalai. A shot you took during that maneuver, we're going to take a look at that. Can you take me through it? There is an image, the aftermath of that ambush, where it's a very dusty picture, it is a scout team carrying the body of Sergeant Rughal, and he's in a body bag, and it was after that. And the scout team, Clainard, who is sort of leading the way, is crying, and they're walking through this very sort of desolate landscape. And I remember shooting that photograph and asking myself, what are we doing here? What are we doing here? Years after 9-11, fighting in the middle of the mountains where there are no people. And it just felt like such a waste that this young man had died for nothing. And in fact, a few years later, the American troops pulled out entirely from that area. There's another image of yours I wanted to bring to mind and for us to have a look at and talk about an 18-year-old woman in labor stranded in 2009. Tell me about that and how that came about. So in 2009, I won a MacArthur Fellowship, that is in America, it's called the Genius Grant. And it's essentially given to all different disciplines from Achilles to a scientist to a photographer, where I was paid a salary for five years with no strings attached to just focus on my work. And I felt a lot of pressure to decide what to focus on with my work, because it was the first time I could decide not be assigned a story. And so I started doing research and I decided to focus on maternal mortality and why over 500,000 women a year were dying in childbirth at that point. This was 2009, as you said. And Afghanistan, where I had been working for a decade at that point, had one of the highest rates of maternal death in the world. And that was because there was such a bad road network, people, women who were pregnant or in labor didn't have access necessarily to medical professionals or to clinics or hospitals that were staffed with doctors. They just couldn't get where they needed to. They just couldn't get where they needed to. And so I went to very remote villages in Badaksham province, which was one of these provinces with high numbers. And on the way back, I was riding with Dr. Ziba, who was also helping me translate. And we noticed these two women on the side of a mountain. And there was not a man with them, which in Afghanistan is very rare. So I stopped the car and said, what are you doing here? Do you need help? And it turned out the woman on the right, Norene So was in labor. And Norene So's husband's first wife had died in childbirth. And he was so determined to not lose her that he managed to get a car in the village. But when we met them, their car had broken down. So they were stranded on the side of the road. And we'll just get my car. I'll take you to the hospital. We're going toward Faisabad, which was the capital of the state. And they said, no, we need permission from the husband. So we'll wait. And so I turned to Dr. Ziba and I said, OK, you have to find the husband. There's one road in the whole province. He's obviously on the road. So she found him, of course, pretty quickly and brought him back in the whole car.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3451,2022-10-16 07:50:13
15166," find the husband there's one road in the whole province he's obviously on on the road you know so she found him of course pretty quickly and brought him back in the whole car the whole family piled in my car and we took them to the hospital and everyone asked me if she delivered safely and if I took photographs and yes she delivered safely but no I did not take photographs because I felt like I changed the course of that story with my presence by taking them so took a photo I took about three frames and that photograph is one of those frames and that's when you had met and just seen it's so striking the blue exactly I met them we asked their story and then we asked permission right before Zeba left to find the husband we asked permission for me to take a few photographs It is crucially important and I think we've moved from this attitude, from its indulgence a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s and so it makes it a really exciting field because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harness to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts, but if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what you bring, figures out why you're sleeping. Do you think on balancing a woman has been a help to you? A huge help. Being a woman, rather than a insurance. Yes, everyone thinks it's a hindrance, but in fact it's a huge help because people, first of all, I've access to men and women and particularly when I'm working in countries like Afghanistan and Somalia where men and women are usually segregated by gender. And people underestimate women I find and they still do and so they sort of discount me and say, okay, sure, sure, go do this to me underestimates you. Yeah, I love being an officer. I love it. Yeah, it's one of those things. But I mean, I suppose on the other serious, much more serious side of it is that again, when you're thinking and calculating risks, you know, rape as a weapon of war is a unique tool wielded against women. Yes. And for me, when I was, I've been kidnapped twice. The first time was in Iraq and that was only a day and it turned out compared to Libya was quite sort of, it was manageable in the sense that we were working outside of Fulugia. I was working with a colleague from the, from the New York Times. We had heard a helicopter of American troops went down. We went to find it. We got cop-in surgeons who thought maybe we were with the, the American occupation. We finally convinced them we were journalists. They held us until dusk and then eventually let us go. Obviously, it was terrifying. We had guns to our heads for about 11 hours. We didn't know if we would survive. Libya was much more violent, much more dramatic. We were four journalists in one car. Originally, we had been two in each car, but one of the cars, one of the driver's brothers had been shot at the front line. So he quit in the middle of the battle and we ended up in one car. We had to decide how long to stay. That is not an easy discussion because with four journalists, everyone has a different perspective on how long to stay, what our needs are, how dangerous a situation is. By the time we decided to pull back east toward Benghazi, we ran into one of Qaddaq.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3452,2022-10-16 07:54:39
15167," what our needs are, how dangerous the situation is. By the time we decided to pull back east toward Benghazi, we ran into one of Kedafi's troops checkpoints. It was incredibly hostile. The rebels we had been covering started opening fire on that checkpoint, so we were literally in a wall of bullets. The men were pulled out of the car. Me is the only woman. I was sort of left sitting there because they didn't know what to do with me. But the car was not armored, so I had to get out of the car because I knew that I needed to get behind cover. I crawled across the backseat, and when I jumped out, one of Kedafi's troops sort of came to me and was pulling at my cameras. Instinctively, I was pulling back, even though there were bullets literally going, you know, next all around us. We finally made it to cover behind the sort of checkpoint building, and we're all told to lie face down on the dirt. We each had a Kalashnikov put to our heads, and we were about to be executed. We were begging for our lives. The commander came over at that point and said, you can't execute them, they're American, which this was all in Arabic and Anthony Shadee later translated for us. You know, in retrospect, I have no idea why they spared us being American because in the Middle East, a lot of people don't like our foreign policy. And so we were tied up and blindfolded. And essentially, for the next three days, we were beaten up, tied up, blindfolded, threatened with execution. And for me as the only woman I was touched repeatedly, I was not raped, but of course, in that time, being tied up and blindfolded, I thought of the many, many women I have interviewed over the years who have been raped. And so I sort of, ironically, look to them for strength because I thought, well, if they survived it, and if it happens to me, I can survive it as well. Are you living just a minute to minute? A minute to minute. Yeah, I mean, in a kidnapping, there is no sort of an hour down the line. It is literally, every second is survival mode. It is, what can I do to get through this fear? What can I do to get through this pain? It sounds like the scene from a film. And yet, it's your life. And I believe Jennifer Lawrence has been interested in your life, or there was. She was. Talk of a film. She was. We spent about three years together when Warner Brothers optioned the rights to my memoir. I wrote a memoir after that, called It's What I Do, a Photographer's Life of Love and War. And that memoir was optioned almost immediately by Warner Brothers. Steven Spielberg was slated to direct and Jennifer Lawrence was slated to play me. And that went on for three years. If not, I'm taking Jennifer Lawrence to War's Island. I took her to the border with South Sudan when it was very, very tense. She wanted to understand what it feels like to feel that fear and to be close to a war zone. Obviously, we had to worry about her safety, so I couldn't take her. You were on that show. I had to worry about her. Yeah, when would I list while you'd do the same thing? It was very stressful. Let's just say, when I put her on the plane to, you know, from Uganda, I couldn't walk for a week. My back went out. But yeah. But she eventually dropped out. And so now it is being made into a limited series. So a TV series. A TV series. Correct. But Lisa Jennifer Lawrence now knows what it's like to do your job. She does. She's just come out with a movie playing a character named Lindsay. Oh, hey. I think when she got that inspiration from... But what if you learned that from being in these scenarios, coming in and coming out of some of the worst things we can do to each other? Yeah. I mean, I guess I've learned the capacity for survival, for resilience, for forgiveness, the fact that human beings can be equally evil as they can be amazingly generous. And yeah, resilient. I think that I've learned a lot from the people I've covered. But I think we have to look at the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3453,2022-10-16 07:59:04

I think that I've learned a lot from the people I've covered, but I think we have to look at the ability of human beings to live both within those situations and to survive them after.

I think Jay Powell said things that were indefensible. Need to catch up. This is Bloomberg Wall Street week. I'm David Weston. We've got the information and insights. We think that's the next second shift from business's most influential and instrumental. It's knocking it out the bullseye. It's a challenging dynamic. This is a level of uncertainty that we haven't had to deal with. Bloomberg Wall Street week live Friday with Replays all weekend on Bloomberg Television and Radio. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. The pressure cooker just got far too hot in banning them for the government to handle. You foresee two-thirds of the crypto hedge funds will disappear. Are we close? The European Union will support and defend Ukraine's territorial integrity with unmatched reach and resources from more than 120 countries. The moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. A lot of the satellites have propulsion systems they can kind of move to get out of the way of each other or change their orbit a little bit. It's a service that you guys offer to help these companies know how to maneuver their machines. Yeah, we offer a collision avoidance service. It's a subscription service. We'll send you an alert up to seven days in advance. If your satellite is going to come dangerously close to a piece of debris or another satellite. Companies have been doing that for decades moving satellites around but it's sort of like a harder problem now. The risk of a collision is a lot higher now. Just because we've installed so much more hardware in this space. You have a big collision that creates a cloud of debris and now all the other satellites are flying through this whizzing mess of debris as we add all of the new satellites into space. The risks of the collision, the likelihood of the collisions going up. Searching in vain for solid ground in an escalating Russian war in Ukraine in a troubled global economy and goodness knows in the British authority's economic management. This is Bloomberg Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. This week, Special Interpreter Larry Summers of Harvard on the potential next shoe to drop economically. I doubt we've seen the last mine go off. Some of them may be in the private sector. I think more of them may be international. And former New Jersey governor and EPA administrator Christine Todd Whitman on a path forward on nuclear energy. No, they can't buy a huge roll at least in the transition from fossil fuels to renewables. Global Wall Street spent the week trying to get its footing after things only got worse in Ukraine as Russian missiles rained down across the country and NATO chief Yen Stolenberg had to reassure us the things weren't about to go nuclear. Russia knows that the nuclear war cannot be won.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3454,2022-10-16 08:03:07
15169," The reassurance the things weren't about to go nuclear. Russia knows that the nuclear war cannot be won. And must never be fought. The IMF released its economic projections, and its chief economist warned that a global recession just may be looming. What we see is that about a third of the global economy is going to be experiencing a contraction this year or next. And if that weren't enough, President Biden told CNN recession may come specifically to the United States. I don't think there will be a recession. If it is, it'll be a very slight recession. And then the CPI numbers came in hotter than expected with the headline number still up at 8.2% and core accelerating to 6.6% year over year. It is not a good picture here. Those who were thinking that inflation might drop off fairly quickly are going to be disappointed by the numbers here. In the meantime, over in Great Britain, we had a week of financial turmoil with a very public battle between the Bank of England and Prime Minister Trust's government, which ended up with a new chancellor of the ex-checker and her giving up on more of her controversial budget. I want to be honest, this is difficult. But we will get through this storm, and we will deliver the strong and sustained growth that can transform the prosperity of our country for generations to come. But the surprises weren't all bad this week, at least not for former Fed-share Ben Bernanke, who was awakened to learn that he shares with two others, the Nobel Prize for economics this year. It was completely unexpected. My wife and I shut off our cell phones when we went to bed last night, not thinking about this issue. And it was our daughter in Chicago who was finally contacted. It called us on the landline to inform us that this had happened. And the markets had just as hard a time as the rest of us finding its footing with the S&P suing five points between big losses and big gains on Thursday alone. After the CPI numbers came out. For the week, the S&P 500 was down 1.55%, the NASDAQ down over 3%, and yield on the 10 year was up over 13 basis points to close the week just above 4%. To help us sort out a wild week in the markets, we welcome now Joe Anfini, partner in advisors, capital management, and Liz Ansonters, chief investment strategist at Chow Schwab. So welcome back both of you to Wall Street Week. Let me start with you, Liz An. What happened this week? I feel like we had hit by a Mac truck. So I think it was probably mostly technical, the reversal that we saw yesterday on an intraday basis in the first part of the day. You didn't see the swoon take the S&P to below 3517. And I'm not a technician, but that level was important because it was the 50% retracement of the post pandemic move higher. And that probably kicked in a combination of buying, hedges being taken off, some short covering, and that fed on itself through the end of the day. Maybe you could point to the move down in yields yesterday, the move down in the dollar, but that could also help to explain today's weakness too, because you saw reversals there. So Joe Anfini, a noise, I think it's fair to say in the equity markets there, but on Friday, actually, they gave up pretty much everything that got back on Thursday. So when you net net, when you get through it all, what did we learn this week that should affect the markets over the longer term? You know, David, I think what we learned is that there's still a lot of risks out there facing the future of the global economy, not just here in the US. And those two price reports we got, the PPI and the CPI, reinforce the view that inflation is going to be a really hard challenge for the Fed to solve. It also seems to have removed any wiggle room that people think the Fed has. They're really going to have to be adamant about raising rates, try to constrain liquidity, try to discourage consumer demand in order for inflation to get under control. There's not a lot of room for them to do anything but raise rates now for the next at least a couple of meetings. The market finally perhaps is digesting that. Listen, there's a lot of trouble. Sorry, go ahead, please. I think Joe Anfini's absolutely right. And I think there have been these moments where it seems like whether it's in reaction to things going on in the UK that the markets almost cheering for or looking for some sort of financial system accident because of the messaging from the Fed, from Powell, that they're not going to step in because of financial market weakness.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3455,2022-10-16 08:07:43
15170," financial system accident because of the messaging from the Fed, from Powell, that they're not going to step in because of financial market weakness across any of the asset markets, or just volatility, but financial system instability may be what could bring the Fed back in. But even in a situation like that, what they may do is use the tool of their balance sheet or repo facilities versus doing a pivot anytime soon on rates. And I'm not sure that's been fully digested by the market yet. Yeah, there could be certainly more digests in the comments, particularly because the risks that are out there are really unusual. You know, it's not just the inflation problem, right? The US has a labor shortage, born of the pandemic, born of early retirees, born of a lack of legal migration, immigration into the US, and that problem is not one that the Fed can solve. And so they still have very high consumer demand and a shortage of supply, no matter what the Fed does to try to curtail demand, there's going to be spill-overs to also curtailing the recovery of supply from the pandemic. So they're sort of fighting this problem without having all the tools that are needed. And you know, the risks that are out there, you know, haven't really abated in many ways, although finally, we're starting to see earnings estimates come down and market expectations adjust to those risks. Lizanne, I wonder whether part of the problem we have right now is it's not all bad. There are parts of the economy that actually continue to be quite strong. It's sort of like we've gone from a unipolar to a multiple world, we've gone to a multiple economy, it feels like sometimes. We have, and I think that's what's particularly unique about the pandemic, the nature of it, how it unfolded, is that we've been in this rolling cycle. So during the the throes of the pandemic, when all the stimulus kicked in both on the monetary side and on the fiscal side, that stimulus and demand associated with it was forced to be funneled into the good side of the economy because of the absence of access to services. That became the breeding ground for the inflation with which we're still dealing. Then as you saw reopening, you saw that pent down demand on the good side, you saw pent up demand on the services side. That tends to be the stickier components of inflation. So even though we're seeing disinflation now on the good side, we've got it on the services side. So it's very different than your typical slow down downturn recession, whatever you want to term it because at least the last two, the COVID recession, the global financial crisis, in essence, the bottom fell out all at once in the economy. This is happening in a unique way because it's sort of shifting through the economy and hitting pockets at different times. Well, and some areas of the economy are still expanding, even as some parts like PCs and smartphones where a lot was purchased during the years of the pandemic, the worst of the pandemic, now those sales coming down, but look at auto production. That industry is still suffering from a lack of the chips needed to finish off cars, and they're putting cars in inventory waiting for that last chip to arrive, for example. And the semiconductor companies that supply them still have a very long runway of demand ahead of them. So there are parts of the economy that are still expanding while others are being hit by lower consumer demand from high inflation, from the change in sentiment from spending on goods to services. So that's why I think it's become very hard to say, well, what kind of a recession might we get? Is it going to be broad-based like recessions in the past? Or is it going to be more specific where lower middle and consumers suffering from the higher interest, suffering from inflation really curtail their spending like Walmart saw? Whereas the higher end retailers are doing fine so far. So it's a very challenging time to forecast where the US economy is going, and how much unemployment might be created because of this constraint on liquidity from the rate increases. That means it's still possible to find potentially investments that do lead to growth over the even the near term as some of these industries continue to recover. And you know, Joanne, to your point about the upper end in better shape as what is by what the retailers are saying, there's also that potential pressure just on psychology because of the wealth effect given that even though the excess savings story has merit up the income spectrum, they're also challenged by not just equity market losses but bond market losses real estate.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3456,2022-10-16 08:11:56
15171," leaving story has merit up the income spectrum. They're also challenged by not just equity market losses, but bond market losses, real estate losses. So I think that's why I think we all have to be careful about extrapolating that excess savings up the income spectrum as a guaranteed feed into the consumption side of the economy. I think even there there might be some hesitancy. Joe, on last thought here, we all talk about when is the market going to bond out? When is the bad news bond about? When do we know we got it all out? We know how to deal with the build from here. Well, I think you almost never know that ever. I mean, think about the risk the global economy is facing. It's not just the US and inflation problems globally. We have the war in Ukraine. And there are some maybe low probability but very large risks associated with that. And then you have China. And they're continuing zero COVID policy, which seems to be having rolling disruptions to supply, which don't help our inflation problem. And now we have more of an economic war against China with the latest round of restrictions on exports of semiconductor equipment and high-level chips. And the real question there is, will there be retaliation from China in terms of restrictions against access to the Chinese market, which is still, you know, a hope to be one of the fastest growing markets in the world, then now we might find that US companies don't get access to that. So we shouldn't assume that the worst is in at this point. And we should expect that markets are going to continue to be volatile as some of those risks get realized or clarified. Joe Anfini and Liz Ansonas will be staying with us as we try to figure out what to do with our money in these turbulent times. Let's go ahead and back some Wall Street week. I'm Bloomberg. I'll Ishut pointed about bigger things we should tell you as many as one if I mean an industry? Back in 1997, I was interested in the following question, which is there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called Saurapod dinosaurs, which had really long skinny necks. So Apatosaurus is an example. Now there's had really long skinny tails. So I made a computer model that showed that in fact the tail of these Saurapod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip, a bull whip. Now the way a bull whip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. And that crack is a sonic boom. I think the way they got a date was to impress the females by making loud booms. Well this was the week when Wall Street got much of what it had been asking for and then decided quite characteristically that it didn't like it. The economy is simmering down as requested. Industrial production took its worst fall in more than a year. Business inventories are rising ominously. And the housing industries trade association said its members were virtually out of business. That of course was Lewis Ruckus around Wall Street back in 1981. Blue to not 41.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3457,2022-10-16 08:16:20
15172," Street Trade Association said its members were virtually out of business. That, of course, was Louis Ruckus here on Wall Street. We've back in 1981, but we're not 41 years ago now, when all the markets wanted was a slowing economy, and the lower interest rates that they thought would come with that. The big move that week was a romantic comedy. You may not remember it with Bert Reynolds named paternity, and the number one song was Arthur's theme from that Dudley Moore film named Arthur. Now, the problems are very different as interest rates are on the way up, not down, and the economy is still very robust by most measures. Still with us are Joanne Fini, of Advisors Capital Management, and Liz Ann Saunders of Charles Schwab. So, Joanne, let me come to you. The question is, what do we do other money in this world? Where does it make sense to invest with this much volatility, this much uncertainty? It's really been challenging time for investors, and it really depends what sort of timeframe you have as an investor. If you're in retirement, what you probably need is some assurance that you're going to be able to get the cash flow you need off of your portfolio. And so, one of the things we've done for our clients in that kind of a situation is to create portfolios with above average dividend yields on the one side. And now, as bond yields are rising, and we've kept our duration relatively short, we've been able to let bonds mature and then re-up at higher yields. So, one area to go to is some relatively stable companies, whether it's a general mills or an ABV or some of the others in consumer staples and in energy that have dividend yields in the four, five, six percent range. And that way, they can still get that income and they can ride out the volatility in the stock prices and wait this out. And that gives our clients a fair bit of comfort. But, you know, it hasn't been easy really for anybody, but that's one way to deal with the volatility. Liz Ann, what do you recommend these days? Well, first of all, I absolutely agree with Joanne that there's no cookie cutter answer to a question like that. It really does depend on who the investor is, their risk tolerance, their past experience, their time horizon, whether they're financial risk tolerance and their emotional risk tolerance, whether there's a narrow gap between the two or a wide gap between the two. But I think we're in a part of the market cycle right now where you want to actually focus on fundamentals. And I know that sounds trite and sounds what we're always supposed to do. But gone are the days where you could look at segments of the market, components of say, big tech and look at it monolithically, make an assumption that they're all going to go up simultaneously. There's much more differentiation in the market right now. And I'd say look for where things are dear from a macro perspective. So we have declining earnings revisions in the aggregate. So look for the factor around positive earnings revisions, positive earnings surprise. We know we're in a rising interest rate environment. So companies with strong balance sheets, low debt, high cash flow, strong free cash flow, lower volatility. It's just kind of a quality wrapper. And I think that's the best type of approach in this environment. And then the last thing we've suggested for those investors who can do it. If you were a rebalance or based on the calendar, maybe instead of doing it once a year, once a quarter, let your portfolio and the volatility associated with dictate the timing of taking advantage of the volatility by adding into weakness, trimming into strength relative to your overall strategic asset allocation. Joanne, what about the possibility of fixed income at this point? I mean, for a long time, you didn't want to be in bonds, given what we were going to have bonds. But those yields have really come up. They're yielding something now. And they do generate cash. I mean, it's sort of like dividends, right? Yeah, absolutely right. We're getting in the order of 6 plus percent in yields in our all investment grade fixed income solution. And when you pair that with in a balance strategy with the equity front, you can generate a pretty nice cash flow for clients. And so if you keep duration short and you're really careful about selecting credit quality, because credit spreads have widened here. So you want to be careful that you're not adding risk to the side of your portfolio that it's supposed to be sort of the suspenders on the pants, right? To provide more stability. And so that's one thing we've done in it. It's helped our clients feel a lot more comfortable in this kind of environment. Lizanna, you do the point yet where you'd consider duration that is going longer duration for the income. So my colleague, Kathy Jones, who's a regular guest on Bloomberg, she's our fixed income strategist. And in the sort of four.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3458,2022-10-16 08:20:47
15173," I'm a derailleur. You have a second. So my colleague, Kathy Jones, who's a regular guest on Bloomberg, she's our fixed income strategist. And in the sort of four-ish percent range, we have suggested you consider lengthening duration. But I agree with everything that Joanne said too. I think there are finally opportunities. We've gone from a teen environment. There is no alternative to TIA. There is an alternative. And there's income and fixed income again. There are strategies, a bit more active strategies that you can employ to take advantage of this move up in yields. Even well down the duration spectrum, you're actually generating a yield. If inflation ever came down, we might actually have positive really yields. We're not quite there yet, but I think we'll get there. Well, Lizanne, I wanted to pick up, that was exactly the point I was going to make, is the challenge is that inflation is so high that even if you're getting those appealing yields on fixed income, you're still losing purchasing power. And so that's why we continue to counsel if the client has appropriate risk tolerances in time horizon. The equity side can help you offset the cost of inflation. For example, one of the stocks in one of these portfolios is McDonald's. Now what you want is to find a company like that that has good cash flow that can continue to pay its dividend, but more importantly, even, can raise its dividend year after year. And they just announced this week a 10% increase in their dividend. So you're being compensated, more than compensated, for that cost of inflation, eroding the purchasing power of your money. And that's something that you're more likely to get on the equity side than you are on the fixed income side. Lizanne, we're spending so much time on rates and on growth, and for that matter, geopolitics and things like Ukraine. What about earnings? We are in earnings season now. We had the first four banks come out this week that they're earnings, which actually were pretty reassuring to a lot of people. Is there a possibility that could help the investor right now to the upside? It's possible. The big thing to think about is that even if we end reporting season with some sort of positive beat rate, we have to recognize that estimates have been coming down since the April, May period of time, both for the second half of 2022 and the first half of 2023. So it has been a lowered bar and much like the second quarter, we're still early, but expectations are that energy pretty much is all the earnings growth. So consensus right now, once the quarter is all said and done a month from now or so, you'll have 3% overall S and P earnings growth, be exclude energy that goes down to minus 3%. And if that's the case, that would be worse than the second quarter. I think the path of least resistance for estimates is still down. I'd also say really important to watch and listen in earnings season, not just for digital numbers, but for your profit margins, what your profit margin outlook, if you're a multinational company, the impact of the incredibly strong dollar, whether you're hedging it or not, the impact of inflation, whether you have a lot of fixed costs or variable costs, what your labor costs are. So I think it's a lot of the details under the surface that matter as much as just the top line reading. Joanna, are you taking account earnings right now in your investment decisions? What are you anticipating? Well, you know, estimates have come down a lot, as Liz Ann was saying. The real question I think around this earnings season is going to be guidance. And given the uncertainty and the real risks that are out there, I think companies are going to be extremely cautious. And I think investors expect that. It's really kind of a waiting game. We don't know if when how large or recession will be, how broad it will be. So investors are going to look to companies to get some clues about that. The companies that are out there on the ground, whether it's a Texas Instruments providing chips to the auto industry or a company providing chips to Apple. And that guidance I think investors are going to learn from. And I don't think they're going to hope for too much. I think we're expecting not very strong guidance for the fourth quarter. Think a lot of companies are going to defer and say, we're going to be more cautious. We're going to cut some costs. We're preparing for things to slow down. And that doesn't necessarily mean you have to change your investment allocations, though. Because if you're in it, not for the next six months, but you're in it for a couple years, three years, five years. Right now we have a lot of stocks that have become relatively inexpensive. So a little hope out there, at least. Thank you so much to Joe Anfini and Liz Nansan. It's great to have you with us. Coming up, we're going to take a look at what's happening next week on Global Wall Street.

Alongside Tom Kane and Lisa Brownbottes, I'm Jonathan Ferro, the RPA Frontsen Center. How does Japan get away with not raising rates? Can it sustain its normal at a time when everybody else is facing a very different reality? Bloomberg surveillance, be informed, be prepared, be ahead of the game. This is Walter E. Week. I'm David Weston. Now to look ahead to next week on Global Wall Street starting with Julia Sally in Singapore. Thanks David. Chardo will dominate the agenda in the week ahead. Following the party congress, the PBOC sets its one year rate on Monday. Bloomberg economics expects it to remain unchanged. Tuesday we'll see a data blitz with third quarter GDP likely to show only a week recovery and September activity highlighting consumption, weakness and the important role public investment is playing in propping up the overall recovery. Elsewhere Bank Indonesia is likely to hike by 50 basis points and Australia will probably report moderate jobs growth for September. Now over to Guy Johnson in London. Guy? The UK will remain the center of attention both in Europe and globally. Monday the big question, will the guilt market be able to cope without the recent support provided by the Bank of England or will Governor Bailey be forced to step back in? We've got guilt auctions peppered throughout the week. Wednesday we get inflation data, we also get housing data and then on Friday we get retail sales plus we've got S&P and Moody's both updating their UK credit rating. We've got earnings also throughout the week. Food giants to know the Nestle are reporting Tuesday on Wednesday. Wednesday we also see the chip equipment maker ASMR reporting numbers pay attention to that one and then on Thursday we get ABB Volvo. And L'Oreal. A focus on earnings in the week ahead with reports from Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Verizon, Netflix, Tesla and IBM. But also pay close attention to chip equipment maker lamb research. The semiconductor industry is reeling right now from the Biden administration's new restrictions on doing business with China, restrictions that hit at a time when the industry was already grappling with the slowdown in demand. Like data next week include industrial production, housing starts and existing home sales. Elsewhere shareholders of spirit airlines are scheduled to vote on whether to move forward with jet blues $3.8 billion offered to buy the company. And if you're a sports fan, a great week ahead for you. The NBA regular season tips off on Tuesday and major league baseball's postseason advances with the league championship games.

We'll talk about the challenges and the opportunities with Christine Todd Whitman, former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. This is Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. Big expensive cities have a lot going for them. But if you live in one, you probably notice that these big expensive cities keep getting more expensive. What if someone paid you 10 grand to do it? We've had over 50,000 applications. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them? Innovation, money and power collide in Silicon Valley and beyond. Bloomberg Technology with Emily Chang. Weekdays at 5 p.m. in New York and 2 p.m. in San Francisco. Net Zero emissions. It's a lofty goal but times are wasting. Just as John Kerry, President Biden's special climate envoy. Many companies are making promises to be net zero by 2050. But the reality is unless you do enough between now and 2030, you can't hit net zero 2050. And if we're really going to get there, Bill Gates says the math makes a pretty compelling case for nuclear power. You get a million times much energy per reaction as you do burning hydrocarbons. And so it's very advantaged if you do the design right. Nuclear physicist and former energy secretary Ernest Moniz says it won't get done without a public private partnership. I think what we need to see is governments moving together with the financial sector and with the equipment providers to get new power plants over the finish line. But partnership or not, convincing the public about safety may remain an issue given high profile accidents like Fukushima, Japan, in 2011, when an earthquake led to a disaster at the plant causing tens of thousands of evacuations. All the nuclear power plants in this country, they operate really on this precipice of normal routine operation on one side and catastrophic accident on the other. And it's unclear exactly when you'll fall to one side or the other, but it's certainly possible. So the question is what will it take, how safe it can be, and how soon can we get there, even for some who initially oppose the idea, but now embrace it. Given this challenge we face today.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3461,2022-10-16 08:33:38
15176," David can be and how soon can we get there, even for some who initially opposed the idea, but now embrace it. Given this challenge we face today, and given the progress of fourth-generation nuclear, go for it. And to give us some answer to these, this is very important questions we turn out to Christine Todd Whitman. She is president of Whitman's strategies. She is, of course, the former governor of the state of New Jersey and the former administrator of the EPA. So welcome to Wall Street Week. Really good to have you with this governor. You've dealt with nuclear energy for years now. So give us your sense of the role of nuclear energy potentially in getting to net zero. Well, I think nuclear can play a huge role, at least in the transition from fossil fuels to renewables. Renewables are not yet based energy. They're peak shaving. And we're a 24-7 society, as is the rest of the world. The world is 24-7. And nuclear is the only form of base power that releases no regulated pollutants or greenhouse gases while it's producing power. And we have an incredible safety record here in this country on nuclear. And actually, with few obviously very huge exceptions being Chernobyl and what happened in Fukushima, Daiichi, overall worldwide. It's been safe and getting safe for all the time. I mean, the U.S. nuclear regulatory commission is considered the gold standard on regulatory oversight of nuclear reactors. I don't think given costs and time that we're going to see any more large reactors built in this country, certainly. They are being built in China. They're being built around the world. And we can certainly play a part in developing the parts for those reactors. But I see the future for nuclear right now being in the small modular reactors. Well, let's get to that, Amol. First of all, give us a sense of the scope of it already. One of the things that I have learned is nuclear is actually one of the few things that really don't have emissions that can be taken to scale. I think something like 20% of energy in the United States is generated by 70% in France. Right. And you saw, in an example of what happens when you take nuclear offline, when California took the Senate off-free nuclear reactor offline, their emissions went up and the cost of their energy went up. I mean, it was totally counter to everything that they were hoping to achieve in my mind. And so what I found over time is that if you have an opportunity to talk to people and answer their very real questions, I mean, it's normal to have questions about the safety and you should ask them. But the answers are really good. And they're based on our history. You can prove that in fact, these things work. And once you do that with people, they get much more comfortable with the idea of nuclear. It's just that for so long. It's been used as frankly a fundraiser a lot of times for the environmental groups. And we need to get the public to understand particularly with the new small modular reactors that are built in a contained facility. They can be placed on site. They're much safer technology. They are a much safer way to produce the nuclear energy. So overall, they are really, I believe, have the potential to make a huge difference. Particularly if you think about the rural parts of America, where you're not on the grid or you're not close to the grid, you can take a small modular reactor and provide power for an entire town or an entire business. So they have a lot of potential there. So let's pursue that question of safety because that is on a lot of people's minds without a doubt. And as you've mentioned, we've had some horrific instances. Is the issue with safety that people don't realize that actually the track record is quite good for nuclear or is it technological development such as you're referring to small module reactors? No, I think it's because people just don't know. They don't understand. I mean, I get a lot of questions I used to in the past about, well, what about the spent rods? And first of all, I tell them from all that when the time when we had 102 nuclear reactors in this country, and you took all those spent rods and you put them in one place, you'd fill up one foot fall field to the height of the goalposts. They may have gotten slightly above that now because this was data from several years ago. But the point being it's not this massive thing that's the size of the state of Vermont that people kind of have in their minds. And the other thing is that what's in those spent rods is 97 to 90.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3462,2022-10-16 08:38:06
15177," that people kind of have in their minds. And the other thing is that what's in those spat rods is 90, 87 to 90% fishable material, meaning unused energy. And in France and Japan, they figured out how to reprocess that and to get the energy out of those rods, rendering that what you have is the quote unquote bad stuff to down to 15%. Let's say. And it can't be used in a nuclear weapon. So it's much easier to store, much less to store. You have a lot of unused power just sitting there in these spat rods. And we should be using that technology as well. And people have to understand, and when you explain it to them, you can't take one of these rods from a nuclear reactor and put it in a missile. It's not the same technology. It won't work that way. And the other thing that'd explain to them because one of the most immediate issues that we had in this country was three mile island. And when that went down, the operators in the utility itself, in the reactor itself, were never exposed to high levels of radiation. And they've been tracked ever since. And there were no releases into the community. And even those who were right there in the reactor had no adverse reaction to what happened. And in fact, it was because they overrode the system, really, that you had the partial meltdown, Fukushima Daiishi. That wasn't because of the earthquake. It was because of the tsunami. And that was because they had their backup power, their generator, located physically in the reactor building. After 9-11, our nuclear regulatory commission said to our nuclear industry, you've got to move those out. They cannot be co-located with the reactor itself. So that kind of thing can't happen here anymore. Just this week, we saw an announcement of a deal to acquire Westinghouse Electric. Basically, on the premise that, in effect, we're going to have more nuclear energy. Do you anticipate at that in the United States? Well, I certainly hope we do. But it was not even 10 years ago. I guess there were two or four proposed reactors, two in Georgia and two in South Carolina. And we were very hopeful with those who were going to come in on budget and on time. And they both ran over and the utilities decided in each case that it just wasn't worth going forward. So it is a question of cost and regulatory hurdles. But you want to have those regulations in place because that's what protects the community and make sure that things are safe and streamline how you approach them so that you make them go through all the hoops they have to for safety, but to put it to the front of the line to get this power online. The big problem we have, though, when you talk about all of this, is the grid itself. It's old. It needs to be revamped. It can't handle a lot of new power coming in. And that's one of the big challenges that seems to get so overlooked a lot when we're talking about these issues. Again, you go back to small modular reactors, which can actually function on their own. What about the grid? Are we investing in the grid? We have the bipartisan infrastructure bill. We also have the so-called inflation reduction act, which had money in there as well. Is there money in there for the grid? Is it enough? There is money in there for the grid, whether it's enough or not. I doubt it. Hopefully the money that's there will be spent in a way that ensures that nothing is wasted because we need every penny of it. Certainly every penny that's in there is needed to get the grid updated and to where it needs to be in order to accept the new power, whether it's from nuclear or renewables. I mean, they're going to depend on that as well. Okay, Governor, thank you so very much for being with us. Really appreciate this former governor Christine Todd Whitman, now with Whitman's strategy. My pleasure. Coming up, we wrap up the week with our special contributed Larry Summers of Harvard. That's next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg.

15178," Music The tip is crucial and important and I think we've moved from this attitude, from its an indulgence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s and so it makes that a really exciting field because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harnessed to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts but if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom you've got to know when and how and why to use that information and that's what you bring figures out while you're sleeping. Music Music This is Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. Welcome. Once again, our very special contributor to Wall Street Week he is Larry Summers of Harvard. So Larry, we got the CPI numbers in that we'd waited for this week and boy they came in how to expect it. It's been doing this repeatedly now. What do you read in these numbers? Not so much hotter than I expected. Inflations got a lot of momentum. The best single measure to look at for inflation is a kind of super core measure which is wages where you can look at the median component of inflation. They've just been running strong for a long time and not decelerating. So I think Team Transitory is engaged in a lot of wishful thinking and I must say that I'm struck by the hypocrisy of some friends of mine like Paul Krugman who are very quick now to focus on housing and the fact that the private indices lead the public indices when the private indices are looking soft but we're entirely unwilling to credit that argument or to pay attention to the private indices some months ago when the private indices were obviously pointing to an acceleration of inflation. So I think we've got to be very very careful here if we want to be credible about containing inflation. How much momentum is built into inflation and how can you tell? What are you looking at right now that tell you what happens in the fourth quarter and as we go into next year? I'm looking at core measures. I'm looking at super core measures that take housing out, take use cars out in addition to taking food and energy out. I'm looking at the so-called median inflation component. Whatever product it is that's right in the middle. I'm looking at the so-called trimmed mean that looks at the middle half of the distribution of product prices and very crucially for me I'm looking at wages which is a kind of super core measure because labor goes into everything and all of those are saying that inflation's not really coming down very fast if it's coming down at all and that it's way above the 2% target or any acceptable level. Besides the CPI numbers Larry a very big story throughout the week has been and continues to be great Britain where you had the Bank of England come in with their-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3464,2022-10-16 08:46:24
15179," or any acceptable level. Besides the CPI numbers, Larry, a very big story throughout the week has been and continues to be great Britain, where you had the Bank of England come in with their emergency buying of long-term guilt that is due to expire on Friday the end of this week. Same time we now have Liz Truss coming out and making some changes. Give us your take on what's going on in the British economy and, more importantly, the management of the British economy. Look, I think this is probably going to be a textbook case of crisis creation followed by crisis mismanagement. I'd be surprised if we were in the 7th inning of this particular set of challenges. I have said before that people now I think understand very clearly that when you do a military intervention you should never give a sunset date when you're going to leave because it just emboldens the opposition. I think something similar is true of last resort finance where the kind of deadline the Bank of England gave I think is asking for trouble down the road. I think we're going to see more tremors, more aftershocks, more problems. At the same time I think we need to recognize that as serious as the British policy errors were this might well not have happened if global economic conditions were more normal and the kind of excesses we've had in the system mean we're in very complicated territory. Well, exactly Larry. I guess I'm asking to say we have global, slow down IMF this week came out and said we're looking at a global slow down at the same time we have central banks in the development countries really all raising rates at the same time. What is the likelihood we're going to see similar won't be the same but similar sorts of problems elsewhere particularly when it comes to very highly leveraged places and places that are more difficult to see some of the private credit some of the non bank banks. I doubt we've seen the last mine go off. Some of them may be in the private sector I think more of them may be international. Something that disappointed me at the IMF World Bank meetings this week was the number of countries who were reporting that they're having substantial difficulty in getting market access. I must say I'm sort of disappointed by official sector people, people from the ministries of finance and the central banks who are talking about how we're going to work with the private sector to catalyze trillions of dollars of finance for green transitions in all these countries but don't seem to be doing anything about the fact that many of these countries can't even issue a bond today. So I think there's a whole set of very important challenges with respect to developing countries and emerging markets and I'd have to say that I don't feel those challenges were really met this week. There's some fires burning and fire department is still mostly in the station. So as we speak to you you are in Washington for those IMF World Bank meetings and the IAF as a practical matter. You were very outspoken in a project syndicate piece also actually speaking with David Malpest, the head of the World Bank, about the role of the World Bank right now on things like sustainability. What is going on there is the World Bank playing the role it should be playing and what should it be doing? No, I think it is playing its usual roles in its usual way and I think generally the economic crisis of the moment demands major changes in approach just as the security crisis in Ukraine demanded major changes in approach and we're not really quite seeing it yet. The World Bank needs to be much more aggressive in the use of its balance sheet and it also needs to get much more capital and instead of having a fight about which of those two things is more important we need to do both of them because the one mistake we're certain not to make.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3465,2022-10-16 08:50:57
15180," And instead of having a fight about which of those two things is more important, we need to do both of them. Because the one mistake we're certain not to make is over investing in the green transition. And so we need to make sure we're doing everything we can to support that transition. So if there's a lack there Larry, often that lack comes from a lack of leadership. Do we not have the leadership we need either from the United States Treasury, the White House, or from that matter at the World Bank? I mean, would you ever consider taking over that role? I think that we do need leadership that points towards larger changes in business as usual. Then we're seeing in the financial area. And I think there's some mistakes being made right now at a very, very difficult moment in Africa, at a very, very difficult moment in Latin America. And at a very, very difficult moment in parts of Asia. Larry, one piece of news, which was actually really hit the markets, but it's not gotten too much attention, is what the United States did, was picked up semiconductors. And China, the chips market really went down substantially. It took a lot of the tech with it. At a time of so much difficulty globally, what are the possible effects of those sorts of trade actions? The kind of large-style cutoff on cooperation and semiconductors that the Biden administration announced. I don't think it's possible to pass an overall judgment on that. Without understanding the security risks that they saw, which depend on classified information, which those of us on the outside don't have. But this was a highly consequential increase in economic aggressiveness. This is different than a trade fight over a specific product or a specific trade practice. This was pretty across the board effort in something that's very, very difficult to challenge China's ability to grow and to develop technology. And so I think it's going to have some far-reaching implications. Very finally, we did have the announcement of three of your fellow economists receiving jointly Nobel Prize for Economics this week. Tell us about what you took away from that award. Look, I think it was the analytical recognition of something that practical people had known for a long time, which is that banks and finance are different, that they're subject to confidence crises that are kind of apart from the fundamentals of what's going on. And that you got to be very mindful in public policy to maintain confidence in financial intermediation in a way that's a bit different than you have to with respect to manufacturing companies or airlines. Or something else that was very fundamental research, theoretical research in the case of Diamond and Divvig using mathematics. Careful, historical study in the case of Bernanke that I think served him very well during his time at the Fed. Okay, thank you so much to Larry Summers, our very special contributor here at Wall Street Week. Coming up, you can't always get what you want, no matter how much you're willing to pay for it.

Everything you need to get set for the start of U.S. trading, Bloomberg the open with Jonathan Terrell. Filling down in the numbers and preparing you as only Bloomberg can, weekdays on Bloomberg. Finally, one more thought. When money is no object, watch out. They say the one with the most toys wins and let's face it, toys usually cost money. And the bigger the toy, the more money it costs. Take for example Jeff Bezos knew yet the largest sailing yacht in the world at 417 feet and costing upwards of $500 million. Or Elon Musk agreeing to plunk down $44 billion for the prize of owning Twitter. I think most people think is worth a lot less than the price tag. That is if he and pay it. There's two options here. One, the deal falls apart and this stock that has been artificially inflated is going to crash. Or if things go the way Twitter wants, then they get the guy in charge who for the last three months has been saying that Twitter has been lying about its user base. But what happens when you spare no expense, go all in, put all your chips on the table, and don't win your dream prize. Consider the case of Hillary Clinton's campaign spending $1.4 billion on the 2016 presidential race, substantially more than Donald Trump's $960 million and coming up short. This is not exactly the speech at the Capitol. I hoped to be giving after the election. More poor Columbia pictures, which in 1987 decided to make Ishtar, figuring anything with Dustin Hoffman and Warren Bady just couldn't fail. But for some reason, a movie about two lounge singers involved in a coup in the made up country of Ishtar didn't quite land with the audiences. Columbia lost around $40 million on the deal, almost $100 million adjusted for inflation today, and the dud established Ishtar as the synonym for box office flop. And now we can add Steve Cohen to the list of those who went big and lost. The hugely successful hedge fund manager paid around $2.5 billion to buy the New York Metz. And this year took it to number one, at least in player salaries. But sad to say for fans of the Amazons, number one in payroll doesn't mean number one on the diamond. The team lost the third game of the wildcard playoff by a score of six to nothing. It was executing pitches and then the wheels fell off. I don't know why. We just couldn't figure out a way to get some runs, some off that's going. Leaving Mr. Cohen to spend the winter going back to first base and thinking hard about whether that $278 million in player salaries just maybe wasn't enough. They're going to get to this great point and have all this momentum behind them and then they blow it. That's the Metz. That's Metz Metz. That does it for this episode of Wall Street Week.

All of us will remain. We will never. No. No. No. Welcome everybody to the N.I.L. Summit and N.I.L Awards. In July 2022 Atlanta hosted what might sound like a boring legal seminar. A conference on the new rules around name, image and likeness in sports. But far from dry and academic the first annual N.I.L. Summit was in fact a flashy star-studded event put on at the college football hall of fame. And mingling amid the biggest current and former names in sports and media there was a crucial cohort. The player is poised to redefine what it means to be a modern college athlete. And the winner of male athlete of the year goes to Chase Griffin. Among those up-and-comers UCLA's Chase Griffin. The UCLA quarterback is among the students becoming as well known for making deals as making plays. And even in that group Chase stands out. My name is Chase Griffin. What's up everyone is Chase Griffin. It's your favorite quarterback, it's favorite quarterback, Chase Griffin. When you look at it as an empowerment equity opportunity is really been unmatched in the sports world for any point in time since Title IX. Better a scope.

15183," And after spending a couple days talking about his approach to business, sports, and equality, it's not shocking to think he might someday hold that office. His level of focus and maturity at the stage, I only wish I had. If you want to buy stock and human being, buy stock and chase company. When it comes to building generational wealth, it's not about the money that you make in college. I'm very excited that I made the amount of money that I made last year. I am even 10 times more excited that I know how to make that money. Summer on any college campus is mostly for the athlete to run lighter, but still regimen its schedules. The attending class is working out, a little bit of hanging out, and then more working out, on their own time. Chase is no exception. The 21-year-old is a backup, albeit an impatient one. In the topsy-turvy past couple of seasons dotted with families, games, and COVID protocols, he's been able to start three games for the Bruins. Griffin, go to the end zone. Why open again? Touchdown UCLA! Eating Arizona and narrowly losing to both Stanford and Oregon. That was inches away from Chase Griffin and UCLA being in full fledged comeback mode. For Chase, UCLA felt like destiny. He was born just a few miles away before his family moved to Texas when he was a toddler. But beyond being a sort of homecoming, the school's history of athlete activism was a massive draw. I always expected from myself to have some sort of impact, but it was beneficial for more people than I interact with on a daily basis. Choosing UCLA, a lot of that went into me seeing myself as someone who reflected the same want to make things better. That so many of the people that UCLA pride itself upon be in the home for have done in the past. The legacies of former UCLA greats like Arthur Ash, Jackie Robinson, Karim Abdul-Jabbar, and Jackie Joyner Cursey have had a wide-ranging impact on society well beyond the Westwood campus. Chase reveres these people, but he's perhaps most keenly aware of the activism of a more recent ruin alum, the basketball player at O'Bannon. At O'Bannon, who was an ace-meth player of the year National Champ, UCLA sports legend, is also a legal hero. I think NIO could be the next installment where we look back in 30, 40, 50 years, and God willing, if we give him the roses he deserves, we add at O'Bannon to that list of UCLA greats. O'Bannon, who played at UCLA from 91 to 95, initiated a lawsuit that's widely credited for finally opening up the possibility of college athletes being paid for use of their name, Image and Lightness. He sued the NCAA in video game publisher EA for anti-trust violations, arguing that athletes should be entitled to financial compensation when schools used their likeness for game. In 2014, a judge ruled in his favor. And then on an episode of the shop, surrounded by O'Bannon, Diana Terossi, and LeBron James, California governor Gavin Newsom signed the first ultimately successful legislation to allow athletes to receive endorsement deals. The Fair paid a play act led other states to follow suit and ultimately led the NCAA in 2021 to relent, seemingly reluctantly. NIO payments were officially allowed as of July 1st 2021. Today is the last day where name, image and likeness laws will not be on the books, and kids will not be, if you will, not allowed to make money off of their name, Image and Lightness.

This NIL thing is the wild, wild west. The NIL change felt like many things that happened very slowly and then it happened very fast. And I wonder for you having contemplated that maybe this was coming at some point, how prepared were you, what was your mindset when the switch flipped? Right. I mean, I still think everyone's trying to get prepared for that industry. It's still sort of like a wild, wild west. I wasn't really expecting anything. I was more just thinking about honestly getting ready for that season. And capitalizing on everything that was happening. When NIL hit and it turned out I had action, I was like, oh, okay, well after this degree deal, which was fantastic. I was like, okay, I see how I can be a staple in this game and I see how I can get better over time. That's why I teamed up with my friends at Shell. And then at Shell, they'll hit and then boost my old deal hit. And then you keep on building clear cover. Like you keep on building and you get better in the meetings. And most of all, you start seeing where your value can be best placed in these new opportunities. The headlines and storylines in the aftermath of the NIL change introduced visions of instant millionaires strolling campuses across the nation. You might think the NIL athlete of the year lives in Splendor or at least in one of those athletic palaces that put most of our college dorms to shame. Well, it's all relative to Chase. All right, Jason. So here we are, World Headquarters. Yep, this is where it all happens. So there's the kitchen right here. I actually really enjoy cooking. Oh, yeah. Yeah, this gas oven gets really hot really fast. I make pizzas and this is the best appliance since the iPhone. If I could put anything in there, I need to do these dishes right here. So no trappings of success yet, more a pretty average college dorm room. The fridge filled with leftovers, a well-used PS4. And of course, the requisite Godfather poster. It's a far cry from the lifestyle seen in some local news reports for NIL athletes during this first year. These are Robinson made headlines with an NIL deal with Lamborghini Austin. Lamborghini's tend to make more headlines than Muhammad Ali are Bruce Lee pictures. Some athletes are living in mansions driving Lamborghinis. As far as I know, you're doing either of those things. I'm actually where you're living right here. And it is with all the respect not a mansion. How much of that is a conscious choice and what does it say about your approach to this? Right. I mean, first off, I look at this as my own room, the guy, everything I need. I'm cool with that. I'm cool with living below my means. I think it's important to remember that the volume of financial gain is completely overstated. And that's what it y'all is for in the media. And someone hears about a $5 million or $10 million deal. You've got to report it. Like, oh my goodness, people are going to read this. A, I'd count two things. How many kids are even getting these deals? And then for the kids that do get it, how much of that is in liquor cash? And how much of it is in assets? If you pay for a $2 million house out here in LA for a kid to stay in the college, that's great. But as soon as they're graduated, they're not going to have that $2 million house. I say the same thing, you know, for the kids who are driving around in Lamborghini's and stuff like that. That's awesome. Like, that's super dope. And I know some of those kids. But, you know, someone paying for your lease is different than someone actually giving you the value of that lease every single month. You're investing it, saving it for a long time, et cetera. I say all that just to mention that product deals and stuff like that are overhyped by the media. And they also can land kids in some trouble if they're not paying taxes on it. That's one of the distinctly unsexy and easy to overlook elements of the new rules. Even if an athlete's not getting cold hard cash from a deal, the value of any products given are subject to state and federal taxes. So suddenly, what a player sees as free gear in return for some social media posts.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3470,2022-10-16 09:12:53
15185," The value of any products given are subject to state and federal taxes. So suddenly, what a player sees as free gear in return for some social media posts actually equals taxable income. And that requires the same forms you'd fill out as an independent contractor getting a check. I made a fair amount in NIO deals and I invested all of it. In my opinion, NIO is great. Doing all this is great. Making money now is great, but the most valuable thing I've gotten from all of this is in the fact I'll always know how to make money off of myself. All told, Chase has done more than 20 deals with major brands like Degree, Shell, and Boost Mobile. Along with venture-stage companies including Discord, Duffel, and Creative Juice. He's also made a point to work with charities like the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, where he's already raised funds for almost 60,000 meals. Hydrogen has a very special place in the universe. It's the first element on the periodic table. It is the most abandoned element in the universe. And when clean energy advocates think about what can we find which would be as easy to use, as fossil fuels, they think about hydrogen. The fuel that will when burn only produce water. We like to imagine that if we just built enough of these and these, we could ditch fossil fuels and save the planet. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. There are some things where you just need good old-fashioned combustible fuel. Now start us around the world of betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century. This is the latest series of ideas, knowledge, and inspiration to feed your ambition. to turn the world to whom burger. from the world of politics to the world of business. Balance of power with David Weston, a huge analysis inside from and about politics power players. Weekdays, this is Bloomberg. I heard the opening. I did. I just took that opening and I pitched it slow, or I think I sped it. At his desk when he's not making music, another side project, he's either networking with CEOs or investors he seeks out or who seek him out, or negotiating new deals. Hey Mallory. I'll show you how you do it. I'm doing well. I'm turning on my camera right now. You're no worries. This is an average NIL deal.

15186," Miranda approaches an athlete who can help spread their message to a demographic they believe the athlete can help reach. In this case, direct TV is looking to market their NFL Sunday ticket to college students. It would be two posts, one post late August and one post on the first week of September. And the compensation would be 1200 per post so it would be 400 total. Right. Are they video posts or are they, you know, picking caption? They can be either. It's up to you guys. That was pretty good. 400 above, but they had originally asked. So that's a win. So yeah, I mean, at this point, after I do a Zoom or something like that, I get to chill out and go back to land down if I was watching a movie or something, or, you know, go to YouTube to start looking for more samples. This is President Trump. It's a pretty simple interaction for Chase and for direct TV, negotiated over a couple of emails and Zoom calls, and papered with a contract Chase will have his dad look over before he signs. And Chase, who's made himself as much of a student of the new NIL marketplace as he has a public policy at UCLA, says he understands why it's working. The brand ambassador with ship with an athlete is more attractive to these brands now as large as a terminal investment than even a post by a famous actor. If there's any place to learn that sports are deep in the hearts of Americans, it's on a high school football field in Texas. Friday night lights in the Lone Star State might be the great iron equivalent of Frank Sinatra's New York City. Making it there needs your something special. Chase Griffin quarterback class 19, Hado Texas. And Chase didn't just make it, he excelled. Let's talk about some of the top quarterbacks in the state. And when you look at that list at the top of it, you got to talk about Chase Griffin. I was lucky to play three years as a quarterback for Hado High School, which is a one horsepower down, we have great success. And so the town really shut down and came out and supported us every Friday night. Chase, one word to describe that finish that game. God, that's it. Coming from a town like that where football is so prioritized, it has pros and cons, but I think on the pros side, I learned how to win, how to get better. And most importantly, what it's like to build a team where everyone gets better. Emulating his UCLA alumni like Robinson, Joyner Cursey and Ab Dildra Bar, Chase is looking at the impact NIL will have not just for him, but the athletes that will follow. When the predecessors who have come before you have changed the world and made life better for everyone today, you can't help but ask yourself how the actions that you're taking now and the companies and brands and the NIL space that you work with are all cumulatively building something greater than any of us could foresee. I've actually, I've never moderated. So this will be my first time. It should be fun. I know my handwriting is terrible. The last day the conference chase was asked to co-moderate a panel with Monique Nelson, the CEO for UNI World Group. All right, I'm excited to be here. UNI World Group is one of the longest standing multicultural advertising and marketing agencies in the United States. The firm works with brands like Ford, Home Depot and Johnson and Johnson to help reach the Black and Brown communities. And they have big ambitions in NIL. For UNI World Group, the idea of this was pretty epic in that because we serve the undervalued, overlooked and the underserved, we knew that this particular group of people would fall into that category. And we plan on being the premier practice for NIL after.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3472,2022-10-16 09:21:24
15187," This particular group of people would fall into that category. And we plan on being the premier practice for NIL athletes that are looking to do purpose-driven, media, advertising, community-level engagement work. UWG launched a program called The NIL to help Black Student Athletes partner with major brands. But to help them understand how to do that, they brought on chase to serve as a student athlete executive in residence. For me, I do nothing without tremendous amounts of data for all of our clients. I really wanted to be thoughtful about this practice being very athlete-centric. If I were to build it or anyone on my team were to build it, it would not have the athlete at the core. When you're 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, the best way to have credibility is confidence. And the only way for confidence to be authentic. I'm actually learning on the job. I'm learning about the brand side of NIL, but I'm also trying to make sure that empowerment equity is built in, especially for Black Student Athletes in the NIL world. ROI. Return on investment. Both Chase and UWG see NIL deals as something much more than making money for students. It's also a potential investment in a community long overlooked. I think we're getting ready to stop boxes, trying to feed the people of L.A. A piece of each of Chase's NIL deals go to his belief brand campaign, which has raised more than $13,000 for meals for the L.A. Food Bank backpack program. But athlete's giving back is only one side. I'm here with Legal Zoom to give you five tips on the NIL game plan. UWG and Chase believe having brands investing in the athletes, especially athletes of color, can be a force multiplier for these historically marginalized communities. When you look at the revenue, jet and rating sports for the Bomb Esteele, 88% of those athletes are Black. So when you're doing stuff to empower student athletes in the NIL space, you're also helping to deliver on your promise. Now student athletes are not the only ones who should receive this help by any means. But statistically, by doing that, you're going to be delivering on your mission. Additionally, student athletes on average come from lower levels of income. So you're also delivering on that promise. And a lot of these student athletes are first generation, their first gen college students. Some of them first gen high school diploma. Some of them first time receiving the amount of money that they receive in their families. This has been a wild first year in NIL. We all knew that there would be bags of cash around, right? There's always been bags of cash. There's cash everywhere. What we know is that that's not sustainable. We know that athletics has an expiration date on it. So for us, inclusion ultimately means this is just a part of you. It is a tremendous part of you. And we are going to celebrate that part of you. But we also know that you're bigger than that. So we want to empower you to live past your expiration date for this part of your life. And quite honestly, have equity in everything that you have poured yourself into as an NIL athlete. It may still be the Wild West days for the NIL industry. But in the first year, about a billion dollars in business was done with NCAA athletes. For the early leaders in the NIL space like Chase, they're striking a precedent for athletes that follow them. And that's important because collegiate athletes don't have that much time to profit. Only an estimated 2% of NCAA athletes go on to the pros. Even the hardest working are often limited by things they can't control. For Chase, it's been his height. I'm 5'10 now in high school after my sophomore year went up through for 3,000 yards. I was probably like 5'6"", 5'5"". I mean, I could already say I'm one of the best in the history of Texas high school football. But I've gone through the high test.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3473,2022-10-16 09:25:47
15188," I said, it's 5'5"". I mean, I get to say, I'm one of the best in the history of Texas high school football. But, you know, I've gone through the height test where they'll call you out of class, shake your hand, look at you up and down. I'd be like, nice to meet you. You go back to class. It's a sad but timeless story for student athletes. And for Chase, his story is something he's not shyed away from, but embraced when it comes to his NIL deals. I'm frequently the smallest person on the football field, but I always strive to be the most impactful. My middle school coach taught me that I would never play in high school. Chase's deals with degrees breaking limits team and clear covers inspired underdogs, allowed him to capitalize financially from football, even the last season he never saw the field for UCLA. I play football because I love the game. I play the football because I'm a good competitor. I love to compete and I play football because I'm good at it. At the end of the day, I don't play football for my livelihood, which is important to remember when it comes down to identity. I myself chase Griffin as long as I'm that I got something in this world. As he moves into the new season and focuses more on football than business, Chase doesn't seem much of a differentiation between the two in terms of his mindset. I wouldn't be surprised if I wasn't playing football in five years and it was running in Fortune 500 company, but I also wouldn't be surprised if I was winning a Super Bowl five, ten years from now. And either way, I'm going to keep on working at the tools that would align myself and my future with both. At the end of the day, you're always going to have yourself. If you can make profit off of yourself and know where you add value in any world you're in, you'll be able to adapt and find ways to generate wealth through yourself. The Part of what I love about business is you get to build things from nothing. I don't have any investors. All this is all money in. This is me just building it. It's pretty much full service shadow banking with nobody in charge. When the price of anything goes up, the consequences reach far beyond what you'd expect, but perhaps most of all when it comes to food. In 2010, surging food prices helped spark the Arab Spring. Lives were lost, regimes fell and the consequences are still with us. Once again, food prices are rising and fast. Energy costs, broken supply chains, and surging demand were just some of the factors that have driven food prices to their first record high since the Arab Spring. And that's all before a war between two of the world's biggest food producers. Ukraine is called the Bread Basket of Europe and taken with Russia the two account for about a quarter of global wheat trade. They produce more than half of the world's sunflower seeds in oil, nearly 20% of the barley. Now throw in rising energy prices and processing, transporting, even refrigerating food gets more expensive. Plus, fertilizer production is extremely energy intensive. Less fertilizer means lower crop yield and prices rise even more. The pandemic revealed how complicated and fragile global trade systems are. Global agriculture, perhaps even more so. Unlike metals, for example, food goes bad. And crops take months to grow and are vulnerable to unpredictabilities like the weather. Rising food prices will be felt everywhere, but the poorest countries in the world will be hit the hardest. And as all these factors compound, the real fear is that record high will lead to a record high and ultimately to a global...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3474,2022-10-16 09:29:59
15189," But the poorest countries in the world will be hit the hardest. And as all these factors compound, the real fear is that record high will lead to record high and ultimately to a global food crisis with vast consequences. So before you invent high in year, disrupt, before you change the world, Bloomberg. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. Like just be honest. We've had sort of a shift in, are we in some sort of cypheration fears? Moment, people were talking about that all day yesterday. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the road today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building across America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels, we want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Hello! How are you? It's so great to see you. Thank you so much for doing this. What do you think about all this celebs getting into? Crypto-like. I think that I think was more last year. I think it's kind of a way of that past. No, I don't think so, but I think it's like any time that frankly, it's when a lot of other people get into crypto, right? Other audiences too. It's when it's in the news a lot. When does that happen? A lot of times when the prices are going up. She was a federal prosecutor going after gangs and the mob before being handed for next assignment, taking down Bitcoin. Katie Hawn soon realized this new technology was much more than a tool used by criminals. She dove deep and became a crypto convert, swapping her prosecutor hat for a board seat at Coinbase, and became the first female general partner at Venture Firm and Recent Horowitz. Hawn, now a prolific crypto investor, recently launched her own fund with $1.5 billion to deploy. It's the largest fund ever raised by a single investor. Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0 CEO and founder of Hawn Ventures, Katie Hawn. Katie, it's so great to have you. Great to be back here in the studio with you, Emily. I want to start with a vibe check. Okay. What state of the crypto cycle are we in right now? It was hot. Yep. And then it got pretty cold. Well, look, Emily, zooming back because I've been in crypto for a decade, if you can believe it. We've seen crypto be really hot and then all of a sudden not. And so we've seen this before, however, I think one of the things that's a little bit different now is with each new crypto cycle, more and more people come into it. And so it's more and more pronounced each cycle. And I would push back on it's not. I think it depends on what area of the ecosystem you're looking at. We think developers think crypto and Web3 is still really hot. I am seeing a lot less of those. We're all going to make it hashtags. I am seeing a lot less of them too, although I am spending less time on Twitter, so maybe that's why. But with each cycle, there are new acronyms. What hasn't happened is a crypto winter in the mid-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3475,2022-10-16 09:34:28
15190," And then less time on Twitter, so maybe that's why I feel. But with each cycle, there are new acronyms. What hasn't happened is a crypto winter in the midst of really serious global macro conditions. So we have inflation, kind of at record highs for our generation, in our lifetime. And then we have also a war that's broken out in the Ukraine. And we have a number of other factors going on here. So that's very different. There was some serious carnage out there. Yeah. Socius, Luna, three hours. What's been your takeaways from that? Yeah. I don't want to sit here and tell you that algorithmic stablecoins are bad because I actually think they're really interesting. However, I think what happened is you had, in this case, you mentioned Luna and Tara. That was an algorithmic stablecoin that was getting pretty widespread adoption relative to what the tech could do. I didn't realize you spent your teenage years living in Egypt and learning Arabic. Tell me about your upbringing. I was always uprooted. My dad worked for a large company, and we were always moving just when I would get comfortable in one space. And I think actually that's pretty important. If you fast-forward and look at my career, I'm comfortable being in uncomfortable situations. I didn't know a lot about venture when I got into it initially. I didn't know a lot about crypto when I got into it initially. And I was OK asking questions. I was OK not knowing the local acronyms or the Namanclature of a particular field. And I'm taken right back to my teenage years in Cairo, moving from Houston, Texas one day to downtown Maddie in Cairo the next day. You studied law? I did. You clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. That's right. You became a federal prosecutor. You were taking on prison gangs and the mafia. That must have taken a really thick skin. I was doing it at age 25. And now if I take a step back and you know, I think that happens at different points in your career. Like, whoa, if I would have analyzed that a little more at the time, and I'm kind of in some ways glad I didn't. I just dove right in because I found it fascinating. There was a human aspect to it. And people's stories. And I felt like those stories mattered. So I was drawn to criminal law and became a federal prosecutor. And I did cases involving violent crime. But then really mistrying cases, being back in the courtroom, being before the grand jury. Like the prosecutor you would see on TV going to try those murder cases. Doing those two hour closing arguments. That's right. And so moved out here to California. I died at the largest prison gang in the world at the time. Outlaw motorcycle gangs, hostage taking, bank robberies, armed bank robberies. There was really not a kind of criminal case by that point in my career. I hadn't done it. It was right around that time. 2012. One of my bosses came in and said, let's have that same energy that you brought to those gang cases, to those murder cases. And let's go ahead and have you investigate this new criminal technology that we really need to look into and possibly shut this down. So you created the first cryptocurrency task force. How would you describe it? Fortunately, several of us in the government realized at the time it's not possible, also not desirable. Because Bitcoin is not an entity. It's not a person. Right, it's a protocol. And it would be like saying, let's go shut down cash. Let's go shut down the internet. It's not possible. Probably wouldn't be a good idea, either. I was using crypto and technologies like the Bitcoin blockchain, because that's all that existed then. This is 2012, 2013, to actually uncover criminal activity. So I didn't think that that technology was bad. Frankly, it was a tool that helped me uncover the various activity. And by the way, it was a step level function improvement better than compliance by banks. I'll just go ahead and say it. That's a little bit controversial. But I had spent a decade subpoenaing large financial institutions. And five times out of 10 didn't get back what I needed. One case I worked on, and people always say, oh, you shut down the Silk Road. What actually happened? I was looking into something completely, not having to do with anything at all of the Silk Road and came across some, what looked to be some kind of odd activity. And it turns out that a couple of federal agents on the Silk Road Task Force out of Washington, DC, were cropped. And that is the case that I ended up in dining.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3476,2022-10-16 09:39:00
15191," It turns out that a couple of federal agents on the Silk Road Task Force out of Washington, D.C. were croaked. And that is the case that I ended up in dieting and I ended prosecuting those agents and they both went to prison. So that's the aspect of what the Silk Road case that I worked on. I would never, never have been able to uncover that criminal activity by those agents because they were federal agents they knew how to cover their tracks had they not used Bitcoin blockchain. So that technology right there, if they had just used wires or cash or bank wires, we would never have uncovered that. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund in front of scratch? Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world we calibrate. After decades of stagnation, Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation. Corporate giants, policymakers and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that. Every week on Japan ahead, right here on Bloomberg Television. So what's the best investment advice you've ever been given by anybody? The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day and if you keep added and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle and it's and it's not just interest. It was it was always said about compound interest returns, compound business returns, compound human returns. They're all very additive because you'll learn every day and if you keep added, it's very, very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make? Selling it the wrong time. And they sell when the prices go down? Yes. Or not keeping, but people have conviction or they invest for the, if they invest for the right reasons, just keep added. So you became kind of a crypto convert after this. You joined the Board of Coinbase very early on. How did you and Coinbase and Brian Armstrong come together? I hosted an event here in San Francisco at the Federal Reserve Bank and I believe it was there that it wasn't just Brian, it was a lot of what I'll call legitimate actors and crypto who wanted to usher in this new wave, this new ecosystem. And then we brought together the heads of all kinds of agencies. Really in an effort to kind of talk about building bridges, you know, the government and the crypto industry. We're never going to see eye to eye on a lot of things, but we did think there were some commonalities. Coinbase is a company that has suffered. They've been losing share. The valuation of the public markets has plummeted. Why do you think that is and how do you think it can be fixed? Yeah, well, I think again a few things it's tied to. One, a large aspect of Coinbase's business now, of course, is trading revenue. And that's down when prices are down. And you know, the company's been very transparent about that long before going public. I mean, also if you look at its S1, it specifically identifies that. And just how volatile crypto cycles are. So I think that's part of it. It's judged by public markets as a technology stock or as a financial services company. By the way, I think it's both. I think it's not just a financial services company. I think it's so much more. I think it's really a portal to this whole new ecosystem. You were also on the board of OpenC until recently, there's an insider trading situation or accusation going on. Their Coinbase has also had employees accused of insider trading. How much is this happening with crypto companies and within the industry and how big a problem is? Yeah, I think crypto is under the microscope. So where you have a case, two cases, three cases in crypto ecosystem, which now is a trillion dollar industry. I think multi-billion approaching trillion dollar industry, you're always going to be able to find examples like that. So I don't want to make too much out of a handful of cases. That said, the company Coinbase OpenC, take these things incredibly seriously. Along with your position at Coinbase, you became a partner at one of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3477,2022-10-16 09:43:14
15192," Incredibly seriously along with your position at Coinbase you became a partner at one of the most story venture capital for American Valley and my name is Andreson Harwitz. What was your experience at A16Z like? There I met Chris Dixon and I met Ben Harwitz and I met Mark Andreson and I had worked with them for just about a year maybe a little bit over when they asked me to come and co-run their crypto funds at Andreson Harwitz. Again I jumped at that chance and I think really that speaks to the fact that as I said before things are a hell yes or there are no and it was a hell yes for me. So Andreson Harwitz is the kind of place where if you make a partner you don't leave. Yeah. How did Mark and Ben respond when you said yeah I want to leave to start a crypto fund of my own. As you might know Emily they're an anchor. They're an anchor check into my fund and I'm very grateful for that. You know Mark and Chris and folks like them are also personal LPs. So I felt very supported when I shared that decision and I will say that it was not running away from Andreson Harwitz. It was running to another opportunity. And you know crypto is not who would they say it's not a spectator sport or it's like you're in it. It's excuse very young. It's 24-7. It's global and it's hustle and at this and that's a trade-off. It's a life trade-off and at this point in my career and in my life if I was going to continue to make that trade-off I just wanted to do it and do it in a way that was really true to me. So you struck out on your own yes to launch on ventures what gave you the courage to do that what was the spark that lit the fire yeah that got you to say I need to do this and do this now. Sure what I set out to do was to continue to invest in this ecosystem that I think is so broad that decision was very purposeful and the timing was very purposeful. We have an early stage fund that does seed stage series A even series B and then we have what we call an acceleration fund which is it's not a growth fund. It's a crypto growth fund and I think those are different things but it's later stage it might be crypto publics. Certain kinds of public tokens were set up to hold tokens to participate in the token ecosystem or later stage companies I mean you know there are now several crypto many crypto unicorns. Space has become really competitive even though you say you know crypto's had its kind of ups and downs the thing is a lot of people in some of those last cycles have seen the kind of venture style returns that can be having crypto and so you've had a lot of new funds enter the space and that's driven up competition. So what differentiates on ventures then from you know all of these other crypto funds or even the more traditional venture capitalists like entries in Harowitz or Sequoia they also have crypto funds. Sure. Well I think a lot of traditional venture capital funds now have crypto funds. It used to just be like a regulatory designation. It was like are you an RIA which is registered investment advisor. I would say for crypto founders today it's not enough to just be an RIA right they frankly I don't even know if a lot of them care that's a regulatory designation. What crypto founders today want to know is do you live in breath crypto. Do you inhale the discord. Are you part of the community. Do you participate in governance. Are you going to be staking these kind of crypto verbs out there and if you're not really in this space full time I think it's very hard to run a successful crypto fund. We don't have a hedge fund component so we're not sitting here buying and trading and selling that's a hedge fund structure and there are crypto hedge funds. We're not one. We're making seven to ten year bets. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund from scratch. You know it's hard but it's not impossible. We don't have a crystal ball. I don't know I can't predict cycles but I knew that we were in a cycle where you saw so much further an excitement around the space and I already talked about what makes this different but I think one thing also is we are an embell strike force. We don't fish in the same pond. We have the crypto natives. We have a fishing execution. We have operators, seasoned operators who really know how to stick the landing and I think that's reflected on our culture. I would say the only thing that's changed in our strategy as a result of the market correction is really more of a focus on early stage but we still have our late stage fund and when we see valuations which I think we'll still see correct spoiler. I think we'll continue to see some corrections and so we might deploy our later stage fund a little bit more slowly. It might not be on an even 50-50.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3478,2022-10-16 09:47:37
15193," Spoiler. I think we'll continue to see some corrections. And so we might deploy our later stage fund a little bit more slowly. It might not be on an even 50-50 cadence. And that's okay. Long-term, our strategy hasn't changed. Long-term, we're committed to this space. How much do you think valuations are going to correct? You know, it's just, I can't give you a one-size-fits-all answer because crypto is not a monolith. You have some crypto companies that really follow more of an enterprise SaaS business model. You have others that are layer one protocols. You have still others that are consumer-facing applications. And I think one of the things we're seeing right now is the infrastructure layer. And that's where we're spending a lot of our time, by the way. And we think more and more use cases will come about when the infrastructure layer is in place. So my own view is we are not rushing to deploy. We're certainly not getting caught up. You do get VC FOMO. I try not to. Avoid that. You know, look, I think it's very easy to get into that mindset. Right? It's because it's a competitive sport. It's a competitive space. And I think I'd be lying if I said that that doesn't influence anyone. I try to, what I do, and I think I do differently, is I try to take stock of that. Oh, that's the FOMO mentality kicking in. That's bad. Again, you don't want to over-correct, though. What we look for is we look for amazing founders. It doesn't matter if I think valuations will correct. If there are amazing founders, there's a huge tam. We also look for what's your regulatory plan? If you're launching a token, what's your plan to comply with the law? What's your plan for security, by the way? We've seen a lot of hacks in the space. We want to really dive in there and make sure that the founders have been thoughtful about, especially if they're costing and customer funds, keeping those funds secure. If it's a cross-chain bridge, what are the exploits? Have you changed your strategy at all, given the downturn? What? Have you backed out of any deals or decided not to do certain deals? Because the conditions have changed since you raised the fund. We have decided not to do certain deals. We've never backed out of a deal. We have decided not to do a few deals. Because we think that pricing was ahead of progress, candidly. And we might have been wrong about that, Emily. We might have been wrong about that. But I think if we were wrong not to do a couple of deals, better that we might have been right. Because if we were wrong about that, I think we can find a way to still invest in those projects later. Well, one thing I'm hearing is that a lot of dry powder has just stepped up because all these funds raised a lot of money raised. What was the biggest fund ever for a single person, not just a woman? Anyone? Are you confident you're going to have a place to put all that money? I am, but if I don't have a place to put it, I'm not just going to go willing, nearly deploy it. One of the things that we told our LPs even during that period when we raised our fund, which was when crypto was undeniably still on a bull run, we said that we are going to be pretty steadfast sticking to a tier deployment cycle. And I think one thing that's changed is that might have lengthened. It certainly hasn't shortened, but we will, again, we have, we feel very good that we have the capital to back preteens when we see them. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind. And we're falling behind. No one covers the world like Bloomberg.

15194," What about NFTs? And are you concerned about the declining demand? We are going to increasingly live in a digital world. And I happen to think that if you live in a digital world, you're going to want to own digital goods in that world. You're not just going to be satisfied to rent them, which is what we do now. You buy our content from walled gardens without digital scarcity, which is what NFTs unlock. You don't really own anything. You're subject to the whims of a platform. And I think NFTs and digitally scarce goods fundamentally change that. I think you'll see NFTs back again. But we are spending a lot of time in the infrastructure layer. Like I tell you, zero knowledge, technology, scalability. We think of that as like the plumbing. If you think of the fiber optic cables. And remember, you couldn't have had YouTube and Netflix with dial up. You couldn't have streamed content. The same is true of crypto use cases. We think that there will be a lot of new use cases unlocked when the infrastructure is there, when it's more efficient, when it's more user friendly. And so we're spending a lot of our time there. President Biden issues this crypto executive order. There are a number of ports that are coming due. What do you want to see from the administration when it comes to regulation and are you optimistic that we will get there? Yeah. We were so delighted to see that executive order. It's not something you should normally be delighted about. But why we were is because it was to us a real recognition that this is a US government saying this field isn't going anywhere. This field is growing. It's growing so much that we are going to direct every single agency in the federal government to come up with a plan here. I think we take a step forward, but then you see we're a big government. We're a big system. We have states. We have local entities. So we take a step forward with the EO. And then we take some steps back sometimes too. And I think what I see as crypto founders are confused by that. They're starting to think, well, I could go to this jurisdiction where there's a single regulator. And you don't have 50 states with different rules. It's the US government that needs to start taking stock of the fact that right now, Emily in China, there's a quarter of a billion, ECNY wallets, a quarter of a billion. We're still talking about whether there should be a government central bank digital currency. We're still studying that. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind China. And we're falling behind. What are the dangers of falling behind China and the rest of the world? This is years ahead. So I don't want people to take a headline and say, oh, I think the US dollar will be no longer the global currency, reserve global currency. I'm not saying that now. But fast forward decades. And if you no longer need to use the dollar because you have an alternative, I think that's a real problem. What would we use instead? Well, I think that there are going to be stable coins out there that people who have access to a smartphone will use. There is a demand for it. We see our 285% year of your growth with stable coins. So people are clearly liking the idea of this. Now, again, there have been some spectacular failures too, but not all stable coins are created the same. But I think the important thing is that we really do need to not just quash innovation. What do you think of how Gary Gensler, the chair of the SEC, and how he's approaching it? One of the things that I hear from founders is that they're very confused because they get told, come in, register. Just come in and talk to us. But you have the one company who's done the ultimate act of going in and registering coin base, filed an S1. And still, there's a lot of saber rattling still going on, I think. And again, I don't want to single out the SEC. And I don't want to suggest that anything they're doing is bad. I do think that right now there's a lot of confusion. And one of the pieces of confusion stems from the fact that, you know, and it started with the ICO, Mania, back in what, 2016, 2017, I can't remember which year now, where the SEC was very loud about securities. A lot of them were securities, but the space has changed. And so to still view it through the ICO lens when so much has happened over the last five years in the space, I think is a mistake. What do you have to say to the skeptics out there who just don't believe in the future of Web 3? And don't see where this is going. I would say don't judge the current state of innovation by the end state of innovation. I hear you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3480,2022-10-16 09:56:30

Steve Young didn't just make a name and a fortune from his NFL days. Armed with a law degree earned while he was still a player and a front row seat to the tech revolution in Silicon Valley, he's quietly built an investment firm that's done more than $50 billion in deals over the past two decades. I mean, I look, I, my previous life was amazing. You know, throwing Jerry Rice at Touchdown or a Brent Jones in front of 80,000 people and winning games like there's nothing like it. It's not 80,000 people watching it, but it feels familiar. And I think that's why there is magic in privately. This is this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3481,2022-10-16 10:03:16
15196," It's not 80,000 people watching it, but it feels familiar. And I think that's why there is magic in privately. This is the Steve Young many haven't seen. The player turned investor. I recently got to spend a few days trying to keep up with Young. His office is in Silicon Valley to a Scottsdale golf club and lots of places in between. What started as a straightforward story about an athlete's successful transition to business turned out to be something much more. A tale of a relentless guy intent on finally marrying his playing and investing careers with an eye toward radically changing both deal making and athlete's lives in the process. Hi. This is a tough decision. But I know that I've made the right one and I really feel it in my heart and I can't deny it. And so I retire from the great game of football today. Lots of players have managed to move from the locker room to the board room taking largely titular roles as advisors and rain makers to companies or investment firms. Few can say they've committed as much as Steve Young, studying investment memos the same way he studied the Niners playbook. Alright, dental, pat, I'm your on your horse. Young's firm HGGC sits in one of the most fascinating corners of Wall Street, private equity. Once upon a time that industry was relatively hidden. Now it's one of the most influential engines of the global economy. It feels like anecdotally I'm hearing more like, oh, private equity consolidated this practice of meditation. Talking about acquiring dental practices may not be as captivating as throwing game winning touchdowns, but it's a fast growing, very lucrative business. Collectively, private equity firms control more than $6 trillion in assets according to McKenzie. The founders of the biggest firms, guys like Henry Kravison, Steve Schwartzman, they are billionaires many times over. So let's talk for a minute about the basics of private equity. Think of it like buying and selling houses. Basically, PE firms use a mix of cash from investors and money barred from banks to buy companies make them more profitable and sell them down the line. And just like with houses, some people own them for a few years, take really good care of them, and sell them for a nice profit. Others, they're more like flippers who look to do the minimum to make a quick buck. Fiat firms have been rightly criticized over the years for shuddering plants and cutting jobs and pursuit of those massive profits, especially in recent years when it comes to medical practices owned by private equity firms. Some practitioners have complained that it forces them to choose between profits and patience. So as they've grown in stature, so too has the scrutiny and the sense of responsibility beyond the bottom line. Young and his partners, they're more than cognizant of that historical reputation and they're aiming to be more nurturing than swashbuckling. They're operating at a smaller scale than the big firms in the so-called middle market. I'm companies worth $50 million to $500 million. That's still a pretty big business. HGGC, they've raised four funds towing almost $7 billion. For Steve Young, it's unquestionably one of the most successful second acts of any former athlete. And while Steve may live in the same neighborhood in Silicon Valley as Mark Zuckerberg, you might not know it from his ride. Vans are the best cars on the road. If you don't have a van and you have kids and you don't have a van, you're an idiot. Yeah. I mean, how do you not go 14 cup holders and six outlets? I can run everything right here as lake, like a rocket ship. 87 was when I lived here for the first time. Silicon Valley was kind of up to full speed in 10 years, so by 1997. So in the last 20 years or so, 25 years even, it's changed in that the biggest companies in the world that weren't here 20 years ago are now here. But what hasn't changed is Stanford's down the street. Silicon Valley has always been kind of an entrepreneurial place. Back when Steve was playing in the early 90s, the technology boom was really just cranking up.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3482,2022-10-16 10:07:47
15197," entrepreneurial place. Back when Steve was playing in the early 90s, the technology boom was really just cranking up just a few miles from where the 49ers played at Candlestick Park. We're watching Silicon Valley just explode around us and Santa Clara, three calm, Cisco, name any business, any big business. And I don't know who had the first idea. I can't give it to anybody that knows who said it was like, let's, let's bring him in the locker room and we'll tell him, look, we'll trade some access to the locker room because that's what we have. Right. Because everyone wanted that, right? The 49ers at that time, it'd be like right now, name it like the patriots are the, the warriors, the Rams or anyone else. And so we had 10, 15 different companies, $10,000, $1,000 each, we just split it all up. And that would just started to come pretty regularly. Those investments and relationships were critical of Steve's own transition into the world of investing, but access to money and deals while playing isn't a guarantee of financial success. I went into private, I think it was a windy road. When you're playing, you're one of the best in the world or best athletes in world, but you don't have financial literacy. But you have all this money. And so there's a big huge chasm in between your financial literacy and the money that's in the bank. We've watched those stories in the tragic stories. It was a painful moment because when you have somebody coming to try to take your rosebore rings, your trophies, your cars, your house. Renskins running back, Clinton Portis, earning more than $48 million of the gridiron, but life after football led to bankruptcy and almost drove him to murder. Around 15% of NFL players file for bankruptcy within 25 years of retirement. And while there are extreme examples of failure and success, every player has the same transition. Companies now, they're getting hundreds, maybe even thousands of applications. So software has come in to automate the process. You want to write your resume for robots, not for humans. The only job your resume has is to be comprehensible to the software that is reading it because that software or robot is going to decide whether or not a human ever gets their eyes on it. These things are programmed by a certain segment of the population that might not be totally inclusive or not be, hopefully aware. Concerns about how this technology could exacerbate discrimination. For the FTC, I think foremost, the FTC needs to be making sure that we're fully understanding this technology. We don't trust companies to self-regulate when it comes to pollution. We don't trust them to self-regulate when it comes to workplace comp, why on earth would we trust them to self-regulate AI?

His transition was sudden, while making a tackle, Junior went airborne, landing with his full weight on his head. Most careers end like mine, unfortunately. It's just the nature of the game. And even though I was doing all that work from the very first day, I still wasn't ready. I kind of really wondered for a few years. I had ideas of things I wanted to do, but I just didn't take the step just to kind of move forward.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3483,2022-10-16 10:12:06
15198," Very first day I still wasn't ready. I kind of really wondered for a few years. I had ideas of things I wanted to do and but I just didn't take the step just to kind of move forward. I had the same paralysis like what exactly am I going to do? What am I even qualified to do? Junior would eventually end up working at HGGC with Steve as well as serve on the board for his foundation forever young. Through his foundation forever young Steve is looking to bridge that gap between athletes having a lot of money in the C-Describes financial literacy. He hopes to create a repository of player transition stories. It's a resource for players by players to give unbiased advice on what comes after sports. An effort to pay forward his success off the field and help others transition from the field to executive suites like the one his firm has at Levi's Stadium. So this is the firm's suite. Playing the game and what we all been through players don't realize how useful that can be if you paid attention. They don't realize the resources they can be. As Junior said we're all kind of frozen. I want them to know by definition of what you've been through you have something to add to the conversation. I began preparing for my future beyond football probably earlier than I wanted to because my dad kept packing at me about the rest of my life. What are you going to do? What's your plan? What's your plan? What's your plan? And I was like my plan is to play football. I was like that's not a plan. That motivation pushed Steve to go back to school at the same time he was playing running from super balls to law school for six years. In 1994 at the same year he was league MVP. He also graduated with a law degree from Brigham Young. Without the law degree I wouldn't have been able to get the opportunity to get into direct investing. Did I have the NBA that everyone had out of Harvard? Did I do this four years of consulting or banking? No. But I think I was given the opportunity because I had that in my pocket. I wouldn't have gone to law school if my dad had not had driven it into my head that you'd better have a plan. As his professional career wound down he would use those relationships forged in the locker room to find ways into the world of business. He sat on the board of power bar after becoming a huge fan of the product as a player. He used to just down them on the sidelines. Like Naiger's teammates Ronnie lot and Harris Barton young had become more invested in investing. He initially from Northgate capital with some ex teammates and then went on to Sorensen capital where he first worked with his future partner Rich Lawson. I actually started my career at Morgan Stanley prior to business school and the Mergers and Acquisitions department. And slept under a desk in New York and in Tokyo, Japan for Morgan Stanley. We started as direct investors at a firm called Sorensen capital and that was probably 20 years ago. The two eventually decided to create their own firm alongside two high caliber private equity mentors Bob Gay and John Huntsman senior. What looked like a winning partnership among the four of them initially called Huntsman Gay Global Capital didn't last. Gay opted to take a job with the Mormon church and Huntsman who planned to join after his company was bought never joined when that deal to sell his company fell through. So no Huntsman, no gay but young and lost an opted to press ahead as HGGC. So this is the inner sanctum. I like it. We did not clean it up for you Tom. I apologize. This is a working day. That's great. And I do. I love the helmet. The firm's offices are filled with sports memorabilia, much of which is used for prizes and charity work that Steve and the firm participate in year round. But Steve is quick to point out that it took a while for him to embrace being surrounded by his past. When I retired from football Roger Starbeck was my hero and we developed a relationship and I asked him, Roger, you were the greatest transition guys in the history of the NFL to go do something else. Give me some tips and his number one tip was run and I go run. What do you mean run? He goes just get it run away. But he said, because it'll never leave you, you always have football in the history of the NFL and all the things that happened. But you need to run. You also, and I don't think this is a stretch, had some hesitation about being X-football player investor. You wanted to be an investor. Is that fair? It's very fair and I think the more fame...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3484,2022-10-16 10:16:34
15199," about being X football player investor. You wanted to be an investor. Is that fair? It's very fair and I think the more famous you are as a player, the more accomplished you are, the more I thought the difficulty would actually have people take you seriously. And I wanted my fame to be a tool. I didn't want it to be a weapon and it's so easy to weaponize, right? You can bring in and just slay the room and that's not the way I wanted to do it. But certainly when I started, I held myself back in some ways. So integral to that transition as it were in that evolution is Rich Lawson, your partner. And we actually, I talked to him last week about this very topic. So I want to show you something. All right. His tag on it. Bring some drama. We have a very long hallway leading to our shared office that I can't seem to get my own wall. And every week I would put up his jerseys from his various different accolades, the USFL or the 49ers at BYU. And it would be strange because one day they'd be there. And then I would come back from a trip and they'd all be gone. So I think for years he wanted to minimize what his past was as opposed to embrace it. It's been really critical to our business. It's given us a bit of a defining characteristic in addition to being good investors. Because no matter how successful you are in other venues, if you're not delivering great returns for your investors, it doesn't matter. It's great. All true. Every bit of it. I'll call it immaturity on my part. But it was born out of this desire to try to make sure that what I was doing, I wanted people to know I was serious about. And that meant grinding it out on deals, doing the work to find by and fix companies. HGGC has completed more than 500 portfolio investments, transactions with an enterprise value of nearly $50 billion. Young and lost his playbook, it's one of cultivating relationships over long periods to consummate deals. As time went on, the sports memorabilia and Wall Street deal toys, those loose site mementos of companies bought, sold, or taken public, began to share space. You can see the four-night room is the main conference room. OK, we get it. Someone joked, I said, we promise to put you over, Joe, is the only place I ever get. It's funny, I was sneaking around your office earlier. I saw that picture of you and Montana, very intimate portrait of. We all agree that it was awkward. It never was an awkward. In fact, the ATT did a commercial on it recently. But it was always profitable. And I think that was that creative tension that it had in a part of it. And I'll always honor my time with Joe. I hated watching, but I love watching Joe. Do you think about that in the context of business and CEOs and succession? Like, you got to, right? So much of this business is classic relationship. Tag on the product may read made in the USA, but the sign on the CEO's door often says made in India. Alpha Beth Sundart Pichai, Microsoft Sacha Nadella, IBM's Arvind Krishna, Micron Technologies Sanjay Mayhotra, and that's just the start. Add in the chief executives of Adobe, Deloitte, Gap, VMware. And that doesn't count Indians running companies all over the world. Why have so many Indians risen to the top? But no coastal appoints to India's incredibly competitive education system. If you can survive the pressure it takes to get into one of the Indian institutes of technology, it gives you confidence to handle American universities and later the business world. Meanwhile, the belief in India's ability to produce so many tech wizards is reinforced every year. Indians make up about three-fourths of the immigrants receiving coveted H1B visas for the US. And it's a safe bet that some of them will eventually find their way to the seasweet.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3485,2022-10-16 10:21:00
15200," A few days later, I joined Steve at his charity golf tournament at Trune North, just outside of Scottsdale, Arizona. The proceeds of that day go to his philanthropic organization for every young. For nearly three decades, that served children facing significant physical, emotional, and financial challenges. I love golf. I love thinking about it. I just don't play it very often. But I believe that if you love golf and you don't play very often, you can get better kind of in your backyard. That's my theory, and it has proven untrue. Steve's ability on the course may not be etched into any record books, but following him around, it's clear that it's not the lack of trying. Oh well. All right. Off we go. We were constantly hustling behind him as he caught up with executives in the portfolio companies and reminisced with former and current players. He's a day trader. He's self-made digger. So he's on the bus after a game in New England, and he's day trading on the bus and Bill checks season and cuts him on the spot. The season that they went to the Super Bowl, day trading got him caught. In many ways it's a convention, right? The people that I don't see maybe once a year, we're half the field or more from our own portfolio and our own firm. And so it's kind of all come together. My firm, our charity, our fundraising efforts, and then the friends that are around. My dad and my brother, it all happens right there as a confluence of all these parts of my life that have found its common center. It may sound right, but these personal relationships and conversations that Steve has with folks on the golf course, it's actually similar to his and the firms approach to private equity. For them, the art is in the relationships built across the negotiating table and even in the days, months, decades leading up to being at that table. Rather than excel-based financial models ground out by young analysts and men having skyscrapers, more typically associated with bi-out firms. If you could leave the hubris behind that that says, I love that business, but it would be so much better, I ran it, right? To me, the more profitable way to do it, not just in returns, but in kind of legacy and abundance is to approach it kind of looking at the person across the table as your strategic partner. Let me understand how you fit into the family. One of the HGGC's best partnerships was with Brian Adams, the founder and CEO of an insurance technology company called Integrity. So we had an advisor that linked us up in the beginning and the first thing, everybody thinks of Steve as a football player and you're intimidated by this idea of this Hall of Fame quarterback, but what you really see quickly is how humble Steve is, how normal he is. Integrity is part of an auction in 2016, one where 19 others were bidding and while HGGC didn't put up the highest monetary offer, it was the relationship that Steve had struck up with Brian that helped them win the deal. Steve and I got to know each other and got to become friends and we started really kind of aligning our values for us. It was a lot of this kind of value alignment. It was like we've got to figure out how to become partners and it's been an incredible rise for us. After HGGC took a minority stake in Integrity, Steve was appointed chairman of the board. In six years the company grew from a few hundred employees to more than 5,000. That's in large part due to acquiring 125 companies through M&A. Both recently Integrity got a new round of funding, $1.2 billion from Silver Lake, one of the biggest firms out there. We've returned the fund and more with one just one investment off of a faith and a relationship really more than anything and a belief in each other. Integrity is also an interesting example of something notable and again somewhat radical that you do around.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3486,2022-10-16 10:25:13
15201," really more than anything and a belief in each other. Integrity is also an interesting example of something notable and again somewhat radical that you do around compensation and ownership and something that you've extended that idea even into your own firm in it in a different way. So walk me through that. Brian had the idea that he had 3,000 employees at the time and you know what, the equity owners of the business, the people that have the stock are making incredible amounts of money, but the employees are getting paid their salaries. What if we gave them stock? In 2019, integrity would do something almost unheard of for a company of their size and potential. They distributed partial ownership in the company to their employees base. He did that as a private business and I thought that's a way to solve for a lot of the ills of corporate world and how people see the world as building equity inside the employee base and I love that and I think we've done it in our firm as well and kind of more distributed partnership and trying to give equity out ownership not just held by two people because what that does is it allows for generational mindset. These work with growing players into business people mirrors the work he's doing at his own firm. They're he and lost and are nurturing the next generation of investors at HGGC and they're thinking of how his legacy will live on in the world of private equity through those younger executives. This is a place where there are 25-ish investment professionals and every single one of us is welcome to bring our ideas to the table and those ideas are heard so we meet every Friday for investment committee and it's not just the investment committee it's not the five or ten partners that meet it's the entire firm and a lot of places that's not the case. Good friend, ran a famous private equity firm nearby and he said your culture is what I want our firm to be like what do you do? I said well the first thing you ought to do is your founders need to put all of their relationships in the middle and no one owns anything and you don't fight over those relationships they're the firms. The 15 seconds and he's like yeah that's not going to work. So it's like the culture has to be kind of in the roots and that resonates with people. Passing down this spirit of abundance approach to private equity all came from Steve's playing days and his Hall of Fame coach Bill Walsh. I watched him do it in the late 80s there's a guy with a camera, the old school you know big thing on his back and he'd follow Bill around everywhere filming Bill as he spoke to the team went out on the practice field installed their offense in the lunch room and I kept that what is this like a museum they're doing or what are they doing a special documentary like no one knew what it was was he was creating a physical toolkit of video based audio based of all speeches and all of his playbooks and all of his installations everything paper based that he had and essentially wrapping it all up as a toolkit to hand it to his assistant coaches that he wanted to go have success in the league who takes all their secrets all the things that makes them great at the height of their greatness three or four generations ahead of everybody else in the league and wraps it up and hands it to the people who are leaving to go coach other places and then says to them you know what I'll see in the championship game and it happened there's a spirit to legacy there's a spirit to and so I watched it and I said to him Bill why would you do that? He said Steve we've got to give opportunity I want these men to succeed and I thought that's a heck of a statement because of course you do but who does the actual work to give them the opportunity to go succeed and giving away what you own that is most valuable is that great business? They would love that you can make an argument that maybe that is the great business that we need to be in.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3487,2022-10-16 10:29:24
15202," When you think of cutting edge technology at sea, you might be thinking of stuff like this. But there's an incoming revolution on the high seas that isn't quite as sexy but could be significantly more impactful. The sign of shipping is the key component of global trade. About 80% of all the world's goods are transported to sea at some point. But there's a significant unseen cost to the modern era of global commerce. About 3% of all the world's CO2 emissions come from shipping. 3% may not sound like a lot, but that's roughly comparable to the entire CO2 output of Germany. Since reducing trade isn't a likely option, what about a technological improvement? To help reduce the emissions from these well stock maritime behemoths. A lot's happening on Wall Street. I think Che Powell said things that were indefensible. Need to catch up. This is Bloomberg Wall Street week. I'm David Weston. We've got the information and insights. We think that's the next secular shift. From businesses most influential and instrumental. It's mocking it out the bullfrog. It's a challenging dynamic. This is a level of uncertainty that we haven't had to deal with. Bloomberg Wall Street week live Friday with replays all weekend on Bloomberg Television in radio. When US jobs numbers are released, Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed and instant expert analysis. Nobody covers jobs day like Bloomberg. It's in the way that There is no manual driving. A human cannot really drive it to transport passengers. So we want to make sure that that mindset, that shift, that distinction is clear. The name Zooks is a reference to a marine organism that, like the robot taxi, depends on renewable energy and is able to maintain a symbiotic relationship with its surrounding habitat. Chief Executive Aisha Evans says sustainability is at the heart of what they do, but is keen to stress that going green means more than just one thing. It's not just about electrifying. That's not what sustainability is. More and more people are coming up the economic social strata. They want to do stuff like everybody else. They want to have access to knowledge, good lives, shop and so on. And the infrastructure is saturated. And we need to think about things holistically when it comes to sustainability, not just electrification, but it doesn't have to happen overnight, though we need to get going.

15203," And we need to think about things holistically when it comes to sustainability, not just any certification, but it doesn't have to happen overnight, though we need to get going. In this episode of Leaders Goes Green, I speak to Zook's Chief Executive, Aisha Evans, about the challenges of developing artificial intelligence being acquired by Amazon and making a driverous future a reality. Aisha, thank you so much for joining us on Leaders With Lackwin, our Amazon acquired Zook's back in January 2020 for what reports suggested was $1.2 billion. Since then, the company has revealed it's Zook's vehicle. This is, I think, a rectangular passenger-focused vehicle with no driver-seed or steering oil. First of all, how would you describe it? We describe it as a purpose-built vehicle, but it's really a robot taxi that's its purpose. And essentially, it's about transporting people from point A to point B on demand in the most effective, cleanest and most enjoyable way. Why won't you call it a car? Because a car is, there is an inference that there is a driver. And in our case, especially a human driver, and from an engineering standpoint, the architecture of a car is around a human driver, the hood so that you can see ahead of you, the windshield, even the seating arrangement so that the people you're transporting do not bother you. Now, as in our robot taxi, there is no manual driving. A human cannot really drive it to transport passengers. So we want to make sure that mindset, that shift, that distinction is clear. So is there a piece of technology? I sure that you wish you'd have at your hands to make it better, to make it workable 100%. No, I'd time. If I could accelerate through time, that would be fantastic. Look, it's about testing. We can drive, that's not the issue. We follow the rules very well. I always say that when it comes to products that use self-driving technology, there are two numbers that are too metrics that are really important. Safety, we know that in the United States, on average, over 40,000 people lose their lives through car crashes. By the way, the pandemic did not help us. We actually spiked up to over 43,000. And those are mostly caused by the human driver's errors. You know, human were not at times the most disciplined. We're looking on phones, we're maybe a little bit de-habitated because of a couple of glasses of wine or we're talking to somebody. And that causes errors. But computers are very good at not making those types of errors. But there's another statistic that's really important is that on average, in the United States, humans collectively drive 100. Millions miles before causing a fatality. Just think about it. 100 million miles. And it takes a lot of testing, a lot of statistical math and forecasting to meet and beat that number because we strive to be better than humans. So when you focus on safety, I said, how much in advance can actually Zook's predict events that are about to happen? We can predict things so the way the AI stack works is, first of all, and this goes to our robot taxi and the sensor architecture and compute. It's important to maximize all of your chances to see what is going on around you and in your environment. And this is why our sensor architecture uses camera, light hours, radars, and longwave infrared cameras. That for example, we can sense heat and something is alive. This is why we have them at the top four corners so that at any point in time, three of those sensor pods are basically seeing you. And then the compute, being able to basically fuse all of that information and data on a continuous basis. And then predict what are the agents around us going to do potentially and therefore how should we react and we're constantly in that loop. And the better the better and the faster you can do that. And basically the more will be there. But that's not really the issue we're having with the testing. The issue we're having with the testing is what I call the millions of unique edge cases, the last minute things that happen.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3489,2022-10-16 10:38:08
15204," we're having with the testing. The issue we're having with the testing is what I call the millions of unique edge cases, last minute things that happen that humans basically are very good at dealing with. I like to say that you've been learning to deal with them as a human ever since you came out of the hospital, basically, as a baby. You're already seeing cars, agents, when do I cross, when don't I cross, all those types of things so that accumulated knowledge is what computers are not very good at, but we're able to run a certain level of prediction. What does this concrete me? So is this reflexes? Is this morality issues? It's things that, for example, another human broke the rule. They came on to your oncoming lane. You could say, hey, you're not supposed to come on my oncoming lane, but the reality is that when your human drivers see somebody else come on their oncoming lane, they assess the situation quickly, either stop, slow down, go around something, it's all of those little mini maneuvers every time something's different happens. So you're trying to, you're not only trying to replicate the human mind, right? And I don't know how long away we are from that. It could be decades, are you trying to better to make better decisions in the human mind? We're trying to make, I don't know that they are better than the human mind, but for a robot, they make a lot of sense. So we're trying to make the kind of parallel applicable decisions so that we're moving people around. And so that means we don't we won't normally we won't necessarily replicate what a human driver would have done, but we'll make a maneuver or a responding maneuver that makes a lot of sense is safe, keeps the flow of traffic, and also our customers comfortable. I mean, you have such a complex industry that you're dealing with. It's AI, it's regulation, it's of course actually making the vehicle. What would you describe your company as? We basically are mobility on demand company from point A to point B, first for human transport, that business model and that those businesses exist in the world today. The only difference is that when you're on an app today, whichever app you choose, what shows up is a passenger car with a human driver. So the business, that's the business, it exists already. All we're doing is replacing the tool, meaning it's not going to be a passenger car with a human driver. It's going to be a robot taxi that comes in. It's a more enjoyable experience. It's electric. Yes, it uses self-driving technology to move it, but that's it. So for those who think we're doing everything, we're not. We're doing the the vent diagram of what is necessary to accomplish that goal. So how far away do you think we're from accomplishing that goal? You're talking about, for example, gathering information, the perception phase, right, which is cameras, radars, inference. And lidar, look, it depends. We tend to be very realistic about what's going on here. This is a beginning of a wave. When you look at all of the big industry transformation, they did not happen overnight. They took quite a while. So in a geofanse area, we hope to be out there very soon. Our focus is being on public roads with our robot taxi soon. But it will be in a moderate small to moderate scale. And then the question is, how ability to be able to add geofancies to add cities on a continuous basis and in a way that is sort of good for customers. Because there's no point in doing it in one tiny little geofanse and not being able to go to a bigger trail of fans. Because then the customers will be like, this is a gimmick. When is that coming to me? Up next, evolution isn't always a smooth process. And Aisha Evans expects things will get bumpy on the road to the future of personal transportation. But she says innovation will find a way. One thing we know about humanity and our history is that progress is unstoppable.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3490,2022-10-16 10:42:30
15205," Limershï¿½ï¿½ We will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never. When you focus on green or sustainability, how do you think this will change cities? So, you know, I think it will improve things dramatically. The fleet will be, or is fully electric. That's a good thing. Second of all, today, humans, when we buy a car, we actually only use it 4% of the time. The rest of the time, it's parking either in our garage or in somebody else's garage or in the street and taking time. And so, just from a mathematical standpoint, we're building more things than we need strictly for human transport. So, we will make less things because when you're not using the robot axis, somebody else is using it. So, it's very effective and efficient. Now, I call it an improvement because we as an industry, and I mean overall, there needs to be a lot of improvement in the battery ecosystem. Whether it's batteries themselves, whether it's the making of them, the using of them, as well as what happens on the end of life of a battery. And I believe that they are still a lot of work to do, but I think there'll be a lot of innovation in that space. When do you think we'll have the first off driving robot taxi in a big city that's also very eco friendly. It's going to be, I don't know, if we don't get into dates at Zooks because we feel that it's better to show and then tell. Then the opposite as an industry and you know this I'm saying an industry meaning I think everyone included with me too many. Oh, it will happen. We've kind of like been either oh my gosh, it's going to happen tomorrow morning. Oh my gosh, it's never going to happen. So, we don't really get into the dates, but within definitely a more realistic timeframe that maybe some people are coding out there. I mean, testing has started for all of us. And so I think it's much sooner than people realize the question will be the game of then replicating that to several cities to an entire country and then to several countries. Were you frustrated or you frustrated now when you started, did you think it would be quicker to have the self driving robot taxis or slower. So out of me, that's not nice. I actually think it's going about I thought it would be even slightly slower. You know, the even the ecosystem of driving right or with passenger cars from the Carson buggy and all of the infrastructure that comes around it to where we are today took a little bit of while right. So I actually think that it's going at the correct pace. It's slightly slower, maybe than I expected, but it's about the pace. This is a big deal. This is a hard technology and this is a societal transformation. At the same time, we talk a lot about this environmental transformation, maybe taking longer than we were expecting because of some components not being readily available. So you worry for the car industry for the industry urine that we just don't have the right components for the battery or for the self driving vehicles. I think we have the right component at this point in time. The question is, how are we going to stimulate the industry, academia, research, governments, regular.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3491,2022-10-16 10:47:01
15206," component at this point in time. The question is how are we going to stimulate the industry, academia, research, governments, regulatory to pour a lot into this space. It's not just about having mandates. By 2000X, all cars will be XYZ. They have the whole infrastructure across all of the different vectors, including academia and research, that also has to come with us so that we have enough innovation for the scale that's going to be necessary. And how you change people's perceptions? I imagine that you're worried that in certain countries people won't want to give up their cars. Well, yes. I mean, disruption is always interesting. There are a lot of countries whose economies depend on the car industry. And so I do worry about that. But I think that one of the mistakes maybe we've made in times of disruption is to not have engineering empathy for the either the company or the country that's being disrupted. I think it's better to have conversations now. Figure out how we managed through the transition together as opposed to good or bad. Because one thing we know about humanity and our history is that progress is unstoppable. I like to say sometimes for effect that if you could wake up somebody who died 2000 years ago magically and then drop them in the middle of New York City or Mumbai or Cape Town, they literally couldn't function. They could they they wouldn't know what to do. And so I think it would be generous with each other and manage through the transition together, but understand that this this this is unstoppable and inevitable. Yeah, even someone who passed maybe 100 years ago would be complete, we lost a New York City. Exactly. They would be looking for the stable and the buggy and the coach and be like, no, no, no, no, you need to either buy a car, take the subway, take public transportation or call, you know, a mobility. And by the way, where's your phone? No, no, we don't mean this phone, we need a phone that's a computer in your pocket. Do you know what an app is? So yes, it would that's why I think that we just need to be patient and drive through the transition together. But actually, if we look at the last, let's say, 20, 30 years, it's amazing. The pace of change and how quick that was in the last six to seven years. Can we replicate that again? Oh, I'm confidence we can. Look, I prior to being in this industry, I was in the wireless industry, had a lot of fun with that from, you know, people forget, even the landline was an evolution, right? It used to be switch boards and an operator needed to be on the other end of that. And then from there, we went to cell phones. I remember being in a lab when we received the first text string on an LCD screen through GPRS and Edge. But then we were already working in research on LTE and basically Wi-Fi and all these things. And we were dreaming of having people having the internet in their pocket and what that would enable. By the way, we didn't really think about apps or anything like that. But we just trusted that with the availability of the infrastructure, people will innovate on top of that and boy, did they? And I expect the exact same thing to happen in the self-driving space. Up next, Aisha Evans on what life is like being part of the Amazon family. No, I don't hang out with bezels and drassi and lymph. And I mean, this is a job. They want us to get to market. They want us to make the progress we say we're going to make. They want us to build a great company and that's really the basis of the relationship.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3492,2022-10-16 10:51:07

The radio's central bank raises interest rates twice as much as full cost. Then surveillance for in-depth analysis. Alongside Tom Keane and Lisa Brownbitt, some Jonathan Ferro, the RPA, Fronts and C-D-L-L-N-S. How does Japan get away with not raising rates? Kenet sustained. It's normal at a time when everybody else is facing a very different reality. Bloomberg surveillance. Be informed. Be prepared. Be ahead of the game.. We all know Jeff Bezos has otherworldly travel ambitions. But his acquisition of ZUX in 2020 proved that the Amazon boss has a future of transport on this planet too. I continue the conversation. ZUX Chief Executive, I-Shavans. What's it like being part of the Amazon family? Do you get much exposure to Jeff Bezos? I get this question a lot. It's a lot of information. Yeah. Look, I mean, first of all, we love being inside Amazon. We literally are grateful and privileged because we are able to get the information from the Amazon family. We are very proud of the technology. We are very proud of the technology. We are very proud of the technology. We are very proud of the technology. We are very proud of the technology. We are very proud of the technology. We are very proud of the technology. We are very proud of the technology. Because this takes a lot of capital. And also, also, good learnings at destination and in my own demonstration. So we have been encourage us in the production of the technology and the technology and the production of the to make the progress we say we're going to make. They want us to build a great company, and that's really the basis of the relationship. Did you always think you'd get here when you were growing up? You were always, from my understanding, very passionate about science and technology. You know, when you were kid, it's funny. I wish I could get a redo, because man, I would be a lot more chilled than, I mean, I knew I wanted to study and be in the field of science and technology. I knew I wanted to match it and mix it with what enabled things for humanity and society across all continents, but exactly what form that would take and whether I was going to make it. I often think about, you know, when something bad happens to a human, I often think about, well, why them and not me. So no, I was a lot more stressed out about, is it, isn't going to work out than am I going to be exactly here? But I'm privileged and happy to be here. I feel blessed. Is that the kind of advice that you give to, if someone very young work to come and see you and say, like, I don't know what the jobs of tomorrow, what the future brings, what should I study at university? What would you tell them? So first, I always tell people, spend a lot of time with yourself. The longest relationship you're going to have in life is with yourself. Understand who you are. I can tell you that I don't know that I fully understand Aisha yet, but there are a lot of things I understand. Simple example. You know, Aisha likes disruption. So do not put Aisha in charge of something that doesn't need to be disrupted because she'll mess it up. And that doesn't make me good or bad. It just makes me different. So spend a lot of time with yourself. Second thing is understand your passions. Because if something doesn't feel like work, it feels, you love it. I know that's a cliche. Then you'll be able to go through the ups and downs of it. And you'll be able to evolve with it. Third, I believe that the blend is the most important thing right now. I think not understanding technology at all is going to make it difficult. If you want to be in that field or in sort of the field that drive things, but understanding empathy and humanity and blending technology with that is where it's at. I mean, A.I. is all about that at the end of the day. Talk to me a little bit. If you have to choose between sustainability, right? If you look at so it's sustainable, it's green, but this very advanced technology for driverless. If you have to choose between the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3493,2022-10-16 10:57:00
15208," A little bit, if you have to choose between sustainability, right? If you look at so it's sustainable, it's green, but this very advanced technology for a driverless. If you had to choose between the two, which one would you choose? It's a non-choice. They have to advance together. Now, we can make some compromises short-term versus medium-term versus long-term, but it has to go together. I mean, sustainability, and that's one of the things that's a little bit of a bad piv of mine. It's not just about electrifying. That's not what sustainability is. More and more people are coming up, the economic social strata. They want to do stuff like everybody else. They want to have access to knowledge, good lives, sharp and so on. And the infrastructure is saturated, and we need to think about things holistically when it comes to sustainability, not just electrification, but it doesn't have to happen overnight, though we need to get going. What kind of leader are you? An evolving leader, a learning leader. I place a lot of focus on people. At the end of the day, my job is to serve the people so that we can reach the goal. I can't do anything by myself. I already know what I think. And so what's more important is how do I enable others? How do I understand why they think the way they do and how do we get to the same goal? I think that I'm a little bit of a control freak, but this is in rehabilitation. I've been on it for 15 years. That's probably the thing that's the hardest. And it manifests itself usually on Fridays at 5 p.m. And so everybody at Zooks knows that if you're going to schedule a difficult meeting on Friday at 5 p.m. You might need to manage through Aisha because I'm just exhausted by that time. And my ability to control myself is not as effective. Do you remember the hardest day in your career? And what did you learn from it? I've had plenty of hard days. I mean, one hard day was at Intel. I was in a very, very, very difficult meeting and situation. I was angry coming out of that meeting and I will always be grateful to Stacey Smith. He was the CFO back then. He gave me a call and he said, how are you feeling? I said, not good. I use choice words. And I'm going to do this, that and the other. And he basically said, look, first of all, I hear you. I understand why you feel that way. Why don't we do this? If Monday morning you still feel like sending that email, then send it. But hold it in your inbox until Monday. And need less to say, I didn't send it Monday. I learned a lot from that sponsorship, generosity, being proactive, managing your triggers and so on. I would say that I've had some tough zoos moments, especially around choosing what to do long-term. But stay through to your principle and play the long game, not the short game, because with zoos, if we had chosen the short game, it would have been not good for the company in the long run. Aisha, thank you so much for joining us today. Francie, my pleasure. Thank you. What are the moon shots at Amazon that are capturing most of your time and attention? Well, we have a unique way.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3494,2022-10-16 10:59:39
15209," What are the moon shots at Amazon that are capturing most of your time and attention? Well, you know, we have a unique way that we go get big new investments. And I'm not sure it's right or wrong, it just happens to be our way. And we ask ourselves when we're considering something for questions. We ask if it's successful, could it be big and move the needle in Amazon? Is it being well served today? Do we have a differentiated approach and do we have confidence there and if not, can we acquire quickly? If we like the answer to those questions, we'll go pursue it with a single-threaded team that isn't distracted by the rest of the business. When it comes to the stock, it has fallen significantly. Do you think investors are missing something or has tech just been overvalued? I have never tried to predict what stocks might do. In any time, I've tried to a little bit, I've been wrong. I do really believe that in the short term, the stock market tends to be a voting machine and the long-term it tends to be a weighing machine. We have a concept we talk about a lot of Amazon inputs and outputs. You know, in the ultimate output for a company is share price. You know, in that other big outputs are free cash flow or profit or revenue. You can't really manage the outputs. You have to manage at the input level and that's where we spend all our time. And so if you do the right things for the business long-term, things tend to work out. I think we've had very good returns for investors and I expect that to be true again.

Before the COVID pandemic upended the way the world does business, logistics was one of those industries that might have been taken for granted. That's not the case anymore. Due to all the turbulences over the last two years, customers are now realizing how important it is to have a reliable logistics partner on their side. Our people are doing a quite complex job. People think, oh, they just deliver passes somewhere, that's an easy job. If you think about what our people are doing, it's quite complex. Businesses and consumers are suddenly thinking a lot more about how things they need reach places where they're needed. It's thrust the sector into the spotlight. Logistics and supply chain has become a household need. It's dramatically different than three pandemic. Yes, it's grown whether that's in market power, revenue, profitability, investor interest. For Deutsche Post DHL Group, that's created opportunity to build on momentum and set ambitious goals for service and performance. When you look at our footprint, you're the most international logistics company there is. We want to become more digital and we want to be much more sustainable than we have been. DP DHL's revenue has soared since 2020 with full-year profit nearly doubling in 2021. CFO Melanie Christ is a key leader of the team that's delivered these results and she views her role as much more than just a number cruncher. There are unfortunately these clichÃ©s that finance is boring and it's kind of like been counting in the back office to be successful in finance. I mean, you have to have the financial expertise, right? But we also have to be credible business leaders in order to really impact the business and steer the direction. She is extremely smart and bright.

And she's not afraid to call people out, to call out other members of the executive team if she feels that something isn't being. She does that in a very nice way, actually. She helps meet tremendously in steering of the company because she is highly regarded by my other colleagues in the senior team. And typically, if they have a problem, they share at first with her before they come to me. When I think about the conversations I have with Frank, the shortest part is actually about the analysis and the facts. It's more the debate about, okay, on that basis, what are the options? What can we do? My role is essentially saying in three sentences, what is working well in this company? Where do we have challenges? And what should we do going forward? Deutsche Post DHL Group consists of five divisions. Express Germany's Post and Passel Service, Global Forwarding and Freight, Supply Chain and E-commerce Solutions. Each of these segments has seen revenue growth in the last four years, while the surge of e-commerce volume during the pandemic has had a direct impact on the trajectory. Have you seen e-commerce as a very structural and fundamental growth driver for us as a company? What we now saw under the pandemic was a structural acceleration. It took us forward to a point in terms of e-compensation, which we probably would have reached on the normal circumstances in three years' time. So it was a big step forward. The DP DHL was well prepared to take this step. The company's strategic plan recognized e-commerce as a growing trend in the logistics landscape, but no one could have forecast the speed and breadth of the transformation. What we are now seeing that also under the pandemic, not only domestic e-commerce has taken a faster growth trajectories and anticipated, but also cross-border e-commerce. And we see that very clearly in our express network, but also in our e-con solutions division. What are the other big structural shifts that you see on the horizon? Is it e-commerce B2B? Is it increased trade as globalisation restructures? What are the shifts that you're seeing? The board B2B e-commerce is still at a very early stage. So we believe that there will be a huge close opportunity there. And we also see that when we are talking to our customers now, I guess everybody has been now realized that being dependent on just one supplier in one province in one country is probably not a good idea. So they want to build more resilience into the supply chain. I think our international footprint, our global strengths, is really something we can leverage for the benefit of our customers. Another factor in the company's favour is its balance sheet. Since Melanie Christ became CFO, cash flow has improved significantly. One of my priorities over the last years has been to really focus the whole organisation on better cash generation. It's not just a finance job, making sure that ultimately a revenue convert into EBIT and into cash and bank account is the responsibility of the whole organisation. She says, we can't be successful as a company if we are not collecting the cash for our services we have provided. And she has not missed one single opportunity to talk about that. I think it's a very comfortable situation, particularly in the current environment, to have a strong balance sheet. I think in that respect, I'm very conservative and I'd rather have a bit more on the balance sheet and a bit more buffer. Spell out for us what the priorities are, the longer term priorities in terms of putting some of that cash to use for you. The first priority here is organic growth. We clearly indicated also this our CAPEX budget, 12 billion for the next three years, that we will keep investing into organic growth. We are very focused on our regular dividend payment. And then, if there is something left, which is fortunately the case at the moment, we will think about inorganic opportunities and we will also think about other means to allow our shareholders to participate. That is why we are currently running a 2 billion euro share by VEC programme. Inorganic opportunities include M&A, like the recent purchase of beverage shipper, Hila Brand. But the brssssssssss.

15211," You're running a 2 billion euro share by the program. Inorganic opportunities include M&A, like the recent purchase of beverage shipper, Hila Brand. But deploying cash is always subject to careful consideration. Does Melanie ever turn around and say, no, when you're pushing through or pushing for a particular package of spending? Yes, she does that quite often, you know, because she has... She is a person in that grade, if you have a CFO who is riskabrous, because you need somebody. You know, the business is always too optimistic. Melanie might be something too pessimistic, but that's a very healthy discussion. And if we then jointly come to the same conclusion after a debate, then we are probably in the right spot. How often do you find yourself saying no to divisional heads? So when I was promoted into the CFO position, my team gave me a stamp with rejected. It sits on my desk. I think the fact that people know it sits there already has instilled quite a lot of discipline in the organization. So I think when I get a proposal, it has already gone through a number of iterations and is normally of such a high quality that I don't need the rejected stamp too often. For the time being, Christ should be able to keep that stamp in a drawer. CEO Frank Appell has expressed a commitment to service quality and confidence that customers will accept higher prices that come with it. If you are too expensive, you will be out of business, but if you don't provide the right quality, you will be out of business as well. So we want to be, we will never be the cheapest in town. That's not doable. We are the premium provider. That's our strategy. Of course, it's also more challenging for us when our customers are under pressure. At the same time, I think, over all the last two years have shown that a reliable high quality supply chain comes at a certain price tag. I definitely see that inflation is having a huge impact on the logistics industry. And there's been substantial price increases in the last few years. I do not see that changing. There's a lot of innovation happening. And I don't see the inflation necessarily going away. It might level out a bit, but it's not going to go away. The logistics companies may have pricing power with customers, but their stock prices haven't been so robust. I think that the issue there is the increase in interest rates has made everyone rethink and be concerned about the level of inventory that is out in the system, if you will, and with the level of disruption. I think what's happened more in the last three months is the more of a view that we're actually heading into. Certainly, an economic slowdown may be a recession. With more than half its revenue coming from Europe, investors may see DP DHL as more exposed to recession risks than its global peers. The company insists it can meet its revenue targets in the event of a downturn. It's counting on diversification as a cushion. I'm not so pessimistic that there is really a deep recession at our doorstep. But even then, our portfolio is very much balanced. We are everywhere in the world. The world will not go entirely in recession. I doubt that. Would it be a stretch to suggest that DP DHL is, to some extent, recession proof? I wouldn't go as far as to say recession proof, but I think we are very well positioned to deal with all different types of recession scenarios due to the breadth of support for you. The balance of support for you really gives us a lot of resilience against any type of headwind. Coming up, a look at DP DHL's investments in action. Melanie Christ shows me around the company's state-of-the-art in logistics. What I love about this building is it actually shows the big mega trends which formed our strategy 2025. This is Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3497,2022-10-16 11:12:45

You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer, disrupt. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. As the Chief Financial Officer of one of the world's largest logistics companies, Melanie Christ has made her mark in global business. That's not what she originally attended to do. I really wanted to go into research. I wanted to become a physicist and that was where my passion was. But then during my studies, some friends of mine started doing this strange thing. They went into management consulting. I didn't even know how to spell it. And I had no idea what it was about. But what they told me was quite interesting. And so I ended up doing an internship with a consulting firm. And I learned more in the two months there than I had in the last two years in my physics job at university. That is how I ended up in consulting. She started her career with three years at McKinsey. Then spent four years in private equity with APAC's partners in London. Before joining Deutsche Post DHL Group in 2004. I was brought into the company to do international M&A project. That was at a time around 20 years ago when we were really building the company in the current shape, acquiring lots of logistics companies around the world. The M&A part was the first thing. And I then wandered into a more mainstream finance field here in the group, becoming the CFO of our digital express division. So from then on it was more leading towards the CFO role eventually. Malenny Christ now heads the finance team with around 11,000 employees. Success in this role is as much an art as a science. If you do the greatest piece of analysis and you see it all and you know it all, but you can't convey that message and you can't convince the rest of the organization that we should move into a certain direction, it's useless. DP DHL is sending a consistent message with its investments. The company spent 123 million euros to upgrade its logistics centre at the Cologne-Born Airport, designing it around key strategic goals. What I love about this building is it actually shows the big mega trends which formed our strategy 2025, which was inaugurated in 2019 when this building opened. Globalisation connecting the world. E-commerce, we have a lot of sortation facilities here for smaller e-commerce shipments. Sustainability, it's a very sustainable building, there's solar panels on the roof and everything, and digitalisation. And well you can obviously see that it is quite automated. How did the team pitch this investment to you initially? And how hard was it as a sell for them? How quickly did you turn around and say yes, this is worth 123 million euros? Of course you always have to make sure that you have the right capacity for the growth in the network. And at that time they came and said hey, we will really see a strong growth in e-commerce volumes on top of the regular B2B growth, we need more sorting capacity, we need this building. And of course there are always debates, does it really have to cost 123 million euros and so on? But fortunately they convinced us because then with Covid and the volume search we urgently needed the capacity. At the same time as Covid accelerated demand for logistics services, disruptions in the labour supply hurt productivity. Advances and technology like this digital sauter have helped offset some pressures but automation also raises questions. Does this tell us that this is the business grows? This is going to become a more automated business, that there's going to be less need for labour for workers. Well you still see people here and I think what you can nicely witness here is the combination of technology which supports people. So for example when you look at the customs area, it used to be a very manual and sometimes confusing process. Now the people are supported in picking the right treatments for customs inspections by light and they are automatically sorted in the sort of to go to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3498,2022-10-16 11:17:10
15213," Customs inspections by light and they are automatically sorted in this sort of to go to customs inspections. So it is also helping the people with the jobs they're doing here every day. We are over set here in 2019-20. You know, we might get one-third less jobs in the current setup until 2030, if we digitalize the organization. But we are very sure that our company will be at least 50, maybe 100% bigger and we will have more jobs to offer than that. At the beginning of a couple of years ago when we started that journey, people said, oh, you know, I might lose my job. I haven't heard that in the last two years as a question in any town hall. This airport hub also showcases DP DHL's aviation fleet, which both small than 320 dedicated cargo aircraft. The biggest tank of our aircraft, but we also have short and medium and long term leases. And this grows in our business. We anticipate that the people keep going. You've talked about investing, of course, in sustainable fuel. Yes. When does that come online? How significant is it? Is it just the critics might say that's just window dressing around a part of the business that is of course very carbon intensive? At least a lot of emissions. Yeah, so you absolutely write the problem with our beautiful aircraft is the CO2 emissions. And when you look at our overall CO2 emissions, two thirds are from aviation. It is about flying these birds with more sustainable fuel. And we said that we're really willing to spend billions on it. We now really hope that we will see the uptick and supply over the next years. Spending billions isn't vague hyperbole. The company has pledged to put seven billion euros towards sustainable technologies and fuels by 2030, with a goal of climate neutral logistics by 2050. Sustainability makes good business sense anyway, especially if you are in a business that is energy or fuel hungry as a compliance element that not just operators in the logistics sector need to consider, but also their customers. So being transparent becomes part of the service about their impact on the globe. We had a lengthy discussion should we make a financial commitment? How much we want to invest for the next decade in our sustainability? We had a long debate is it right to say we want to invest seven billion until 2030? There were pros and cons. But that was a very intense discussion melody in I had where we finally came to the conclusion that this is a right number. This is a right approach. We convinced our colleague and that's the reason why we are where we are, where we are seen as somebody who really commit that not that many people are. We have not that many companies who have quantified their future investment. Still ahead how one of the business world's most influential women is working to strengthen gender equality within her company. I think the great thing is that now across the board in finance but also in the group overall, we have role models which show young female talent that everything is possible. This is Bloomberg. When US jobs numbers are released, Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed and instant expert analysis. Nobody covers jobs day like Bloomberg. Imagine simply climbing a cable into space. The concept is known as the space elevator. Not only could it significantly change how we leave planet earth, but it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space. And they're a scientist who think we could have already built it. We have the material, we have the technology, we have the lasers, we have the climbers, we have all of it. If a private entity wants to build it or a government, they could build it. It'll change society. We have no clue how colonizing in the space, how really spreading on the space, really change our society over the next 50 to 200 years. It'll be completely different.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3499,2022-10-16 11:21:22

Deutsche Post DHL Group CFO Melanie Christ is often named to lists of the most powerful women in business. And while men still outnumber women as finance heads of large companies, there are signs that the balance is shifting. The number of female CFOs across major US companies has risen to an all-time high, according to a study by Chris Colder Associates. And executive search firm Cohen Partners reports that 36% of new CFOs hired by notable companies in the first half of 2022 were women. I asked Melanie Christ if she's encountered obstacles as a woman rising through the executive ranks. I have to say, I have not made many negative experiences. Maybe I was also a little bit in the evenal thinking about these challenges so much. So when I studied physics, there weren't many women, so I was somehow always used to it. And it can also be an advantage when you're kind of like the only girl in the room. I mean, the boss at the end remembers your name and not the 19 guys who all kind of like wear dark suits and white shirts and look alike. So I never experienced it as an external stress factor. I have to say for me personally, it was more balancing my own expectations around kind of like getting family and the job combined. But that was probably more of a pressure I put on myself, thinking that I had to be perfect in every dimension and not something where the pressure was put on me from my male colleagues. So how do you take that experience and put it to play in terms of how you advance the role of women in this organization? I think the great thing is that now across the board in finance, but also in the group overall, we have role models which show young female talent that everything is possible. In finance, we have a share of women in management of 32%. So we are ahead of the group. We want to get to 35% by 2025. I think we are now at a position where if you have a vacancy, I want to have at least one woman on the shortlist. Because we have enough female talent. So every shortlist should contain a woman and then the best person in the race should win. CEO Frank Appell says Christ sets an example for the entire organization. And he believes her success may influence the entire industry. She has proven that she is an outstanding CEO for all. And she is definitely a role model in many dimensions that you know what I like about there. She is still you know a very warm and nice person and that makes such a big difference. So you can get to that level without compromising on how nice you are as a person. I think she is a great role model. I think I hope that this has had positive impact for many others. From the big picture down to the smallest operational details, Melanie Christ is fully engaged in guiding DP DHL into the future. I wanted to know what she sees when she looks ahead. What do you see as the biggest opportunities for DP DHL over the next 10 years? I think we have a fund.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3500,2022-10-16 11:25:45
15215," Sees when she looks ahead. What juice is the biggest opportunities for DP DHL over the next 10 years? I think we have a fantastic portfolio and we just have to leverage the growth opportunities which are there both on the ECOM site and also on the traditional B2B site. And the key differentiators for us will be digitalisation, sustainability and our great people. As you look ahead 10 years, what are some of the challenges? What keeps you up at night as you think about the business going forward? I think we have to keep this focus and the ability to adjust in a very agile way. Sometimes when you kind of like think about all the risk controlling and stuff, people tend to create the impression that you can preplan everything. That's clearly not the case. So I think we have to stay focused and keep the ability to react in a very agile way. But looking at what happened over the last 24 months, I'm very optimistic that we will also be able to cope with whatever happens next. And how do you see your role changing in the years ahead? I think it is changing at a very rapid pace, which is a great thing because it never gets boring. Those elements I just mentioned for the group overall, digitalisation and sustainability are also hugely relevant for the finance role. It's like a new language you have to learn. And you learn the vocabulary, but then you also have to develop a feeling if I kind of like put so much capital into this decarbonisation measure, I get so much in terms of return out of it. But that's a fascinating opportunity where we can make a huge difference for finance and for the group overall. As you look to the future, Melanie, what do you think is going to be the skill sets, the knowledge bases, they're going to be essential to the success of future CFOs? Yes, probably the two most essential new skills will be to get even better at lifelong learning, because we will have to learn so much new stuff every year, be it in the digitalisation area, be it on sustainability. So this ability also has a 50-year plus-old person to keep learning and keep the curiosity. I think that is going to be super essential, and the second element will be being a great team player. The world is complex, you can't know it all, so you really have to work even more strongly with your team. What advice would you give to someone who's just recently been appointed CFO? That's a great question. I think I would probably simply say, be curious and ask as many questions as you can, try to learn as much as possible, not only in the finance area, but get close to the business, try to really understand the business, because only when you are close to the business and you understand the fundamental profit drivers, will you be a really great CFO. I'm Tom McKenzie. This is Bloomberg. So is there more pressure when you're trying to win a basketball championship than when you're trying to please investors? Where's the greater pressure? Oh, I think it's definitely trying to win a championship. It's hard, because when you invest and you know this, when you're investing, you can control a lot more things. When in a basketball court, you can't control whether somebody's going to make a shot, you've got to get lucky. And what's the greater pleasure making five times your money on a distress debt investment or winning the NBA championship? They're both fabulous. I wish I could do one each year. That would be great. But I think there's a great feeling in being right on an investment, that you've done a tremendous amount of work and you've made money for your clients, which I think is great. I think winning a championship is, it's a very surreal feeling because there's a whole city or state that is actually behind you. You know, we had 70,000 people at the finals and we had them all outside. It's 17,000 in stands and then literally like 60,000 people outside. And when we won, like just the joy that you had brought to the city was phenomenal.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3501,2022-10-16 11:30:10
15216," And when we won, like just the joy that you had brought to the city was phenomenal. We make it very transparent to the shopper before they accept an order. What's the order is going to look like? How much we're going to pay them and how much like the consumer is paying them. And so they can decide whether they take an order or whether they refuse it. And that's a kind of flexibility that our shoppers really value and the kind of transparency that they want. Are you seeing a labor shortage right now? And what are you doing to come back at? It's different in different places or demographic of shoppers is completely different from food delivery and our right sharing where 70% women and half of them are moms. And that's because a lot of the job at Instacart is very different and just being in the car with strangers. It's about like going to the store doing a good job of customer service of really picking the right product for the consumer and we are seeing that being very appealing to women.

Welcome to the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit. I'm Froncing Lockwell here at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. This event powered by Bloomberg featured finalists selected by the Earth Shop Council, launched by Prince William, is a global initiative that drives innovation on solutions to climate change and environmental issues in the following categories. Protect and restore nature. Clean our air, revive our oceans, build a waste-free world, fix our climates. So over the next half an hour, we'll bring you all the highlights from this most important gathering. This is Bloomberg. Protect and the environment was of course close to my grandmother's heart, and I know you should have been delighted to hear about this event and the support you're all giving our Earth Shop finalists. The next generation of environmental pioneers. Together in this room are the people and organisations who will help us to achieve the Earth Shop mission, to repair, restore and rejuvenate our planet within this current decade. That mission is not simple. Just as President John F. Kennedy so famously said, as he challenged the United States for America, to unite behind the goal, putting man on the moon, we choose to do these things not because they are easy, but because they are hard. I know that the world is an uncertain place right now, that many families and communities across the globe are facing unimaginable challenges. From conflicts to energy crisis and food shortages. While addressing these in the short term, we must also remain resolutely focused on tackling the greatest challenges that threaten our tomorrow. Because if we don't, the changing climate will only serve to entrench these immediate challenges into fundamental global issues, severely impacting the lives of each and every one of us. That is why our collective mission is so urgent, but there is huge reason to be optimistic. The 2022-21 cohort of Earth Shop winners and finalists is evidence that we can succeed. That we can protect our world for our children, our grandchildren and the generations that will follow them. These pioneers exemplify the leadership needed in this decade of change. They include inspiring activists, brilliant innovators, a forward-thinking city, and even an entire country making a real difference. But they cannot do it alone. This must be...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3502,2022-10-16 11:34:25
15217," Brilliant innovators afford thinking city and even an entire country making a real difference. But they cannot do it alone. This must be a team effort. We must come together behind their innovative solutions to ensure they reach their full potential with peace and scale. While my message today is one of gratitude and encouragement, I also acknowledge that you cannot succeed in isolation. As governments, we have a responsibility to create the incentives and the space for you to flourish. A receptive environment for change and the accountability that comes with guardianship. In many nations, the foundation for this approach has been flayed for us long ago if we choose to listen. Where I come from, I'll tear down New Zealand, a beautiful place you must visit. Our indigenous people hold the world view that every single living and non-living thing is connected. Our people, our plants, our animals, descendants of Ranganoi, the sky father and Papa Tuanuku, the earth's mother and their children. And so it follows that people and nature are kin, are family. And we must care for one another in the spirit of Kaitiaki Tanga, which translates into guardianship by the people of the land for the next generation. In short, koha ho tetaow, kote tayao koha ho, I am the environment and the environment is me. Our life source, our economy, our future. Now I've seen this in action first hand many times, not least in my own backyard, the Pacific, where the ocean is a source of protein, income, culture and connection. Now it is a source of challenge as it rises up and begins to inundate small island nations. It can be confronting to hear and see the stories of just how real these challenges are, but none of us are here because we have given up, but because we believe there is a way to change the future. We are not only part of the nature, but we are nature. Nature is living element. For indigenous people, nature is whole. Our planet is alive. The rivers are her blood. The trees are her hair. The soil, her skin, the wind, her breeze. And indigenous peoples, our planet they know, they are the doctor. We are protecting 80% of the world's biodiversity. Because our way of life do not harm nature at the opposite, we are strengthening ecosystems. We improve biodiversity by cooperating with the birds and trees, listening to the winds, observing the cloud, learning from even the little insect. We protect nature by setting up our own limits. We don't take more that mother earth can give and we give back. We protect the sacred trees. We don't destroy the field of the medicinal plants. We choose, pre-susely, the animal that we can kill to just keep the balance of the ecosystem. As all of us know in this fight, no one can afford to sit on the sidelines. No one can claim that climate change is somebody else's problem or shrug it off for future generations to address. We are all affected by a warming planet. We see that every day and decisions being made right now will determine our shared tomorrow. So we must choose and we must act as united nations ourselves. Our progress depends on collective action, on collective ingenuity. If we stick together, we can make fixing the climate the greatest project and greatest achievement of our lifetimes. We have the science, we have the solutions. Now all the world needs is political will. Together we can create a future where rampant carbon is removed from the atmosphere. Where green buildings and green businesses.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3503,2022-10-16 11:38:40
15218," is political will. Together, we can create a future where rampant carbon is removed from the atmosphere, where green buildings and green business transform the livability of communities, where easy access to renewable energy enables greater equity, where sustainable agriculture feeds a growing global population. The needs are urgent, and the costs of inaction are worse than any nightmare. But let us not be driven by hope, not fear, by optimism, not despair, because hope is not passive. Hope is the ultimate source of renewable energy, pushing us forward every day to try and try again. Today, the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit in partnership with Mike Bloomberg and Bloomberg Philanthropies will ask each and every one of us what we can do to accelerate progress to repair our planet this decade. And offer solutions on how to collaborate to drive this ambitious but essential climate agenda. We will continue to drive impact around system-changing climate solutions and amplify the Earth Shop Prizes call to accelerate progress to repair our planet through collaboration and innovation. But most importantly, we will remind ourselves what can be achieved when we turn pessimism to optimism and optimism into action. Coming up, put more from the panelists and finalists here at the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit. This is Bloomberg. Back in 1997, I was interested in the following question, which is there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called Saurapod dinosaurs, which had really long skinny necks. So Apatosaurus is an example. Now, it's had really long skinny tails. So I made a computer model that showed that in fact, the tail of these Saurapod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip, a bullfip. Now, the way a bullfip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. And that crack is a sonic boom. I think the way they got a date was to impress the females by making loud booms. No one covers the world like Bloomberg.

When I last went through Europe, people were the leaders were all saying, hey, give me technologies so I can tell Putin to get lost.

Seeds typically between the timing start and they get out in the farmers fields is about eight years. Now we have a pipeline of innovations. We've been funding the CG system for 20 years now. It's funded about a billion a year. It's, if people care at all about adaptation, that thing will be funded at two billion a year. I mean, there won't be anything close to the impact of climate related seeds, climate related maize, rice, wheat, sort of a millet. And thank goodness, because of human genetics, we know how to do the editing, thank goodness, because of AI, we know how to find the alleles, because of drones, we can measure stuff in the field. So there's huge advance in terms of how the whole seed ecosystem moves at full speed. The timing is very tricky here. The warming doesn't stop the day you get to zero emissions. There's a lag in this system. It's about a 20-year lag. So you haven't seen that Earth Tempest is not equilibrated to the atmospheric CO2 content. So when you get to zero, it's not like 2051. Take my air conditioner away. No, it starts quite a bit later. And so you have to look at what the peak is, and you can't just plan for OK, 2030, 2030 is where your main production in central Africa is down 25%. By 2050, it's down 70%. And you will have switched in most of those areas from a fairly heat-sensitive crop to Sorghum. Now Sorghum productivity is super low. So we'll get people to do better maize for these next 15 years, and then they are going to have to switch to Sorghum. It is tough when you see the floods in Pakistan. I mean, nobody expected that. If the goal of climate was to make us pay attention, wow, that is way beyond expectation. So some adaptation money literally will just be disaster recovery money. The boundary of what's also pretty confusing. I mean, what is food aid? If climate's causing some production losses, all world-proof program money is that all climate adaptation money? It's certainly the need for it's going up. That's a system that's about 6.5 billion a year, so relative to the systemic solution, which is the research piece, it's relatively larger, but the demand for that piece, which is the acute half of Pakistani rice got flushed away. So I do think we're going to bring some rigor to this, because the pressure now, the goal of doubling the adaptation money from, they say, 20 billion here to 40 billion here, the pressure on that is the problem. Still peanuts. No, it's very small. I mean, yeah, if you start sticking food aid in there, you can use it up very quickly, rebuilding after hurricanes. I mean, we had hurricanes before, but the costs there are absolutely gigantic. There are ways of stopping wildfires, there are ways of dealing with sea level rise. So the innovation agenda, not just on seeds, the innovation agenda is going full speed on mitigation. That's where there's 100 companies break through energy and it's funded. And by mitigation, you mean mostly energy. You mean everything to do with energy. You mean generation of energy, you mean batteries, you mean transport, you mean all of the new, and there's some renewables that are already traditional, but more that need to come on. So that's the package that you're talking about mitigation. Or are you also talking about agriculture as mitigation? Yeah, so every area of emissions, the world tends to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3505,2022-10-16 11:47:34
15220," as you're talking about mitigation. How are you also talking about agriculture as mitigation? Yeah, so every area of emissions, the world tends to focus on past near cars and electricity. That's not a third of emissions. And so the focus on the easiest third, now 4% of new cars are electric. So that's the field that we're further still long. About 4% of energy generation is wind and solar. And as you triple the size of your grid, you want that to be say, some people would say 100%. Other people might say 70 to 80%. The amount you have to build, we're not within a factor of 5 of the build rate of those. But those are the easy sectors. Cement, clean cement costs over twice as much as the way we make cement today. And it's partly the heating energy. It's partly the basic thing, remember in chemistry, when you take calcium carbonate and heat it, you get calcium, that's what makes cement. But the thing that goes away, that's CO2. And so we have to have a way of making cement, which a number of these innovative. And a steel and iron. Yep. There's a whole family of hard to obeyed sectors. That's true. If you get a dead industrial sector, if you get green hydrogen that's cheap enough, it actually solves quite a large number of those. Some of the industrial processes should go straight to electricity. And some you go through, you do your reduction using the hydrogen, where you would have used some hydrocarbon concept before. For steel, we actually have companies doing both. We have electricity steel and others doing electricity is the way of replacing the blast furnace. And then we have others that take hydrogen. And if you get the hydrogen cheap enough, you get the super magic thing, which is that the green product doesn't cost more. That's called the green premium equals zero. And then your adoption scale is utterly different. If we tried to subsidize steel and cement, say rich countries say, OK, we want to get rid of that, which those two are 15% of emissions, that's greater than all foreign aid budgets put together. And so over 200 billion foreign aid never will pass that number. It's just not politically possible. It's a number that's at about 170 and going down today. Coming up, but more from the panelists and finalists here at the Earth's Shop Prize Innovation side. This is Bloomberg. Big, expensive cities have a lot going for them. But if you live in one, you've probably noticed that these big, expensive cities keep getting more, well, expensive. You could always move away. You might have just started working remotely, so there's really nothing keeping you there. But then again, moving is a hassle. Well, what if someone paid you 10 grand to do it? What if they threw in free office space, a bicycle, or a gym membership? Programs and cities and states around the US are doing exactly that. And they're getting a lot of interest. We've had over 50,000 applications. About 90,000 applications. We've had over 1,800 applicants from all over North America. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them? Or are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns for places looking for an injection of fresh talent?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3506,2022-10-16 11:52:26
15221," Welcome back to the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit. Finalists of the annual award appeared alongside special guests, including worldwide business leaders, philanthropists and non-governmental activists. Now, while the 2022 finalists have been announced, our panelists have their eyes on the future, and here's what they have to say. This is the Earth Shop Decade. We are in a race to repair and regenerate the planet. Some will focus on policy, some will focus on activism. We are focused on supporting the game changers, the innovators, the entrepreneurs and the problem solvers. We believe in the power of human ingenuity, grit and determination to create solutions that if scaled could repair the planet. We have only 8% of the ocean protected today, and our Earth Shop is, as Pati said, 30% of the ocean at least, 30% of the ocean protected by 2030. And we know that if we protect the right 30%, not only will we prevent the extinction of many marine species, but also we will produce more fish. There's going to be these protected areas are going to produce a spillover that will exceed the foreground catch. So we're going to have more fish to eat, food security, livelihoods for people. And we know that for every dollar that we invest in a protected area in a marine reserve, that produces 10 dollars in economic output and creates more jobs. So it's a triple win for marine life, for food security and for climate. And of course, for the economy. So that's the goal, the mission, to in the next 8 years, and that's where the Earth Shop is pretty crazy. In the next 8 years, we need to quadruple all the ocean protection that has ever happened in human history. Are you optimistic that can be done? I am optimistic, there's no choice. I've seen firsthand the potential that a breakthrough idea can hold, and if we start seeing more of these transformative solutions across all the challenges facing our planet and suddenly our Earth Shop won't seem so improbable. The work will be difficult, it'll take extraordinary resources, determination, partnership. But we've got all the essentials right here in this room. So what is the challenge? It's the speed, scale, and cost of making these green hydrogen generators. Well, that's exactly what we are working on. Because to make green hydrogen the fuel source of the future, it needs to be cheaper than fossil fuels. And that means, electrolyzers are going to need to be really, really cheap. If you want to take a solution around the globe as quickly as possible, you need to make it standardized, mass-produced commodity. A product that is easy to make and quick to build and cheap as well. And so, while some believe electrolyzers need to be large machines, we believe the electrolyzer should be a standardized, mass-producible product that can make green hydrogen anywhere for anyone. In 2030 we imagine millions and millions of projects on restore, and not just places on earth where we see nature being brought back, but all of the other nodes that are key to ensuring success. So the technology providers, the nurseries, the seed banks, the funders, the government incentive programs, so that we have an ecosystem that really allows us to leverage the many, many connections within the nature-based solution space. And in 2030 we have been focused on another key area which is cities and cities require data and insights to take action on climate and to preserve nature, to create more nature and tree canopy. So we've set a goal that we want to- We want more nature in cities, exactly, exactly, right? And so we've been partnering with cities like Los Angeles to give them insights, utilizing AI and geomapping, on where all the places that you can create more tree canopy which are concentrated in many places",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3507,2022-10-16 11:56:19
15222," And we so we've been partnering with cities like Los Angeles to give them insights utilizing AI and geo mapping on where all the places that you can create more tree canopy which reduces urban heat islands improves air quality sequesters carbon. So we want to bring data and solutions to bringing nature into cities as well as of course preserving and restoring nature. And so one of the goals that we've said is we want to enable over 500 cities around the world. I know we're going to hear from the mayor of a Paris after this to reduce a gigaton of carbon emissions by 2030. And so that's through data tools and sites, whether that's evolving transportation systems or planting new tree canopy. So that's a big bold target that we want to see achieved by 2030. Anyway, I guess I'm in the wrong place. I came here to invite all of you to the grouch convention, but it turns out you're all about my least favorite thing helping. Oh, you've got me ask I do like helping people learn how to reuse repurpose and recycle together everyone in this room can build a world where nothing goes to waste. And that includes even you. Me sorry, my guy got to get going to that convention, but just between us, yes, I do have a recycling bin right next to my can, but no one think it out OK, it'll ruin my image. I father believe in the power of the idea and over time, the vision, the purpose, the courage, it embodied has inspired each generation to take on its own challenges, not because they're easy, but because they're hard. And I think that in Kennedy understood that the effort to land on the moon would bring out the best in us that everyone would have to contribute that it would require innovation, creativity, teamwork, commitment and faith. And that world would be better because of it. The earth shot prize has inspired the same spirit of optimism and ingenuity on a global scale to tackle the most pressing challenge we now face repairing the planet. Family and I are so excited that the Prince of Wales will honor this year's earth shot prize winners in partnership with the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, a city that is committed to scientific excellence, environmental justice and the fight against climate change. We're proud that President Kennedy's moonshot legacy still inspires hope and we look forward to welcoming all of you who are working to ensure a better future here on earth. And that's all from the earth shot prize innovation summit. You can find complete coverage of the event including full interviews and articles on blooper.com. I'm Frossine Lackwap from New York and this is Bloomberg. I'm going to name a couple of of your babies. I don't know if I'm asking you to choose amongst your children, but you know some of the most recognizable buildings by you of course the Millennium Bridge London City Hall, the Reichstag and the Great Court British Museum. What was your favorite project to do? The Reichstag does stand out because first of all it's an energy manifesto. So it transformed something that was dependent on fossil fuels it uses all the technology to produce something which is essentially carbon neutral and there's a public building. It's a symbol of a city. It's a symbol of a nation. It incorporates works of art. It's recycling and existing building which as I mentioned earlier is the ultimate in sustainability if you can if you can give a new life to a building. It also creates public space of the roof level. It is the most visited parliament in the world so it puts the public above the politicians who are answerable to them. And that of course was made possible by...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3508,2022-10-16 12:00:27
15223," the public above the politicians who are answerable to them. And that, of course, was made possible by the politicians. So it's a demonstration of democracy in action.

Filling down in the numbers and preparing you as only Bloomberg can. Weekdays on Bloomberg. Indonesia's economy is rising fast with massive factories like these ones dominating the outskirts of Jakarta. I last met President Joko Widodo or Jokoi, as he's more often known, in his home town of Solo. That was almost three years ago and a lot has changed. You dealt with Elon Musk? Yeah. We left Jakarta's presidential palace by convoy for a huge Hyundai factory built during COVID on three quarters of a million square meters of land. Jakoi, who wants ran a furniture business, has equally large ambitions for his country's economy. He's banned the export of raw nickel in favor of downstream products, will instead produce refined nickel that will be used in the batteries to power electric vehicles. An equally impressive factory is being built nearby for just that purpose. If you work in a factory, it's a salary much higher. Comparing with the other industry in the automatic industry, higher. Much higher. Higher than furniture. Of course, yes. If Jakoi has his way, other raw materials will follow. Coal, box-ite, tin, gold and copper, even palm oil. This November, Indonesia will host the G20. Jakoi is one of the few leaders to have met both China's Eugene Ping and Russia's Vladimir Putin since the invasion of Ukraine. This is a conversation with President Jakoi of Indonesia. President Jakoi, thank you for talking to Bloomberg again. When I was last here in 2019, you had just been re-elected. Now, you're halfway through your final term as President of Indonesia. You are the biggest country in Southeast Asia. You are right in the middle of the United States and China and their arguments. You recently said the world was in dire need of responsibility and wisdom. My first question for you was Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan? Was it wise? Was it even responsible? Yes. The rivalry of the big countries is indeed worrying. What we want is for this region to be stable, peaceful, so that we can build economic growth. I think not only Indonesia, Asian countries also want the same thing. I think you are being very diplomatic, President. There was word that Nancy Pelosi was going to come to Indonesia.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3509,2022-10-16 12:04:45
15224," and I think it's a very diplomatic present. There was word that Nancy Pelosi was going to come to Indonesia and then you decided to change that plan. Is that true? Did that, did that. No, no, we will openly receive, but there was no visit. There now seems to be a more serious danger of a Chinese invasion in Taiwan. And there is a concern that if there is a conflict in Taiwan, it would spill over into the South China Sea, where you have territory, territory that China can test. Is Indonesia ready to defend itself or defend its land and waters in that case? So you're ready for that conflict militarily if it happens? Yes, once again we want to remind you that this is the case. We do want the region to be peaceful. It shouldn't come to the point that tensions rise until it affects economic growth, and then later on affects the well-being of our people. In my opinion, it is very important that there is a space for dialogue between leaders, especially leaders of big countries. The global situation is extremely difficult, and there shouldn't be further unnecessary issues. We are going through a food crisis and an energy crisis that hasn't been resolved, the pandemic still exists in some countries. Is that going to be a big theme for you at the G20, that you want to turn the debate away from these rivalries between superpowers and focus on issues like food security, inflation? Yes, it is better than having open conflict. It is better to have a forum for dialogue like G20. If there is space for discussion, we can discuss and have debates and hopefully come up with solutions. This is what we want. This is why we have a space for dialogue. I know that you have invited President Xi Jinping to come to the G20. Has he said he will come here in November? Yes, President Xi Jinping will come. And President Putin. President Putin has also told me he will come. Do you worry at all about the G20 being this conflict where you have the democracies coming forward with plans? And you have Putin sitting there in one room like this and you have Xi Jinping with his own agenda. It will be a very difficult house party to run. At the G20, we do not want to add to conflict or problems, but to resolve the problems. How we can resolve all these problems, not to add problems and conflict. Puganang by conflict, you know, being to see Putin, you being to see Zelensky, you being to see Xi Jinping. Do you think that by bringing people together that that is a way to solve conflict? Sometimes it can increase it. There must be communication, even if it doesn't necessarily resolve the problem. It is better to have dialogue than to have open conflict. When we started this interview, I said that you were in the middle between China and America, but having looked at Indonesia, I looked at the numbers. American investment in Indonesia over the past five years is $9 billion. China has invested $40 billion. You look around here, we have a Chinese car factory around the corner. China is buying up a lot of the refineries and make precious metals. America at the moment is losing the battle for hearts and minds in Indonesia, but also in Southeast Asia. Do you think that is fair? This is an approach that needs to be renewed because what is needed by countries in Asia, including Indonesia, is investment. What investment? If it comes from China, we welcome it. If it comes from America, we welcome it. We are not going to be choosing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3510,2022-10-16 12:09:08
15225," I'm from America, we welcome it. We are not going to be choosy. I'm not going to be choosy. I'm not going to be choosy. So, by about, you are not choosy, but one side is coming and saying, I want to invest, I want to trade. And the other one is saying, no trade packs. And I want to come and talk about other things. You know, this is what I'm saying. That is why I said previously they need to renew their approach. You've dealt with Donald Trump, who famously insulted his allies and promoted America first. Joe Biden was supposed to be different, but rhetoric aside, is there any change? Surely Joe Biden is still saying America first. He just isn't insulting you at the same time. Indonesia wants to be friends with everyone. With any country, we don't have problems with any country. Each country will have their own approach. Each leader has their own style and approach, so there shouldn't be a problem. But now, what's needed by Indonesia is investment, technology that will change our society. I just wanted to ask you about ASEAN since you mentioned it. You have a group of countries, but it is one where you look at the countries. It includes Myanmar, which seems to have all these problems with human rights and so on. Why do you keep Myanmar in ASEAN? We already had a meeting in Jakarta with all members of ASEAN. All the leaders came, including Myanmar's junta. And there's a consensus, five point consensus. The implementation hasn't taken place, and the approach we have taken hasn't worked. That's the complication we're facing. There are several ASEAN meetings after that, which we did not include in Myanmar participation. One very last thing on foreign policy. You've been to Go and see Vladimir Putin and tried to talk to him and you saw President Zelensky in Ukraine. I think you've focused on food security and issues like that. Do you see any sign of peace or progress there as the President of the G20? I went to Kiev and talked to President Zelensky, one and a half hours. Then went to Moscow, Russia, to meet with President Putin and talk with him almost two and a half hours. I want to see a space for dialogue after the meeting so we can discuss. But I see the chances are small. So I turned to issues like food crisis. And President Zelensky said they can't export because there were no guarantees for security to ship goods from Odessa port to Istanbul. That was the message I conveyed to President Putin. And President Putin said he will guarantee security for ships to enter Odessa. Those are what I told the media. President Zelensky said he will guarantee security for the security of the G20. And President Zelensky said he will guarantee security for the security of the G20. President Zelensky said he will guarantee security for the security of the G20. It is crucial and important. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its life.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3511,2022-10-16 12:13:26
15226," Um, it's an indulgence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s, and so it makes it a really exciting field, because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harnessed to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart. If you can spit back a lot of facts, but if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what you bring, figures out why you're sleeping. Indonesia is an extremely resource rich country, and the economy's potential is enormous. It has a third of the world's nickel reserves used in the lithium batteries of electric vehicles. It's the world's biggest grower of palm oil, the second largest miner of tin, the third biggest producer of coal, and ranks fifth for boxite. Its grassberg mine has won the largest reserves of gold and copper. Resource nationalism is nothing new, but Indonesia's two-term president is doubling down. After banning the export of raw nickel, he's now planning the same path for all the others. Jikoi is moving downstream, creating higher-value products that will be used in everything from aircraft to semiconductors, to touch screens, and the batteries in electric vehicles. We want the added value to be in Indonesia, so there will be state income in form of tax, provide jobs in Indonesia. And the most important thing is that we can enjoy the added value. I'll give you nickel as an example. When we exported raw materials four to five, six years ago, the value was only $1.1 billion. Once we went downstream in 2021, our exports were valued at $20.8 billion, that's nearly 18 times. That's what we want to do with boxite. We need copper, tin, crew, palm oil, and others. We are not being closed. We are being open indeed. U.S., China, Europe want to come and cooperate. We are open. The messages you want people to come here and use these raw materials to make things. And so just to be clear, ferronical and pig iron, they will be the next ones to be stopped exported. So they people have to use them here. When we, the industry here, are ready, exports automatically will stop. What we want is to build a large ecosystem to produce electric cars as many as we can here in Indonesia. And boxite and tin will also be in this list of materials to use inside Indonesia. Yes, that is correct. Not only nickel, boxite, for example, is used to produce alumina. And then be used to make cars body or cars chassis. OK, this is more beer. You've talked about putting attacks on nickel products. You know, the next stage up is that going to happen this year? An export tax on nickel products. Yekomonginan. You're just possible to impose it this year? I can see around here you've had a lot of success. You and I went around a rather nice car factory and you have the electric vehicle, the electric battery construction, Hyundai, LG, Volkswagen and Toyota, Seamkin. The person who everyone talks about is Tesla. And you have a five billion dollar contract to supply.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3512,2022-10-16 12:17:52
15227," The person who everyone talks about is Tesla and you have a $5 billion contract to supply Nickelaw, but you wanted to have a Tesla car factory. It now looks as if you hope to get a Tesla battery facility and I wondered if you could give us any news on that. Is that any closer? If it is Tesla, we want them to build electric cars in Indonesia. From Ford as well, we want them to build electric cars here. From Hyundai, electric cars, from car makers in Japan, Toyota and Suzuki. We want a huge ecosystem of electric cars for the world. We don't just want to reach batteries only because this is just half of it. We made a very eloquent case and Elon Musk is a famously reasonable man. Why is he said no to the car factory then? It's still in discussion. Let's see later the final result. You have negotiated with Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin, either of them is difficult to deal with as Elon Musk. Everything needs time. I don't want to go quick with no result. It needs an intense communication and the result will show. I don't know if it's going to happen. I think there has been an element, looking around here, that it tends to be the Asian countries which have been first into trying to build electric battery facilities here. We want to build a large ecosystem for electric cars that is truly environmentally friendly. The energy will come from green energy such as hydro power plants, geothermal, wind, sea waves, solar panels. The famous case of the palm oil, I think people back in April, you suddenly imposed an export ban on palm oil. The price shot up to $1,600, flooded the domestic market, then you changed your mind. Partly because the domestic market was so full of palm oil, you let it export, the prices come down. Some people would say that Indonesia is now a very honestly run country but it can be capricious. You change between these things. Do you think the palm oil ban was a mistake in retrospect? Yes. But at that time, the domestic market situation, there was a price spike of almost double. So we made a policy. There were several policies but it didn't solve the problems for months on. So we stopped exporting crude palm oil and the domestic price fell. Then we resumed exports. I think it's okay. No problem. Will you remove the obligation to serve the domestic market first, the famous DMO, this idea that palm oil has to be offered to the domestic market first? Do you now want to get rid of that? Yes. If going forward, the price is stable, we can remove the DMO policy. We prioritize our national interest. We need to get rid of the DMO policy. We need to get rid of the DMO policy. We need to get rid of the DMO policy. We need to get rid of the DMO policy. When you think space, you probably think... One space agency that travels under the radar is Issa. Which is surprising considering what the European space agency has achieved and how vital it is to local local space industry. We've collaborated.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3513,2022-10-16 12:21:59
15228," Which is surprising considering what the European Space Agency has achieved and how vital it is to the global space industry. We've collaborated with pretty much everybody who is involved in space exploration. But ESA wants to be a leading force in furthering humanity's mission into space. Commander ground to your copy. Copy. If we want to have a successful human missions to Mars, we are going to have to learn to live and work off-world in a different way. The place where we are going to learn to do that is on the move. Can ESA help humanity take its next giant leap? Watch Bloomberg surveillance early edition for the news you need when you need it. I'm not going to look at the lines in New York and Edwards in London. The radio is central bank. Races interest rates twice as much as bull cars. Then surveillance for in-depth analysis. Well outside Tom Kane and Lisa Brownbottes, I'm Jonathan Ferro, the RBI Fronts and Sensor. How does Japan get away with not raising rates? Can it sustain its normal at a time when everybody else is facing a very different reality? Bloomberg surveillance. Be informed. Be prepared. Be ahead of the game. Why do the biggest names in business choose Bloomberg? That's great question. Great question. I can't get all night. A consistent thing you've been talking about is green industries in the environment. You have a goal to make Indonesia carbon neutral by 2060. As you know, most of your energy now comes from coal, coal prices have gone up. Will you stick to your pledge that you would build no new coal-fired plants that has gone forever? Our target is very ambitious. 41% 2030 and 2060 we should be at zero. But this requires technology and funding. Money, the potential is clear. We have potential of renewable energy to produce 434,000 megawatts. But to shift from coal to renewable is not an easy thing. Because the price to produce energy from coal is still cheaper than geothermal. You're sticking to your pledge that there will be no new coal-fired power. Yes, it's being done. It's just that there are still some that are still on the process of being completed. Not new ones. Indonesia has an oversupply of electricity. Half of the emissions from Indonesia come from land use and forest clearing. 51% of Indonesia is forest and you have committed to keep to that level. But you are still letting people cut down rainforest, which is the really most useful bit. They're building other forests, farm forests. Isn't that the wrong thing? You should be protecting the rainforest first and then thinking about the other kinds of forest next. John, Kapalkaranhutan, Satoi, Kapalkaranhutan. John forest fire happened more than 20 years ago. Since 2016 it has been reduced by 85%. We also do restoration on more than 2 million hectares of petalands. Within the next three years we will also do restoration for 660,000 hectares of mangrove's forest. In the past five years we also imposed a moratorium on new palm oil plantation. Does it make you cross when people from the rich world like me appear?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3514,2022-10-16 12:26:21
15229," Loyal plantation. Limatang Yanglalu. Does it make you cross when people from the rich world, like me, appear? And countries that have already taken down their forests, used their coal, and you have a country of 270 million, much poorer people who have not done this yet. And we come and lecture you about this. Massive forest clearing is in the past. No more today. What we have now is restoration, revitalizing, taking care of the environment. I have required all mining companies to build a nursery for reclamation of their mining areas. We are working to improve the environment. I can take you to the nearest nursery center in Bagoor that produce about 2 million seedlings a year. And we will have 30 of those nurseries. Then you will believe that we are serious. Can I ask you very quickly about New Centaurar, this capital that you are building. $34 billion, the aim is to finish it by 2045. This would be the new capital of Jakarta in Borneo. I wondered, will you finish the first stage in August 2024? Are you on time in terms of that? The shift to a new capital is a long-term plan since the first president, Sukarno. It's my responsibility to put the policy in place, but we still check the feasibility studies. It will need funding of $33 billion, and we will use state budget to cover for 20%. While the rest, 80% from private sector, from investment. And this isn't just for two years. It's for 20 years. I'm confident with a good concept and with good returns for the investments, I am sure many investors will come in. You know that many people in Indonesia look at problems, look at challenges like building New Centaurar, that will happen long after you are supposed to give up. You are currently very popular. You have a 68% approval rating. And some people, some of your allies in the legislature have suggested you could amend the constitution so that you could do a third term, keep building this capital, keep building car factories. I wonder if you said before you will follow the constitution, but can you rule this out regardless of the constitution? Let's talk about the new capital, New Centaurar first. There is law on this that is supported by 93% of the parliament. What's there to be afraid of with that much support? Secondly, an amendment of constitution, I have said repeatedly, I will abide by the constitution, although support from the parliament is at 84%. Once more, I will abide to the constitution and wishes of the people. Sayat bha ad bha dha kuan si kusi. President Jikowi, I'd like the centaurar still looking forward. Thank you very much for talking Bloomberg again. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3515,2022-10-16 12:30:53

15231," the injured and to a soldier who is nearby. And by the time he called us over, you know, the protocol is we wait to be told, you know, it's clear you can come. And so by the time he called us over, I ran across the street not knowing what to expect. Obviously I knew there was someone injured, but I anticipated it being a soldier. And although there were civilians crossing steadily and even during the strike, I mean, because nothing was shielded, so people had to continue to move. And so when I got there, I came upon these four lifeless bodies. Of course, I didn't know if they were dead or alive at that point. I noticed sort of the tiny little moon boots of a child. And as a mother, that was sort of incredibly jarring and devastating moment. And I was trying to survey, but I was also kind of in shock. And I one side of my brain was sort of saying, you have to start photographing. And you have to take these pictures because I knew that I had just witnessed, you know, something that was an intentional targeting of civilians. And so I took a few photographs, but rounds were still coming in. So we were, our security advisor, Steve was saying, you know, hurry up, work very quickly, and we have to leave. And so I kind of moved around the scene and taking a few photographs, thinking in my head also, I have to be respectful. And you know, perhaps I shouldn't show the faces. So I was trying to take pictures that show the faces and that didn't show the faces, so that we had some options. Well, the image that you, I'm talking about, or certainly the version I've seen, you don't necessarily look at the faces actually the way, now you've said that, the way that you look at the image. You can't, I, you can't see them, but you can't see them. It's more you look at the scene of a family. Exactly. And so I've been doing this for, I've been covering war for over 20 years. And I know that there are so many images I've taken that have never been published because they're, they're graphic. And so I was thinking of that as I was shooting, as horribles, that sounds, because obviously, I've just witnessed the most devastating scene, but I'm also a photojournalist, and that's my job. And so I was, I was trying different angles. And frankly, I didn't think the picture could ever be published because it was civilians. Do you know, do you know the impacts of that photo? Yeah, I mean, it's been used by the, by, I think the United States ambassador to the United Nations, to talk about the intentional targeting of civilians. It's been used repeatedly as proof that civilians were targeted, because I was there. I witnessed the run-up, and I, and I know that whoever was firing those rounds was bracketing onto that position.

15232," and recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s, and so it makes that a really exciting field, because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harnessed to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart. If you can spit back a lot of facts, but if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what you bring, figures out what you're sleeping. You mentioned being a mother, has that changed the job? Yeah, I mean, it's definitely changed the job in the sense that I'm more cautious now than I was before I had children. I think to a sort of normal person who doesn't do this for a living, they probably can't see that. But for me, making decisions on a minute to minute basis in a war zone, I know I'm being more cautious. I know I'm not going sort of all the way to the front or as far forward as some of my colleagues might be going. You also are now seeing, perhaps, when you see an image, when you create an image, when you see the reality of a child who is dead in front of you would have always affected you. I imagine. Always. Has it changed, though? Yes, it has changed. I think, you know, I photographed, I have photographed children dying in Iraq and Afghanistan in Somalia during the Horn of Africa drought in 2011. And it was always devastating, but I think now as a mother, the first thing I do is sort of put myself in the shoes of that mother. And I know, you know, I live in constant fear that something will happen to my children. So you're trying to keep yourself safe, but you're also trying to document at the same time. Of course. And perhaps processing it in a slightly different way. I mean, are you, would you say you have become desensitized, though? No. Do you have to be in any way? No, not at all. I mean, I think, I think I have ways of dealing with my emotion in that moment. But, you know, part of that is just really focusing on the task at hand, which is making photographs. And looking through the viewfinder that definitely helps me focus on taking pictures. But I'm not desensitized at all. I mean, I cry pretty much all the time when I'm photographing. I get very, very emotional. And that's OK. I mean, I don't have an issue with that. I don't know what my colleagues think of me, but, you know, I think it's normal. I mean, I'm a human being. And do you think, I mean, you talk about hanging back because of the risk as well, not necessarily going straight to the front? And yet, when I asked you about that particular image, it sounded like it's very instinctive. When you know you're not where you need to be, and you are heading towards danger. Correct. And that's obviously what I struggle with, because if I'm close and something happens a little closer or a little further from me, but closer to the front line, I'll likely go. But I think where I'm positioning myself is sort of a little removed back and then making judgment calls every day. You know, if I hear that the school has been hit and 30 children have been killed, I will go. You know, if I hear that a building has been hit on the front line, but no civilians were killed, I'm likely not to go. So I'm weighing sort of what will I gain from risking my life? Although that building's been hit, but no civilians have been killed. I mean, this talks to the idea of not you per se, but a criticism of those in your field of being war junkies, trying to find the very worst to document. And being in places they don't need to be, sometimes causing perhaps more risk. What do you say to that? You know, for me, the highest toll of war is civilian casualties. So that's not being a war junkie. That is documenting reality. And the reality is we are in a situation where one country has invaded another. And every civilian who dies is on account of that invasion. And so I think that if I'm in a position and civilians are being killed,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3518,2022-10-16 12:44:14
15233," in who dies is on account of that invasion. And so I think that if I'm in a position and civilians are being killed, I have to document that. That is a very important part of the job of someone who covers conflict. I'm presumably that for you in this work that you do, you don't obviously just cover war, you cover humanitarian disasters, climate change, the effects on the planet on that. But when it is about civilians, it sounds like the justification you have to make to yourself, to your family, and to those who could be critical, is that you are providing evidence. Yeah, and that evidence has been used already by the United Nations. Have you taken pictures of people killing others, of the actual killers before? Yeah. I mean, I've taken pictures of people who have been accused of killing others, but I have not been there sort of in the moment. I just wonder what that's like as well. You know, seeing people do the very worst they can do to each other. I think people are very smart about journalists. You know, they obviously don't allow us access to things when they are killing civilians. You know, I think that there was a time in the Cornwall Valley. I was with the American troops, the 173rd Airborne. I had spent two months living on the side of a mountain with the 173rd me and a colleague Elizabeth Rubin for the New York Times magazine. And the point was to understand the nuances of war and why so many civilians were dying in Afghanistan. And in fact, Lieutenant Colonel Oslohn, who was the commander of the Cornwall Valley, was very smart because he had this philosophy of transparency because he believed that journalists needed to understand sort of the nuances of war to understand why civilians were being killed. And so we were in rock operation, rock avalanche, which was in the movie, the documentary Restrepo, I don't know if you've seen it, but it's extraordinary. And so we were in that operation where we've jumped out of helicopters in the middle of the night into the heart of Taliban territory, literally walked with everything we owned for six days. And eventually we were ambushed by the Taliban. And we were ambushed from three sides. And there was a huge gun battle. Three soldiers were shot, one was killed. And in the retaliation of the American troops, I was standing with some of the soldiers, everyone was very shaken up, of course. And one of the soldiers said, look, they're using Afghan women and children as human shields. And he literally had me look through the scope of his gun. And there were women and children on the roofs of the building where they were shooting from. And that is a case where it was incredible to witness. And I could only have witnessed that if I, because I had spent so much time with these troops, and really was willing to risk my life and to be there in the middle of Operation Wakavela. A shot you took during that maneuver. We're going to take a look at that. Can you take me through it? There is an image, the aftermath of that ambush, where it's a very dusty picture. It is a scout team carrying the body of Sergeant Rughal. And he's in a body bag. And it was after that. And the scout team, Clainard, who is leading the way, is crying. And they're walking through this very desolate landscape. And I remember shooting that photograph and asking myself, what are we doing here? What are we doing here? Years after 9, 11, fighting in the middle of the mountains where there are no people. And it just felt like such a waste that this young man had died for nothing. And in fact, a few years later, the American troops pulled out entirely from that area. There's another image of yours I wanted to bring to mind and for us to have a look at and talk about. An 18-year-old woman in labor stranded in 2009. Tell me about that and how that came about. So in 2009, I won a MacArthur Fellowship. That is in America, it's called the Genius Grant. And it's essentially given to all different disciplines from a cellist to a scientist to a photographer, where I was paid a salary for five years with no strings attached to just focus on my work. And I felt a lot of pressure to decide what to focus on with my work.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3519,2022-10-16 12:48:24
15234," I was paid a salary for five years with no strings attached to just focus on my work. And I felt a lot of pressure to decide what to focus on with my work because it was the first time I could decide not be assigned a story. And so I started doing research and I decided to focus on maternal mortality and why over 500,000 women a year were dying in childbirth at that point. This was 2009, as you said. And Afghanistan, where I had been working for a decade at that point, had one of the highest rates of maternal death in the world. And that was because there was such a bad road network, people, women who were pregnant or in labor didn't have access necessarily to medical professionals or to clinics or hospitals that were staffed with doctors. They just couldn't get where they needed to. They just couldn't get where they needed to. They had to take a donkey for 12 hours and imagine being in labor, you know, getting on the back of a donkey. And so I went to very remote villages in Badaksham province, which was one of these provinces with high numbers. And on the way back, I was riding with Dr. Ziba, who was also helping me translate. And we noticed these two women on the side of a mountain. And there was not a man with them, which in Afghanistan is very rare. And we stopped the car and said, what are you doing here? Do you need help? When it turned out, the woman on the right, Noreneese was in labor. And Noreneese's husband's first wife had died in childbirth. And he was so determined to not lose her that he managed to get a car in the village. But when we met them, their car had broken down. So they were stranded on the side of the road. So I said, well, just get in my car. I'll take you to the hospital. We're going toward Fiasabad, which was the capital of the state. And they said, no, we need permission from the husband. So we'll wait. And so I turned to Dr. Ziba and I said, OK, you have to find the husband. There's one road in the whole province. He's obviously on the road. So she found him, of course, pretty quickly, and brought him back. And the whole family piled in my car and we took them to the hospital. And everyone asked me if she delivered safely. And if I took photographs, and yes, she delivered safely. But no, I did not take photographs because I felt like I changed the course. I love that story with my presence by taking them. So you took a photo. I took about three frames and that photograph is one of those frames. And that's when you had met. And just seeing it. Because it's so striking, the blue. Exactly. I met them. We asked their story. And then we asked permission right before Ziba left to find the husband. We asked permission for me to take a few photographs. Access the financial world on demand.

15235," Do you think on balance being a woman has been a help to you in the field? A huge help. Being a woman, rather than a hindrance? Yes, everyone thinks it's a hindrance, but in fact it's a huge help because people, first of all, I've access to men and women, and particularly when I'm working in countries like Afghanistan and Somalia where men and women are usually segregated by gender, and people underestimate women I find and they still do. And so they sort of discount me and say, okay, sure, sure, go. Nice to be underestimated. Yeah, I love being an officer. I love it. Yeah. It's one of those things. But I mean, I suppose on the other serious, much more serious side of it is that, again, when you're thinking and calculating risks, you know, rape as a weapon of war is a unique tool wielded against women. Yes. And for me, when I was, I've been kidnapped twice. The first time was in Iraq and that was only a day and it turned out, compared to Libya was quite sort of, it was manageable in the sense that we were working outside of Fulugia. I was working with a colleague from the New York Times. We had heard a helicopter of American troops went down. We went to find it. We got caught by insurgents who thought maybe we were with the American occupation. We finally convinced them. We were journalists. They held us until dusk and then eventually let us go. Obviously, it was terrifying. We had guns to our heads for about 11 hours. We didn't know if we would survive. Libya was much more violent, much more dramatic. We were four journalists in one car. Originally, we had been two in each car, but one of the cars, one of the driver's brothers had been shot at the front line. So he quit in the middle of the battle and we ended up in one car. We had to decide how long to stay. That is not an easy discussion because with four journalists, everyone has a different perspective on how long to stay, what our needs are, how dangerous the situation is. By the time we decided to pull back east toward Benghazi, we ran into one of Kedafi's troops checkpoints. It was incredibly hostile. The rebels we had been covering started opening fire on that checkpoint. We were literally in a wall of bullets. The men were pulled out of the car. Me as the only woman, I was sort of left sitting there because they didn't know what to do with me. But the car was not armored. So I had to get out of the car because I knew that I needed to get behind cover. I crawled across the backseat and when I jumped out, one of Kedafi's troops sort of came to me and was pulling at my cameras instinctively. I was pulling back even though there were bullets literally going, you know, next all around us. We finally made it to cover behind the sort of checkpoint building and we're all told to lie face down in the dirt. We each had a Kalashnikov put to our heads and we were about to be executed. We were begging for our lives. The commander came over at that point and said, you can't execute them. They're American, which this was all in Arabic and Anthony Shadee later translated for us. You know, in retrospect, I have no idea why they spared us being American because in the Middle East, a lot of people don't like our foreign policy. And so we were tied up and blindfolded. And essentially for the next three days, we were beaten up, tied up, blindfolded, threatened with execution. And for me as the only woman I was touched repeatedly, I was not raped. But of course, in that time being tied up and blindfolded, I thought of the many, many women I have interviewed over the years who have been raped. And so I sort of ironically looked to them for strength because I thought, well, if they survived it and if it happens to me, I can survive it as well. Are you living just minutes a minute? A minute a minute. I mean, in a kidnapping, there is no sort of an outward on the line. It is literally every second is survival mode. It is what can I do to get through this fear? What can I do to get through this pain? I mean, it sounds like the scene from a film. And yet it's your life.

Talk of a film. She was. We spent about three years together when Warner Brothers optioned the rights to my memoir. I wrote a memoir after that called It's What I Do, a Photographer's Life of Love and War. And that memoir was optioned almost immediately by Warner Brothers. Steven Spielberg was slated to direct and Jennifer Lawrence was slated to play me. And that went on for three years. It was like, like, taking Jennifer Lawrence to Ozai. I took her to the border with South Sudan when it was very, very tense. She wanted to understand what it feels like to feel that fear and to be, you know, to be close to a war zone. Obviously, we had to worry about her safety so I couldn't take her. You're an extra headache. You've got to worry about what a list of why you're deep in with this thing. Very stressful. Let's just say when I put her on the plane to, you know, from Uganda, I couldn't walk for a week. My back went out. But yeah. But she eventually dropped out. And so now it is being made into a limited series. So a TV series. A TV series. Correct. OK. Lisa Jennifer Lawrence now knows what it's like to do your job. She does. She's just come out with a movie playing a character named Lindsay. So, hey, I think she got inspiration from it. But what have you learned that from being in these scenarios, coming in and coming out of some of the worst things we can do to each other? Yeah. I mean, I guess I've learned the capacity for survival, for resilience, for forgiveness, the fact that human beings can be equally evil as they can be amazingly generous and yeah, resilient. I think that I've learned a lot from the people I've covered. But I think we have to look at the ability of human beings to live both within those situations and to survive them after. Well, thank you very much for taking us behind the lens with you. Thank you. Lindsay. And thank you so much for being with us until we meet again. Take care and goodbye. I'm David Weston.

Some of them may be in the private sector. I think more of them may be international. And former New Jersey governor and EPA administrator, Christine Todd Whitman, on a path forward on nuclear energy. Nuclear and pay a huge roll, at least in the transition from fossil fuels to renewables. Global Wall Street spent the week trying to get its footing after things only got worse in Ukraine as Russian missiles rained down across the country, and NATO chief Yen Stoltenberg had to reassure us that things weren't about to go nuclear. Russia knows that the nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. The IMF released its economic projections and its chief economist warned that a global recession just may be looming. What we see is that about a third of the global economy is going to be experiencing the contraction this year or next. And if that weren't enough, President Biden told CNN recession may come specifically to the United States. I don't think there will be a recession. If it is, it will be a very slight recession. And then, then, the CPI numbers came in hotter than expected with the headline numbers still up at 8.2 percent, and core accelerating to 6.6 percent year over year. It is not a good picture here. Those who were thinking that inflation might drop off fairly quickly are going to be disappointed by the numbers here. In the meantime, over in Great Britain, we had a week of financial turmoil with a very public battle between the Bank of England and Prime Minister Trust's government, which ended up with a new chancellor of the ex-checker and her giving up on more of her controversial budget. I want to be honest, this is difficult, but we will get through this storm, and we will deliver the strong and sustained growth that can transform the prosperity of our country for generations to come. But the surprises weren't all bad this week, at least not for former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke, who was awakened to learn that he shares with two others the Nobel Prize for economics this year. It was completely unexpected. My wife and I shut off our cell phones, we went to bed last night not thinking about this issue.

And I'm not a technician, but that level was important because it was the 50% retracement of the post pandemic move higher. And that probably kicked in a combination of buying, hedges being taken off, some short covering, and that fed on itself through the end of the day. Maybe you could point to the move down in yields yesterday, the move down in the dollar, but that could also help to explain today's weakness too because you saw reversals there. So Joanna Femme and a noise, I think it's fair to say in the equity markets there. But on Friday, actually, they gave up pretty much everything that got back on Thursday. So when you net net, when you get through it all, what did we learn this week that should affect the markets over the longer term? You know, David, I think what we learned is that there's still a lot of risks out there facing the future of the global economy, not just here in the US. And those two price reports we got, the PPI and the CPI, reinforce the view that inflation is going to be a really hard challenge for the Fed to solve. It also seems to have removed any wiggle room that people think the Fed has. They're really going to have to be adamant about raising rates, try to constrain liquidity, try to discourage consumer demand in order for inflation to get under control. There's not a lot of room for them to do anything but raise rates now for the next at least couple of meetings. The market finally perhaps is digesting that. Let's end this a lot of talk about. Sorry, go ahead, please. I think Joanna's absolutely right. And I think there have been these moments where it seems like whether it's in reaction to things going on in the UK that the markets almost cheering for or looking for some sort of financial system accident because of the messaging from the Fed, from Powell that they're not going to step in because of financial market weakness across any of the asset markets or just volatility but financial system instability, maybe what could bring the Fed back in. But even in a situation like that, what they may do is use the tool of their balance sheet or repo facilities versus doing a pivot any time soon. On rates and I'm not sure that's been fully digested by the market yet. Yeah, there could be certainly more digesting to come, particularly because the risks that are out there are really unusual. You know, it's not just the inflation problem, right? The US has a labor shortage, born of the pandemic, born of early retirees, born of a lack of legal migration, immigration into the US. And that problem is not one that the Fed can solve. And so they still have very high consumer demand and a shortage of supply no matter what the Fed does to try to curtail demand, there's going to be spillovers to also curtailing the recovery of supply from the pandemic. So they're sort of fighting this problem without having all the tools that are needed. And you know, the risks that are out there, you know, haven't really abated in many ways. Although finally, we're starting to see earnings estimates come down and market expectations adjust to those risks. Lizanne, I wonder what the part of the problem we have right now is it's not all bad. There are parts of the economy that actually continue to be quite strong. It's sort of like we've gone from a unipolar to a multiple world. We've gone to a multiple economy, it feels like sometimes. We have. And I think that's what's particularly unique about the pandemic, the nature of it, how it unfolded is that we've been in this rolling cycle. So during the the throes of the pandemic, when all the stimulus kicked in both on the monetary side and on the fiscal side, that stimulus and demand associated with it was forced to be funneled into the good side of the economy because of the absence of access to services. That became the breeding ground for the inflation with which we're still dealing. Then as you saw reopening, you saw that pent down demand on the good side, you saw pent up demand on the services side, that tends to be the stickier components of inflation. So even though we're seeing disinflation now on the good side, we've got it on the services side. So it's very different than your typical slow down turn recession, whatever you want to term it, because at least the last two, the COVID recession, the global financial crisis, in essence, the bottom fell out all of",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3524,2022-10-16 13:10:14
15239," counter and recession, whatever you want to term it, because at least the last two, the COVID recession, the global financial crisis, in essence, the bottom fell out all at once in the economy. This is happening in a unique way because it's sort of shifting through the economy and hitting pockets at different times. Well, and some areas of the economy are still expanding, even as some, you know, parts like PCs and smartphones where a lot was purchased during the years of the pandemic. Now those sales coming down, but look at auto production. That industry is still suffering from a lack of the chips needed to finish off cars, and they're putting cars in inventory waiting for that last chip to arrive, for example. And the semiconductor companies that supply them still have a very long runway of demand ahead of them. So there are parts of the economy that are still expanding while others are being hit by lower consumer demand from high inflation, from the change in sentiment from spending on goods to services. So that's why I think it's become very hard to say, well, what kind of a recession might we get? Is it going to be broad-based like recessions in the past? Or is it going to be more specific where lower middle and, you know, consumers suffering from the higher interest, suffering from inflation really curtail their spending like Walmart saw, right? Whereas the higher-end retailers are doing fine so far. So it's a very challenging time to forecast where the U.S. economy is going and how much unemployment might be created because of this constraint on liquidity from the rate increases. That means it's still possible to find potentially investments that do lead to growth over the, even the near term, as some of these industries continue to recover. And, you know, Joanne, to your point about the upper end in better shape, as witnessed by what the retailers are saying, there's also that potential pressure just on psychology because of the wealth effect, given that even though the excess savings story has merit up the income spectrum, they're also challenged by not just equity market losses, but bond market losses, real estate losses. So I think that's why I think we all have to be careful about extrapolating that excess savings up the income spectrum as a guaranteed feed into the consumption side of the economy. I think even there, there might be some hesitancy. Joanne, last thought here, we all talk about when is the market bond them about? When is the bad news bond about? When do we know we got it all out? We know how to deal with the build from here. Well, I think you almost never know that ever. I mean, think about the risk the global economy is facing, right? It's not just the U.S. and inflation problems globally, right? We have the war in Ukraine, and there are some, maybe low probability, but very large risks associated with that. And then you have China, and they're continuing zero COVID policy, which seems to be having rolling disruptions to supply, which don't help our inflation problem. And now we have more of an economic war against China with the latest round of restrictions on exports of semiconductor equipment and high level chips. And the real question there is, will there be retaliation from China in terms of restrictions against access to the Chinese market, which is still, you know, hope to be one of the fastest growing markets in the world. Well, we might find that U.S. companies don't get access to that. So we shouldn't assume that the worst is in at this point, and we should expect that markets are going to continue to be volatile as some of those risks get realized or clarified. Joe Anfini and Liz Ansonas will be staying with us as we try to figure out what to do with our money in these turbulent times. Let's go ahead and up to Exxon Wall Street week. I'm Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3525,2022-10-16 13:14:17
15240," Thanks for watching. We will never break, we will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never break, have a wide array of zips, and the mountains shake. All our will remain. We will never, no, we will never, no. From the world of politics to the world of business. Balance of power with David Weston, Beows and Nellisks, from and about politics power players. Weekdays, this is Bloomberg. Well, this was the week when Wall Street got much of what it had been asking for, and then decided quite characteristically that it didn't like it. The economy is simmering down as requested. Industrial production took its worst fall in more than a year. Business inventories are rising ominously. And the housing industries trade association said its members were virtually out of business. That of course was Lewis Ruck has your own Wall Street. Back in 1981, believe it or not, 41 years ago now, when all the markets wanted was a slowing economy, and the lower interest rates that they thought would come with that. The big move that week was a romantic comedy. You may not remember it with Bert Reynolds named paternity. And the number one song was Arthur's theme from that Dudley Moore film named Arthur. Now the problems are very different as interest rates are on the way up, not down, and the economy is still very robust by most measures. Still with us are Joe Anfini of Advisors, Capital Management, and Liz Ann Saunders of Charles Schwab. So, you, the question is what do we do other money in this world? What does it make sense to invest with this much volatility, this much uncertainty? It's really been challenging time for investors. And it really depends what sort of time frame you have as an investor. If you're in retirement, what you probably need is some assurance that you're going to be able to get the cash flow you need off of your portfolio. And so one of the things we've done for our clients in that kind of a situation is to create portfolios with above average dividend yields on the one side. And now as bond yields are rising and we've kept our duration relatively short, we've been able to let bonds mature and then re up at higher yields. So, you know, one area to go to is some relatively stable companies, whether it's General Mills or an ABV or, you know, some of the others in consumer staples and in energy that have, you know, dividend yields in the four, five, six percent range. And that way they can still get that income and they can ride out the volatility in the stock prices and wait this out. And that gives our clients a fair bit of comfort, but, you know, it hasn't been easy really for anybody, but that's one way to deal with the volatility. Lizanne, what do you recommend these days? Well, first of all, I absolutely agree with Joanne that there's no, there's no cookie cutter answer to a question like that. It really does depend on who the investor is, their risk tolerance, their past experience, their time horizon, whether they're financial risk tolerance and their emotional risk tolerance, whether there's a narrow gap between the two or a wide gap between the two. But I think we're in a part of the market cycle right now where you want to actually focus on fundamentals. And I know that sounds trite and sounds what we're always supposed to do, but gone are the days where you could look at segments of the market components of, say, big tech and look at it monolithically, make an assumption that they're all going to go up simultaneously. There's much more differentiation in the market right now. And I'd say look for where things are dear from a macro perspective. So we have to climb.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3526,2022-10-16 13:18:37
15241," Simultaneously, there's much more differentiation in the market right now. And I'd say look for where things are dear from a macro perspective. So we have declining earnings revisions in the aggregate. So look for the factor around positive earnings revisions, positive earnings surprise. We know we're in a rising interest rate environment. So companies with strong balance sheets, low debt, high cash flow, strong free cash flow, low lower volatility, there's kind of a quality wrapper. And I think that's the best type of approach in this environment. And then the last thing we've suggested for those investors who can do it, if you were a rebalance or based on the calendar, maybe instead of doing it once a year, once a quarter, let your portfolio and the volatility associated with dictate the timing of taking advantage of the volatility by adding into weakness, trimming into strength relative to your overall strategic asset allocation. Joanne, what about the possibility of fixed income at this point? I mean, for a long time, you didn't want to be in bonds, given what we're going to have bonds. But those yields have really come up. They're yielding something now and they do generate cash. I mean, it's sort of like dividends, right? Yeah, absolutely right. So, you know, we're getting in the order of 6 plus percent in yields in our all investment grade fixed income solution. And when you pair that with in a balance strategy with the equity front, you know, you can generate a pretty nice cash flow for clients. And so if you keep duration short and you're really careful about selecting credit quality, because credit spreads have widened here. So you want to be careful that you're not adding risk to the side of your portfolio that it's supposed to be sort of the suspenders on the pants, right? To provide more stability. And so that's one thing we've done in it's helped our clients feel a lot more comfortable in this kind of environment. Lizanna, are you to the point yet where you'd consider duration that is going longer duration for fixed income? So my colleague Kathy Jones, who's a regular guest on Bloomberg, she's our fixed income strategist. And in the sort of four-ish percent range, we have suggested you consider lengthening duration. But I agree with everything that Joanne said too. I think there are finally opportunities. We've gone from a teen environment, there is no alternative to TIA. There is an alternative. And there's income and fixed income again. And there are strategies, a bit more active strategies that you can employ to take advantage of this move up in yields. Even well down the duration spectrum, you're actually generating a yield. If inflation ever came down, we might actually have positive really yields. We're not quite there yet, but I think we'll get there. Well, Lizanna, I wanted to pick up, that was exactly the point I was going to make, is the challenge is that inflation is so high that even if you're getting those appealing yields on fixed income, you're still losing purchasing power. And so that's why we continue to counsel if the client has appropriate risk tolerances in time horizon. The equity side can help you offset the cost of inflation. For example, one of the stocks in one of these portfolios is McDonald's. Now what you want is to find a company like that that has good cash flow that can continue to pay its dividend, but more importantly, even can raise its dividend year after year. And they just announced this week a 10% increase in their dividend. So you're being compensated, more than compensated, for that cost of inflation eroding the purchasing power of your money. And that's something that you're more likely to get on the equity side than you are on the fixed income side. Because then we're spending so much time on rates and on growth and for that matter geopolitics and things like Ukraine. What about earnings? We are in earnings season now. We had the first four banks come out this week with their earnings, which actually we're pretty reassuring to a lot of people. Is there a possibility that could help the investor right now to the upside? It's possible. I think the rub though is that even if we end reporting season with some sort of positive beat rate, we have to recognize that estimates have been coming down since the April May period of time, both for the second half of 2022 and the first half of 2023. So it has been a lowered bar and much like the second quarter, we're still early, but expectations are that energy pretty much is all the earnings growth. So consensus right now, once the quarter is all said and done a month from now or so, you'll have 3% overall S and P earnings growth. We exclude energy that goes down to minus 3%. And if that's the case, that would be worse than the second quarter. I think.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3527,2022-10-16 13:23:13
15242," be earnings growth, be exclude energy that goes down to minus 3 percent. And that's, if that's the case, that would be worse than the second quarter. And I think the path of least resistance for estimates is still down. I'd also say really important to watch and listen in earning season, not just for, did you beat your numbers or your profit margins, what your profit margin outlook. If you're a multinational company, the impact of the incredibly strong dollar, whether you're hedging it or not, the impact of inflation, whether you have a lot of fixed costs or variable costs, what your labor costs are. So I think it's a lot of the details under the surface that matter as much as just the top line reading. Joanna, are you taking account earnings right now in your investment decisions? What do you anticipate? Well, you know, estimates have come down a lot, you know, as Liz Am was saying. The real question I think around this earning season is going to be guidance. And given the uncertainty and the real risks that are out there, I think companies are going to be extremely cautious. And I think investors expect that. It's really kind of a waiting game. We don't know if, when, how large a recession will be, how broad it will be. So we're going, investors are going to look to companies to get some clues about that. The companies that are out there on the ground, whether it's a Texas Instruments providing chips to the auto industry, you know, or a company providing chips to Apple. And that guidance, I think, investors are going to learn from. And I don't think they're going to hope for too much. I think we're expecting not very strong guidance for the fourth quarter. I think a lot of companies are going to defer and say, we're going to be more cautious. We're going to cut some costs. We're preparing for things to slow down. And that doesn't necessarily mean you have to change your investment allocations, though. Because if you're in it, not for the next six months, but you're in it for a couple years, three years, five years, right now we have a lot of stocks that have become relatively inexpensive. So a little hope out there, at least. Thank you so much to Joe Anfini and Liz Ann Satter. It's great to have you with us.

Monday, the big question, will the guilt market be able to cope without the recent support provided by the Bank of England? Or will Governor Bailey be forced to step back in? We've got guilt auctions peppered throughout the week. Wednesday, we get inflation data, we also get housing data, and then on Friday, we get retail sales. Plus, we've got S&P and Moody's both updating their U.K. credit rating. We've got earnings also throughout the week, food giants to know, and Nestle are reporting Tuesday. On Wednesday, Wednesday, we also see the chip equipment maker ASMR reporting numbers, pay attention to that one. And then on Thursday, we get ABB Volvo and L'Oreal. A focus on earnings in the week ahead with reports from Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Verizon, Netflix, Tesla, and IBM. But also pay close attention to chip equipment maker lamb research. The semiconductor industry is reeling right now from the Biden administration's new restrictions on doing business with China. Restrictions that hit at a time when the industry was already grappling with a slowdown in demand. Economic data next week include industrial production, housing starts, and existing home sales.

We'll talk about the challenges and the opportunities with Christine Todd Whitman, former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. This is Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. Hi. Hydrogen has a very special place in the universe. It's the first element on the periodic table. It is the most abandoned element in the universe. And when clean energy advocates think about what can we find which would be as easy to use as fossil fuels they think about hydrogen. The fuel that will, when burned, only produce water. We like to imagine that if we just built enough of these and these, we could ditch fossil fuels and save the planet. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. There are some things where you just need a good old-fashioned combustible fuel. Now startups around the world are betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3529,2022-10-16 13:31:27
15244," Now startups around the world are betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century. Net Zero emissions. It's a lofty goal, but times are wasting. Just as John Kerry, President Biden's special climate envoy. Many companies are making promises to be net zero by 2050. But the reality is, unless you do enough between now and 2030, you can't hit net zero 2050. And if we're really going to get there, Bill Gates says the math makes a pretty compelling case for nuclear power. You get a million times much energy per reaction as you do burning hydrocarbons. And so it's very advantaged if you do the design right. Nuclear physicist and former energy secretary Ernest Moniz says it won't get done without a public private partnership. I think what we need to see is governments moving together with the financial sector and with the equipment providers to get new power plants over the finish line. But partnership or not, convincing the public about safety may remain an issue given high profile accidents like Fukushima, Japan, in 2011, when an earthquake led to a disaster at the plant causing tens of thousands of evacuations. All the nuclear power plants in this country, they operate really on this precipice of normal routine operation on one side and catastrophic accident on the other. And it's unclear exactly when you'll fall to one side or the other, but it's certainly possible. So the question is, what will it take, how safe it can be, and how soon can we get there, even for some who initially oppose the idea, but now embrace it. Given this challenge we face today and given the progress of fourth generation nuclear, go for it. And to give us some answer to these, these are very important questions we turn out to Christine Todd Whitman. She is president of Whitman Strategies. She is, of course, the former governor of the state of New Jersey and the former administrator of the EPA. So welcome to Wall Street Week. Really good to have you with this governor. You've dealt with nuclear energy for years now. So give us your sense of the role of nuclear energy potentially in getting to net zero. Well, I think nuclear can play a huge role at least in the transition from fossil fuels to renewables. Renewables are not yet based energy. They're peak shaving and we're a 24 seven society as is the rest of the world. The world is 24 seven. And nuclear is the only form of base power that releases no regulated pollutants or greenhouse gases, wireless producing power. And we have an incredible safety record here in this country on nuclear and actually with few obviously very huge exceptions being Chernobyl and what happened in Fukushima, Daiishi. Overall worldwide, it's been, it's been safe and getting safe for all the time. I mean the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission is considered the gold standard on regulatory oversight of nuclear reactors. I don't think given costs and time that we're going to see any more large reactors built in this country, certainly. They are being built in China. They're being built around the world and we can certainly play a part in developing the parts for those reactors. But I see the future for nuclear right now being in the small modular reactors. Well, let's get to that and, well, first of all, give us a sense of the scope of it already. One of the things that I have learned is nuclear is actually one of the few things that really don't have emissions that can be taken to scale. I think something like 20% of energy in the United States is generated by 70% in France. Right. And you know, you saw an example of what happens when you take nuclear offline when California took the Senate, and no free nuclear reactor offline. Their emissions went up and the cost of their energy went up. I mean, it was totally counter to everything that they were hoping to achieve in my mind. And so what I found over time is that if you have an opportunity to talk to people and answer their very real questions, I mean, it's, it's.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3530,2022-10-16 13:35:56
15245," hoping to achieve in my mind. And so what I found over time is that if you have an opportunity to talk to people and answer their very real questions, I mean, it's normal to have questions about the safety and you should ask them. But the answers are really good and they're based on our history. You can prove that in fact these things work. And once you do that with people, they get much more comfortable with the idea of nuclear. It's just that for so long. It's been used as frankly a fundraiser a lot in a lot of times for the environmental groups. And we need to get the public to understand particularly with the new small modular reactors that are built in a contained facility. They can be placed on site. They're much safer technology. They are much safer way to produce the nuclear energy. So overall, they are really, I believe, have the potential to make a huge difference. Particularly if you think about the rural parts of America where you're not on the grid or you're not close to the grid, you can take a small modular reactor and provide power for an entire town or an entire business. So they have a lot of potential there. So let's pursue that question of safety because that is on a lot of people's minds without a doubt. And as you've mentioned, we've had some horrific instances. Is the issue with safety that people don't realize that actually the track record is quite good for nuclear or is it technological development such as you're referring to small module reactors? No, I think it's because people just don't know. They don't understand. I mean, I get a lot of questions I used to in the past about, well, what about the spent rods? And first of all, I tell them from all that when the time when we had 102 nuclear reactors in this country, and you took all those spent rods and you put them in one place, you'd fill up one foot fall field to the height of the goalposts. They may have gotten slightly above that now because this was data from several years ago. But the point being it's not this massive thing that's the size of the state of Vermont that people kind of have in their minds. And the other thing is that what's in those spent rods is 97 to 90 percent fishable material meaning unused energy. And in France and Japan, they figured out how to reprocess that. To get the energy out of those rods, rendering that what you have is the quote unquote, bad stuff to down to 15 percent, let's say. And it can't be used in a nuclear weapon. So it's much easier to store, much less to store. You have a lot of unused power just sitting there in these spent rods. And we should be using that technology as well. And people have to understand, and when you explain it to them, you can't take one of these rods from a nuclear reactor and put it in a missile. It's not the same technology. It won't work that way. And the other thing that you explained to them because one of the most immediate issues that we had in this country was three mile island. And when that went down, the operators in the utility itself, in the reactor itself, were never exposed to high levels of radiation. And they'd been tracked ever since, and there were no releases into the community. And even those who were right there in the reactor had no adverse reaction to what happened. And in fact, it was because they overrode the system, really, that you had the partial meltdown Fukushima Daiichi. That wasn't because of the earthquake. It was because of the tsunami. And that was because they had their backup power, their generator located physically in the reactor building. After 9-11, our nuclear regulatory commission said to our nuclear industry, you've got to move those out. They cannot be co-located with a reactor itself. So we, that kind of thing can't happen here anymore. Just this week, we saw an announcement of a deal to acquire Westinghouse Electric. Basically, on the premise, then, in fact, we're going to have more nuclear energy. Do you anticipate it at that Indian United States? Well, I certainly hope we do, but it was what, not even ten years ago, I guess, there were two, four proposed reactors, two in Georgia and two in South Carolina. We were very hopeful that those were going to come in on budget and on time. And they both ran over and the utilities decided in each case that it just wasn't worth going forward. So it is a question of cost and regulatory hurdles, but you want to have those regulations in place.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3531,2022-10-16 13:40:28
15246," facilities decided in each case that it just wasn't worth going forward. So it is a question of cost and regulatory hurdles, but you want to have those regulations in place because that's what protects the community and make sure that things are safe and streamline how you approach them so that you make them go through all the hoops they have to for safety, but to put it to the front of the line to get this power online. The big problem we have, though, when you talk about all of this is the grid itself. It's old. It needs to be revamped. It can't handle a lot of new power coming in and that's one of the big challenges that seems to get over overlooked a lot when we're talking about these issues. Again, you go back to small modular reactors, which can actually function on their own. What about the grid? Are we investing in the grid? We have the bipartisan infrastructure bill. We also have the so-called inflation reduction act, which had money in there as well. Is there money in there for the grid? Is it enough? There is money in there for the grid, whether it's enough or not. I doubt it. Hopefully the money that's there will be spent in a way that ensures that nothing is wasted because we need every penny of it. Certainly, every penny that's in there is needed to get the grid updated and to where it needs to be in order to accept the new power, whether it's from nuclear or renewables. I mean, they're going to depend on that as well. Okay, Governor, thank you so very much for being with us. I really appreciate this former governor, Christine Todd, with and now with Whitman's strategy. My pleasure. Coming up, we wrap up the week with our special contributed Larry Summers of Harvard. That's next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total US greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71% building to crowds America burned fossil fuels to operate? What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do a hundred percent clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels. We want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of US greenhouse gas emissions. This is Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. Once again, our very special contributor to Wall Street Week is Larry Summers of Harvard. So Larry, we got the CPI numbers in that we waited for this week. And boy, they came in, how did it expect it? It's been doing this repeatedly now. What do you read in these numbers? Not so much hotter than I expected. Inflations got a lot of momentum. The best single measure to look at for inflation is a kind of super core measure which is wages. Or you can look at the median component of inflation. They've just been running strong for a long time and not decelerating.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3532,2022-10-16 13:44:33
15247, of inflation. They've just been running strong for a long time and not decelerating. So I think Team Transitory is engaged in a lot of wishful thinking and I must say that I'm struck by the hypocrisy of some friends of mine like Paul Krugman who are very quick now to focus on housing and the fact that the private indices lead the public indices when the private indices are looking soft but we're entirely unwilling to credit that argument or to pay attention to the private indices some months ago when the private indices were obviously pointing to an acceleration of inflation so I think we've got to be very very careful here if we want to be credible about containing inflation. How much momentum is built in inflation and how can you tell what are you looking at right now they're telling you what happens in the fourth quarter and as we go into next year. I'm looking at core measures I'm looking at super core measures that take housing out take use cars out in addition to taking food and energy out I'm looking at the so-called median inflation components whatever product it is that's right in the middle I'm looking at the so-called trimmed mean that looks at the middle half of the distribution of product prices and very crucially for me I'm looking at wages which is a kind of super core measure because labor goes into everything and all of those are saying that inflation's not really coming down very fast if it's coming down at all and that it's way above the 2% target or any acceptable level. Besides the CPI numbers Larry a very big story throughout the week has been and continues to be great Britain where you had the Bank of England come in with their emergency buying of long-term guilt that is due to expire on Friday the end of this week. Same time we now have Liz Truss coming out and making some changes give us your take on what's going on in the British economy and put more importantly the management of the British economy. Look I think this is probably going to be a textbook case of crisis creation followed by crisis mismanagement I'd be surprised if we were in the 7th inning of this particular set of challenges I have said before that people now I think understand very clearly that when you do a military intervention you should never give a sunset date when you're going to leave because it just emboldens the opposition and I think something similar is true of last resort finance where the kind of deadline the Bank of England gave I think is asking for trouble down down the road so I think we're going to see more tremors more after shocks more problems at the same time I think we need to recognize that as serious as the British policy errors were this might well not have happened if global economic conditions were more normal and the kind of excesses we've had in the system mean we're in very complicated territory well exactly Larry I guess I'm asking to say we have global a slow down IMF this week came out and said we're looking at a global slow down at the same time we have central banks in the development countries really all raising rates at the same time what is the likelihood we're going to see similar won't be the same but similar sorts of problems elsewhere particularly when it comes to very highly leveraged places and places that are more difficult to see some of the private credit some of the non bank banks I doubt we've seen the last mine go off some of them may be in the private sector I think more of them may be international you know something that disappointed me at the IMF World Bank meetings this week was the number of countries who are reporting that they're having substantial,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3533,2022-10-16 13:48:54
15248," Something that disappointed me at the IMF World Bank meetings this week was the number of countries who were reporting that they're having substantial difficulty in getting market access. And I must say I'm sort of disappointed by official sector people, people from the ministries of finance and the central banks who are talking about how we're going to work with the private sector to catalyze millions of dollars of finance for green transitions in all these countries but don't seem to be doing anything about the fact that many of these countries can't even issue a bond today. So I think there's a whole set of very important challenges with respect to developing countries and emerging markets. I have to say that I don't feel those challenges were really met this week. There are some fires burning and fire department is still mostly in the station. So as we speak to you, you are in Washington for those IMF World Bank meetings and the IAF as a practical matter. You were very outspoken in a project syndicate piece also actually speaking with David Melpaz that had the World Bank about the role of the World Bank right now on things like sustainability. What is going on there is the World Bank playing the role it should be playing and what should it be doing? No, I think it is playing its usual roles in its usual way. And I think generally the economic crisis of the moment demands major changes in approach just as the security crisis in Ukraine demanded major changes in approach. And we're not really quite seeing it yet. The World Bank needs to be much more aggressive in the use of its balance sheet and it also needs to get much more capital. And instead of having a fight about which of those two things is more important, we need to do both of them. Because the one mistake we're certain not to make is over investing in the green transition. And so we need to make sure we're doing everything we can to support that transition. So if there is a lack there Larry often that lack comes from a lack of leadership. Do we not have the leadership we need either from the United States Treasury, the White House or for that matter at the World Bank? I mean would you ever consider taking over that role? I think that we do need leadership that points towards larger changes in business as usual than we're seeing in the financial area. And I think there's some mistakes being made right now at a very very difficult moment in Africa, at a very very difficult moment in Latin America, at a very very difficult moment in parts of Asia. Larry, one piece of news which was actually really hit the markets but has not gotten too much attention is what the United States did, it was picked up to semiconductors. And China, the chip's market really went down substantially, it took a lot of the tech with it. At a time of so much difficulty globally, what are the possible effects of those sorts of trade actions? You know the kind of large-style cutoff on cooperation and semiconductors that the Biden administration announced. I don't think it's possible to pass an overall judgment on that without understanding the security risks that they saw which depend on classified information which those of us on the outside don't have. But this was a highly consequential increase in economic aggressiveness. This is different than a trade fight over a specific product or a specific trade practice. This was pretty across the board effort in something that's very very difficult to challenge China's ability to grow and to develop technology. And so I think it's going to have some far-reaching implications. But very finally we did have the announcement of three of your fellow-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3534,2022-10-16 13:53:08
15249," and so I think it's going to have some far-reaching implications. Very finally, we did have the announcement of three of your fellow economists receiving jointly Nobel Prize for economics this week. Tell us about what you took away from that award. Look, I think it was the analytical recognition of something that practical people had known for a long time, which is that banks and finance are different, that they're subject to confidence crises that are kind of apart from the fundamentals of what's going on, and that you got to be very mindful in public policy to maintain confidence in financial intermediation in a way that's a bit different than you have to with respect to manufacturing companies or airlines. Or something else, it was very fundamental research, theoretical research in the case of Diamond and Divvig using mathematics. Careful historical study in the case of Bernanke that I think served him very well during his time at the Fed. Okay, thank you so much to Larry Summers, our very special contributor here at Wall Street Week. Coming up, you can't always get what you want, no matter how much you're willing to pay for it. That's next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. Welcome to Deborah Kustrali. This is Bloomberg Technology from Bloomberg crypto. Finally, one more thought. When money is no object, watch out. For example, Jeff Bezos knew the largest selling yacht in the world at 417 feet and costing upwards of $500 million. that is if he ends up paying it. There's two options here. One, the deal falls apart and this stock that has been artificially inflated is going to crash. Or if things go the way Twitter wants, then they get the guy in charge who, for the last three months, has been saying that Twitter's been lying about its user base. But what happens when you spare no expense? Go all in, put all your chips on the table, and don't win your dream prize. Consider the case of Hillary Clinton's campaign spending $1.4 billion on the 2016 presidential race, substantially more than Donald Trump's $960 million and coming up short.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3535,2022-10-16 13:57:18
15250," spending $1.4 billion on the 2016 presidential race, substantially more than Donald Trump's $960 million and coming up short. This is not exactly the speech of the Capitol. I hoped to be giving after the election. More poor Columbia pictures, which in 1987 decided to make Ishtar, figuring anything with Dustin Hoffman and Warren Bady just couldn't fail. But for some reason, a movie about two lounge singers involved in a coup in the made-up country of Ishtar didn't quite land with the audiences. Columbia lost around $40 million on the deal, almost $100 million adjusted for inflation today, and the dud established Ishtar as the synonym for box office flop. This is the Oasis. Does this look like an Oasis deal? Yeah, look at the birds. Are those vultures? And now we can add Steve Cohen to the list of those who went big and lost. The hugely successful hedge fund manager paid around $2.5 billion to buy the New York Met. And this year took it to number one, at least in player salaries. But sad to say for fans of the Amazons, number one in payroll doesn't mean number one on the diamond. The team lost the third game of the wildcard playoff by a score of six to nothing. It was executing pitches and the wheels fell off. I don't know why. Jesus couldn't figure out a way to get some runs, some off that's going. Leaving Mr. Cohen to spend the winter going back to first base and thinking hard about whether that $278 million in player salaries just maybe wasn't enough. They're going to get to this great point and have all this momentum behind them and then they blow it. That's the Met. That's Met's Metzing. That does it for this episode of Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. This is Bloomberg. See you next week. So what's the best investment advice you've ever been given by anybody? The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day and if you keep added and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's not just interest. It was always said about compound interest returns, compound business returns, compound human returns. They're all very additive because you'll learn every day and if you keep added, it's very, very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make? Selling it the wrong time. And they sell when the prices go down or not keeping. But people have conviction or they invest for the, if they invest for the right reasons, they just keep added.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3536,2022-10-16 14:01:50
15251," We days at 5 p.m. in New York and 2 p.m. in San Francisco. This is my kitchen table and also my filing system. Over much of the past three decades, I've been an investor. The highest calling of mankind I've often thought was private equity. And then I started interviewing. I've learned in doing my interviews how leaders make it to the top. I asked him how much he wanted. He said 250. I said fine. It didn't negotiate with him. I did no due diligence. I have something I'd like to sell. And how they stay there. You don't feel inadequate now because being on the second wealthiest man that we're on is that right? In recent decades, one of the most important figures in Wall Street has been John Mac. He led Morgan Stanley for many years and led it through the financial crisis of 2007-2008. John rose from modest circumstance in North Carolina to become a dominant figure in Wall Street for quite some time. I sat down with John recently to discuss his life story and also what he sees as the future of Wall Street. So you've spent more than 50 years on Wall Street and probably the most difficult time was during this 2007-2008 recession where Morgan Stanley came close to going under. Was that the most difficult time of your career? No question about it. I mean, we were on the brink of going out of business. And you thought you had a good cash reserve for a while, but then all of a sudden people started pulling cash out. Your cash reserves went down. How close did you come to actually going bankrupt? Well, we were very close, David, into the point that Tim Geithner, at the Fed, was trying to get us to sell to Jamie Diamond at the time. And he kept saying, that's what I want you to do. So I called Jamie and I said, look, Geithner's all over me. He says, you'll buy the firm. He said, I don't want your firm. I said, well, go tell Geithner that. And he said, John, if he forced me to do it, I wouldn't pay you $2 a share. So that made it easy on me. I was not going to listen to them. And as a result, we called our board in and we're thinking we're going to go out of business. At one point, you're on a phone call with Ben Bernacki, the chairman of the Fed, Hank Paulson, Secretary of Treasurer, and Tim Geithner, in the head of the New York Fed. And they say you should file for bankruptcy. And you slammed the phone down on them. Was that easy to do? For me, it was easy to do. I mean, thank God I left out some four letter words. I said, I'll take the firm down first and I hung up on it. Okay. I can't tell you why I did it because I'm my gut. It was the wrong thing to do. So now, after your retirement, you've decided to write a book. It's a very good book. I've read a post and all in about your life story. So how hard is it to sit down and write about your life and go through the good and the bad things that take you along with a long time to do this? And do you ever say, why did I agree to do this? No. No. I enjoy sitting down and working with the person who works for me on the book. Look, I have a lot of memories and a lot of things that I did that in talking with him. It came up of other things that I had done. So I enjoyed it. It was, I got along really well with my writer and Linda Coleman was just terrific. And we had fun doing it. So I enjoyed doing the book. So at the end of the book, you say something that I found to be surprising. You talked about the fact that you've recently been diagnosed with some cognitive impairment, which you say could lead to Alzheimer's. Correct. And why did you put that in the book? You didn't need to put that in. No, I didn't. Christian, I talked about it. And she said, look, John, you're always up front with people. You're writing this book. Tell people the truth. Tell them you're having some issues. So we talked about it and I agree that's the right thing to do. I mean, I didn't put it in there for sympathy. I didn't put it in there for, you know, come over and give me a hug. I just think my personality has been up front. I tell people what's going on. I did that when I ran Morgan Stanley. I did it at Credit Suisse, even though Swiss didn't like me very much for doing it. I did it at Credit Suisse. That's who I am. I'm up front. I tell people what's going on. Look, it happens. You say that maybe you thought it came from your football injuries, or maybe you fell off an ATV. Right. But in high...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3537,2022-10-16 14:06:51
15252," Look, it happens. You say that maybe you thought it came from your football injuries or maybe you fell off an ATV. But in hindsight, is it more of a genetic kind of thing do you think or the doctors don't really know? Well, the doctors don't know if it's genetic. I mean, my mother did have Alzheimer's. I just think you need information. Look, I hope my cognitive skills last a long time, but life's life and just live it. And I don't think trying to hide things. If you and I didn't know each other like we know each other, go out to dinner, I don't want you to say, John, you just told me that three minutes ago. I want to put a little warning out there, give me a break. I may repeat myself. And I cover myself by saying I may have already told you this. Now, Christie is your wife of more than 50 years as well? 49 years of 49 years. 49 years. Okay. So, where did you meet her? I met her through Charlie Rose. So Charlie Rose and I were at Duke University. He was a couple of years ahead of me. And he had moved to New York. And I was in New York working at Smith Barney at the time. And he called me up and said, you know, my wife's sister's coming up. We'd like you to take her out. I thought about it a little bit and got a date for Friday night and called him back and said, okay, we'll go out Saturday night. And I got to their apartment on 96th Street. Mary was a beautiful woman. And Christie walked in. She took my breath away. Not only beautiful, but had a great smile. She was very warm, very friendly. If it wasn't love at first sight, it was pretty close. Let's talk about your background. So you grew up in North Carolina, but your grandfather immigrated from Lebanon, is that right? But why did he go to the North Carolina? Was there a big Lebanese community there? Did he intend to go to another place? There was a big Lebanese community in South Carolina. And he was going to go to Mary in South Carolina when he got off Ellis Island. And he ended up in Mary in North Carolina. He stayed the night in the train depot. No one came to pick him up. So finally, the conductors said, get on the, pull him on the train and took him to Charlotte North Carolina on that train. And there was a Arabic family around a coffee shop at the train station. And they talked about the mix up. They gave him a job. He started washing dishes. Then he became a peddler. Then he went back and got the rest of his family. And they had made enough money to get a wagon. And they went in the countryside selling cloth, sewing materials, shoes, stuff like that. And then that evolved into John Mackin's sons, John Mack was my grandfather's name. And it was a clothing department store. And my father, who was an entrepreneur, decided he wanted to be totally on his own. And he started wholesale grocery business. And so they wanted you to go in that business at some point? I don't think my father did. My mother was a very strong force. She only wanted to be a doctor. And I really didn't want to be a doctor. My father was laid back and my mother was really aggressive. It was a great combination. So you were a high school football star? Well, I don't know about a star, but I was a good football player. I thought you were all state. That's pretty good. I'll stay. You've done your homework. So all states, so you get a scholarship at Duke University to play football. And what happened to your career at Duke? Well, I thought it was a good football player job. I got to Duke. They had some great players. And then in my sophomore year, I was a red shirt for one year. And I was on like the second team, but I broke C6 in my neck. I cracked it. And what happened every time I would tackle someone, my left arm inside would go dead. So Frank Bassett, who's one of the orthopedic surgeons who used to be at Duke, called the AD and said this young man's football career is over. He has a bonafide injury. He cannot play football any longer. So that ended my football career. But once you're on scholarship, I still had to work there. So I was a manager, you know, getting towels and setting up trips when I go play, you know, one of the teams in Florida or one of the teams in the big team. So when you graduated, did you say, I want to go to Wall Street and be the CEO of Morgan Stanley?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3538,2022-10-16 14:10:55
15253," say, you know, one of the teams in Florida, one of the teams in the big team. So when you graduated, did you say, I want to go to Wall Street and be the CEO of Morgan Stanley? Now, when I graduated, I need one course to finish Duke University. My scholarship had expired. So I got a job in a local brokerage firm called First Securities in North Carolina. So that got me involved in the securities business and there was a lady there named Fannie Mitchell. Maybe you remember, she ran the job placement office at Duke University. So when the recruiters would come down, she would say, there's one guy you got to meet, it's John May. And I would meet these recruiters and got a number of job offers. And then I decided that I like the securities business. Smith Barney wanted to open an office at that time in Atlanta. They all for me a job and I took it. Okay, so you're moving in on me quick. Just stradzing me with your fancy hands. I'm going to deal with your night because it's really bothering me. Ah, my night. Yeah. He's a troublemaker. Yeah. What did you get up to this weekend? You know, just robot stuff. A lot of chess. I was practicing for you. I know you're pretty good. Ooh, I don't like that. I will take this. Put it over here. Not cool. Not cool. All right, I will, I will concede. I can see. You've got me, Bid. Very good game. Well played. Thank you, sir. Thank you. She went to Smith-Parnie. What did you do there where you like a registered investment? Redbird. Exactly. I mean, stock broker. We started out in a train class and I got my brokerage license and then I was approached by the head of the municipal bond division. Why don't you come into the bond business? And I really didn't want to go down to open an office in Atlanta or down in Florida. So I took that job. So I got into bond business and I was a trader on the bond desk of the municipal's and then at some point that led Smith-Parnie of getting into the corporate bond market and I transitioned over to corporate bonds. And then from there they told me they would put me on commission, which they never did. And I got approached by a small boutique firm called Smithers, which was really known for their bond acumen and their bond business. So I went over and became a salesman doing corporate securities, corporate bonds at Smithers and Coffin. I've often thought to be a good trader. You have to be pretty quick in your head with numbers to make sure you get the numbers right. Is that true? Were you really good at that? No, that is true, but I think as a salesman, much more so than a trader, that business is a commodity business, it's not relationships. So if you can build a relationship with your clients where they trust you and they go to you when they have business to do, that's how you become successful. Okay, so how did Morgan Stanley hear of you and say you should join what was then considered a white shoe firm and probably hadn't hired a lot of Lebanese backed traders before, right? Well, it's a good story. So I met with Dick Fisher, who was running that initiative to build a secondary bond business. And we went back and forth and I said, I'm flattered that you would all have a good job, but I don't believe a Lebanese heritage from North Carolina who went to Duke University has a chance at making it Morgan Stanley. And he said, well, you're wrong. And if you think you come over here and you're right when you quit our Prince Liberalè°.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3539,2022-10-16 14:15:08
15254," and he said, well, you're wrong. And if you think you come over here and you're right when you quit our resign, I'm telling you, you're wrong. This is a meritocracy and you should do it as it convinced me. So in those days, Morgan Stanley was a private partnership, not a public company. And it was a company that basically underwrote, let's say AT&T bonds, but it didn't actually go out and sell. It was priceless. And other people would sell them. So Morgan Stanley said, we're now going to change that and you became a trader for Morgan Stanley. I became a salesman at Morgan Stanley. That's what they need. So you did that for a while. And then at some point, people give you more authority and you get to be in management. Did you want to be in management? Or did you like to be a trader or salesman? I like success. So I thought the right way to go is managing being a manager. And that's what I wanted to do. And whether there's a lot of disagreement, if I were any good and not very good, I liked it. And I thought I was pretty good at it. So you rose up and you ultimately are offered the position of being the CEO of Morgan Stanley? Well, yeah, eventually. But there were a lot of blocks along the way to do that. But then all of a sudden, you decided you needed to do a merger with Dean Witter. Right. And why did you need to do that? Well, Dean Witter was owned by Sears. And they had decided to spin it off. And Morgan Stanley got the order from Sears to do this transaction, to raise money, in an equity transaction. So when we met with Phil Purcell and talked about all their salesman, their branch offices, it became apparent to me and also to Dick Fisher that this is the way to really build the franchise because distribution is going to be more and more important and to have a connection with retail clients would be important. And that's how we made the decision. There was push back in the firm. But with Parker Gilbert and Dick Fisher's leadership, we were able to convince the partners. This is the right thing to do. And we did it. So your firm was a leading Wall Street firm. You could argue Dean Witter was a so-called Main Street firm. Correct. And putting the two together had never been done like that before. Correct. And how did you negotiate who was going to be the CEO? Well, at that time, Dean Witter owned Discover Card. So their market cap was dramatically larger than ours. So we based it on market cap. And they had a much larger market cap to do the deal. Purcell wanted to be in charge. That was one of the prerequisites to do the deal. It'd be the CEO. And I'd be the president of the firm. And we did that deal. All right. She did that deal. And being president under somebody else was a step back. You could argue that it's a bigger firm. How long did that last? That's a good question. I know it didn't last too long. Ultimately, you said I've had enough of this. And you didn't like his style. And you write about that in your book. But you ultimately said, OK, I'm out of here. So unemployed. And you tell your wife, guess what? Your husband's unemployed. No. My wife is so supportive. I could have told her anything. And she's on my side. It was great. You know, I ended up at one point kind of going to a hedge fund and work with Art Sandberg. And I did that for a while. But I was really flexible. And I think they call them the grumpy old men who went after the existing management at Morgan Stanley and felt like they were losing their edge. And also their reputation as a really great investment bank. And really led by Parker Gilbert and Louis Bernard and some of the senior partners who had retired. And they owned a lot of stock. And they put a lot of pressure on Dean Werner Morgan Stanley to make a change. And that's how I ended up going back. So Phil Purcell was ousted. And then they came to you. And to your surprise, they said, come back and be the CEO. You hadn't known that you were going to be asked. Correct. I didn't know that at all. So what was it like when you came back that were there people cheering for you when you came back into Morgan Stanley? You seen the film. Yes. For a young person who now is looking at a career, would you recommend a Wall Street career today? David, yeah, listen. There are not many jobs you're going to have as a young individual. You're always, always learning.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3540,2022-10-16 14:19:33
15255," focused on being an institutional firm with a very strong retail base. Your predecessor, Phil Purcell, was famous for not meeting with a lot of people. He was a little isolated. Some people accused them of being you like to be in the trading floor, near the trading floor, being with customers all the time or with your employees. Is that right? Yes. And so if you found people that were ignoring their clients or ignoring their employees, people working for you, you tended to tell them what you thought. Without question. Well, what I did when I was running the fix income division, I would sit out on the trading floor and have I had a glass booth office. So if I had needed to have a conversation with someone, so going off in the conference room, we could sit in this glass office and we'd have a conversation. And I would be on the phones. I'd walk around and sit down by the best salesman or the worst salesman. What are you working on? What are your clients doing? I was always involved. And I had some really fun times in doing it. I think in my book, I talk about how you treat people. And I get off the elevator at 8 o'clock in the morning or 7.45. And you look over to the right and they're delivery guys bringing coffee and ex sandwiches or whatever you do for breakfast. And about 20 minutes later, I walk back and I go out on the trading floor and I go up to the sky and I said, how long have you been here? He said about 30 minutes. He was in a spanic, about 30 minutes. I said, if you call the person in order breakfast, he said, yes, I've called them three times. I said, give me the number. So I gave him the number and I said, this is John Mack, I want you to get your ass out here. And he comes out in front of the delivery guy and I said, look, we're no better than he is. He's just trying to make a living. And you make him wait, you take money out of his pocket if I ever hear about it again, you're fired. That went around the floor like that. You don't treat people that way. And I hope that's ingrained in me before I went to Morgan Stanley, but I really learned it from Dick Fisher. He was such a gentleman and very smart and made decisions. So the person that you almost fired, did he do that again or no? He did do it again. No one did it again. So Morgan Stanley is doing quite well and Morgan Stanley is competing principally with Goldman Sachs, I guess it was your main rival. And then all of a sudden we go into a recession, 2007, 2008. So what happened was, as I remember from reading from that period of time and from reading your book, you had this large cash reserve and you wanted to make sure you had a lot of cash, but people were afraid of Morgan Stanley maybe going under. So they said, give me my cash back. I'm going to put it in JP Morgan. It's exactly right. And so all of a sudden the cash is going all the way down. At some point you say maybe we're not going to make it. That's exactly right. Well, thank God for the Japanese is what I can say. What I learned is it goes back to when Morgan Stanley would bring brokers from whether Namiura or Sumitomo didn't make any difference and they would do in a training program at Morgan Stanley. And the Japanese who came through that training program respected the culture of Morgan Stanley. So when we were on the brink they stepped up and gave us the money to stand business. So it turned out to be a good investment for Mitsubishi because your stock is flourished since then. And after that happened, did you think that Wall Street learned any lessons and do you think this could happen again where you have enormous illiquidity problems or liquidity problems and Wall Street really has changed very much? Well, I think the business of Wall Street hasn't changed that much, but the scrutiny on capital and capital solvency is very, very focused. And I think the Fed does a much better job in paying attention to the liquidity of these investment banks. Also I think boards of directors have elevated risk management to a level that never existed when I was there. So going through a near death experience that we went through and other firms, in some cases they actually died like, unfortunately, Lehman Brothers, boards focus on risk management. It's not about what deal you did, it's not about where we're going to open another branch office. It's about liquidity and solvency. So after this happened and Morgan Stanley comes back and...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3541,2022-10-16 14:28:04
15256," You know, we're going to open another branch office. It's about liquidity and solvency. So after this happened and Morgan Stanley comes back and is doing quite well, you'll open me to side to retire. Right. And you handed the reins over to James Gorman, who would not been a lifer at Morgan Stanley. And in fact, he had come from Maryland. You had recruited him from there. Right. And he was a consultant, not a trader, not investment banking person. So was that controversial to give it to him? If it were confident, I never heard about anyone saying, I mean, how could you do that? James is smart. He knows the business. He spent time as a consultant, time at Merrill Lynch. I saw how you ran the business, I retailed business at Morgan Stanley. He was on the management committee. I got a chance to see his interface. I would go up once a week and spend time in the office up in Westchester to be with him and how he managed. Smart as he can be can make a decision, doesn't suffer fools. And he has a great personality. He was a natural. So for a young person who now is looking at a career, would you recommend a Wall Street career today? David, yeah, listen, there are not many jobs you can have as a young individual, where you're always, always learning. It may be not something you can write, but Wall Street lives on the news. And what people are doing and what are the trends? I don't know many businesses like that. If you go in the matter of action business, you have a sales cycle, you hope it's doing well. But in Wall Street, you have data every day that tells you, not only what's going on in this country, what's going on in the world. So as you look at your career, what do you think you're the most proud of having done, help with New York Presbyterian, help Morgan Stanley recover from some of his problems? What are you most proud of? I'm most proud of where Morgan Stanley came from just a few hundred people to where it is now. I think taking the risks we took during the Dean Wooder trade, having the bumps that we had to live with, it turned out to be an unbelievable investment bank with a great culture. And to have James Gorman run it, and now I couldn't be happier or more proud of it. So in hindsight, if you had to do it all over again, would you have gone to medical school as your mother wanted or you're happy you became a Wall Street person? To my mother's disappointment, thank God, I came to Wall Street. So as you look back on your career, what would you say is the best investment advice you've ever received? Probably the best investment advice that I never received, but that I've lived my whole life around, is surround yourself with really good people. I thought about it just today, like I do many times, you know, what makes a great investor? A great investment firm is comprised of people who are optimists and pessimists and realists, because in the intersection of the debates that go across that wide range of personalities is where you find truth. It's part of the reason I'm so focused on freedom of expression. I see it my own four walls, the robust and fulsome debates around how we commit our capital, what defines a good idea, what businesses to build or pursue. That's what drives the success at Citadel. And I've been very fortunate in life to have always had a group of friends who really push me, who make me better. And here, I get to work with 3 1,000 colleagues who in their ways make me better each and every day, and collectively, as a team, we've had the opportunity to have an incredible impact on the financial landscape around the world. Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world recalibrates.

15257," and my hand on Bloomberg television. Everything you need to get set for the start of U.S. trading Bloomberg the open with Jonathan Farrell. Drilling down in the numbers and preparing you as only Bloomberg can weekdays on Bloomberg. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. Let's just be honest. We've had sort of a shift in are we in some sort of sideflation fears moment. People were talking about that all day yesterday. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. The pressure cooker just got far too hot in banning them for the government to handle. You foresee two-thirds of the crypto hedge funds will disappear. Are we close? The European Union will support and defend Ukraine's derrige rural integrity. With unmatched reach in resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, you are global business authority. Hello! Good! How are you? It's so great to see you. Thank you so much for doing this. What do you think about all this love getting into crypto? I think that that I think was more last year. I think it's kind of a way of that past. No, I don't think so, but I think it's like anytime that frankly it's when a lot of other people get into crypto, right? Other audiences too. It's when it's in the news a lot. When does that happen? A lot of times when the prices are going up. She was a federal prosecutor going after gangs and the mob before being handed for next assignment. Taking down Bitcoin. Katie Han soon realized this new technology was much more than a tool used by criminals. She dove deep and became a crypto convert, swapping her prosecutor hat for a board seat at Coinbase. It became the first female general partner, Adventure firm and recent Horowitz. Han, now a prolific crypto investor, recently launched her own fund with one and a half billion dollars to deploy. It's the largest fund ever raised by a single investor. Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, CEO and founder of Han Ventures, Katie Han. Katie, it's so great to have you. Great to be back here in the studio with you, Emily. I want to start with a vibe check. Okay. What state of the crypto cycle are we in right now? It was hot. Yep. And then it got pretty cold. Well look, Emily, zooming back because I've been in crypto for a decade if you can believe it. We've seen crypto be really hot and then all of a sudden not. And so we've seen this before. However, I think one of the things that's a little bit different now is with each new crypto cycle, more and more people come into it. And so it's more and more pronounced each cycle. And I would push back on it's not. I think it depends on what area of the ecosystem you're looking at. We think developers think crypto and Web3 is still really hot. I am seeing a lot less of those. We're all going to make it hashtags. I am seeing a lot less of them too. Although I am spending less time on Twitter. So maybe that's what. But with each cycle, there are new acronyms. What hasn't happened is a crypto winter in the midst of really serious global macro conditions. So we have inflation, kind of at record highs for our generation, in our lifetime. And then we have also a war that's broken out in the Ukraine. And we have a number of other factors going on here. So that's very different. There was some serious carnage out there. So, yeah. Luna, three hours. What's been your takeaways from what? Yeah, I don't want to sit here and tell you that algorithmic stablecoins are bad. Because I actually think they're really interesting. However, I think what happened is you had, in this case, you mentioned Luna and Tara. You know, that was an algorithmic stablecoin that was getting pretty widespread adoption relative to what the tech could do. I didn't realize you spent your teenage years living in Egypt and learning Arabic. Yeah. Tell me about your upbringing. I was always uprooted. My dad worked for a large company and we were always moving just when I would get comfortable in.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3543,2022-10-16 14:36:30
15258," Arabic. Tell me about your upbringing. I was always uprooted. My dad worked for a large company and we were always moving just when I would get comfortable in one space. And I think actually that's pretty important. If you fast-forward and look at my career, I'm comfortable being in uncomfortable situations. You know, I didn't know a lot about venture when I got into it initially. I didn't know a lot about crypto when I got into it initially. And I was okay asking questions. I was okay not knowing the local acronyms or the Namanclature of a particular field. And I'm, you know, I'm taken right back to my teenagers in Cairo, moving from Houston, Texas one day to downtown Maddie in Cairo the next day. You studied law. I did. You clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. That's right. You became a federal prosecutor. You were taking on prison gangs and the mafia. That must have taken a really thick skin. I was doing it at 8 to 25. And now if I kind of take a step back in you, I think that happens at different points in your career. Like, whoa, if I would have analyzed that a little more at the time, and I'm kind of in some ways glad I didn't. I just dove right in because I found it fascinating. There was a human aspect to it. And people's stories. And I felt like those stories mattered. So I was drawn to criminal law and became a federal prosecutor. And I did cases involving violent crime, but then really mistriing cases. Being back in the courtroom, being before the grand jury. Like the prosecutor you would see on TV going to try those murder cases. Doing those two hour closing arguments. That's right. And so moved out here to California. I indicted the largest prison gang in the world at the time, outlaw motorcycle gangs, hostage taking, bank robberies, armed bank robberies. There was really not a kind of criminal case by that point in my career. I hadn't done it. It was right around that time, 2012. One of my bosses came in and said, let's have that same energy that you brought to those gang cases, to those murder cases. And let's go ahead and have you investigate this new criminal technology that we really need to look into and possibly shut this down. So you created the first cryptocurrency task force. How would you describe it? Fortunately, several of us in the government realized at the time it's not possible, also not desirable. Because Bitcoin is not an entity. It's not a person. Right, it's a protocol. And it would be like saying, let's go shut down cash. Let's go shut down the internet. It's not possible. Probably wouldn't be a good idea either. I was using crypto and technologies like the Bitcoin blockchain, because that's all it existed then. This is 2012, 2013, to actually uncover criminal activity. So I didn't think that that technology was bad. Frankly, it was a tool that helped me uncover the various activity. And by the way, it was a step level function improvement better than compliance by banks. I'll just go ahead and say it. That's a little bit controversial. But I had spent a decade subpoenaing large financial institutions. And five times out of 10 didn't get back what I needed. One case I worked on, and people always say, oh, you shut down the Silk Road. What actually happened? I was looking into something completely, not having to do with anything at all of the Silk Road and came across some what looked to be some kind of odd activity. And it turns out that a couple of federal agents on the Silk Road Task Force out of Washington, DC, were cropped. And that is the case that I ended up in dining. And I ended up prosecuting those agents and they both went to prison. So that's the aspect of what Silk Road case that I worked on. I would never have been able to uncover that criminal activity by those agents, because they were federal agents they knew how to cover their tracks had they not use Bitcoin blockchain. So that technology right there, if they had just used wires or cash or even bank wires, we would never have uncovered that. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund from scratch?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3544,2022-10-16 14:41:17
15259," We make it very transparent to the shopper before they accept an order. What do you do to combat that? It's different in different places or demographic of shoppers. We are looking for products for consumers and we are seeing that being very appealing to women. I hosted an event here in San Francisco at the Federal Reserve Bank and it was there. We have a new ecosystem and we brought together the heads of agencies. Coinbase is a company that has suffered, they have been losing share, the valuation of the public markets has plummeted. Why do you think it can be fixed? When prices are down and the company has been transparent about that, long before going public. It's so much more. Crypto is under the microscope. I think multi-billion approaching trillion dollar industry, you are always going to be able to find examples like that. Along with your position at Coinbase, you became a partner at one of the most storied venture capital for instance Silicon Valley. I met Ben Horowitz and I worked with them for just about a year and maybe a little bit over when they asked me to come and co-run their crypto funds at AndreessenHorowitz. I jumped to that chance and I think that speaks to the fact that as I said before, things are a hell yes or no. So Andreessen Horowitz is the kind of place where if you make a partner you don't leave. As you might know Emily, they are an anchor. I'm very grateful for that. I felt very supported when I shared that decision and I will say that it was not running away from AndreessenHorowitz. I'm very grateful for that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3545,2022-10-16 14:44:16
15260," when I shared that decision. And I will say that it was not running away from Andrews and Hearts. It was running to another opportunity. And you know, crypto is not, what do they say? It's not a spectator sport. It's like you're in it. It excuse very young. It's 24-7. It's global. And it's hustle. And at this, and that's a trade-off. It's a life trade-off. And at this point in my career and in my life, if I was going to continue to make that trade-off, I just wanted to do it and do it in a way that was really true to me. So you struck out on your own? Yes. To launch on Ventures, what gave you the courage to do that? What was the spark that lit the fire? Yeah. That got you to say, I need to do this and do this now. Sure. What I set out to do was to continue to invest in this ecosystem that I think is so broad that decision was very purposeful. And the timing was very purposeful. We have an early stage fund that does seed stage, series A, even series B. And then we have what we call an acceleration fund, which is not a growth fund. It's a crypto growth fund. And I think those are different things. But it's later stage. It might be crypto-publics. Certain kinds of public tokens were set up to hold tokens to participate in the token ecosystem. Or later stage companies. I mean, there are now several crypto, many crypto unicorns. The space has become really competitive. Even though you say, crypto's had its ups and downs, the thing is, a lot of people in some of those last cycles have seen the kind of venture style returns that can be had in crypto. And so you've had a lot of new funds enter the space. And that's driven up competition. So what differentiates on ventures then? From all of these other crypto funds, or even more traditional venture capitalists, like entries in Harowitz or Sequoia, they also have crypto funds now. Well, I think a lot of traditional venture capital funds now have crypto funds. It used to just be like a regulatory designation. It was like, are you an RIA, which is registered investment advisor? I would say for crypto founders today, it's not enough to just be an RIA, right? They, frankly, I don't even know if a lot of them care. That's a regulatory designation. What crypto founders today want to know is, do you live and breathe crypto? Do you inhale the discourse? Are you part of the community? Do you participate in governance? Are you going to be staking these kind of crypto verbs out there? And if you're not really in this space full time, I think it's very hard to run a successful crypto fund. We don't have a hedge fund component. So we're not sitting here buying and trading and selling. That's a hedge fund structure. And there are crypto hedge funds. We're not one. We're making seven to 10-year bets. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund from scratch? You know, it's hard, but it's not impossible. We don't have a crystal ball. I don't know. I can't predict cycles, but I knew that we were in a cycle where you saw so much further an excitement around the space. And I already talked about what makes this different. But I think one thing also is we are a nimble strike force. We don't fish in the same pond. We have the crypto natives. We have a fishing execution. We have operators, seasoned operators, who really know how to stick the landing. And I think that's reflected on our culture. I would say the only thing that's changed in our strategy as a result of the market correction is really more of a focus on early stage. But we still have our late stage fund. And when we see valuations, which I think will still see correct, spoiler. I think we'll continue to see some corrections. And so we might deploy our later stage fund a little bit more slowly. It might not be on an even 50-50 cadence. And that's OK. Long-term, our strategy hasn't changed. Long-term, we're committed to this space. How much do you think valuations are going to correct? You know, it's just, I can't give you a one-size-fits-all answer because crypto is not a monolith. You have some crypto companies that really follow more of an enterprise SaaS business model. You have others that are layer one protocols. You have still others that are consumer-facing applications. And I think one of the things we're seeing right now is the infrastructure layer. And that's where we're spending a lot of our time, by the way. And we think more and more use cases will come about when the infrastructure layers in place. So my own view is we are not rushing to deploy. We're certainly not getting caught up. Do you get VC FOMO? I try not to. I try not to. You know, look, I think it's very easy to get into that mindset, right? It's because it's a competitive sport. It's a competitive space. And I think I'd be lying if I said that that doesn't influence anyone. I try to, what I.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3546,2022-10-16 14:50:06
15261," Get into that mindset, right? It's because it's a competitive sport. It's a competitive space And I think I'd be lying if I said that that doesn't influence anyone I try to what I do and I think I do differently is I try to take stock of that. Oh, that's the faux-momentality kicking in That's bad Again, you don't want to over-crack to though what we look for is we look for amazing founders It doesn't matter if I think valuations will correct if they're amazing founders There's a huge tam. We also look for what's your regulatory plan if you're launching a token What's your plan to comply with the law? What's your plan for security by the way? We've seen a lot of hacks in the space We want to really dive in there and make sure that the founders have been thoughtful about Especially if they're custodian customer funds keeping those funds secure if it's a cross-chain bridge What are the exploits? Have you changed your strategy at all given the downturn? What have you backed out of any deals or decided not to do certain deals? Because the conditions have changed since you raised the phone We have decided not to do certain deals. We've never backed out of a deal We have decided not to do a few deals because because we think that pricing was ahead of progress candidly And we might have been wrong about that Emily. We might have been wrong about that But I think if we were wrong not to do a couple of deals Better that we might have been right Because if we were wrong about that, I think we can find a way to still invest in those projects later Well, one thing I'm hearing is that a lot of dry powder has just sacked up because yeah All these funds raised a lot of money raised What what was the biggest fund ever for a single person not just a woman? Yeah, anyone. Yep. Are you confident you're gonna have to put a place to put all that money? I am but if I don't have a place to put it I'm not just going to go willing nilly deploy it one of the things that we told our LPs even during That period when we raised our fund which was when crypto was undeniably still on a bull run We said that we are going to be pretty steadfast sticking to a to your deployment cycle And you know, I think one thing that's changed is that might have lengthened It certainly hasn't shortened But we will again we have we feel very good that we have the capital to back great teams when we see them So you think we're we're gonna fall behind the United States we already are falling behind fall behind We're falling behind the markets are preparing to close but the day is not over yet It is now up about 45 percent a lot of volatility right now You need the power of the Bloomberg terminal to get you market moving data before anyone else Those numbers are much higher than expected all greater today to overweight You need top analysts to bring you exclusive global insight into cross asset markets The meaning of market is a really big focus Bitcoin ain't going to be short term Bloomberg markets to close weekdays on Bloomberg Bloomberg has enhanced search on the terminal to deliver what you need when you need it now You can simply type phrases in every day English in the command line Compare financials Find people Analyze markets You can enter phrases or ask questions What do you want to know today? Ask a question or visit search go to find answers now What about NFTs and if you are you concerned about the declining demand we are going to increasingly live in a digital world And I happen to think that if you live in a digital world you're going to want to own Digital goods in that world you're not just gonna be satisfied to rent them Which is what we do now we buy our content from Waldgarden's without digital scarcity, which is what NFTs unlock you You don't really own anything your subject to the whims of a platform and I think NFTs and digitally scarce goods Fundamentally change that I think you'll see NFTs back again But we are spending a lot of time in the infrastructure layer like I tell you zero knowledge technologies scalability we think of that as like the plumbing If you think of the fiber-hubbic cables remember you couldn't have had YouTube and Netflix With dial up you couldn't have streamed content the same as",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3547,2022-10-16 14:53:46
15262," Like the plumbing, if you think of the fiber-hubtic cables. Remember, you couldn't have had YouTube and Netflix with dial-up. You couldn't have streamed content. The same is true of crypto use cases. We think that there will be a lot of new use cases unlocked when the infrastructure is there, when it's more efficient, when it's more user-friendly. And so we're spending a lot of our time there. President Biden issues this crypto executive order. There are a number of ports that are coming due. What do you want to see from the administration when it comes to regulation? Are you optimistic that we will get there? Yeah. We were so delighted to see that executive order. It's not something you should normally be delighted about. But why we were is because it was to us a real recognition that this is a US government saying, this field isn't going anywhere. This field is growing. It's growing so much that we are going to direct every single agency in the federal government to come up with a plan here. I think we take a step forward, but then you see, we're a big government. We're a big system. We have states. We have local entities. So we take a step forward with the EO. And then we take some steps back sometimes too. And I think what I see as crypto founders are confused by that. They're starting to think, well, I could go to this jurisdiction where there's a single regulator. And you don't have 50 states with different rules. It's the US government that needs to start taking stock of the fact that right now, Emily in China, there's a quarter of a billion, ECNY wallets, a quarter of a billion. We're still talking about whether there should be a government central bank digital currency. We're still studying that. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind China. We're falling behind. What are the dangers of falling behind China and the rest of the world? This is years ahead. So I don't want people to take a headline and say, oh, I think the US dollar will be no longer the global currency, reserve global currency. I'm not saying that now. But fast forward decades. And if you no longer need to use the dollar, because you have an alternative, I think that's a real problem. What would we use instead? Well, I think that there are going to be stable coins out there that people who have access to a smartphone will use. There is a demand for it. We see 285% year over year growth with stable coins. So people are clearly liking the idea of this. Now, again, there have been some spectacular failures, too. But not all stable coins are created the same. But I think the important thing is that we really do need to not just quash innovation. What do you think of how Gary Gensler, the chair of the SEC, and how he's approaching it? One of the things that I hear from founders is that they're very confused because they get told, come in, register. Just come in and talk to us. But you have the one company who's done the ultimate act of going in and registering coinbase, filed an S1. And still, there's a lot of saber rattling still going on, I think. And again, I don't want to single out the SEC. And I don't want to suggest that anything they're doing is bad. I do think, though, that right now there's a lot of confusion. And one of the pieces of confusion stems from the fact that it started with the ICO mania back in 2016, 2017. I can't remember which year now, where the SEC was very loud about securities. A lot of them were securities. But the space has changed. And so to still view it through the ICO lens, when so much has happened over the last five years in the space, I think is a mistake. What do you have to say to the skeptics out there who just don't believe in the future of Web3? And don't see where this is going. I would say don't judge the current state of innovation by the end state of innovation. I hear from a lot of these skeptics. And by the way, I'm friends with a lot of these skeptics, too. I don't only want to live in a crypto bubble. They want to see the use cases, especially if they're not technical. Well, when am I going to use it? What will I use it for? And I think one of the things that's not appreciated is how quickly the infrastructure here is catching up. And once you have really scalable blockchains that can handle a lot of thorough put and are very efficient, I think that unlocks a whole lot of use cases. People are spending more time on screens. That curve is up and to the right. Whether we like it or not, that is the future. I mean, those who have kids know that kids spend more time online. They want digital things, too. And I think to dismiss it, it is a bit generational. I do find not always, but it is a bit generational. If you talk to kids about being able to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3548,2022-10-16 14:58:41
15263," I do find not always, but it is a bit generational. If you talk to kids about being able to have money online, they instantly get that concept. They're comfortable not having to hold something in their hand to think it has value. Take us to the end state. Do Google and Amazon and Facebook and Apple still exist? I believe they will still exist. I mean, it depends what you talk about when you talk about the end state. I mean, I think that, you know, I think for decades, those companies will still be around. But the important thing is I think this new ecosystem is going to represent a challenge to them. I do think that those entities, decentralized forces are coming and will cut into those entities, profits and revenues. So we have a little rapid fire section. If you could belong to any altcoin tribe, that's what it be. Gosh. There is no way I'm answering that because I will get trolled on Twitter by every other altcoin tribe. I'm a crypto maximalist. I'm a crypto maximalist. All right. Well, I'm not picking one. Booker podcast. You're binging now. Yeah. Okay. I'm, I, yes, I am. Oh gosh. I'm binging on wheat crashed. Something that brings you simple joy. You know, one of the things that I love and I've missed being away from this summer is swimming. I just love, I find like some of my best thoughts come to me while I'm moving. Career philosophy. Mm. Yeah. Do a job where you know 50% of the job and where you're going to learn 50% of the job. Um, again, that goes back to no growth in the comfort zone, no comfort in the growth zone. Yeah. Yeah. Watch Bloomberg surveillance early edition for the news you need when you need it. I'm not a little bit Kayleigh Lymes in New York and N Edwards in London. It's great. You're central bank raises interest rates twice as much as bull cars. In surveillance for in-depth analysis outside some Kate and Lisa Brownbitt. So I'm John at the fair out the FBI front and sense. How does Japan get away with not raising rates? Can it sustain its normal at a time when everybody else is facing a very different way out? Bloomberg surveillance be informed, be prepared, be ahead of the game. Back in 1997, I was interested in the following question, which is there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called sauropod dinosaurs, which had really long skinny necks. So apodosaurus is an example. Now, it's had really long skinny tails. So I made a computer model that showed that in fact the tail of these sauropod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip, a bullfip. Now the way a bullfip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. And that crack is a sonic boom. I think the way they got a date was to impress the females by making loud booms. Access the financial world on demand.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3549,2022-10-16 15:02:18

It's creating an entirely new autonomous vehicle targeted at the Robotaxi market. Just don't call it a car. A car is an inference that there is a driver, especially a human driver. And from an engineering standpoint, the architecture of a car is around a human driver. Whereas in our Robotaxi, there is no manual driving. A human cannot really drive it to transport passengers. So we want to make sure that mindset, that shift, that distinction is clear. The name ZUX is a reference to a marine organism that, like the Robotaxi, depends on renewable energy and is able to maintain a symbiotic relationship with its surrounding habitat. Chief Executive Aisha Evans says sustainability is at the heart of what they do. But it's keen to stress that going green means more than just one thing. It's not just about electrifying. That's not what sustainability is. More and more people are coming up the economic social strata. They want to do stuff like everybody else. They want to have access to knowledge, good lives, sharp and so on. And the infrastructure is saturated. And we need to think about things holistically when it comes to sustainability, not just any clarification. But it doesn't have to happen overnight, though we need to get going. In this episode of Leaders Goes Green, I speak to ZUX Chief Executive Aisha Evans about the challenges of developing artificial intelligence, being acquired by Amazon and making a driver's future a reality. Aisha, thank you so much for joining us on Leaders With Lackwin. Our Amazon acquired ZUX back in January 2020 for what reports suggested was $1.2 billion. Since then, the company has revealed it's ZUX vehicle. This is, I think, a rectangular passenger-focused vehicle with no driver's seat or steering wheel. First of all, how would you describe it? We describe it as a purpose-built vehicle, but it's really a robot taxi that's its purpose. And essentially, it's about transporting people from point A to point B on demand in the most effective, cleanest and most enjoyable way. So why won't you call it a car? Because a car is, there is an inference that there is a driver. And in our case, especially a human driver, and from an engineering standpoint, the architecture of a car is around a human driver. The hood so that you can see ahead of you, the windshield, even the seating arrangement so that the people you're transporting do not bother you. Whereas in our robot taxi, there is no manual driving. A human cannot really drive it to transport passengers. So we want to make sure that that mindset, that shift, that distinction is clear. So is there a piece of technology? I sure that you wish you'd have at your hands to make it better, to make it workable 100%. No, I'd time, if I could accelerate through time. That's really, that would be fantastic. Look, it's about testing. We can drive. That's not the issue. The issue is, and we follow the rules very well. I always say that when it comes to products that use self-driving technology, there are two numbers that are too metrics that are really important. Safety, we know that in the United States, on average, over 40,000 people lose their lives through car crashes. By the way, the pandemic did not help.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3550,2022-10-16 15:06:42
15265," safety. We know that in the United States, on average, over 40,000 people lose their lives through car crashes. By the way, the pandemic did not help us. We actually spiked up to over 43,000. And those are mostly caused by the human driver's errors. Human were not at times the most disciplined. We're looking on phones, maybe a little bit de-habitated because of a couple of glasses of wine or we're talking to somebody. And that causes errors. But computers are very good at not making those types of errors. There's another statistic that's really important is that on average, in the United States, humans collectively drive 100 million miles before causing a fatality. Just think about it. A hundred million miles. And it takes a lot of testing, a lot of statistical math and forecasting to meet and beat that number because we try, we strive to be better than humans. So when you focus on safety, I said, how much in advance can actually zoos predict events that are about to happen? We can predict things. So the way the AI stack works is, first of all, and this goes to our robot taxi and the sensor architecture and compute. It's important to give to maximize all of your chances to see what is going on around you and in your environment. This is why our sensor architecture uses camera, light hours, radars, and longwave infrared cameras. So that, for example, we can sense heat and something is alive. This is why we have them at the top four corners. So that at any point in time, three of those sensor pods are basically seeing you. And then the compute being able to come to basically fuse all of that information and data on a continuous basis and then predict what are the agents around us going to do potentially and therefore how should we react and we're constantly in that loop. So the better the better and the faster you can do that, and basically the more will be there. But that's not really the issue where we're having with the testing. The issue we're having with the testing is what I call the millions of unique edge cases last minute things that happen that humans basically are very good at dealing with it. I like to say that you've been learning to deal with them as a human ever since you came out of the hospital, basically, as a baby. You're already seeing cars, agents, when do I cross, when don't I cross all those types of things so that accumulated knowledge is what computers are not very good at, but we're able to run a certain level of prediction. What is this concretely so is this reflexes is this morality issues. You could say, hey, you're not supposed to come on my oncoming lane, but the reality is that when your human driver sees somebody else come on their oncoming lane, they assess the situation and quickly either stop, slow down, go around something. It's all of those little mini maneuvers every time something's different happens. You're trying to you're not only trying to replicate the human mind, right, and I don't know how long away we are from that. It could be decades, are you trying to better to make better decisions in the human mind. We're trying to make I don't know that they are better than the human mind, but for a robot, they make a lot of sense. So we're trying to make the kind of parallel applicable decisions so that we're moving people around. And so that means we don't we won't normally we won't necessarily replicate what a human driver would have done, but we'll make a maneuver or a responding maneuver that makes a lot of sense is safe, keeps the flow of traffic and also our customers company. It's regulation. It's of course, actually making the vehicle. What would you describe your company has. Basically, our mobility on demand company from point A to point B first for human transport that business model and that those businesses exist in the world today. The only difference is that when you're an app today, whichever app you choose.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3551,2022-10-16 15:11:00
15266," transport that business model and that those businesses exist in the world today. The only difference is that when you're on an app today, whichever app you choose, what shows up is a passenger car with a human driver. So the business, that's the business, it exists already. All we're doing is replacing the tool, meaning it's not going to be a passenger car with a human driver. It's going to be a robot taxi that comes in. It's a more enjoyable experience. It's electric. Yes, it uses self driving technology to move it, but that said so for those who thinks we're doing everything, we're not. We're doing the van diagram of what is necessary to accomplish that goal. So how far away do you think we're from accomplishing that goal? You're talking about, for example, gathering information, the perception phase, right, which is cameras, radars, inference. And light off look, it depends. We tend to be very realistic about what's going on here. This is a beginning of a wave. When you look at all of the big industry transformation, they did not happen overnight. They took quite a while. So in a geofan's area, we hope to be out there very soon. Our focus is being on public roads with our robot taxi soon, but it will be in a moderate small to moderate scale. And then the question is, how ability to be able to add geofancies to add cities on a continuous basis. And in a way that is sort of good for customers, because there's no point in doing it in one tiny little geofan's and not being able to go to a bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger fans, because then the customers will be like, this is a gimmick. When is that coming to me? Up next, evolution isn't always a smooth process. And isha Evans expects things will get bumpy on the road to the future of personal transportation. But she says innovation will find a way. One thing we know about humanity and our history is that progress is unstoppable. From the world of politics to the world of business, balance of power with David Weston, Mews and Melisys, inside, from and above politics power players, weekdays, this is Bloomberg. A fundamental change in the way we move around will require a fundamental rethinking of the way cities are built, especially when taking sustainability into account. I carry on the conversation with Zook's chief executive, Isha Evans. When you focus on green or sustainability, how do you think this will change cities? So, you know, I think it will improve things dramatically. The fleet will be, oh, is fully electric. That's a good thing. So, second of all, today, humans, when we buy a car, we actually only use it 4% of the time. The rest of the time, it's parking either in our garage or in somebody else's garage or in the street and taking time. Just from a mathematical standpoint, we're building more things than we need strictly for human transport. So we will make less things because when you're not using the robot axis, somebody else is using it. So it's very effective and efficient. I call it an improvement because we as an industry, and I mean overall, there needs to be a lot of improvement in the battery ecosystem, whether it's batteries themselves, whether it's the making of them, the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3552,2022-10-16 15:15:27
15267," And I mean, overall, there needs to be a lot of improvement in the battery ecosystem, whether it's batteries themselves, whether it's the making of them, the using of them, as well as what happens on the end of life of a battery. And I believe that they are still a lot of work to do, but I think there'll be a lot of innovation in that space. But when do you think we'll have the first off driving robotaxi in a big city that's also very eco-friendly? It's going to be, I don't know, we don't get into dates at zoos because we feel that it's better to show and then tell than the opposite. As an industry, and you know, this I'm saying, an industry meaning I think everyone included. We've made too many, oh, it will happen. We've kind of like been, oh my gosh, it's going to happen tomorrow morning. Oh my gosh, it's never going to happen. So we don't really get into the dates, but within definitely a more realistic time frame that maybe some people are quoting out there. I mean, testing has started for all of us. And so I think it's much sooner than people realize. The question will be the game of then replicating that to several cities, to an entire country, and then to several countries. Were you frustrated or are you frustrated? Now, when you started, did you think it would be quicker to have these self-driving robotaxis or slower? You're going to out me. That's not nice. I actually think it's going about, I thought it would be even slightly slower. You know, even the ecosystem of driving, right, or with passenger cars, from the Carson buggy and all of the infrastructure that comes around it to where we are today, it took a little bit of while, right? And so I actually think that it's going at the correct pace. It's slightly slower, maybe than I expected, but it's about the base. This is a big deal. This is a hard technology, and this is a societal transformation. At the same time, we talk a lot about this environmental transformation, maybe taking longer than we were expecting because of some components not being readily available. Do you worry for the car industry, for the industry urine, that we just don't have the right components for the battery or for the self-driving vehicles? I think we have the right component at this point in time. The question is, how are we going to stimulate the industry, academia, research, governments, regulatory to pour a lot into this space? It's not just about having mandates. By 2000X, all cars will be XYZ. They're the whole infrastructure across all of the different vectors, including academia and research, that also has to come with us so that we have enough innovation for the scale that's going to be necessary. And how you change people's perceptions? I imagine that you're worried that in certain countries, people won't want to give up their cars. Well, yes. I mean, disruption is always interesting. There are a lot of countries whose economies depend on the car industry. And so I do worry about that. But I think that one of the mistakes maybe we've made in times of disruption is to not have engineering empathy for the either the company or the country that's being disrupted. I think it's better to have conversations now, figure out how we manage through the transition together as opposed to good or bad. Because one thing we know about humanity and our history is that progress is unstoppable. I like to say sometimes for effect that if you could wake up somebody who died 2000 years ago magically and then drop them in the middle of New York City or Mumbai or Cape Town, they literally couldn't function. They could they they wouldn't know what to do. And so I think that we need to be generous with each other and manage through the transition together, but understand that this is unstoppable and inevitable. Yeah, even someone who passed maybe 100 years ago would be complete. We lost a New York City. Exactly. They would be looking for the stable and the buggy and the coach and be like, no, no, no, you need to either buy a car, take the subway, take public transportation or call, you know, a mobility. And by the way, where's your phone? And no, no, we don't mean this phone. We need a phone that's a computer in your pocket. Do you know what an app is? So yes, it would that's why I think that",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3553,2022-10-16 15:19:55
15268," And by the way, where's your phone? No, no, we don't mean this phone. We need a phone that's a computer in your pocket. Do you know what an app is? So yes, that's why I think that we just need to be patient and drive through the transition together. But if we look at the last, let's say, 20, 30 years, it's amazing the pace of change and how quick that was in the last six to seven years. Can we replicate that again? Oh, I'm confident we can. Look, prior to being in this industry, I was in the wireless industry. Had a lot of fun with that from people forget. Even the landline was an evolution, right? It used to be switchboards and an operator needed to be on the other end of that. And then from there, we went to cell phones. I remember being in a lab when we received the first text string on an LCD screen through GPRS and Edge. But then we were already working in research on LTE and basically Wi-Fi and all these things. And we were dreaming of having people having the internet in their pocket and what that would enable. By the way, we didn't really think about apps or anything like that. But we just trusted that with the availability of the infrastructure, people would innovate on top of that and boy, did they? And I expect the exact same thing to happen in the self-driving space. Up next, Aisha Evans on what life is like being part of the Amazon family? No, I don't hang out with bezels and grassy and limp. And I mean, this is a job. They want us to get to market. They want us to make the progress we say we're going to make. They want us to build a great company. And that's really the basis of the relationship. You will put a woman on Mars.

But his acquisition of ZUX in 2020 proved that the Amazon boss very much has his eye on the future of transport on this planet too. I continue the conversation. ZUX Chief Executive, Ichevins. What's it like being part of the Amazon family do you get much exposure to Jeff Bezos? This is, I get this question a lot. A lot, I imagine. Yeah, look, I mean, first of all, we love being inside Amazon. We literally are grateful and privileged because this takes a lot of capital. There are a lot of really good success stories and also good learnings at Amazon about being long-term oriented and being part of creating a new industry and driving to use a clichÃ© transformation. So we get a lot of good advice. It's been really great. And no, I don't hang out with Bezos and Jassy and Lemp. And I mean, this is a job. They want us to get to market. They want us to make the progress we say we're going to make. They want us to build a great company. And that's really the basis of the relationship. Did you always think you'd get here?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3554,2022-10-16 15:24:01
15269," us to make the progress we say we're going to make. They want us to build a great company, and that's really the basis of the relationship. Did you always think you'd get here when you were growing up? You were always, from my understanding, very passionate about science and technology. You know, when you were a kid, it's funny. I wish I could get a redo, because man, I would be a lot more chilled than, I mean, I knew I wanted to study and be in the field of science and technology. I knew I wanted to match it and mix it with what enabled things for humanity and society across all continents, but exactly what form that would take, and whether I was going to make it. I often think about, you know, when something bad happens to a human, I often think about, well, why them and not me? So no, I was a lot more stressed out about, is it going to work out, than am I going to be exactly here? But I'm privileged and happy to be here. I feel blessed. Is that the kind of advice that you give to, if someone very young work to come and see you and say, like, I don't know what the jobs of tomorrow, what the future brings, what should I study at university? What would you tell them? So first, I always tell people, spend a lot of time with yourself. The longest relationship you're going to have in life is with yourself. Understand who you are. I can tell you that I don't know that I fully understand Aisha yet, but there are a lot of things I understand. Simple example, you know, Aisha likes disruption. So do not put Aisha in charge of something that doesn't need to be disrupted, because she'll mess it up. And that doesn't make me good or bad. It just makes me different. So spend a lot of time with yourself. Second thing is understand your passions, because if something doesn't feel like work, it feels, you love it. I know that's a cliche, then you'll be able to go through the ups and downs of it, and you'll be able to evolve with it. Third, I believe that the blend is the most important thing right now. I think not understanding technology at all is going to make it difficult if you want to be in that field or in sort of the field that drives things, but understanding empathy and humanity and blending technology with that is where it's at. I mean, AI is all about that at the end of the day. Talk to me a little bit. If you have to choose between sustainability, right? If you look at so it's sustainable, it's green, but this very advanced technology for a driverless. If you had to choose between the two, which one would you choose? It's a non-choice. They have to advance together. Now, we can make some compromises short term versus medium term versus long term, but it has to go together. I mean, sustainability, and that's one of the things that's a little bit of a bad people of mine. It's not just about electrifying. That's not what sustainability is. More and more people are coming up the economic social strata. They want to do stuff like everybody else. They want to have access to knowledge, good lives, shop and so on. And the infrastructure is saturated. And we need to think about things holistically when it comes to sustainability, not just electrification, but it doesn't have to happen overnight, though we need to get going. What kind of leader are you? An evolving leader, a learning leader. I place a lot of focus on people. At the end of the day, my job is to serve the people so that we can reach the goal. I can't do anything by myself. I already know what I think. And so what's more important is how do I enable others? How do I understand why they think the way they do? And how do we get to the same goal? I think that I'm a little bit of a control freak, but this is in rehabilitation. I've been on it for 15 years. That's probably the thing that's the hardest. And it manifests itself usually on Fridays at 5 p.m. And so everybody at Zooks knows that if you're going to schedule a difficult meeting on Friday at 5 p.m. You might need to manage through Aisha because I'm just exhausted by that time. And my ability to control myself is not as effective. Do you remember the hardest day in your career? And what did you learn from it? Oh, I've had plenty of hard days. I mean, one hard day was at Intel. I was in a very, very, very difficult meeting and situation. And I was angry coming out of that meeting.

He gave me a call and he said, how are you feeling? I said, not good. I use choice words. And I'm going to do this, that, and the other. And he basically said, look, first of all, I hear you. I understand why you feel that way. Why don't we do this? If Monday morning you still feel like spending, sending that email, then send it. But hold it in your inbox until Monday. And needless to say, I didn't send it Monday. I learned a lot from that sponsorship, generosity, being proactive, managing your triggers, and so on. I would say that I've had some tough zoos moments, especially around choosing what to do long-term. But stay true to your principle and play the long game, not the short game, because with zoos, if we had chosen the short game, it would have been not good for the company in Belong Run. I sure thank you so much for joining us today. Francine, my pleasure, thank you.! And you're one of the most fascinating entrepreneurs because you all started really young. What did you learn? Did you always think that you'd be an entrepreneur? Probably yes. I think which is a bit sad. For age what? Five? I'm not sure. I come from a family of entrepreneurs so even though I probably can spell the word and still can't indicate it. It's sort of in my blood. It's really fun starting a business. I'm fun growing a business. I feel it's a real privilege. And I started my business officially at 18 but I think I knew I wanted to do it very differently from about 15. But I'm sure it's you know if you're surrounded by it feels very natural. So yes it's fun. And it started how you started by making you want to Florence. It was an Italy and you started handbags. Yeah. So I knew I was actually given a handbag by my mother when I was about 61 of her old handbags and I remember how it made me feel. And I think fashion is fascinating for the mood changing, the confidence boosting aspects and some tribal aspects of what fashion does. And so I went at 18 to Florence knowing that was the home of the Lebhagus which is what interested me. I just wanted to learn actually I'm being surrounded by craftsmen who are making things as important and that's going to be very interesting I think over the next sort of 10 years. I think the on-shoring of craft and manufacturing is going to be fascinating. Actually I mean I watched the off-shoring. I literally saw it. And I think we're going to be seeing that coming back to local. We have to. Just objectives in terms of carp and proximity is going to be key.

15271," European Pose with Guy Johnson in London and Alex Diel in New York, Realtown Numbers, Realtime Analysis, weekdays. In 2021, Shake Shack was looking to hire a new chief financial officer. The fast casual restaurant chain found the perfect candidate in an unexpected place. Wall Street. I had worked at Goldman Sachs for about 16 years. I was covering the restaurant sector. Katie and I worked together for a long time. She was an analyst covering our stock. The day that I knew I was looking for a new CFO, the day that I announced it, I went to a recruiter and I said, what about Katie for me? I remember working with her. You think she might be interested in this? That same day, she had heard about it and went to her family and said, this is the job I want. Literally that same day. It was something that I always wanted to take a more of a leadership role at a company. We hit it off. Katie Fogourney spent the first part of her career asking hard questions about corporate strategy. Now she's responsible for answers. I think that there's a number of things that a cell side research analyst can lend to a company, especially a company that is in high growth mode. One, it's just really a very firm ability to analyze strategic decisions, to really get into the numbers, into the models, and to have a firm view of different scenarios out there. When those Wall Street executives move into the company seat, they bring an understanding hopefully of the fundamentals company sector, but also what it means to be a stock. The total stakeholder perspective includes shareholders. How are we measuring the incrementality of a great offer like this? Katie's skill set so uniquely is able to harvest in her mind so much data and information. Turn it quickly into tremendous insights that end up driving our strategic priorities. That is her sweet spot. I look at a CFO from Wall Street as someone who can bring a breath of fresh air to a business that often can become very in bread. They're extremely grounded in data. They're curious about data. They're pushing the data. They know what to do with the data and tie that into telling the story. There's a reality check that Katie brings to the business to say, you know, I know you think this, but let me tell you what the data is really telling us here. She's still looking at data to predict the future, only now she's taking it a step further. Before, it was a lot of kind of sitting almost in an armchair type basis and analyzing different and now pieces of information to see where I thought the best investment dollar would be allocated. Here it is actually driving a plan of how we can best maximize shareholder returns. It is about leveraging data analytics, driving real insights through, you know, not just your own guest data, but leveraging statistical models and really kind of figuring out where the best strategic decisions will be made over time. This is an industry that really needs that type of analysis that help the strategic vision now more than ever. And so it was incredibly exciting to start to apply that here at ShakeShack. ShakeShack began as a humble hot dog cart in New York's Madison Square Park. It opened its first restaurant as a kiosk in that park in 2004. A decade later, there were more than 60 ShakeShack restaurants around the world. And in early 2015, the company went public. At the end of 2021, ShakeShack and its license partners operated nearly 400 locations in 16 countries. At least 60 more are expected to open by the end of 2022. We always feel like we're just getting started at ShakeShack. Somehow, you know, we kind of describe ourselves as a public startup. We have a huge footprint and white space out there that we can grow globally. And we're going to continue to do that. The pace of expansion is nothing new for this company, but maybe different is the shape.

15272," Nothing new for this company, but maybe different is the shape. Shake Shack has thrived in high-density urban locations, which provided 60% of revenues before the pandemic. But returned to office patterns during COVID have been unpredictable, hampering sales growth in cities. Now Shake Shack is exploring new formats as it extends its footprint in suburbs. It is not just a reaction to COVID. This is stuff that we've been working on before. What COVID did was accelerated the pace and excitement, frankly, for some of the things that we've been planning before. Drive through amongst them as the most important. We were right at a pivotal moment of thinking drive-throughs were obsolete, and then COVID hit, and it was a saving grace. When you get out into the suburban areas, drive-in becomes incredibly important, because that's convenience. And if a significant percentage of your business is drive-up, you need a smaller facility. So the investment can be smaller. This is the first time the company has ever put in a drive-through. We opened up our first one in December of last year. We have six open, very exciting stuff. Drive-through lanes offer long-term opportunities to build revenue and increase margins. But right now, they carry a higher price tag. Overall, we've seen a rise in our build costs. We talk about 10 to 15% higher build costs across the board. Things are just costing more. It makes site selection ever more important. It makes all of the work that we do in real estate and that whole process incredibly more important. Since Katie Fogarty became CFO of Shake Shack in June 2021, inflation has risen at a record rate, making her job that much harder. Everything that enters our business, commodities, foods, cost of building restaurants is getting more expensive. I don't see that ending anytime soon. I think we've got to continue to plan for it. If you look at the price of beef, if you look at the price of dairy, eggs, all of these core things, even paper and packaging, it's just meaning that everything costs us more and more and more. And we're not alone. This is happening to the entire industry right now. The industry is also dealing with a sea change on the labor front. Hourly wages have soared, and the great resignation has hit restaurants hard. Labor costs aren't going down because of the training and turnover at the 30, 60, and 90-day mark. If someone can even figure the job out, do they stay? And that's still not under control whatsoever. So while maybe the actual wage inflation can taper, turnover and training costs are still elevated. We've invested more than $10 million in our employees over the past year. And we're going to continue to invest more. We're testing four-day work weeks to help, especially our working parents, kind of juggle that balance between childcare and your work. I know I deal with that all the time. This is really a people-first company. In an inflationary environment, you're going to see us continue to lead with our people. Do you worry at all about a price wage spiral, not just here, but in the industry, in the economy? Yes. And I think that this is something that many business leaders are focused on. And time will tell kind of how all of this lands. I think the wage-price spiral continues for quite some time. And I think we probably have been a lot less aggressive than we can be, and than many other companies have been. In terms of raising prices. Yes, we've taken our time. If you look at a 20-year history of pricing in this company, we've taken about 2% a year on average. We've never taken what we could. We've always taken what we should. We have to pay people more. We have been, and we'll continue to do so. We'll take a little bit of a margin compression on that as we've had to. And I think that's the right thing. So that for the long term, Shake Check continues to be what we're building, which is the next generation's burger joint. Shake Check margins have come down from pre-pandemic levels. At the same time, the company's cash position has improved. During COVID, we actually took two opportunities to raise capital. We have a fortress balance sheet like we've never had before. Good timing, good planning. So when we use that money, we're looking for a great return. The area with the highest potential return is right in Katie Fogridi's wheelhouse, advancing Shake Shack's digital transformation. It's amazing to sit here and think that this is a company that had essentially hardly any digital sales prior to the pandemic. And when the pandemic hit, we went full force on digital with the app, web, with third party delivery. And here we are now with, you know.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3558,2022-10-16 15:41:45
15273," sales prior to the pandemic. And when the pandemic hit, we went full force on digital with the app, web, with third party delivery. And here we are now with 43% of our sales still coming from digital channels, even as our in-check business has been available. That doesn't count the kiosks, right? That does not count the kiosk. So what kind of investment was that? Was it a home run? Is that something where you're like, Randy, this paid off big time. Well, it's something that we continue to invest in. And we continue to see opportunities to improve our app, improve that guest experience, improve the ways that we're incentivizing our guests to really lean into our digital channels. If you simply look at what the higher frequency we get from those digital guests, moving more and more of them into the channels and continuing to invest to drive frequency of that base, it's a really good recipe for strong long-term traffic growth. Coming up, digital investments have boosted Shake Shack's business. Katie Fogartia shares me they're not done innovating. We want the kiosks to be able to identify who you are and what you like to order when you come into the shack. This is Bloomberg. You will shed light on dark matter. You will make aging optional. You will turn 5G up to 11. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, high in year, disrupt. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. From its early days as a kiosk in Manhattan's Madison Square Park, Shake Shack's brand has combined simplicity and style. The menu features classic items with a creative twist while the ingredients and service are a significant step up from fast food. The concept was an instant success, but maintaining growth and staying relevant comes to the complex set of pressures. We've come out of the pandemic with a new world. And where something that might have been an evolutionary change has been a revolutionary change. We've made changes to the way we eat. We've made changes to the way we operate that might have taken years have been compressed into months and days. The role of CFO in a company like ours that's so dynamically growing, so constantly changing and focused on digital is critical. Cane plays such an amazing role there. She's not just moving numbers around. This is not your grandfather's CFO anymore. The digital infrastructure, the way we think about things out is a monster that needs to be fed all day long every day and is always hungry. And you could probably have 150 digital priorities today that all our teams will fight about. Ops wants this, tech wants this, marketing wants this, I want this, Katie wants that. Katie's job is to take all that prioritization, think it through, understand which one is going to have the best return on capital, and which ones have no return on capital, and you still got to do them anyway. That's the reality of the world we live in right now. And it's critical to lead that in the right way. I visited a Manhattan shack with Katie Fogarty. Our first stop inside the restaurant was an ordering kiosk. And on the burger side, you can see the option here for the bourbon bacon jam burger, with shallots on top, the avocado bacon burger as well, our beloved smoked shack. The kiosks are an investment in engagement. We just see a gas kind of sit with the menu and really appreciate and understand how they can customize their order or the different add-ons that they have. So we really do believe that this provides them with an even better experience than going to the cash register. What's the payoff? I mean, the cost to put one of these in compared to how much more a customer spends on a kiosk. We do see a very nice lift off of the kiosk. And actually, this is not even a very fancy kiosk technology. It's an iPad. What has more investment tied to it, it's just the constant innovations that we've had to make the kiosk functionality better and better. And we're driving towards a parody situation where the kiosk and the cash register have exactly the same.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3559,2022-10-16 15:45:52
15274," of a parity situation where the kiosk and the cash register have exactly the same functionality and we want the kiosk to be able to identify who you are and what you like to order when you come into the shack. Improvements like these take resources. Shakeshacks general and administrative expenses have risen as the companies put capital behind digital initiatives and the changes ripple out from there. As our digital evolution has been underway we've had to make a number of adjustments to the layout of our current existing shack base and really rethink the flow of the shack that we're building in order to really capitalize and enable and let our digital business thrive. In many Shacks we've taken out cash registers we've moved them around. A lot of times it's two or three cash registers that are just taken down to one. We've had to really rethink the way that the flow of our guest journey is in our shack. So one perfect example of it is we put in pickup shelves here at most of our restaurants. Guests who are looking for that to go experience can come in and pick up the order to go and they don't have to sit there and wait with everybody else who is waiting for their food ready to be made. We are constantly monitoring and identifying ways to be better in the kitchen and it also goes down to the products and the types of offerings that we have. We never want to have something that is going to overly complicate our team members journey. We don't want to have something that's going to slow us down operationally. So you'll see a lot of our LTOs just really be building a four menu ingredients and allowing our teams to kind of do a little bit different with what we already have. LTO stands for Limited Time Offer. It might be a special shake flavor or partnerships like a recent venture with the Stiller Makers Mark. But Shake Shack's core offering is the burger and it's not just any burger. The company pledges to store premium meat that's ethically raised and costs more even when inflation is not at historic levels. I've heard a lot about the importance of the quality to you guys in terms of ingredients. Doesn't that get expensive especially right now quality beef must be you know in rising in terms of price. I mean we've always used premium ingredients and those premium ingredients they come at a higher price. We always have an eye on the margin but we know also at the end of the day you're running a very dangerous game if you're trying to reverse engineer into something that you know you want from a P&L standpoint the guests might not like it. Shake Shack's standing firm on quality and it's also practicing transparency announcing plans to raise menu prices by 5 to 7% in the fourth quarter of 2022. Shake Shack is the best example, the definition of a fantastic value proposition. However not all customers across this country have you know that change in their pocket to pay for that average ticket at lunch or dinner and I think they're very comfortable with that and I think it's very interesting and very different than what others are doing. I mean it is who they are they're not trying to escape it they're not trying to be something they're not and the fact of the matter is if they picked a different path and it's fine it would be hard to pivot back. We are serving fresh whole muscle, hormone antibiotic free beef that is a totally different thing than you're going to eat at nearly all other restaurants certainly traditional fast food and you got to pay more for that and you should want to and when you see things like 10 for a dollar or two for five dollars we can't do that because our ingredients cost more than that to bring it to you and you should want to pay more for that and frankly who am I to argue? It's a little crunchy the bacon is a crunchy I like that. It's delicious. I might finish this. Coming up why Shake Shack believes it's got everything to gain by going global. I mean there's so many opportunities for us to add to our license business. We see there's a huge white space opportunity for us. And Katie Fogarty tells me what skills she's relied on while making the transition from Wall Street analyst to CFO. I would say just a lot of grit. I never thought it was going to be easy and it's proved to be quite the learning opportunity. This is Bloomberg.

15275," Big, expensive cities have a lot going for them. But if you live in one, you probably notice that these big, expensive cities keep getting more, well, expensive. You could always move away. You might have just started working remotely, so there's really nothing keeping you there. But then again, moving is a hassle. Well, what if someone cade you 10 grand to do it? What if they threw in free office space, a bicycle, or a gym membership? Programs and cities and states around the US are doing exactly that, and they're getting a lot of interest. We've had over 50,000 applications. About 90,000 applications. We've had over 1800 applicants from all over North America. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them? Or are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns for places looking for an injection of fresh talent? Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world recalibrates. After decades of stagnation, Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation. For giants, policymakers, and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that. Every week on Japan ahead, right here on Bloomberg Television. When US jobs numbers are released, Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed and instant expert analysis. Nobody covers jobs day like Bloomberg. Only 90% of Shake Shack locations in the US are company operated. Around the world it's a different story. The business has grown internationally by working with licensed partners to operate restaurants. That's a trend they intend to keep going. Today we have Shake Shack since 16 countries, everywhere from China to Singapore to the Philippines to London and beyond. We see it as a huge, white space opportunity for us. Many restaurant brands struggle to move outside of their own core market in the United States. Perhaps it's something that's very New England and when they try to move outside of the New England area, guest reception is just not there. Or it's a West Coast brand that takes 50 years to bleed across the country. The thing about Shake Shack and the magic about it is this is a company that can sit here with only 200 restaurants in the US today, open up one in a Tier 2 city in China. And the guest reception for that restaurant is mind blowing. These are some of the largest open that we've ever had. We have big plans for our licensed business. It's a really asset light, cash accretive business for us. We love it. And we love it when our partners overseas make a ton of money because they're going to build more restaurants. We're going to all continue to grow. I mean, there's so many opportunities for us to add to our licensed business. And certainly, I get so many text messages from people traveling the world. If there is a Shake Shack there, guess which one this one is and if there's not one, why don't you have one here? The first Shake Shack in mainland China opened in 2019 and there are now more than 20. Although the government zero COVID policy is weighed on revenues, the company is committed to expanding its presence. One is a fascinating business for us. It's one of the most exciting and biggest opportunities Shake Shack has. Over the initial couple of years of the pandemic, they've faired much better than we did here and much better than most places around the world. Today, it has been erratic. It's been lockdowns. It's been closures. But here's what's amazing. The resiliency of the Chinese people, our team over there is unlike anything I've witnessed. It is one of the toughest places to do business in the world, but our brand seems to be really resonating with people over there right now. And I see it as one of the biggest areas of growth we have in Shake Shack. Restaurants haven't been resonating with Wall Street recently. The sector has underperformed the S&P 500 for much of 22, but the industry is historically resilient. Restaurants are undervalued right now. It's a person who has been following restaurants since I had...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3561,2022-10-16 15:54:32
15276," As a person who has been following restaurants since I had hair, I think restaurants are probably the most flexible and most creative of businesses that we have. The routine and the social engagement happens at restaurants and that's not changing just because we may or may not go into the recession. It just isn't going to change and so the restaurant stocks will rebound. This industry is the third largest employer, you know, all the population of workers in this country. This is like the fabric of the economy and the economy will rebound and restaurants stocks will blow up. If you want to trade in and out of Shake Shack, you know, you this may not be the time for you. If you are a believer in the brand of Shake Shack for the long term, like we are and have been, we're going to create tremendous value for our shareholders over time. We've done that. Shareholders should measure us on are we building things for the long term and for the long term, my sense is Shake Shack isn't me good bet. One of Shake Shack's long term assets is a bright new CFO. Katie Fogarty now has a year of experience under her belt. I wanted to know what she sees when she looks ahead. What's the opportunity for Shake Shack in the next 10 years that excites you the most? I have to say it is in watching our people grow and develop. I see a very strong growth roadmap here for the company in terms of units and sales potential. But what that really means at the end of the day is that our hourly team members are able to grow a career with us in a way that is unique to Shake Shack and cannot be found at many other restaurant brands. We have a number of people who start off as hourly team members and are now making six figures and have equity because they've grown up through the system and they're paying it forward by training other people to allow them to have such a great career path as well. What's the challenge over the next 10 years that keeps you up at night? It also goes with people. It has been a very challenging staffing environment for the restaurant industry as a whole. It's been well telegraphed that some people have just left the industry altogether. And so we know when we have high turnover we're not operating at our best. And so I do think that there's an amazing opportunity that once kind of the world stabilizes and returns back to normal that we have people considering the restaurant industry as more of an exciting long-term career. In terms of your role as CFO, how do you see that or your role with this company changing and developing over the next 10 years? I think that it becomes ever more important to have a great grasp on the insights that are driving the business, on the factors that are driving your business. And that's very important for CFO to do, but also to collaborate with other business leaders within the company to help kind of cross-pollinate strategies. Whatever I do in a vacuum is not going to be nearly as impactful as our entire executive leadership team coming together and acting on something. And I think that that is ever more apparent sitting on this side of the table than it was on the other side as a Wall Street analyst. Speaking of that, what skill or what area of knowledge do you think has helped you the most in your first year as CFO? I would say just a lot of grit. This has been a very challenging industry for sure. I never thought it was going to be easy and it's proved to be quite the learning opportunity. Coming in every day just excited to learn something new and make a difference wherever you can knowing that I'm sitting here with a team of people growing a company that will potentially have an impact on a number of people's lives going forward. So what advice would you give someone else then who maybe is watching and gets promoted to CFO? What advice would you give to a future CFO? What advice would I give to your future CFO? I guess I would just be get into the details. Super, super deep. And really kind of understand and ask a lot of questions. Peel the onion. I think a lot of people just don't go deep enough and don't ask the questions so that you actually cannot, you know, if you're not versed on what's going on, you can't find group cause and you can't drive change. So, you know, I would say get into the details, have an open mind. It's an incredibly fun job for sure. Working with people who are coming, you know, everybody's aligned here to drive the future of Shake Shack, but everybody comes at it from a different angle. So...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3562,2022-10-16 15:59:01

So it's very exciting to work with an amazing team of people. I'm Matt Miller. This is Bloomberg. So what happens is that we create some icons, we call them tags, and they have a signal within them. And when you stare at that, your eye responds to it in a particular way. The way in which that eye response occurs is a signal that we pick up on the visual cortex of the brain at the back of the brain. So the sensor is looking for the signals we create here that come through the eyeball, through the brain, and then onto the visual cortex. Once we've got it there as a signal, we can grab that. We understand what that signal looks like, and we can turn that into a command or whatever we're trying to control. There's multiple places where we think this technology could be applied, perhaps in driving or commanding, and ground vehicles or a man's naval vessels, perhaps providing a menu selection and control within a control room environment, maybe in a nuclear power station, and all those kinds of things are perhaps in the value of this technology. MUSIC No one covers the world like Bloomberg. The pressure cooker just got far too hot in Birmingham for the government to handle. You foresee two-thirds of the crypto-hatch funds will disappear. Are we close? The European Union will support and defend Ukraine's territorial integrity. With unmatched reach in resources, from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. I think the market that over the past few weeks has made it clear it wants to go higher. It got a little spooked by the idea that real political attention will rise. MUSIC It is crucially important, and I think we've moved from this attitude, from its indulgence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s, and so it makes that a really exciting field, because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harnessed to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart. It can spit back a lot of facts. But if you want to be wise, you really want wisdom. You've got to know when and how and why to use that information.

15278," This week, Special Interpreter Larry Summers of Harvard on the potential next shoe to drop economically. I doubt we've seen the last mine go off. Some of them may be in the private sector. I think more of them may be international. And former New Jersey Governor and EPA Administrator Christine Todd Whitman on a path forward on nuclear energy. Nuclear hermitage, a huge role, at least in the transition from fossil fuels to renewables. Global Wall Street spent the week trying to get its footing after things only got worse in Ukraine as Russian missiles rained down across the country. And NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg had to reassure us that things weren't about to go nuclear. Russia knows that the nuclear war cannot be won. And must never be fought. The IMF released its economic projections and its chief economist warned that a global recession just may be looming. What we see is that about a third of the global economy is going to be experiencing a contraction this year or next. And if that weren't enough, President Biden told CNN recession may come specifically to the United States. I don't think there will be a recession. If it is, it will be a very slight recession. And then the CPI numbers came in hotter than expected with the headline numbers still up at 8.2% and core accelerating to 6.6% year over year. It is not a good picture here. Those who were thinking that inflation might drop off fairly quickly are going to be disappointed by the numbers here. In the meantime, over in Great Britain, we had a week of financial turmoil with a very public battle between the Bank of England and Prime Minister Trust's government, which ended up with a new chancellor of the ex-checker and her giving up on more of her controversial budget. I want to be honest, this is difficult, but we will get through this storm and we will deliver the strong and sustained growth that can transform the prosperity of our country for generations to come. But the surprises weren't all bad this week, at least not for former Fed share Ben Bernanke, who was awakened to learn that he shares with two others the Nobel Prize for economics this year. It was completely unexpected. My wife and I shut off our cell phones when we went to bed last night not thinking about this issue. And it was our daughter in Chicago who was finally contacted and called us on the landline to inform us that this had happened. And the markets had just as hard a time as the rest of us finding its footing with the S&P swinging five points between big losses and big gains on Thursday alone after the CPI numbers came out. For the week, the S&P 500 was down 1.55%, the NASDAQ down over 3% and yield on the 10 year was up over 13 basis points to close the week just above 4%. To help us sort out a wild week in the markets, we welcome now Joe Anfini, partner in advisors, capital management and Lizans Anders, chief investment strategist at Chow Schwab. So welcome back both of you to Wall Street Week. Let me start with you, Lizan. What happened this week? I feel like we had hit by a Mac truck. So I think it was probably mostly technical, the reversal that we saw yesterday on an intraday basis in the first part of the day. You did see the swoon take the S&P to below 3517 and I'm not a technician, but that level was important because it was the 50% retracement of the post pandemic move higher. And that probably kicked in a combination of buying hedges being taken off some short covering and that fed on itself through the end of the day. Maybe you could point to the move down in yields yesterday, the move down in the dollar, but that could also help to explain today's weakness too because you saw reversals there. So Joe Anfini, a noise, I think it's fair to say in the equity markets there, but on Friday actually they gave up pretty much everything they got back on Thursday. So when you net net, when you get through it all, what did we learn this week that should affect the markets over the longer term? You know David, I think what we learned is that there's still a lot of risks out there facing the future of the global economy, not just here in the US. And those two.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3564,2022-10-16 16:07:36
15279," A lot of risks out there facing the future of the global economy, not just here in the US. And those two price reports we got, the PPI and the CPI, reinforce the view that inflation is going to be a really hard challenge for the Fed to solve. It also seems to have removed any wiggle room that people think the Fed has. They're really going to have to be adamant about raising rates, try to constrain liquidity, try to discourage consumer demand in order for inflation to get under control. There's not a lot of room for them to do anything but raise rates now for the next at least a couple of meetings. The market finally perhaps is digesting that. Let's say there's a lot of trouble. Sorry, go ahead, please. I think Joanne's absolutely right. And I think there have been these moments where it seems like whether it's in reaction to things going on in the UK that the market's almost cheering for or looking for some sort of financial system accident because of the messaging from the Fed, from Powell, that they're not going to step in because of financial market weakness across any of the asset markets or just volatility, but financial system instability, maybe what could bring the Fed back in. But even in a situation like that, what they may do is use the tool of their balance sheet or repo facilities versus doing a pivot anytime soon on rates. And I'm not sure that's been fully digested by the market yet. Yeah, there could be certainly more digesting to come. Particularly because the risks that are out there are really unusual. It's not just the inflation problem, right? The US has a labor shortage, born of the pandemic, born of early retirees, born of a lack of legal migration, immigration into the US. And that problem is not one that the Fed can solve. And so they still have very high consumer demand and a shortage of supply, no matter what the Fed does to try to curtail demand, there's going to be spillovers to also curtailing the recovery of supply from the pandemic. So they're sort of fighting this problem without having all the tools that are needed. And the risks that are out there haven't really abated in many ways. Although finally, we're starting to see earnings estimates come down and market expectations adjust to those risks. Lizanne, I wonder whether part of the problem we have right now is it's not all bad. There are parts of the economy that actually continue to be quite strong. It's sort of like we've gone from a unipolar to a multiple world. We've gone to a multiple economy, it feels like sometimes. We have. And I think that's what's particularly unique about the pandemic, the nature of it, how it unfolded is that we've been in this rolling cycle. So during the throes of the pandemic, when all the stimulus kicked in both on the monetary side and on the fiscal side, that stimulus and demand associated with it was forced to be funneled into the good side of the economy because of the absence of access to services. That became the breeding ground for the inflation with which we're still dealing. Then as you saw reopening, you saw that pent down demand on the good side. You saw pent up demand on the services side. That tends to be the stickier components of inflation. So even though we're seeing disinflation now on the good side, we've got it on the services side. So it's very different than your typical slow down downturn recession, whatever you want to term it, because at least the last two, the COVID recession, the global financial crisis, in essence, the bottom fell out all at once in the economy. This is happening in a unique way because it's sort of shifting through the economy and hitting pockets at different times. Well, and some areas of the economy are still expanding, even as some parts like PCs and smartphones where a lot was purchased during the years of the pandemic. Now those sales coming down, but look at auto production. That industry is still suffering from a lack of the chips needed to finish off cars, and they're putting cars in inventory waiting for that last chip to arrive, for example. And the semiconductor companies that supply them still have a very long runway of demand ahead of them. So there are parts of the economy that are still expanding while others are being hit by lower consumer demand from high inflation, from the change in sentiment from spending on goods to services. So that's why I think it's become very hard to say, well, what kind of a recession might we get? Is it going to be broad-based like recessions in the past? Or is it going to be more specific where lower middle and consumers suffering from the higher interest, suffering from inflation really curtail their spending like Walmart saw? Right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3565,2022-10-16 16:12:28
15280," lower middle and consumers suffering from the higher interest, suffering from inflation, really curtail their spending, like Walmart saw, right? Whereas the higher end retailers are doing fine so far. So it's a very challenging time to forecast where the US economy is going and how much unemployment might be created because of this constraint on liquidity from the rate increases. That means it's still possible to find potentially investments that do lead to growth over the, even the near term, as some of these industries continue to recover. And you know, Joanne, to your point about the upper end in better shape is what is by what the retailers are saying. There's also that potential pressure just on psychology because of the wealth effect, given that even though the excess savings story has merit up the income spectrum, they're also challenged by not just equity market losses, but bond market losses, real estate losses. So I think that's why I think we all have to be careful about extrapolating that excess savings up the income spectrum as a guaranteed feed into the consumption side of the economy. I think even there there might be some hesitancy. Joanne, last thought here, we all talk about, when is the market going to find them out? When is the bad news about them? When do we know we got it all out? We know how to deal with, we're build from here. Well, I think you almost never know that ever. I mean, think about the risk, the global economy is facing, it's not just the U.S. and inflation problems globally. We have the war in Ukraine, and there are some, maybe low probability, but very large risks, as opposed to with that. And then you have China, and they're continuing zero COVID policy, which seems to be having rolling disruptions to supply, which don't help our inflation problem. And now we have more of an economic war against China with the latest round of restrictions on exports of semiconductor equipment and high-level chips. And the real question there is, will there be retaliation from China in terms of restrictions against access to the Chinese market, which is still, you know, a hope to be one of the fastest growing markets in the world than now we might find that U.S. companies don't get access to that. So we shouldn't assume that the worst is in at this point, and we should expect that markets are going to continue to be volatile as some of those risks get realized or clarified. Jim Anfini and Liz Ansoners will be staying with us as we try to figure out what to do with our money in these turbulent times. Let's go ahead and back some Wall Street week. I'm Bloomberg. MUSIC We will never break, we will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never break, have the water rises and the mountains shake. All of us will remain. We will never, no, no. We will never, no. We will never break, we will never break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3566,2022-10-16 16:16:14
15281," Ooh. We will never break. We will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. Well, this was the week when Wall Street got much of what it had been asking for. And then decided quite characteristically that it didn't like it. The economy is simmering down as requested. Industrial production took its worst fall in more than a year. Business inventories are rising ominously. And the housing industries trade association said its members were virtually out of business. That, of course, was Louis Ruckus here on Wall Street. Back in 1981, believe it or not, 41 years ago now when all the markets wanted was a slowing economy. And the lower interest rates that they thought would come with that. The big move that week was a romantic comedy. You may not remember it with Bert Reynolds named paternity. And the number one song was Arthur's theme from that Dudley Moore film named Arthur. Now the problems are very different as interest rates are on the way up, not down. And the economy is still very robust by most measures. Still with us are Joe Anfini of Advisors, Capital Management and Liz Ann Saunders of Charles Schwab. So, Joe Anfini, let me come to you. The question is, what do we do with our money in this world? What does it make sense to invest with this much volatility, this much uncertainty? It's really been challenging time for investors. And it really depends what sort of time frame you have as an investor. If you're in retirement, what you probably need is some assurance that you're going to be able to get the cash flow you need off of your portfolio. And so one of the things we've done for our clients in that kind of a situation is to create portfolios with above average dividend yields on the one side. And now as bond yields are rising and we've kept our duration relatively short, we've been able to let bonds mature and then re-up at higher yields. So one area to go to is some relatively stable companies, whether it's General Mills or an ABV or some of the others in consumer staples and in energy that have dividend yields in the 4, 5, 6% range. And that way they can still get that income and they can ride out the volatility in the stock prices and wait this out. And that gives our clients a fair bit of comfort. But it hasn't been easy really for anybody, but that's one way to deal with the volatility. Lizanne, what do you recommend these days? Well, first of all, I absolutely agree with Joanne that there's no cookie cutter answer to a question like that. It really does depend on who the investor is, their risk tolerance, their past experience, their time horizon, whether they're financial risk tolerance and their emotional risk tolerance, whether there's a narrow gap between the two or a wide gap between the two. I think we're in a part of the market cycle right now where you want to actually focus on fundamentals. And I know that sounds right and sounds what we're always supposed to do. But gone are the days where you could look at segments of the market components of say big tech and look at it monolithically, make an assumption that they're all going to go up simultaneously. There's much more differentiation in the market right now. And I'd say look for where things are dear from a macro perspective. So we have declining earnings revisions in the aggregate. So look for the factor around positive earnings revisions, positive earnings surprise. We know we're in a rising interest rate environment. So companies with strong balance sheets, low debt, high cash flow, strong free cash flow. Low lower volatility is just kind of a quality wrapper. And I think that's the best type of approach in this environment. And then the last thing we've suggested for those investors who can do it. If you were a rebalance or based on the calendar, maybe instead of doing it once a year, once a quarter, let your portfolio and the volatility associated with dictate the timing of taking advantage of the volatility by adding into weakness, trimming and distrances relative to your overall strategic asset allocation. Joanne, what about the possibility of fixed income at this point? I mean, for a long time, you didn't want to be in bonds given what we're going to have bonds. But those yields have really come up. They're yielding something now and they do generate cash. It's sort of like dividends, right?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3567,2022-10-16 16:20:47
15282," I mean, for a long time, you didn't want to be in bonds, but those yields have really come up. They're yielding something now, and they do generate cash. It's sort of like dividends, right? Yeah, absolutely right. We're getting in the order of 6% in yields in our all investment grade fixed income solution. And when you pair that with, in a balanced strategy, with the equity front, you can generate a pretty nice cash flow for clients. And you're really careful about selecting credit quality, because credit spreads have widened here. So you want to be careful that you're not adding risk to the side of your portfolio that it's supposed to be sort of the suspenders on the pants, right? To provide more stability. And so that's one thing we've done in its help our clients. I feel a lot more comfortable in this kind of environment. Liz Anna, you did the point yet where you'd consider duration, that is going longer duration for the income. So my colleague, Kathy Jones, who's a regular guest on Bloomberg, she's our fixed income strategist. And in the sort of four-ish percent range, we have suggested you consider lengthening duration. But I agree with everything that Joanne said too. I think there are finally opportunities. We've gone from a teen environment. There is no alternative to Tia. There is an alternative. And there's income and fixed income again. And there are strategies, a little bit more active strategies that you can employ to take advantage of this move up in yields. Even well down the duration spectrum, you're actually generating a yield. If inflation ever came down, we might actually have positive really yields. We're not quite there yet, but I think we'll get there. Well, Liz Anna, I wanted to pick up. That was exactly the point I was going to make. Is the challenge is that inflation is so high that even if you're getting those appealing yields on fixed income, you're still losing purchasing power. And so that's why we continue to counsel if the client has appropriate risk tolerances and time horizon. The equity side can help you offset the cost of inflation. For example, one of the stocks in one of these portfolios is McDonald's. Now, what you want is to find a company like that that has good cash flow that can continue to pay its dividend. But more importantly, even, can raise its dividend year after year. And they just announced this week a 10% increase in their dividend. So you're being compensated, more than compensated, for that cost of inflation eroding the purchasing power of your money. And that's something that you're more likely to get on the equity side than you are on the fixed income side. Lizanne, we're spending so much time on rates and on growth and for that matter, geopolitics and things like Ukraine. What are our earnings? We are in earnings season now. We had the first four banks come out this week of their earnings, which actually were pretty reassuring to a lot of people. Is there a possibility that could help the investor right now to the upside? It's possible. I think the rub, though, is that even if we end reporting season with some sort of positive beat rate, we have to recognize that estimates have been coming down since the April May period of time, both for the second half of 2022 and the first half of 2023. So it has been a lowered bar and much like the second quarter, we're still early, but expectations are that energy pretty much is all the earnings growth. So consensus right now, once the quarter is all said and done a month from now or so, you'll have 3% overall less than $1,000. 3% overall, S&P earnings growth, be exclude energy that goes down to minus 3%. And that's, if that's the case, that would be worse than the second quarter. And I think the path of least resistance for estimates is still down. I'd also say really important to watch and listen in earnings season, not just for, did you beat your numbers or your profit margins, what your profit margin outlook, if you're a multinational company, the impact of the incredibly strong dollar, whether you're hedging it or not, the impact of inflation, whether you have a lot of fixed costs or variable costs, what your labor costs are. So I think it's a lot of the details under the surface that are matter as much as just the top line reading. Joanna, are you taking account earnings right now in your investment decisions? What are you anticipating? Well, you know, estimates have come down a lot, you know, as Liz Ann was saying. The real question I think around this earnings season is going to be guidance. And given the uncertainty and the real risks that are out there, I think companies are going to be extremely cautious. And I think investors expect that. It's really kind of a waiting game. We don't know if, when, how large a recession will be, how broad it will be. So we're going, investors are going to look to companies to get some clues about that. The companies that are out there on the ground, whether it's a Texas Instruments providing chips to the auto industry, you know,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3568,2022-10-16 16:25:26
15283," So we're going, investors are going to look to companies to get some clues about that. The companies that are out there on the ground, whether it's a Texas Instruments providing chips to the auto industry, you know, or a company providing chips to Apple. And that guidance, I think, investors are going to learn from. And I don't think they're going to hope for too much. I think we're expecting not very strong guidance for the fourth quarter. Think a lot of companies are going to defer and say we're going to be more cautious. We're going to cut some costs we're preparing for things to slow down. And that doesn't necessarily mean you have to change your investment allocations though. Because if you're in it, not for the next six months, but you're in it for a couple of years, three years, five years, right now we have a lot of stocks that have become relatively inexpensive. So a little hope out there, at least. Thank you so much to Joe Anfini and Liz Nansan. It's great to have you with us. Coming up, we're going to take a look at what's happening next week on Global Wall Street. This next Wall Street week on Bloomberg. This is Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston.

Following the party congress, the PBOC sets its one year rate on Monday. Bloomberg economics expects it to remain unchanged. Tuesday we'll see a data blitz with third quarter GDP likely to show only a week recovery and September activity highlighting consumption, weakness and the important role public investment is playing in propping up the overall recovery. Elsewhere, Bank in Indonesia is likely to hike by 50 basis points and Australia will probably report moderate jobs growth for September. Now over to Guy Johnson in London. Guy. The UK will remain the centre of attention both in Europe and globally. Monday, the big question, will the guilt market be able to cope without the recent support provided by the Bank of England or will Governor Bailey be forced to step back in? We've got guilt auctions peppered throughout the week. Wednesday, we get inflation data, we also get housing data and then on Friday we get retail sales plus we've got S&P and Moody's both updating their UK credit rating. We've got earnings also throughout the week. Food giants to know the Nestle are reporting Tuesday on Wednesday. Wednesday, we also see the chip equipment maker ASMR reporting numbers pay attention to that one and then on Thursday we get ABB Volvo and L'Oreal.

We'll talk about the challenges and the opportunities with Christine Todd Whitman, former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. This is Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. Every Friday with 30 minutes dedicated to fixed income, I'm Jonathan Farrow this is with the book Real Yield. Hydrogen has a very special place in the universe. It's the first element on the periodic table. It is the most abandoned element in the universe. And when clean energy advocates think about what can we find which would be as easy to use as fossil fuels they think about hydrogen. The fuel that will, when burned, only produce water. We like to imagine that if we just built enough of these and these, we could ditch fossil fuels and save the planet. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. There are some things we just need a good old-fashioned combustible fuel. Now startups around the world are betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century. Innovation, money and power collide in Silicon Valley and beyond. Bloomberg Technology with Emily Chang. Weekdays at 5 p.m. in New York and 2 p.m. in San Francisco. Net Zero emissions. It's a lofty goal but times are wasting. Just as John Kerry, President Biden's special climate envoy. Many companies are making promises to be net zero by 2050. But the reality is unless you do enough between now and 2030, you can't hit net zero 2050. And if we're really going to get there, Bill Gates says the math makes a pretty compelling case for nuclear power. You get a million times much energy per reaction as you do burning hydrocarbons. And so it's very advantaged if you do the design right.

15285," It's very advantaged if you do the design right. Nuclear physicist and former energy secretary Ernest Moniz says it won't get done without a public private partnership. I think what we need to see is governments moving together with the financial sector and with the equipment providers to get new power plants over the finish line. But partnership or not convincing the public about safety may remain an issue given high profile accidents like Fukushima Japan in 2011 when an earthquake led to a disaster at the plant causing tens of thousands of evacuations. All the nuclear power plants in this country, they operate really on this precipice of normal routine operation on one side and catastrophic accident on the other. And it's unclear exactly when you'll fall to one side or the other, but it's certainly possible. So the question is what will it take, how safe it can be, and how soon can we get there? Even for some who initially opposed the idea, but now embrace it. Given this challenge we face today and given the progress of fourth generation nuclear, go for it. And to give us some answer to these, this is very important questions we turn out to Christine Todd Whitman. She is president of Whitman Strategies. She is of course the former governor of the state of New Jersey and the former administrator of the EPA. So welcome to Wall Street Week. Really good to have you with this governor. You've dealt with nuclear energy for years now. So give us your sense of the role of nuclear energy potentially in getting to net zero. Well, I think nuclear can play a huge role at least in the transition from fossil fuels to renewables. Renewables are not yet based energy. They're peak shaving and we're a 24-7 society as is the rest of the world. The world is 24-7. And nuclear is the only form of base power that releases no regulated pollutants or greenhouse gases while it's producing power. And we have an incredible safety record here in this country on nuclear. And actually with few obviously very huge exceptions being Chernobyl and what happened in Fukushima, Daishi, overall worldwide. It's been saving getting safer all the time. I mean the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission is considered the gold standard on regulatory oversight of nuclear reactors. I don't think given costs and time that we're going to see any more large reactors built in this country certainly. They are being built in China. They're being built around the world. And we can certainly play a part in developing the parts for those reactors. But I see the future for nuclear right now being in the small modular reactors. Well let's get to that and I'm going to first of all give us a sense of the scope of it already. One of the things that I have learned is nuclear is actually one of the few things that really don't have emissions that can be taken to scale. I think something like 20% of energy in the United States is generated by 70% in France. Right. And you know you saw an example of what happens when you take nuclear offline when California took the Senate off-free nuclear reactor offline. Their emissions went up and the cost of their energy went up. I mean it was totally counter to everything that they were hoping to achieve in my mind. And so what I found over time is that if you have an opportunity to talk to people and answer their very real questions. I mean it's normal to have questions about the safety and you should ask them. But the answers are really good and they're based on our history. You can prove that in fact these things work. And once you do that with people they get much more comfortable with the idea of nuclear. It's just for so long. It's been used as frankly a fundraiser a lot in a lot of times for the environmental groups. And we need to get the public to understand particularly with the new small modular reactors that are built in a contained facility. They can be placed on site. They're much safer technology. They are much safer way to produce the nuclear energy. So overall they are really I believe have the potential to make a huge difference. Particularly if you think about the rural parts of America where you're not on the grid or you're not close to the grid. You can take a small modular reactor and provide power for an entire town or an entire business. So they have a lot of potential there. So let's pursue that question of safety because that is on a lot of people's minds.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3571,2022-10-16 16:37:58
15286," for an entire town or an entire business. So they have a lot of potential there. So let's first do that question of safety, because that is on a lot of people's minds without a doubt. And as you've mentioned, we've had some horrific instances. Is the issue with safety that people don't realize that actually the track record is quite good for nuclear? Or is it technological development, such as you're referring to small module reactors? No, I think it's because people just don't know. They don't understand. I mean, I get a lot of questions I used to in the past about, well, what about the spent rods? And first of all, I tell them from all that, when the time when we had 102 nuclear reactors in this country, and you took all those spent rods and you put them in one place, you'd fill up one footfall field to the height of the goalposts. They might have gotten slightly above that now, because this was data from several years ago. But the point being, it's not this massive thing, this size of the state of Vermont, that people kind of have in their minds. And the other thing is that what's in those spent rods is 97 to 90% fishable material, meaning unused energy. And in France and Japan, they figured out how to reprocess that and to get the energy out of those rods, rendering that what you have is the, quote unquote, bad stuff to down to 15%. Let's say, and it can't be used in a nuclear weapon. So it's much easier to store, much less to store. You have a lot of unused power just sitting there in these spent rods. And we should be using that technology as well. And people have to understand, and when you explain it to them, you can't take one of these rods from a nuclear reactor and put it in a missile. It's not the same technology. It won't work that way. And the other thing that explained to them because one of the most immediate issues that we had in this country was through my island. And when that went down, the operators in the utility itself, in the reactor itself, were never exposed to high levels of radiation. And they've been tracked ever since. And there were no releases into the community. And even those who were right there in the reactor had no adverse reaction to what happened. And in fact, it was because they overrode the system, really, that you had the partial meltdown, Fukushima Daiishi. That wasn't because of the earthquake. It was because of the tsunami. And that was because they had their backup power, their generator, located physically in the reactor building. After 9.11, our nuclear regulatory commission said to our nuclear industry, you got to move those out. They cannot be co-located with the reactor itself. So that kind of thing can't happen here anymore. Just this week, we saw an announcement of a deal to acquire Westinghouse Electric. Basically, on the premise, in effect, we're going to have more nuclear energy. Do you anticipate at that in the United States? Well, I certainly hope we do. But it was not even 10 years ago. I guess there were two or four proposed reactors, two in Georgia and two in South Carolina. And we were very hopeful what those were going to come in on budget and on time. And they both ran over. And the utilities decided, in each case, that it just wasn't worth going forward. So it is a question of cost and regulatory hurdles. But you want to have those regulations in place, because that's what protects the community and make sure that things are safe and streamline how you approach them. So that you make them go through all the hoops they have to for safety, but to put it to the front of the line to get this power online. The big problem we have, though, when you talk about all of this, is the grid itself. It's old. It needs to be revamped. It can't handle a lot of new power coming in. And that's one of the big challenges that seems to get overlooked a lot when we're talking about these issues. Again, you go back to small modular reactors, which can actually function on their own. What about the grid? Are we investing in the grid? We have the bipartisan infrastructure bill. We also have the so-called inflation reduction act, which had money in there as well. Is there money in there for the grid? Is it enough? There is money in there for the grid, whether it's enough or not. I doubt it. Hopefully the money that's there will be spent in a way that ensures that nothing is wasted because we need every penny of it. Certainly every penny that's in there is needed to get the grid updated and to where it needs to be in order to accept the new-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3572,2022-10-16 16:42:47
15287," ensures that nothing is wasted because we need every penny of it. Certainly every penny that's in there is needed to get the grid updated and to where it needs to be in order to accept the new power, whether it's from nuclear or renewables. I mean, they're going to depend on that as well. Okay, Governor, thank you so very much for being with us. Really appreciate this former Governor Christine Todd with and now with Whitman's strategy. My pleasure. Coming up, we wrap up the week with our special contributed Larry Summers of Harvard. Let's next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total US greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71% building to crowds America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels. We want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of US greenhouse gas emissions. Welcome to the world of decentralized finance. Bloomberg's covering all things crypto. The people, the transactions and the technology. Bloomberg crypto Tuesdays. This is Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. Welcome. Once again, our very special contributor to Wall Street Week is Larry Summers of Harvard. So Larry, we got the CPI numbers in that we'd waited for this week. And boy, they came in how to expect it. It's been doing this repeatedly now. What do you read in these numbers? Not so much hotter than I expected. Inflations got a lot of momentum. The best single measure to look at for inflation is a kind of super core measure, which is wages, where you can look at the median component of inflation. They've just been running strong for a long time and not decelerating. So I think Team Transitory is engaged in a lot of wishful thinking. And I must say that I'm struck by the hypocrisy of some friends of mine like Paul Kroegman, who are very quick now to focus on housing and the fact that the private indices lead the public indices when the private indices are looking soft, but we're entirely unwilling to credit that argument or to pay attention to the private indices some months ago when the private indices were obviously pointing to an acceleration of inflation. So I think we've got to be very, very careful here if we want to be credible about containing inflation. How much momentum is built into inflation? How can you tell? What are you looking at right now that tell you what happens in the fourth quarter and as we go into next year?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3573,2022-10-16 16:46:11
15288," First momentum is built into inflation. How can you tell? What are you looking at right now that are telling you what happens in the fourth quarter and as we go into next year? I'm looking at core measures. I'm looking at super core measures that take housing out, take use cars out in addition to taking food and energy out. I'm looking at the so-called median inflation component. Whatever product it is that's right in the middle. I'm looking at the so-called trimmed mean that looks at the middle half of the distribution of product prices. And very crucially for me, I'm looking at wages which is a kind of super core measure because labor goes into everything. And all of those are saying that inflation's not really coming down very fast if it's coming down at all and that it's way above the 2% target or any acceptable level. And besides the CPI numbers, Larry, a very big story throughout the week has been and continues to be great Britain where you had the Bank of England come in with their emergency buying of long-term guilt that is due to expire on Friday the end of this week. Same time we now have Liz Truss coming out and making some changes. Give us your take on what's going on in the British economy and more importantly the management of the British economy. Look, I think this is probably gonna be a textbook case of crisis creation followed by crisis mismanagement. I'd be surprised if we were in the 7th inning of this particular set of challenges. I have said before that people now I think understand very clearly that when you do a military intervention you should never give a sunset date when you're gonna leave because it just emboldens the opposition. And I think something similar is true of last resort finance where the kind of deadline the Bank of England gave I think is asking for trouble down the road. So I think we're gonna see more tremors, more aftershocks, more problems. At the same time I think we need to recognize that as serious as the British policy errors were this might well not have happened if global economic conditions were more normal. And the kind of accesses we've had in the system mean we're in very complicated territory. Well exactly Larry, I guess I'm asking to say we have global, slow down, IMMF this week came out and said we're looking at a global slow down at the same time we have central banks and development countries really all raising rates at the same time. What is the likelihood we're gonna see similar? It won't be the same but similar sorts of problems elsewhere particularly when it comes to very highly leveraged places and places that are more difficult to see some of the private credit some of the non bank banks. I doubt we've seen the last mine go off. Some of them may be in the private sector. I think more of them may be international. You know something that disappointed me at the IMMF World Bank meetings this week was the number of countries who were reporting that they're having substantial difficulty in getting market access. And I must say I'm sort of disappointed by official sector people, people from the ministries of finance and the central banks who are talking about how we're gonna work with the private sector to catalyze trillions of dollars of finance for green transitions in all these countries. But don't seem to be doing anything about the fact that many of these countries can't even issue a bond today. So I think there's a whole set of very important challenges with respect to developing countries and emerging markets. And I'd have to say that I don't feel those challenges were really met this week. There's some fires burning and fire department is still mostly in the station.

15289," As we speak to you, you are in Washington for those IMF World Bank meetings and the IIF as a practical matter. You were very outspoken in a project syndicate piece also actually speaking with David Maltes, they had the World Bank about the role of the World Bank right now on things like sustainability. What is going on there is the World Bank playing the role it should be playing and what should it be doing? No, I think it is playing its usual roles in its usual way and I think generally the economic crisis of the moment demands major changes in approach just as the security crisis in Ukraine demanded major changes in approach and we're not really quite seeing it yet. The World Bank needs to be much more aggressive in the use of its balance sheet and it also needs to get much more capital and instead of having a fight about which of those two things is more important, we need to do both of them because the one mistake we're certain not to make is over investing in the green transition. And so we need to make sure we're doing everything we can to support that transition. So if there is a lack there Larry often that like comes for a lack of leadership do we not have the leadership we need either from the United States Treasury, the White House or for that matter at the World Bank? I mean would you ever consider taking over that role? I think that we do need leadership that points towards larger changes in business as usual than we're seeing in the financial area. And I think there's some mistakes being made right now at a very very difficult moment in Africa, at a very very difficult moment in Latin America, at a very very difficult moment in parts of Asia. Larry one piece of news which was actually really hit the markets but has not gotten too much attention is what the United States did with respect to semiconductors and China. The chips market really went down substantially it took a lot of the tech with it at a time of so much difficulty globally and what are the possible effects of those sorts of trade actions? You know the kind of large-style cutoff on cooperation and semiconductors that the Biden administration announced. I don't think it's possible to pass an overall judgment on that without understanding the security risks that they saw which depend on classified information which those of us on the outside don't have. But this was a highly consequential increase in economic aggressiveness. This is different than a trade fight over a specific product or a specific trade practice. This was a pretty across the board effort in something that's very very difficult to challenge China's ability to grow and to develop technology. And so I think it's going to have some far reaching implications. Larry finally we did have the announcement of three of your fellow economists receiving jointly Nobel Prize for economics this week. Tell us about what you took away from that award. Look I think it was the analytical recognition of something that practical people had known for a long time which is that banks and finance are different. And it's that they're subject to confidence crises that are kind of apart from the fundamentals of what's going on. And that you got to be very mindful in public policy to maintain confidence in financial intermediation in a way that's a bit different than you have to with respect to manufacturing companies or airlines or something else.

Okay, thank you so much to Larry Summers. Our very special contributor here at Wall Street Week. Coming up, you can't always get what you want, no matter how much you're willing to pay for it. That's next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. However you get your news, this is Bloomberg Deb Rackford Lake. Welcome to Deb Rack Australia. This is Bloomberg Technology. Welcome to Bloomberg Crypto.

They say the one with the most toys wins and let's face it, toys usually cost money. And the bigger the toy, the more money it costs. Take for example Jeff Bezos knew yacht, the largest sailing yacht in the world at 417 feet and costing upwards of $500 million. Or Elon Musk agreeing to plunk down $44 billion for the prize of owning Twitter. Something most people think is worth a lot less than the price tag. That is if he ends up paying it. There's two options here. One, the deal falls apart and the stock that has been artificially inflated is going to crash. Or if things go the way Twitter wants, then they get the guy in charge who for the last three months has been saying that Twitter has been lying about its user base. But what happens when you spare no expense? Go all in, put all your chips on the table and don't win your dream prize. Consider the case of Hillary Clinton's campaign spending $1.4 billion on the 2016 presidential race. Substantially more than Donald Trump's $960 million and coming up short. This is not exactly the speech at the Capitol. I hoped to be giving after the election. More poor Columbia pictures, which in 1987 decided to make Ishtar, figuring anything with Dustin Hoffman and Warren Bady just couldn't fail. But for some reason, a movie about two lounge singers involved in a coup in the made up country of Ishtar didn't quite land with the audiences. Columbia lost around $40 million on the deal, almost $100 million adjusted for inflation today, and the dud established Ishtar as the synonym for box office flop. Is this the oasis? Does this look like an oasis? Yeah, look at the birds. Are those vultures? And now we can add Steve Cohen to the list of those who went big and lost. The hugely successful hedge fund manager paid around $2.5 billion to buy the New York Macs. And this year took it to number one, at least in player salaries. But sad to say for fans of the Amazons, number one in payroll doesn't mean number one on the diamond. The team won.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3576,2022-10-16 16:59:28
15291," Number one, at least in player salaries. But sad to say for fans of the Amazons, number one in payroll doesn't mean number one on the diamond. The team lost the third game of the Wildcard playoff by a score of six to nothing. It was executing pitches and the wheels fell off. I don't know why. We just couldn't figure out a way to get some runs, some off that's going. Leaving Mr. Cohen to spend the winter going back to first base. And thinking hard about whether that $278 million in player salaries just maybe wasn't enough. They're going to get to this great point and they have all this momentum behind them and then they then they blow it. That's the match. That's metzing. That does it for this episode of Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. This is Bloomberg. See you next week. So what's the best investment advice you've ever been given by anybody? The compound interest. The compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance, and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day. And if you keep at it and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's not just interest. It was always said about compound interest returns. Compound business returns. Compound human returns. They're all very additive because you'll learn every day. And if you keep at it, it's very, very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make? Selling it the wrong time. And they sell when the prices go down? Yes. Or not keeping. But people have conviction if they invest for the right reasons, they'll just keep at it. Today is the most significant day in the history of the NGWA. The last day on planet Earth in the United States of America in college athletics where name, image, and likeness laws will not be on the books. And kids will be not allowed to make money off of their name, image, and likeness. Today's the last day that amateurism has at least a shadow meaning in our culture. Major ruling from the Supreme Court involving again. The most seismic change in college sports happened in 2021. And its aftershocks are still ricocheting across the landscape. Non-Pro athletes getting paid for use of their name, image, and likeness. Until last year banned by the NCAA, is now allowed. And it's changing the face of sports and business radically. According to OpenEndors, brand spent almost $1 billion in the first year of the new rules. And that number is only going to grow. But some of the biggest winners, they may surprise you. The top female athletes are caching in, and women's basketball players are standing center stage. Your heels, you want your heels to go down.

15292," Top female athletes are cashing in and women's basketball players are standing center stage. Your heels you want your heels to go down. You took a pre-ride poop. And I always really is pretty surreal. I don't think I really wrap my head around the concept that I am making money just doing the thing that I love. Starting her sophomore year, Aisy Fudds already signed deals with Chipotle, American Eagle and others, earning tens of thousands of dollars leveraging her on-court prowess and off-court social media following. She's also getting massive investment from the pro game as well, becoming one of the first athletes to sign with Steph Curry's SC30 Inc. The two even designed to shoot together. One Steph Curry would wear during his 2021 NBA Finals MVP performance. It's an investment directly into a future player, but also the future of women's basketball. And especially for the women's game, NIL deals may not only benefit the students, but the pro game as well. But I'm gonna call Carly knows everything. Hey, hi Carly. I have my TV mounted on the wall in my room, and I'm wondering if I'm moving back into the same room? Can I just take the TV off and leave the mouse? Kind of all the little things that I said I have too much of. Um, Aisy Fud can almost trick you into thinking she's just a regular college student. You can't judge me by what you see here today. We just finished our summer session, so I'm about to move out. I gotta completely move out to remove in the exact same apartment. It's starting to stress me out. I gotta carry this back. Who's gonna help you move all the bait stuff now? Oh, well, you see, I leave tomorrow. So I will be probably playing it all nighter, but not if my mom is watching this. I will be going to sleep early and getting my rest. Don't let Aisy Dorm room and procrastination fool you, though. It's very clear, very quick, that there is nothing ordinary about her. Fud was the class of 2021's number one consensus recruit while she was playing for St. John's College High School out of DC. Now she's playing for one of the most storied and winning programs in any sport in history, the University of Connecticut Huskies. The National Championship goes to Connecticut for the fourth year in a row, as the dynasty fulfills its destiny. Winners of 11 national championships, producers of Olympians, and multiple WNBA MPs. But Aisy has something that the trailblazing women of UConn's past never had. The opportunity to not only play basketball, but get paid for it. I remember just learning that you could profit off of your name and brand. And like, I could profit off of Aisy, the Bachelot player, not just Aisy, the person, which I didn't really understand why you couldn't, because at least for me, like, Aisy, the Bachelot player is also Aisy, the person, like, basketball is such a huge role in my life that I didn't understand why I wouldn't be able to profit from it. It's a board not understand exactly what made this all possible. In 2021, after decades of debate, lawsuits, and legislation, the NCAA prompted by a unanimous ruling by the Supreme Court, finally relented on one of its longest standing strictures, that athletes could not in any way be compensated beyond scholarships and small stipends from their schools. It would only take a few months before Aisy, a freshman at the time, would sign her first major deal, which a Pope like. Before the freshman even got to play a game for the Huskies, she aches her first NIL deal as a college athlete ambassador for the magnificent Mexican restaurant chain. You are on the leading edge of something that feels, for those of us who've been looking at sports for a long time, like a very meaningful moment in sports. It's like the economics are changing, the role of sports in society is changing. We see that from the outside. You're inside it. You're, does it feel momentous to you? You can tell, like, how important it is, but at the same time, like, this is all I know and-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3578,2022-10-16 17:08:36
15293," You see that from the outside, you're inside it. Yeah, does it feel momentous to you? You can tell how important it is, but at the same time, this is all I know in college, Basil, as NIL. So I'm still trying to find my way in it, find my groove and stuff. But I know how important it is, and the people before me paved the way and set that path for me to be able to do this and how important it is for me to be able to take advantage of this and be able to continue this on for that piece of power. To come. While colleges and universities still can't directly come and save their athletes, those athletes can legally be paid by third parties who want to use their name, image and likeness, or NIL. AZ, advised closely by a team led by her parents and her agents, has created a portfolio anchored by relationships with Chipotle, American Eagle, sports drink, bio steel, and SC30. Brands, she already admired as the successful athlete and American teenager. I've been lucky that the deals that I've been approached with have been things that have been really good and things that I've liked. American Eagle is one of my favorite brands. I always wear their jeans. So it's one of the easiest transitions type things. Bio steel was something that I hadn't really tried before and once I did, I really liked it. [âª music playing in background, music playing in background, on the basketball side, it's impossible to be on Yukon's campus and not feel the weight of history, especially when you see where the team works out. Officially called the Worth Family Yukon Basketball Champion Center, it's a 78,200 square foot complex that costs $40 million. It's most striking feature. It's split right down the middle between men's and women's basketball. Seemingly identical when you walk in, except while the men's team boasts four national championships, the women's side has more than double that. And that actually understates their dominance. The team has gone undefeated in six seasons and its players have been staples on the US Olympic team. Suburred and Diana Tarrassi are only the latest in the line of superstars to begin in the early 1990s with Rebecca Lobo. The Huskies have featured 12 AP national players of the year, including Lobo, Maya Moore, twice, Rihanna Stewart, three times, and most recently Paige Becker's, will get to her in a minute. OK, so you're moving in on me quick. Just stradzing me with your fancy hands. I'm going to deal with your night because it's really bothering me. My night? Yeah. He's a troublemaker. Yeah.

15294," Technology, welcome to Bloomberg crypto. Banners are, I mean, they're overwhelming for me. I mean, you know, and I'm not, you know, standing in your shoes. What do you take from that personally? I think it can be seen for sure as like overwhelming kind of pressure to live up to those standards. But I use it kind of as motivation. This is our UConn program. Like there's no need to compare ourselves to the past. Like we're not those players that we see on the wall. We're different players. Like I'm A.C. I'm not super. We need to forge our own path and our own story and viewcon books. Global goes to work in the land and a beautiful. Those former UConn stars helped to establish the UConn team as a product to watch. Over the last decade, meteorites moved from Connecticut public television to S&Y and now include Fox Sports. With game coverage mixed with behind-the-scenes documentaries, UConn has become one of the biggest platforms for women's basketball. UConn women's team is so well known that at the moment it's arguably a better platform than most if not all of the professional women's teams or even the WNBA overall. Well, I don't think there's any greater female sports collegiate brand than UConn women's basketball. It's on TV. You can follow those athletes. In a way that if you compare it to the WNBA, you don't always get consistency of coverage, local or international markets. You're not always able to follow those athletes. This is Angela Regiro. She's a former hockey player and four-time Olympian. She now runs Sports Innovation Lab. That's a Boston-based company that uses data science to help teams and leagues understand their fans and figure out how to better engage them. The future of sports really is how do you optimize and drive revenue in these digital spaces, these digital communities? So collegiate athletes are going to really benefit from the change in the NIO ecosystem because they're authentically themselves. They're using these platforms already and they're being entertainers. I'm not sure how to work this. I think it's recording. Fans of women's sports and female athletes want more authenticity. These fans are dying. For not just the game and the stats and the scores, they want to know what you're doing 24-7. They want to know what these female athletes think. What are they wearing? What are they dating? What do they care about? What are their causes? And that's going to build a wave of support when those athletes graduate that they'll hopefully bring to those WMBA teams. I think that this is really an incredible opportunity for me and all of women's basketball to be able to benefit and it's sad knowing that this is kind of our most profitable age. So I think that that's also an important part of being able to use NIO now before going pro. But dance videos and homemade tostinos ads can only take that mission so far. Aze knows that success on the court comes first and will allow everything else to follow. And while Yukon has had a storied history, their last championship was way back in 2016. Lucky for her, she's playing with not only just a good friend and dance partner, but the best college player in the country, Paige Becker's. Paige Bucket's Becker's is also one of the biggest college students when it comes to NIO deals. Striking the first NCAA athlete deal with Gatorade as well as partnerships with StockX and CashApp. And she has been estimated to potentially bring in a million dollars in NIO deals. We do a lot of team activities for some horse riding. Yes, this is my first one involving a live animal. During the last week of official summer workouts, Azee Paige and their teammates finished their last session and went over to Yukon's horse barn for some team bonding. Have an extra large. Right, so when you're working with a horse, you want to try to stay calm and relax. You're going to make him anxious. I'm sorry. The typical day in stores can pick it. So we don't play basketball.

15295," It's what we do when we don't play basketball. Peasants. So well. It was a light moment before everyone went off to hang with their families and get rested up for the season. A few weeks later, beckers would have announced that her 22-23 season was over before it even started. You conwomen's basketball junior guard Paige Beckers suffered a torn ACL in her left knee and will miss the 2022-23 season. It's an injury Azee knows all too well, having gone through her own ACL tear in 2019. While Paige's absence will test the team's depth and metal, what was on display in stores and apparent in conversations with Azee was that she and Beckers were intent on using their increasingly higher profiles, not just to benefit themselves, but their entire team. Bra paint. Now you didn't. Wow, it's so sweet. I'm so excited. In Azee's case, that means free to vote like. Thank you. Both Azean Page are conscious of the inequality that still exists in NIL. While the players in this room share the benefit of playing at Yukon, not all can or will get the deals Azean Page have already signed. Soft worthy of person, sci-cater. People outside of your world of actually doing it speculate about the consequences and maybe some of the unintended consequences of NIL you think, well, you know, the really prominent players like you, we're going to benefit and then other players are not. And so maybe there's some jealousy or envy or whatever. How do you make sure that it doesn't? We were very tight. We're a super close group. I mean, you've been to stores or not, there's not much else to do besides play basketball and hang out with each other. And I think it also is because that whatever deals we get, like, you share with each other. So I have a deal with Chipotle and my whole team. Whenever they watch Chipotle, they let me know or American Eagle they can get whatever they want. I think it goes both ways with whatever deals. Other people have that we're super open, always willing to share. I think I'm posting an answer around about this. This would be the last team meal for Azee before going on summer break. And when we next caught up with her, it would be about as far from a dorm room in stores that you could possibly get. Azee's out in LA this week to do a commercial shoot for a new underarmer shoot alongside both Steph and Seth Curry. Along with her is her family, including her former coaches and current business screens, her mom and dad. We make sure that one of us is at everything that she does just to give her that support. So I've been at a lot of them still blows my mind like, okay, well, you look really cute in that outfit, but it just doesn't like really, I don't know, sink in that that she's this public figure for lack of a better word. The partnership with Curry is both historic and important well beyond the deal itself. Azee was the first woman and the first college athlete to join the SC30 brand and has developed a friendship with Curry. She fully concedes to initially being a bit star-straight.

So before you invent pioneer, disrupt, before you change the world, Bloomberg. It's kind of crazy. I mean, I try to keep my cool when I'm working out with him and then like with Seth and stuff on set, but in my head, I'm going a little bit crazy. Yeah. I first met him at Curry camp right after my freshman year in high school. I got invited. I was one of the first two girls invited to camp and then I was invited the next year as well. And then Curry ran me to my agent, my group and they let me know and I was all for it. I'm working out with someone that I look up to and someone that inspires me. So getting to see firsthand like him in action, like what he does behind the scene. Like I get to challenge myself and compete a little bit with him. It's amazing. Shooting ads for unreleased at peril isn't something cameras were welcome into, but Azeus also in LA for basketball, getting private workouts with Steph Curry's own trainer, Carl Bergstrom. Azeus also been a part of Curry camps, including this past summer in San Francisco. She also helped design a shoe for the SC 30 line, the Curry himself war in an NBA finals game this past season. The 2022 Bill Russell NBA finals MVP award goes to Steph in Curry. Did you know that on average women have 30% less income for retirement? The IA was one of the first brands where I kind of got to use my platform to speak out about title 9 and retirement equality. I think that's definitely something that I still want to continue to do, but that was big for me because I'm still trying to figure out what I stand for and what I support and things I want to be able to support. She's got to formulate her own understanding and opinion about life. We all have our own perspectives and that's what makes us all unique. We all have our own opinions and experiences. I'm just proud that she found the level of comfort to be able to speak on something that she had no idea exists. I didn't know existed in retirement inequality women were tied with 30% less income and retirement than men. I didn't know that was a thing and I think from being a girl dad having her come along has awakened my senses to things that my wife has experienced as a player that I've seen firsthand being a girl's basketball coach that the girls endure. It's been pretty pretty tremendous honestly. And as a fellow girl dad, Curry's involvement with an equality campaign was notable, but not surprising for AZ, who said she was drawn to his brand as much for his off the court persona as his championship pedigree. He is a very big family man. You can see that with his kids with his wife. And I'm huge with my family. I do everything with them. They're with me here on this trip. So I think the family aspect was huge and just kind of his personality. He welcomed me in right away. Even when I was at camp he made me feel part of that group and special. Just being here like I feel like I'm really part of this brand, part of this team, part of the Curry family and I could be more grateful. Kobe Bryant forever, of course, remember does an NBA legend and rightfully so, but it's a father of four daughters. Curry's also filled a void that AZ and others thought might be left empty after Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gigi died tragically in a helicopter crash in 2020. Bryant had been arguably the biggest advocate in the world for the women's game and without him it was unclear who would carry that torch. That was kind of a big question when Kobe died. It was like who was going to step up and continue to help fight for women's basketball and help kind of raise the game. And I think Steph is doing a really good job of like trying and inviting women to his KM and little things like that that are helping elevate the women's game. And like this deal is incredible being not just the first like NIL the own college athlete but also the first female sign to his brand. I don't even really know what word to use to describe that feeling when I first signed it and being here now like it means so much. AZ's connection to it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3582,2022-10-16 17:25:46
15297," This brand, I don't even really know what word to use to describe that feeling when I first signed it and being here now like it means so much. AZ's connection to and reliance on her own family was on full display in LA. She'd come to the West Coast with her mom, dad, and two younger brothers and her success as a burgeoning business provides some fun perks. On trips like this, I love just watching my parents reaction because they've been in the game. They've always played in college and they've played professionally so seeing their reaction to kind of where I am, it's just really funny. I mean like my dad loves being around all these NBA players, my mom loves seeing all these high level workouts and so seeing like them happy, it's really fun. AZ's parents both played Division 1 basketball in college and coached her throughout her youth which she credits made her the way she is. Even if sometimes it's not so easy to grow up with two coaches for parents. Part of the reason that I am the way I am is because they didn't really compliment much so I always had something to work on, I was always working hard. I think they did a very good job obviously. I'm playing really bad, I would hear about that but they did a really good job of separating mom and dad from coach. Like I remember when I was younger, my dad would take me off to get ice cream and stuff after games. That was something when we started coaching then we were very cognizant of not having that coach role carry over. I harbor things a little more so sometimes they'd go get ice cream and I'd be like, yeah she's soft, why are you getting ice cream? That doesn't mean ice cream but then he really likes ice cream too so. When I started the coach I definitely did not want to have that contentious relationship at all and so the ice cream thing became a reminder to me. It's a treat to like now I get to go back and be dad. Katie Fudd played at NC State and then Georgetown in the late 1990s as women's basketball was starting to gain a bit of traction and the WNBA was in its form of div years. She had to deal with inequalities that she never wanted her daughter to face. When it came time for AZ to pick a school her mom had a big influence. When AZ was getting recruited I felt very strongly about what is the culture. When I was at Georgetown it was kind of a men's basketball program and not really much else. It's evolved since then but in our practice time was limited on the court based on when the men practiced or you know it was just it was just all based around the men. So there's a lot of schools that she was looking at where they they had some storied men's programs but how do the players interact? How does you know what's the culture on the campus like? Let's make sure that we're doing the right thing by by both the men's and the women's program. AZ's parents were able to go from being her coaches to fans in the stands but now have evolved into her advisory board on her branding deals. I think we spent the better part of the pandemic on seminars and YouTube and listening talk I probably have a four-year degree and have a cell phone NIL just because you're just making sure we understood it as well as we could to help her but also connecting with the right people. I think the fact that we have such a great relationship with her she trusts us implicitly like we're not going to put her in a situation that one she doesn't support the company or doesn't you know it too much authentic stuff and then we're not going to put her in a situation that just isn't isn't good for her. As the new season starts AZ's NIL deals existing and new will be in the background. Expectations are always high at Yukon and even more attention will be on her given Becker's injury. While new NIL opportunities grab headlines and attention AZ has a clear focus on what to have. How do you raise your NIL game? How do you grow it in a way that's authentically amazing? I think now that I have my first year kind of under my belt I have established my brand with all these other people but I think I need to be able to kind of like establish my own brand more like the AZ brand and like post about myself more as well but I think just knowing that what your priorities are that my priorities right now are basketball and school because without good grades will be able to play them without basketball I wouldn't have these opportunities in these deals.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3583,2022-10-16 17:30:09

What do Formula 1 cars and your local supermarket have in common? Well, strange as it sounds, they might both be using the same technology. A lot of innovation has trickle down from the world of high tech engines and it hasn't just found a new life in road cars. F1 cars have long been thought of as the peak of cool and technology in them is also helping to pull down our produce aisles. Engineers from Williams are using their knowledge from nine constructors championships working with company Aerofoil to help reduce the energy consumption of supermarkets. The device they're building is based on the design of an F1 cars rear wing. It attaches to fridges to keep more cool air in the unit. They estimate it can reduce supermarket energy consumption by 25%. Even innovation from F1 is also helping hybrids reduce their carbon footprint. That's curves or the kinetic energy recovery system. In common parlance, it's known as regenerative braking and works by storing energy of the car decelerating in a battery for later use. If that's not enough, F1 is now looking at curves or a thermal energy recovery system looking to harness the heat produced from braking and the engine exhaust that could allow cars to generate the same power using 30% less fuel. So while F1 may have a reputation as a gas guzzler, some of its innovations in the name of speed are helping in the everyday fight against climate change. Imagine simply climbing a cable into space. The concept is known as the space elevator. But only could it significantly change how we leave planet earth, but it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space. And there are scientists who think we could have already built it. We have the material, we have the technology, we have the lasers, we have the climbers, we have all of it. If a private entity wants to build it or a government, they can build it. It'll change society. We have no clue how colonizing in the space, how really spreading on the space, really change our society over the next 50 to 200 years. It'll be completely different. Before the COVID pandemic upended the way the world does business, logistics was one of those industries that might have been taken for granted. That's not the case anymore. Due to all the turbulence over the last two years, customers are now realizing how important it is to have a reliable logistics partner on their side. Our people are doing a quite complex job. People think, oh they just deliver parts of somewhere, that's an easy thing. The thing about what I want people to do is quite complex. Businesses and consumers are suddenly thinking a lot more about how things they need reach places where they're needed. It's thrust the sector into the spotlight. Logistics and supply chain has become a household need. It's dramatically different than pre-pandemic. Yes, it's grown, whether that's in market power, revenue, profitability, investor interest. The Deutsche Post DHL Group, that's created opportunity to build on momentum and set ambitious goals for service and performance. When you look at our footprint, you're the most international logistics company there is. We want to become more digital and we want to be much more sustainable than we have been.

15299," 2020 with full-year profit nearly doubling in 2021. CFO Melanie Christ is a key leader of the team that's delivered these results. And she views her role as much more than just a number cruncher. There are unfortunately these clichÃ©s that finance is boring and it's kind of like been counting in the back office to be successful in finance. I mean, you have to have the financial expertise, right? But we also have to be credible business leaders in order to really impact the business and steer the direction. She is extremely smart and bright. You need somebody who is able to digest a lot of information that rapidly and can distinguish what is important and what is less important. And she has tremendous skill in that. And she's not afraid to call people out, to call out other members of the executive team if she feels that something isn't being. She does that in a very nice way, actually. She helps me tremendously in steering the company because she is highly regarded by my other colleagues in the senior team. And typically if they have a problem, they share at first with her before they come to me. When I think about the conversations I have with Frank, the shortest part is actually about the analysis and the facts. It's more the debate about, okay, on that basis, what are the options? What can we do? My role is essentially saying in three sentences, what is working well in this company, where do we have challenges and what should we do going forward? Do you post DHL Group consists of five divisions, express, Germany's post and parcel service, global forwarding and freight, supply chain and e-commerce solutions. Each of these segments has seen revenue growth in the last four years, while the surge of e-commerce volume during the pandemic has had a direct impact on the trajectory. Have you seen e-commerce as a very structural and fundamental growth driver for us as a company? What we now saw under the pandemic was a structural acceleration. It took us forward to a point in terms of e-compennetration, which we probably would have reached on the normal circumstances in three years' time. So it was a big step forward. DP DHL was well prepared to take this step. The company's strategic plan recognized e-commerce as a growing trend in the logistics landscape, but no one could have forecast the speed and breadth of the transformation. We are now seeing that also another pandemic, not only domestic e-commerce has taken a faster growth trajectories and anticipated, but also cross-border e-commerce. We see that very clearly in our express network, but also in our e-commerce solutions division. What are the other big structural shifts that you see on the horizon? Is it e-commerce B2B? Is it increased trade as globalisation restructures? What are the shifts that you're seeing? The B2B e-commerce is still at a very early stage, so we believe that there will be a huge close opportunity there. We also see that when we are talking to our customers now. I guess everybody has been aware that being dependent on just one supplier in one province in one country is probably not a good idea. So they want to build more resilience into the supply chain. I think our international footprint, our global strengths, is really something we can leverage for the benefit of our customers. Another factor in the company's favour is its balance sheet. Since Melanie Christ became CFO, Cashflow has improved significantly. One of my priorities over the last years has been to really focus the whole organisation on better cash generation. It's not just a finance job, making sure that ultimately revenue converts into EBIT and into cash in the bank account is the responsibility of the whole organisation. She says we can't be successful as a company if we are not collecting the cash for our services we have provided. She has not missed one single opportunity to talk about that. I think it's a very comfortable situation, particularly in the current environment, to have a strong balance sheet. I think in that respect, I'm very conservative and I'd rather have a bit more on the balance sheet and a bit more buffer. Spell out for us what the priorities are, the longer-term priority.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3585,2022-10-16 17:38:35
15300," strong balance sheet. I think in that respect, I'm very conservative and I'd rather have a bit more on the balance sheet and a bit more buffer. Spell out for us what the priorities are, the longer-term priorities in terms of putting some of that cash to use for you. The first priority here is organic growth. We clearly indicated also this our CAPEX budget, 12 billion for the next three years, that we will keep investing into organic growth. We are very focused on our regular dividend payment. And then, if there is something left, which is fortunately the case at the moment, we will think about inorganic opportunities and we will also think about other means to allow our shareholders to participate. That is why we are currently running a 2 billion euro share by VEC program. Inorganic opportunities include M&A, like the recent purchase of beverage shipper, Hila Brand. But deploying cash is always subject to careful consideration. Does Melanie ever turn around and say no when you're pushing through or pushing for a particular package of spending? Yes, she does that quite often, because she has... She is a person and that's great if you have a CEO who is risk-abuse because you need somebody. The business is always too optimistic. Melanie might be something too pessimistic, but that's a very healthy discussion. If we then jointly come to the same conclusion after a debate, then we are probably in the right spot. How often do you find yourself saying no to divisional heads? When I was promoted into the CFO position, my team gave me a stamp with rejected. It sits on my desk. I think the fact that people know it sits there already has instilled quite a lot of discipline in the organization. So I think when I get a proposal, it has already gone through a number of iterations and is normally of such a high quality that I don't need the rejected stamp too often. For the time being, Christ should be able to keep that stamp in a drawer. CEO Frank Appell has expressed a commitment to service quality and confidence that customers will accept higher prices that come with it. If you are too expensive, you will be out of business, but if you don't provide the right quality, you will be out of business as well. So we want to be. We will never be the cheapest in town. That's not doable. We are the premium provider. That's our strategy. Of course, it's also more challenging for us when our customers are under pressure. At the same time, I think, over all the last two years have shown that a reliable high quality supply chain comes at a certain price tag. I definitely see that inflation is having a huge impact on the logistics industry. And there's been substantial price increases in the last few years. I do not see that changing. There's a lot of innovation happening. And I don't see the inflation necessarily going away. It might level out a bit, but it's not going to go away. The logistics companies may have pricing power with customers, but their stock prices haven't been so robust. I think that the issue there is the increase in interest rates has made everyone rethink and be concerned about the level of inventory that is out in the system, if you will, and with the level of disruption. I think what's happened more in the last three months is the more of a view that we're actually heading into. Certainly, any coming slow down may be a recession. With more than half its revenue coming from Europe, investors may see DBDHL as more exposed to recession risks than its global peers. Company insists it can meet its revenue targets in the event of a downturn. It's counting on diversification as a cushion. I'm not so pessimistic that there is really a deep recession at our doorstep. But even then, our portfolio is very much balanced. We are everywhere in the world. The world will not go entirely in recession. I doubt that. Would it be a stretch to suggest that DBDHL is, to some extent, recession proof? I wouldn't go as far as to say recession proof, but I think we are very well positioned to deal with all different types of recession scenarios due to the breadth of support for you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3586,2022-10-16 17:42:58
15301," I have to say recession proof, but I think we are very well positioned to deal with all different types of recession scenarios due to the breadth of support for you. The balance of support for you really gives us a lot of resilience against any type of headwind. Coming up, a look at DP DHL's investments in action. Melanie Christ shows me around the company's state of the art and logistics art. What's up about this building is it actually shows the big mega trends which formed our strategy 2025. This is Bloomberg. As the chief financial officer of one of the world's largest logistics companies, Melanie Christ has made her mark in global business. That's not what she originally attended to do. I really wanted to go into research, I wanted to become a physicist and that was where my passion was. But then during my studies, some friends of mine started doing this strange thing. They went into management consulting. I didn't even know how to spell it and I had no idea what it was about. But what they told me was quite interesting. And so I ended up doing an internship with a consulting firm. And I learned more in the two months there than I had in the last two years in my physics job at university. That is how I ended up in consulting. She started her career with three years at McKinsey, then spent four years in private equity with APAC's partners in London before joining Deutsche Post DHL Group in 2004. I was brought into the company to do international M&A project. That was at the time around 20 years ago when we were really building the company in the current shape, acquiring lots of logistics companies around the world. The M&A part was the first thing and I then wandered into a more mainstream finance field here in the group becoming the CFO of our DHL Express Division. So from then on it was more leading towards the CFO role eventually. Malenny Christ now heads the finance team with around 11,000 employees. Success in this role is as much an art as a science. If you do the greatest piece of analysis and you see it all and you know it all, but you can't convey that message and you can't convince the rest of the organization that we should move into a certain direction, it's useless. DP DHL is sending a consistent message with its investments. The company spent 123 million euros to upgrade its logistics centre at the Clone Bon Airport, designing it around key strategic goals. What I love about this building is it actually shows the big mega trends which formed our strategy 2025, which was inaugurated in 2019 when this building opened. So globalisation connecting the world. E-commerce, we have a lot of sortation facilities here for smaller e-commerce shipments. Sustainability, it's a very sustainable building, there's solar panels on the roof and everything and digitalisation and well you can obviously see that it is quite automated. How did the team pitch this investment to you initially and how hard was it as a sell for them? How quickly did you turn around and say yes, this is worth 123 million euros. Of course you always have to make sure that you have the right capacity for the growth in the network. And at that time they came and said hey, we will really see a strong growth in e-commerce volumes on top of the regular B2B growth. We need more sorting capacity, we need this building. And of course there are always debates, does it really have to cost 123 million euros and so on. Unfortunately they convinced us because then with COVID and the volume search we urgently needed the capacity. At the same time as COVID accelerated demand for logistics services, disruptions in the labour supply hurt.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3587,2022-10-16 17:47:08
15302," Church, we urgently need a little capacity. At the same time as Covid accelerated demand for logistic services, disruptions in the labour supply hurt productivity. Advances and technology like this digital sauter have helped offset some pressures, but automation also raises questions. Does this tell us that there's the business grows? This is going to become a more automated business, but there's going to be less need for labour for workers. Well, you still see people here, and I think what you can nicely witness here is the combination of technology which supports people. So for example, when you look at the customs area, it used to be a very manual and sometimes confusing process. Now the people are supported in picking the right shipments for customs inspections by light and they are automatically sorted in this sauter to go to customs inspections. So it is also helping the people with the jobs they're doing every day. We obviously sat in 2019-20. You know, we might get one-third less jobs in the current setup until 2030 if we digitalise the organisation, but we are very sure that our company will be at least 50, maybe 100% bigger and we will have more jobs to offer than that. At the beginning of a couple of years ago when we started that journey, people said, oh, you know, I might lose my job. I haven't heard that in the last two years as a question in any tone hall. This airport hub also showcases DP DHL's aviation fleet which boasts more than 320 dedicated cargo aircraft. The biggest chunk of our aircraft, but we also have short and medium and long term leases and visit close in our business, we anticipate that the people keep going. You've talked about investing, of course, in sustainable fuel. Yes. When does that come online? How significant is it? Is it just the critics might say that's just window dressing around a part of the business that is, of course, very carbon intensive? At least a lot of emissions. Yes. So you absolutely write the problem with our beautiful aircraft is the CO2 emissions. And when you look at our overall CO2 emissions, two-thirds are from aviation. It is about flying these birds with more sustainable fuel and we said that we're really willing to spend billions on it. We now really hope that we will see the uptick in supply over the next years. Spending billions isn't vague hyperbole. The company has pledged to put seven billion euros towards sustainable technologies and fuels by 2030 with a goal of climate neutral logistics by 2050. Sustainability makes good business sense anyway, especially if you are in a business that is energy or fuel hungry as a compliance element that not just operators in the logistics sector need to consider, but also their customers. So being transparent becomes part of the service about their impact on the globe. We had a lengthy discussion. Should we make a financial commitment? How much we want to invest for the next decade in our sustainability? We had a long debate. Is it right to say we want to invest seven billion to 2030? There were pros and cons. But that was a very intense discussion melody in I-Hart where we finally came to the conclusion that this is the right number. This is the right approach. We convinced our colleague and that's the reason why we are where we are, where we are seen as somebody who really commit. They're not meant many companies who have quantified their future investment. Still ahead, how one of the business world's most influential women is working to strengthen gender equality within her company. I think the great thing is that now across the board in finance, but also in the group overall, we have role models which show young female talent that everything is possible. This is Bloomberg. We make it very transparent to the shopper before they accept an order. What the order is going to look like. How much we're going to pay them and how much the consumer is paying them. And so they can decide whether they take an order or whether they refuse it. And that's a kind of flexibility that our shoppers really do. They're going to be able to make a lot of money. They're going to be able to make a lot of money. They're going to be able to make a lot of money. They're going to be able to make a lot of money. This is really...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3588,2022-10-16 17:51:47

That's our shoppers really value and the kind of transparency that they want. Are you seeing a labor shortage right now? And what are you doing to come back at? It's different in different places. Our demographic of shoppers is completely different from food delivery and our right sharing. We're 70% women and half of them are moms. And that's because a lot of the job at Instacart is very different and just being in a car with strangers. It's about like going to the store, doing a good job of customer service of really picking the right products for the consumer. And we are seeing that being very appealing to women. You will shed light on dark matter. You will make aging optional. You will turn 5G up to 11. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge, and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer, disrupt. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. Japan ahead right here on Bloomberg Television. Deutsche Post DHL Group CFO Melanie Christ is often named to lists of the most powerful women in business. And while men still outnumber women as finance heads of large companies, there are signs that the balance is shifting. The number of female CFOs across major US companies has risen to an all-time high, according to a study by Chris Colder Associates. And executive search firm Cohen Partners reports that 36% of new CFOs hired by notable companies in the first half of 2022 were women. I ask Melanie Christ if she's encountered obstacles as a woman rising through the executive ranks. I have to say, I have not made many negative experiences. Maybe I was also a little bit in the even-not-thinking about these challenges so much. So when I studied physics, there weren't many women, so I was somehow always used to it. And it can also be an advantage when you're the only girl in the room. I mean, the boss at the end remembers your name and not the 19 guys who all kind of wear dark suits and white shirts and look alike. So I never experienced it as an external stress factor. I have to say for me personally, it was more balancing my own expectations around kind of like getting family and the job combined. But that was probably more of a pressure I put on myself, thinking that I had to be perfect in every dimension and not something where the pressure was put on me from my male colleagues. So how do you take that experience and put it to play in terms of how you advance the role of women in this organization? I think the great thing is that now across the board, in finance, but also in the group overall, we have role models which show young female talent that everything is possible. In finance, we have a share of women in management of 32%. So we are head of the group. We want to get to 35% by 2025. I think we are now at a position where if you have a vacancy, I want to have at least one woman on the short list. Because we have enough female talent. So every short list should contain a woman and then the best person in the race should win. CEO Frank Appell says Christ sets an example for the entire organization. And he believes her success may influence the entire industry. She has proven that she is an outstanding CEO.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3589,2022-10-16 17:55:47
15304," on pool for the entire organization. And he believes her success may influence the entire industry. She has proven that she is an outstanding CEO for all. And she's definitely a role model in many dimensions that you know, what I like about there, she is still you know, a very warm and nice person. And that makes such a big difference. So you can get to that level without compromising on how nice you are as a person. I think she's a great role model. And the whole that this has had positive impact for many of us. From the big picture down to the smallest operational details, Melanie Christ is fully engaged in guiding DPDHL into the future. I wanted to know what she sees when she looks ahead. What do you see as the biggest opportunities for DPDHL over the next 10 years? I think we have a fantastic portfolio. And we just have to leverage the growth opportunities which are there both on the ECOM site and also on the traditional B2B site. And the key differentiators for us will be digitalisation, sustainability, and our great people. As you look ahead 10 years, what are some of the challenges? What keeps you up at night as you think about the business going forward? I think we have to keep this focus and the ability to adjust in a very agile way. Sometimes when you kind of like think about all the risk controlling and stuff, people tend to create the impression that you can preplan everything. That's clearly not the case. So I think we have to stay focused and keep the ability to react in a very agile way. But looking at what happened over the last 24 months, I'm very optimistic that we will also be able to cope with whatever happens next. And how do you see your role changing in the years ahead? I think it is changing at a very rapid pace, which is a great thing because it never gets boring. Those elements I just mentioned for the group overall, digitalisation and sustainability are also hugely relevant for the finance role. It's like a new language you have to learn. And you learn the vocabulary, but then you also have to develop a feeling if I kind of like put so much capital into this decarbonisation measure I get so much in terms of return out of it. But that's a fascinating opportunity where we can make a huge difference for finance and for the group overall. As you look to the future Melanie, what do you think is going to be the skill sets, the knowledge bases, they're going to be essential to the success of future CFOs? Yes, probably the two most essential new skills will be to get even better at lifelong learning because we will have to learn so much new stuff every year. Be it in the digitalisation area, be it on sustainability. So this ability also has a 50-year plus-old person to keep learning and keep the curiosity. I think that is going to be super essential and the second element will be being a great team player. The world is complex, you can't know it all. So you really have to work even more strongly with your team. What advice would you give to someone who's just recently been appointed CFO? That's a great question. I think I would probably simply say, be curious and ask as many questions as you can. Try to learn as much as possible, not only in the finance area, but get close to the business, try to really understand the business because only when you are close to the business and you understand the fundamental profit drivers will you be a really great CFO. I'm Tom McKenzie. This is Bloomberg. At some point you had to fight for the trademark for the Red Soul. Is that stressful? Very stressful. Very stressful. Especially, you know, we are a small company in a way and we have to fight people who have those huge companies who put you 27 lawyers on your back for something which is yours. It's very stressful. I wish it didn't happen. Everything which happened to me is a lesson in a way bad or good. Once it's done, it's done and you're sort of happy. I'm happy about it. That thing I could have definitely avoided. But it's done. Did you realize at the time when you started the company that you would become so successful?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3590,2022-10-16 18:00:27

Did you realize at the time when you started the company that you would become so successful? I'm actually so big. No, no. You know, when I started the company, I wanted to have a shop in Paris, which is my hometown. And I wanted to do pretty shoes for pretty girls. That was my goal. Now you look back and you say, actually, I still make pretty shoes, but for many more women. Yeah, absolutely. Do you think you would have been so successful without the Red Soul? I think the Red Soul definitely, of course, participates to my work, but also to the fame of my shoes because it's instantly recognizable. But then, you know, the design is very important. But definitely, when you have such a strong sign of recognition, it participates to... Yeah. Back in 1997, I was interested in the following question, which is, there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called Sorapod dinosaurs, which had really long skinny necks. So Apodosaurus is an example. Now, it was at really long skinny tails. So I made a computer model that showed that, in fact, the tail of these Sorapod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip, a bullfip. Now, the way a bullfip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. And that crack is a sonic boom. I think the way they got a date was to impress the females by making loud booms. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. The pressure cooker just got far too hot in Birmingham for the government to handle. You foresee two-thirds of the crypto hedge funds will disappear. Are we close? The European Union will support and defend Ukraine's territorial integrity. With unmatched reach and resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks, 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. Let's just be honest. We've had sort of a shift in, are we in some sort of circulation fears? No, man, people were talking about that all day yesterday. This is my kitchen table and also my filing system. Over much of the past three decades, I've been an investor. The highest calling of man time I've often thought was private equity. And then I started interviewing. While I watch your interview, I know how to do some interviews. I've learned in doing my interviews how leaders make it to the top. I asked him how much he wanted. He said 250. I said fine. It didn't negotiate with him. I did no due diligence. I have something I'd like to sell. And how they stay there. You don't feel inadequate now because being on the second wealthiest man, the world is that right? In recent decades, one of the most important figures in Wall Street has been John Mack. He led Morgan Stanley for many years and led it through the financial crisis of 2007-2008. John rose from modest circumstance in North Carolina to become a dominant figure in Wall Street for quite some time. I sat down with John recently to discuss his life story and also what he sees as the future of Wall Street. So you spent more than 50 years on Wall Street and probably the most difficult time was during this 2007-2008 recession where Morgan Stanley came close to going under. Was that the most difficult time of your career? No question about it. I mean, we were on the brink of going out of business. And you thought you had a good cash reserve for a while, but then all of a sudden people started pulling cash out. Your cash reserves went down. How close did you come to actually going bankrupt? Well, we were very close, David, to the point that Tim Geithner at the Fed was trying to get us to sell to Jamie Diamond at the time. And he kept saying, that's what I want you to do. So I call Jamie.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3591,2022-10-16 18:04:51
15306," He said, I don't want your firm. I said, we'll go tell Geithner that. And he said, John, if he forced me to do it, I wouldn't pay you $2 a share. So that made it easy on me. I was not going to listen to them. And as a result, we called our board in and we're thinking we're going to go out of business. At one point, you're on a phone call with Ben Bernacki, the chairman of the Fed, Hank Paulson, Secretary of Treasury, and Tim Geithner, the head of the New York Fed. And they say you should file for bankruptcy. And you slammed the phone down on them. Was that easy to do? For me, it was easy to do. I mean, thank God I left out some four letter words. I said, I'll take the firm down first and I hung up on them. Okay. I can't tell you why I did it because I'm my gut. It was the wrong thing to do. So now, after your retirement, you decided to write a book, which is a very good book. I've read a post and all in about your life story. So how hard is it to sit down and write about your life and go through the good and the bad things that take you along with a long time to do this? And do you ever say, why did I agree to do this? No. No, I enjoy sitting down and working with the person who works for me on the book. Look, I have a lot of memories and a lot of things that I did that in talking with him, it came up of other things that I had done. So I enjoyed it. It was, I got along really well with my writer and Linda Coleman was just terrific. And we had fun doing it. So I enjoyed doing the book. So at the end of the book, you say something that I found to be surprising. You talked about the fact that you've recently been diagnosed with some cognitive impairment, which you say could lead to Alzheimer's. And why did you put that in the book? You didn't need to put that in. No, I didn't. Christian, I talked about it. And she said, look, John, you're always up front with people. You're writing this book, tell people the truth, tell them you're having some issues. So we talked about it and I agreed it's the right thing to do. I mean, I didn't put it in there for sympathy. I didn't put it in there for, you know, come over and give me a hug. I just think my personality has been up front. I tell people what's going on. I did that when I ran Morgan Stanley. I did it at Credit Suisse, even though Swiss didn't like me very much for doing it. I did it at Credit Suisse. That's who I am. I'm up front. I tell people what's going on. Look, it happens. You say that maybe you thought it came from your football injuries or maybe you fell off an ATV. Right. But in hindsight, is it more of a genetic kind of thing do you think or the doctors don't really know? Well, the doctors don't know it's genetic. I mean, my mother did have Alzheimer's. I just think you need information. Look, I hope my cognitive skills last a long time, but life's life and just live it. And I don't think trying to hide things. You know, if you are, if you and I didn't know each other like we know each other, we are out in the dinner, I don't want you to say, John, you just told me that three minutes ago, I want to put a little warning out there, you know, give me a break. I may repeat myself. And I cover myself by saying I may have already told you this. Now, Christie is your wife of more than 50 years as well? 49 years of 49 years. 49 years of November. Okay. So, where did you meet her? I met her through Charlie Rose. So Charlie Rose and I were at Duke University. He was a couple of years ahead of me. And he had moved to New York and I was in New York working at Smith Barney at the time. And he called me up and said, you know, my wife's sister is coming up. We'd like you to take her out. I thought about it a little bit and got a date for Friday night and called him back and said, okay, we'll go out Saturday night. And I got to their apartment on 96th Street. Mary was a beautiful woman and Christie walked in. She took my breath away. Not only beautiful, but had a great smile. She was very warm, very friendly. If it wasn't love at first sight, it was pretty close. Let's talk about your background. So you grew up in North Carolina, but your grandfather immigrated from Lebanon, is that right? But why did he go to the North Carolina? That was her big Lebanese community there.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3592,2022-10-16 18:09:33
15307," Background so you grew up in North Carolina but your grandfather immigrated from Lebanon is I like but why did he go to North Carolina was there a big Lebanese community there or did he intend to go to another place? There was a big Lebanese community in South Carolina and he was going to go to Marion South Carolina when he got off Ellis Island and he ended up in Marion, North Carolina. He stayed the night in the train depot no one came to pick him up so finally the conductors said get on the pull him on the train and took him to Charlotte, North Carolina on that train and there was a Arabic family around a coffee shop at the train station and they talked about the mix up they gave him a job he started washing dishes then it became a peddler then he went back and got the rest of his family and they had made enough money to get a wagon and they went in the countryside selling cloth you know sewing materials, shoes stuff like that and then that evolved into John Mackinson's John Mack was my grandfather's name and it was a clothing department store and my father who was an entrepreneur decided he wanted to be totally on his own and he started wholesale grocery business and so they wanted you to go in that business at some point I don't think my father did my mother was a very strong force she only wanted to be a doctor and I really didn't want to be a doctor my father was laid back and my mother was really aggressive it was a great combination so you were a high school football star well about a star but I was a good football player you were all state that's pretty good all right all state you've done your homework okay so all states so you get a scholarship to Duke University to play football and what happened to your career at Duke well I thought it was a good football player to I got to Duke they have some great players and then in my sophomore year I was a red shirt for one year then I was on like the second team but I broke C6 in my neck I cracked it and what happened every time I would tackle someone my left arm inside would go dead so Frank Bassett who's one of the orthopedic surgeons who used to be at Duke call the AD and said this young man's football career is over he has a bona fide injury he cannot play football any longer so that ended my football career but once you're on scholarship I still had to work there so I was a manager you know getting towels and setting up trips when I go play you know one of the teams in Florida one of the teams in the big team so when you graduated did you say I want to go to Wall Street and be the CEO of Morgan Stanley now when I graduated I need one course to finish Duke University my scholarship had expired so I got a job in a local brokerage firm called First Securities in North Carolina so that got me involved in the securities business and there was a lady there named Fanny Mitchell and maybe you remember she ran the job placement office at Duke University so when the recruiters would come down she would say there's one guy you got to meet it's John Mack and I would meet these recruiters and got a number of job offers and then I decided that I like the securities business Smith Barney wanted to open an office at that time in Atlanta they all for me a job and I took it big expensive cities have a lot going for them but if you live in one you've probably noticed that these big expensive cities keep getting more well expensive you could always move away you might have just started working remotely so there's really nothing keeping you there but then again moving is a hassle well what if someone paid you 10 grand to do it what if they threw in free office space a bicycle or a gym membership programs and cities and states around the US are doing exactly that and they're getting a lot of interest we've had over 50,000 applications about 90,000 applications you had over 1800 applicants from all over North America so are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them or are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns for places looking for an injection of fresh talent",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3593,2022-10-16 18:13:14
15308," Or are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them? Or are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns for places looking for an injection of fresh talent? She went to Smith-Barnie. What did you do there? Were you like a registered investment? Exactly. I mean stockbroker. We started out in a trained class and I got my brokerage license and then I was approached by the head of the municipal bond division. Why don't you come into the bond business? And I really didn't want to go down to open an office in Atlanta or down in Florida. So I took that job. So I got into bond business and I was a trader on the bond desk and the municipal. And then at some point that led Smith-Barnie of getting into the corporate bond market and I transitioned over to corporate bonds. And then from there they told me they would put me on commission which they never did. And I got approached by a small boutique firm called Smithers, which was really known for their bond acumen and their bond business. So I went over and became a salesman doing corporate securities, corporate bonds, at Smithers and Coffin. I've often thought to be a good trader. You have to be pretty quick in your head with numbers to make sure you get the numbers right. Is that true? No, that is true. But I think as a salesman, much more so than a trader, that business is a commodity business without relationships. So if you can build a relationship with your clients where they trust you and they go to you when they have business to do, that's how you become successful. Hey, so how did Morgan Stanley hear of you and say you should join what was then considered a white shoe firm? Probably hadn't hired a lot of Lebanese back traders before, right? That's a good story. So I met with Dick Fisher who was running that initiative to build a secondary bond business. And we went back and forth and I said, I'm flattered that you would all do your job. But I don't believe a Lebanese heritage from North Carolina who went to Duke University has a chance at making it Morgan Stanley. And he said, well, you're wrong. And if you think you come over here and you're right when you quit our resign, I'm telling you you're wrong. This is a meritocracy and you should join us. It convinced me. So in those days Morgan Stanley was a private partnership, not a public company. And it was a company that basically underwrote, let's say AT&T bonds, but it didn't actually go out and sell them. It was price them and other people would sell them. So Morgan Stanley said, we're now going to change that and you became a trader for Morgan Stanley. I became a salesman at Morgan Stanley. That's what they need. So you did that for a while and then at some point people give you more authority and you get to be in management. Did you want to be in management or do you like to be a trader or salesman? I like success. So I thought the right way to go is managing being a manager and that's what I wanted to do. Whether there's a lot of disagreement if I were any good and not very good. I liked it and I thought I was pretty good at it. So you rose up and you ultimately are offered the position of being the CEO of Morgan Stanley? Well, yeah, eventually. But there were a lot of blocks along the way to do that. But then all of a sudden you decided you needed to do a merger with Dean Witter. Right. And why did you need to do that? Dean Witter was owned by Sears and they had decided to spin it off. And Morgan Stanley got the order from Sears to do this transaction to raise money in an equity transaction. So when we met with Phil Purcell and talked about all their salesman, their branch offices, it became apparent to me and also to Dick Fisher. That this is the way to really build the franchise because distribution is going to be more and more important.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3594,2022-10-16 18:17:40
15309," A parent to me and also to Dick Fisher, that this is the way to really build the franchise, because distribution is going to be more and more important and to have a connection with retail clients would be important. And that's how we made the decision. There was push back in the firm, but with Parker Gilbert and Dick Fisher's leadership, we were able to convince the partners. This is the right thing to do and we did it. Here firm was a leading Wall Street firm. You could argue Dean Witter was a so-called Main Street firm and putting the two together had never been done like that before. How did you negotiate who was going to be the CEO? Well at that time Dean Witter owned Discover Card. So their market cap was dramatically larger than ours. So we based it on market cap and they had a much larger market cap to do the deal. Your sell wanted to be in charge, that was one of the prerequisites to do the deal, that he'd be the CEO. And I'd be the president of the firm and we did that deal. All right, she did that deal and being president under somebody else was a step back. You could argue that it's a bigger firm. How long did that last? It gave us a good question. I know it didn't last too long. Ultimately you said I've had enough of this and you didn't like his style and you write about that in your book. But you ultimately said okay I'm out of here and so unemployed and you tell your wife, guess what, your husband's unemployed? All right. Now my wife is so supportive. I could have told her anything and she would, she's on my side, it was great. You know I ended up at one point kind of going to a hedge fund and work with Art Sandberg and I did that for a while. But I was really flexible and I think they call them the Grumpy Old Men who went after the existing management at Morgan Stanley and felt like they were losing their edge and also their reputation as a really great investment bank and really led by Parker Gilbert and Louis Bernard and some of the senior partners who had retired and they owned a lot of stock and they put a lot of pressure on Dean Werter Morgan Stanley to make a change and that's how I ended up going back. So Phil Purcell was ousted and then they came to you and to your surprise they said come back and be the CEO. You hadn't known that you were going to be asked. Correct. I didn't know that at all. So what was it like when you came back where there are people cheering for you when you came back into Morgan Stanley? You seen the film. Yes. For a young person who now is looking at a career, would you recommend a Wall Street career today? David, yeah, listen, they're not many jobs you're going to have as a young individual. You're always, always learning. Sleep is crucially important and I think we've moved from this attitude from its indulgence a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s and so it makes it a really exciting field because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harness to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts but if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information and that's what your brain figures out while you're sleeping.

Nobody covers jobs day like Bloomberg. So how did you build Morgan Stanley, where you focused on underwriting, trading, other areas that were new to Wall Street? Well I focused on what we did really well and what we really did extremely well was build relationships with corporations and CEOs. We were either number one or number two in the M&A tables every year. So that was very important. And then we said, look, if we're going to be doing M&A and we have these wonderful relationships and trust, let's move into the secondary market and become a very active securities business. So we ended up building a very large platform at the institutional level. And over time, with Dean Whitter, you had the retail. So we really focused on being an institutional firm with a very strong retail base. Your predecessor, Phil Prasso, was famous for not meeting with a lot of people. He was a little isolated. Some people accused him of being, you like to be in the trading floor, near the trading floor, being with customers all the time, or with your employees, is that right? Yes. And so if you found people that were ignoring their clients or ignoring their employees, working for you, you tended to tell them what you thought. Without question. What I did when I was running the division, fixed income division, I would sit out on the trading floor and have, I had a glass booth office. So if I had to have a conversation with someone, so going off in the conference room, we could sit in this glass office and we'd have a conversation. And I would be on the phones. I'd walk around and sit down by the best salesman or the worst salesman. What are you working on? What are your clients doing? I was always involved. And I had some really fun times in doing it. I think in my book, I talk about how you treat people. And I get off the elevator at 8 o'clock in the morning or 7.45. And you look over to the right and they're delivery guys bringing coffee and examin' which is a way of you to do for breakfast. And about 20 minutes later, I walk back and I go out on the trading floor and I go up to the sky and I said, how long have you been here? He said about 30 minutes. He was in a spanic, about 30 minutes. I said, if you call the person in order breakfast, you said, yes, I've called them three times. I said, give me the number. So I gave it a number and I said, this is John Mack, don't you get your ass out here. And he comes out in front of the delivery guy and I said, look, we're no better than he says. He's just trying to make a living. When you make him wait, you take money out of his pocket if I ever hear about it again, you're fired. That went around the floor like that. You don't treat people that way. And I hope that's ingrained in me before I went to Morgan Stanley, but I really learned it from Dick Fisher. He was such a gentleman and very smart and made decisions. So the person that you almost fired, did he do that again or no? He did do it again. No one did it again. So Morgan Stanley is doing quite well and Morgan Stanley is competing principally with Goldman Sachs, I guess it was your main rival. And then all of a sudden we go into a recession, 2007, 2008. So what happened was, as I remember from reading from that period of time and from reading your book, you had this large cash reserve and you wanted to make sure you had a lot of cash, but people were afraid of Morgan Stanley maybe going under. So they said, give me my cash back. I'm going to put it in JP Morgan. Exactly right. And so all of a sudden the cash is going all the way down. At some point you say maybe we're not going to make it. That's exactly right. Well thank God for the Japanese is what I can say. What I learned is it goes back to when Morgan Stanley would bring brokers from whether Namiura or Simutomo didn't make any difference and they would in a training program at Morgan Stanley. And the Japanese.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3596,2022-10-16 18:26:34
15311," and brokers from whether Namur or Sumitomo didn't make any difference, and they would in a training program at Morgan Stanley. And the Japanese who came through that training program respected the culture of Morgan Stanley. So when we were on the brink, they stepped up and gave us the money to stand business. So it turned out to be a good investment for Mitsubishi because your stock is flourished in STEM. And after that happened, did you think that Wall Street learned any lessons and do you think this could happen again where you have enormous illiquidity problems or liquidity problems, and Wall Street really has changed very much? Well, I think the business of Wall Street hasn't changed that much, but the scrutiny on capital and capital solvency is very, very focused. And I think the Fed does a much better job in paying attention to the liquidity of these investment banks. Also, I think boards of directors have elevated risk management to a level that never existed when I was there. So going through a near-death experience that we went through and other firms, in some cases they actually died, like, unfortunately, Lehman Brothers, boards focus on risk management. It's not about what deal you did, it's not about where we're gonna open another branch office, it's about liquidity and solvency. So after this happened and Morgan Stanley comes back and is doing quite well, you ultimately decide to retire. And you handed the reins over to James Gorman, who would not been a lifer at Morgan Stanley, and in fact, he had come from Maryland, you had recruited him from there, and he was a consultant, not a trader, not investment banking person. So was that controversial to give it to him? If it were confident, I'd never heard about anyone saying, I mean, how could you do that? James is smart, he knows the business, he spent time as a consultant, time at Merrill Lynch. I saw how he ran the business, I retailed business at Morgan Stanley. He was on the management committee, I got a chance to see his interface. I would go up once a week and spend time in the office up in Westchester to be with him and how he managed. Smart as he can be, can make a decision, doesn't suffer fools, and he has a great personality, he was a natural. So for a young person who now is looking at a career, would you recommend a Wall Street career today? David, yeah, listen, there are not many jobs you can have as a young individual, where you're always, always learning. It may be not something you can write, but Wall Street lives on the news, and what people are doing, and what are the trends? I don't know many businesses like that. If you go in the manufacturing business, you have a sales cycle, you hope it's doing well, but in Wall Street, you have data, every day that tells you, not only what's going on in this country, what's going on in the world. So as you look at your career, what do you think you're the most proud of having done, help with New York Presbyterian, help Morgan Stanley recover from some of its problems? What are you most proud of? I'm most proud of where Morgan Stanley came from, just a few hundred people to where it is now. I think taking the risks we took during the Dean Wooder trade, having the bumps that we had to live with, it turned out to be an unbelievable investment bank with a great culture, and to have James Gorman running it now, I couldn't be happier or more proud of it. So in hindsight, if you had to do it all over again, would you've gone to medical school as your mother wanted or you're happy you became a Wall Street person? To my mother's disappointment, thank God, I came to Wall Street. We don't have enough women founder CEOs who are getting funding, so basically less than 2% of VC funds go to women, less than 1% go to women of color. And so in this innovation space, I said to myself, what's the best way to use capital to move things for women? And that's when I started to say, okay, I actually need to move some money into the venture capital space, and I want to do it smartly. I mean, the first goal is to make money. I'm not putting my money out as a social impact. I'm putting it out to make money, but I wanted to go behind funds like aspect ventures that's run by Theresa Gau and Jennifer Fondstadt, who are looking at these opportunities, and they have a thesis around my gosh. There are so many opportunities.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3597,2022-10-16 18:31:00
15312," funds like aspect ventures that's run by Theresa Gau and Jennifer Fondstadt who are looking at these opportunities and they have a thesis around my gosh. There are so many opportunities there if we go towards funding some of these women businesses. Some LPs have said to me all we care about is returns. Some of the best investors may not be the best people, but they have the best returns. What do you have to say to those people? I have to say you're investing in what you know. And so you need to look at what trends are coming in the nation and how you're going to dress them. Women are 85% of consumer dollars spent. Women control 70% of financial decisions in the house. So if you're not investing in products that go towards females or a women led company, you're missing an opportunity because you just don't see it.

A three time MVP, 14 time All Star and World Series champion. He retired in 2016 as the highest paid player in MLB history, fourth all time on the list of home runs.

I think in a weird way I'm going to look back and say that's one of the best things that happened. Five years after his retirement, Alex Rodriguez, the CEO is getting back into sports this time as an owner of a pro basketball team. And he wants to build more than just a franchise, but a legacy maybe with a dose of redemption. The mistakes made in baseball are done and I can't go back and fix them. I want to keep a clean record of the father as a friend or the business person. And because of those mistakes, I think I have that opportunity and I'm having the time of my life doing it. A-Rod, Alex Rodriguez is buying the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Minnesota links. The purchase price is expected to be in the range of $1.5 billion. You know, for me, I think making the transition from player to owner is something that's very exciting to me.

15313," I think making the transition from player to owner, something that's very exciting to me, I'm really excited to bring my experience both in business and in sports and in locker room and do really, really exciting things and bring a world championship to the city. In April 2021, Alex Rodriguez joined one of the most exclusive clubs around, folks who own a pro sports team. And while his name and his fame made the headlines, it was his business empire that allowed him to actually close the deal. The easy to remember name, A-Ride Corp, it's grown into a diversified investor and operator, taking a cue from mega firms like Blackstone and KKR. A-Ride Corp has taken a real estate portfolio and expanded into venture capital and private equity and media and like any business in 2021, it's own SPAC. I was more lucky than smart. I started investing very smart real estate, simply as a hedge to, as my earning power would close, my real estate would not only appreciate what's, but create more cash flow. And then I would take that cash flow and I would buy more real estate and other private equity type investments were generated more cash flow. So as my Yankee income went to zero, hopefully my real estate and my businesses would grow over time. And while players nowadays are becoming better and better business brands, few are able to achieve the scale as A-Ride Corp has in such a relatively short amount of time. But understanding how that growth happened in business, just like baseball, has to start at home. Part of what I love about business is you get to build things from nothing, right? Like nothing. So I had two hip surgeries and I never wanted to be the old guy that couldn't get up you know this there. So I built a flat house all entertainment on that side. My roommate, dad and the girls on this side. But it had to be one story because A, I'm always forgetting things. And B, I wanted it to want to be like, oh my god, I can't get up the steps because it be sips. Yeah, I walk around here, I mean first of all the arts is beautiful, but tons of pictures of you and the girls and I mean you've really made a family life for yourself here. Tell me about that. Well, tell you what I'm not at home. I'm not a cleanup hitter and I'm not a CEO. The girls remind me every day that I work for them. Yeah. People always ask me, what are you doing your life? And I say the three bees, I do baseball and I'll basketball through business and my babies. And that's kind of, that's my happy zone. It's funny through pandemic. We spent so much time here and in my 46 years, the toughest time in the world that I've witnessed. On the other side of that, we were in here and we felt safe and we felt loved. And it was like 90 days of breakfast, lunch, and dinner. With my girls, it was a dream come true. They got so sick of my dad jokes, so sick of my dancing. And it's actually a leisure TikTok. I've been begging trying to bribe out of to do one with me. She was daddy, you have no swag, no drip. I'm not doing anything with you. Hey, Rod's dancing may not get his daughter's approval, but his following on social media is huge, with nearly four million followers on Instagram alone. That number is larger than his new basketball team, the Yankees or the Red Sox, not to mention any other single baseball player, current or former. Who has better taste in music? Whose dream is decorated nicer? What is it that makes you engage the way you do in social? You know Jason, a lot of that came through my time during my suspension. You know, I spent a whole year serving a suspension. And in that time, I had an opportunity to turn the lens inward. And understand why I was making some of the good choices, the poor choices, the bad choices. And understand kind of conversation, understand storytelling. And it's something that I'm enjoying is still fairly new. We're not experts by any means. But every time we look at companies or opportunities or partnerships, is data driven and social driven and it's been quite a tool for us. That suspension, which obviously people will forever associate.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3599,2022-10-16 18:39:29
15314," For us, that suspension, which obviously people will forever associate you with. And there's an interesting choice you make there, at that moment and then in subsequent moments, to not lean out, to not retreat, but to lean in, to some extent. And especially in the last couple of years, tell me about that. If you think about my career, sure I've hit home runs and been part of the World Championship team, but I'm also on fifth all time in the history of strikeouts. I mean, that means that only four people in the history of mankind have failed more than me. But I think as a result, I've been, you know, PhD in failing, but also an MBA of getting back up. Looking around at his house and his selection of cars, it's hard to say that A-Rot has ever really failed. But it's striking what he has built, considering where he came from. I'm not sure if he's ever going to be able to do that. But I think that's the only way to get back up. And I think that's the only way to get back up. We will never break. We will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. Have a wide array of issues and the mountains shake. All of them will remain. We will never. No. We will never. No. We will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never. I was born in New York, raised in Miami. When I got to Miami, I was around eight and a half and nine years old. My father left when I was around 10. At home, it was Mom, my brother Joe and my sister Shouzi. They took the role of my brother became the Secretary of Sports. My sister became the Secretary of Education. And my mom just had to make enough money to pay her bills. I think my father leaving us at 10 left a huge vacant spot. And I think I needed to then fill that void by having a collection of mentors. One of those earliest mentors was his baseball coach, Rich Hoffman, right here at Westminster High School. See vlogs through this area a few times. This brings back some pretty cool memories. If you hit a home run here, it goes to the basketball courts and the pool. And I kind of like it. It's kind of like this Fenway kind of wriggly. Yeah, exactly. The set of the green monster you have, the green pumps. Yes, exactly. It's really where I really started to understand the power of mentorship and dreaming big.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3600,2022-10-16 18:43:47
15315," looks southward. People always question Miami. Why do people live there? There's not any great jobs. You know, we don't have a lot of financial services here. We don't have anybody manufacturing anything. But that's changing. People see this as a very cool place to live and work. Now, before it was all, it was always a cool place to live, but we're going to work. Now it's OK, the jobs are here first. Cool place to visit in the past. Right, yeah. And now each pocket is being built out. I think our Basel years and years ago started that. And then there have been a course of events that have followed that continue to enrich Miami. And I would say we're still early as a city. But while Miami may be home base, Rodriguez is most aggressive current real estate project is buying, renovating, and renting out single-family homes in markets across the country. And in this case, he's not just emulating some of the world's biggest investors, but also getting into business with them, including real estate legend Barry Sternley. Just as behemoths like Blackstone who've been mass single-family homes, Rodriguez, through the type of capital group, has snapped up 5,000 homes so far. We think we're still in the early endings of single-family housing. Rents are going up about 18 to 19 percent. Once we find something, then this I learned from Warren Buffett is be disciplined. But when you find your pitch, don't go for a single or a double, going and going big. And that's exactly what we've done multi-family. And now with single-family homes. Going big has required Rodriguez to build a team around him, and he's opted for a delicate balance of homegrown and outside hires. On the one side, friends dating back to childhood and adolescence, including Aaron, Pepe, and Jose. On the other newer additions such as Kelly LaFerieir, Stuart Zook, David Becker, and Lisa Pire. Managing the chemistry among the small and growing team is akin to the elusive intantibles Rodriguez sought in clubhouses when he was a player. Getting it right, well, that's the difference between being a champion and an also ran. Lisa, take it away. Sure. So I think next we're going to have David on table, from Kelly. And we take the easy relationship to the world so he's in the club. So teams 11 and 11. And one exciting development is the 12-17 hearing and selectors is going to use PN. So we were done on these principles in New York. At the A-Ride Corp offices, you'll notice the memorabilia, the pictures of famous athletes, the real-time social data being displayed on the TV wall. But you'll also see pictures of Rodriguez with some of the biggest businessmen in the world. Alex has become a sponge. And he started that as an active player. When he was on the road, he would go and visit the Jerry Rine Struffs of the world in his uniform and ask them business questions. And he's surrounded himself with really good smart people. The wide network is critical and sourcing deals, including in the venture world, where the A-Ride portfolio has included more than 60 companies, brands like Hems and Hers, GoPuff, and UFC Gems. But having the best team doesn't mean you win every at bat. Their SPAC, Slam Corp, was recently negotiating a roughly $3 billion deal to merge with collectible company, Pnini. That didn't materialize after Pnini stumbled. Slam's still in search of a target. But Rodriguez's belief in taking swings, striking out and hitting big, is also the same way he would end up with his own sports franchise. Why do the biggest names in business choose Bloomberg? That's great question. Great question. And best question I get all night. Bloomberg, top experts, great questions. Watch Bloomberg's surveillance early edition for the news you need when you need it.

Can it sustain its normal at a time when everybody else is facing a very different reality? Bloomberg surveillance. Be informed. Be prepared. Be ahead of the game. J.Lo and A.R.D. are angling to buy the New York Mets. They're not just angling. I mean, they are in the process of putting the money together. Rodriguez along with a group that included his then-girlfriend Jennifer Lopez, entrepreneur Mark Lurian several others, mounted a bid against front runner and hedge fund billionaire Steven A. Cohen. These guys are all rich, you know, as far as we go, they've made millions and millions of dollars, but we're talking about billions here. The very public process ultimately landed A.R.D. and J.Lo's consortium as the runner up with Cohen by the team for $2.4 billion. We have a little bit depressed about it. We don't like to lose and, you know, we really started getting really excited and thinking about what could be. And so when it just sort of came to a complete halt, it was sort of like the shock to the system. We were sort of depressed and down. Mark Lurian is a New York-born businessman who most recently had been a senior executive at Walmart. He got in there by selling his company, Jet.com, to the mega retailer and stayed on to run that division. And while A.R.D. partnership with J.Lo would come undone, he formed a close business and personal connection with Laurie that's lasted. How rules, man, I told you, no one's highest, man. You can't make a great retire. You can't. We grew up in a sort of very similar way and from very, very humble beginnings. I love Mark. I love him like a brother. And he's a great partner and a great friend. And, you know, he's sleep to my house. I sleep at his house. And we both have this drive and this mission that I want him to win in the worst way. And I think he does the same for me. I want to show you this clip because it spoke to me a lot about the depth of your relationship. Yeah, I think this is getting a little bit deeper now, but I think it comes down to our dads. You know, they both felt like, you know, we had something to prove in order to sort of feel love, really. And when you did something spectacular, you felt, oh, maybe, you know, like, and I think he similarly had felt that too, where if you wanted to feel love, you had to do big things. What do you make of that? I never thought about it that way, but I know that when my father left at 10, it left a huge hole in my heart and my stomach. And I knew that I had to do better. And I think before therapy, it was probably better for the wrong things. I think post and current, I look at it as just my purpose. But I also know that I'm enough now. And probably before that, I thought it wasn't. The deep connection with Lori led to a new $400 million venture fund called VCP, and notably allowed them to quickly pivot to a successful deal in sports ownership. They're pursuit of the Minnesota Timberwolves and Minnesota links. He called me and he said, hey, are you serious about this? He said, I won't do it unless you're serious about it. And I said, I'm serious about it. Are you serious about it? And again, a minute conversation, we're both in. And we probably got the deal done in six or seven days. NBA ownership has radically transformed in the past decade. It's tech executives like Steve Balmer and Joe Sy and Wall Street investors like Mark Lazer, Josh Harris, and Tony Ressler, hit snapped up teams. There's a supply demand imbalance where and most people, if they could, would own a professional sports team and there's very high barriers to entry.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3602,2022-10-16 18:56:49
15317," There's a supply demand imbalance where anyone, you know, most people if they could would own a professional sports team and there's you know very high barriers to entry and you know very limited supply. In the case of the Timberwolves, Glenn Taylor bought the team in 1994 for $88 million. The sale to Rodriguez's group values the franchise paired with the four-time WNBA champion links at $1.5 billion. And that's relatively affordable. A Rod's old team, the Yankees, is worth more than $5 billion according to several estimates and while ownership is changing so too are the players. I think players today want more in every sport. They're into fashion, they want to be good investors, they want to learn about venture. The NBA players today that I've been around, some of them are more prepped at 20 than some of the guys that I played with at WNBA 50. And meeting with our athletes and talking about business and then reaching out to me, it's great, it's humbling and it's really impressive. And if anything, their ownership has maybe gotten too close to the players. The team being fined $250,000 for violating league rules within offseason workout and A Rod's hometown of Miami. But buying a basketball team instead of the Met's might accomplish a goal he thought was unreachable, actually making him cool to his daughters. I recently went to a Sixers game and my little one Ella who's 13, she closed that and really liked this basketball thing. Like one day maybe I get to run the business here one day. Really? And I was like, oh my god, that's like the greatest thing I've ever heard. And she goes, you know, it's like, you know, base was a little slower, but this stuff, I can really get into it. I said, whoa, baseball's great too. It's just, you know, it's more of a thinking man's game. It's like chess, not checkers. And she goes, yeah, yeah, whatever. I don't like chess either. But she says this basketball thing, I have like real passion is like the entertainment and I have thoughts and I have ideas. And I, and she thinks much more like a producer, she likes dancing. And I mean, to me, that's just like, boy, that's the great thing about sports and music. It brings people together. And it's only that that for us that night. You have built this, this amazing business. And there are people who are watching this, just like this guy, you know, it's like that they'll always remember you for your baseball career. And a baseball career that was controversial to say the least, you could be a little bit on an island somewhere. You don't have to do this. I thought about tapping out a bunch of times. I would wake up in the middle of the night and be in tears going like, how in the world, do I get pocket aces and figure out a way to screw this up? That was a very painful time for me. And I think the year's suspension allowed me to not only put lipstick on the house and paint it and fix the windows, it allowed me to tear the entire house down and start building it one brick at a time. And in that process, I became even closer to my daughters. And when I think about those mistakes and the lessons learned, I think about, okay, but you know what, that was baseball. And I had good moments and I had very tough moments. But clean slate when it comes to being a father, to being a partner, to being a businessman, to being a friend. So I draw some incredible motivation through, man, something that sucked, something that I did to myself. I say to myself, in the darkest hour, boy, if I ever get another opportunity, I'm not going to screw that up again. And I'm trying my best not to do that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3603,2022-10-16 19:00:47

It's the first element on the periodic table. It is the most abandoned element in the universe. And when clean energy advocates think about what can we find which would be as easy to use as fossil fuels they think about hydrogen. The fuel that will when burn only produce water. We like to imagine that if we just built enough of these and these we could ditch fossil fuels and save the planet. Unfortunately it's not that simple. There are some things we just need a good old fashioned combustible fuel. Now startups around the world are betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century. Innovation, money and power collide in Silicon Valley and beyond. Bloomberg Technology with Emily Chang. Weak days at 5 p.m. in New York and 2 p.m. in San Francisco. What separates a great investor from an average investor? Is it an early affinity for markets? I put a satellite dish on top of the dorm room so I would have access to real-time stock quotes. In unconventional path, what I really wanted to do was ski. So I left Wharton and I went up the main and became ski boat. A never ending thirst for knowledge? It is a constant education each and every day. An acute attention to detail. I was down there for three weeks. I met every tenant. I was counting the car traffic. I was learning the business. A willingness to take a risk. If you want to produce return, you have to be willing to take risk. Where the ability to recognize a mistake and move on. I don't mind a 90% chance probability of failure if there's a 10% chance of changing the world. In how to invest, I hope to provide a glimpse into the thoughts and practices of the world's great investors and hopefully inspire a new generation of professional investors. In my pursuit of identifying the traits and skills of a great investor, I first looked into their backgrounds. I found many were raised in blue collar or middle class families. Rarely, where they from fabulously wealthy families or families where there was a history of investing professionally. But their path to a career in investing varied. Some like Ron Baron, the mutual fund manager and investor with more than $50 billion on her management started investing as a teenager. After my birth, I was interested in stock market because I had friends of mine who had been given stock from the grandparents who were prosperous. In Eastman, Kodak and Polaroid. I said, I want to do that. My father said, we can't invest in stocks. We've never done that. Family. In fact, one of the ideas behind my business is the idea was I wanted to be able to have people like my parents be able to invest in the stock market. I saw that and then he said, well, I had $1,000 at the time and he said, well, if you show me why you want to invest in a company.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3604,2022-10-16 19:05:23
15319," So I saw that and then he said, well, I had a thousand dollars at the time and he said, well, if you show me why you want to invest in a company and you put all your money into one company, then and show me why, then I'll let you do that and open account for you. And so I did research, I would go to this brokerage firm and I would, it was called McDonald and Company or from Cleveland and they were right by Asbury Park High School. So I would go there after school, sports and girls and stocks and I would go there after school and all these guys, old guys, 40, 50 years old. They're sitting there on these green chairs and looking at the tape that hardly moved. I think the New York Stock Exchange was 25 million shares a day and maybe American was a million or two million shares a day. So look at it and I got a report on this Mama County National Bank and I started reading it and it was around the corner in where I lived in Allenhurst outside of Asbury Park. And I told my father why I wanted to invest in it and he let me invest and the stock was $10 a share, 100 shares and then the stock every day for the next six months, seven months, every day to stay the same or win up an eighth and it was printed the 15 stocks in the Asbury Park Press and everybody said the same and then it got acquired at $17 a share. So my $1000 became $1700. I said man, there's nothing today, I want to do that. So I was interested. Hedge Fund billionaire Ken Griffin also turned an early affinity for math and computers into an early career in stock trading. Let's talk about your background before you started Sadeel. You're born in Florida? I was born in Daytona Beach. My father worked on the space program back in the 1960s. But I spent my formative years in middle school and high school in Bucke or Tung Florida. And you were a pretty good math student and I'm told a computer nerd as well. Is that fair or unfair? Well I appreciate the compliment because to be a computer nerd has obviously turned out to be a pretty good place to be in life. And yes, I was very interested in both mathematics and programming in high school. And it's defined my career and it has had a very important role in my life. So you went to Harvard College. Most students there are taking courses or their athletics but you were going to be doing that but you were also trading securities. Is that true? That is true. I started up a small partnership my second year at Harvard to engage in convertible bond arbitrage which was a bit of an off the beaten path occupation for a kid in college. But I had a great fast nation with markets and I had an opportunity to invest capital markets in my college days. And it was an incredible opportunity. It was a really great learning experience. But in those days it wasn't common to be able to get stock prices instantly. You had to get a special terminal or special intended to let you get the stock quotes. Is that right? So it's amazing. I love the line people go well that's how we've always done it. And I get to think back into the early days of Citadel we always did it meant we used a fax machine which you and I of course have memories of. And the fax machine was revolutionary. In the 1980s real time stock prices were actually difficult to receive. And I put a satellite dish on top of the dorm room so I would have access to real time stock quotes in managing the portfolio that I manage. And what did the Harvard people say? Interestingly enough back in the 80s Harvard had a general prohibition on commercial activity in your dorm rooms. So I had to go to the building superintendent to get an exception to put the satellite dish on the roof of the building. And fortunately he was willing to grant me that exception. But not every investor saw their future in finance early. Real estate Titan Sam Zell and myself studied the law, became lawyers and hated it. I was always a good enough academic to get from here to there. So when I wanted to go to law school I got seven A's. But I didn't get very many A's before that. And I basically used the four years of being an undergraduate to build a real estate business and build other businesses. And I just had a great time. So you were doing some real estate on the side while you were in college. And then you went to University of Michigan Law School and to please your mother or father you said I'm going to go to law school. But you weren't that interested in being a lawyer? No. Never. As a matter of fact I ended up graduating and becoming a lawyer and I practiced for four days. Four days. I didn't realize you practiced that long. Four days.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3605,2022-10-16 19:09:43
15320," Never, as a matter of fact, I ended up graduating and becoming a lawyer and I practiced for four days. Four days, I didn't realize you practiced that long. Four days. So, in the morning of the fifth day, I went to see the senior partner and as only a 24-year-old could do, I looked in and I said, I just don't think this is a good use of my time. He said, okay, there's the door. Well, actually, what he's going to do is, what he's going to do. And I said, I'm just going to go back to doing deals like I did when I was in law school and in the real estate business in Arbor. And so, he said, one of you stay here and we'll do the legal work and we'll invest in your deals. And so, that's what we did for a year. And then there's activist investor Nelson Pellets, who didn't see the point in studying at all. What I really wanted to do was ski. So, I left Wharton and I went up to Maine and became a ski boat. What did your family say? Nelson, we really wanted you to go to Wharton and be a good student. You're one of ski. I mean, that's not what you're supposed to do. That's correct. They did say that. What did you do? You said I was skiing. My father was an amazing guy. He wasn't happy that I left Wharton. He wasn't happy that I was a ski bum. And he wasn't happy that I grew a beard. But I did all of those things. And this snow melted in late spring and came back and I had a summer job offered to me in Mount Hood, Argonne to help them teach racing to young kids in Mount Hood, Argonne. And I needed some money to get out there. I asked him if he'd give me a job on a truck, a hundred bucks a week, two weeks. That was all I needed. He said, find, shave your beard off and do it. I said I would. It was only temporary. So I shaved my beard off and after about a week on the job, I started telling things that I thought that were missed opportunities. And he set me up beautifully. He said, why don't you stay here and do what you want to do instead of going out to Mount Hood, Argonne? Well, I did. And that's what happened. There are also great investors like Paula Volent, one of the country's most successful and almond heads who came to investing after a completely different career. I studied paper conservation, restoring prints and drawings. I worked at the New York Historical Society for a while there. I then went to work at the Palace of Fine Arts in their Conservation Lab and then I went to Los Angeles where I worked at the LA County Museum. I did study, I did a scientific work at the Getty. And then I set up my own conservation studio where I worked with contemporary artists like Sam Edrige, Sam Francis. And I was running my own business and I realized I needed to know a little bit about finance because I was working with very expensive works of art. I was running a studio. And so I started taking a couple of business classes at UCLA and through that I got introduced to Yale School of Management. But I got into Yale School of Management at the same time I got offered a fellowship at the National Gallery of Art where you and I both serve. The Lyscher Fellow and I worked in the paper conservation lab there combining paper and paintings techniques for conservation on contemporary works of art. So you did that for a while? Then you went to Yale School of Management? My husband and I had been trying to have a child and it wasn't kind of works. It wasn't happening so he said, okay, well let's move to New Haven. And of course that was instant and my daughter was born after my first semester. So I took a break and while when my daughter was probably two months old I went to David Swenson and knocked on the door and said hi, I want to learn about endowment because I'm going to work in a museum. And this is about David. David looked at my resume. There was no finance at all. And he took me in and I started filing and helping organize things and little by little I got projects to do. I remember he had me do a big research on soft dollars. That was one project I worked on. And little by little I became incorporated into the investment office. Coming up we hear about the extreme intelligence and intention to detail that it takes for success.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3606,2022-10-16 19:13:59
15321," Little by little, I became incorporated into the investment office. Coming up, we hear about the extreme intelligence and intention to detail that it takes for success on Wall Street. One of Sam's favorite Samisms is we suffer from knowing the numbers. While Teslas and the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the road today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building to crowds America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Teslas. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels, we want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what's the best investment advice you've ever put in to give unbeaten anybody? The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance, and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day. And if you keep at it and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's not just a miracle. It's an incredible miracle. And it's not just interest. It was always said about compound interest returns, compound business returns, compound human returns. They're all very additive because you learn every day. And if you keep at it, it's very, very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make? Selling it the wrong time. And they sell when the prices go down? Yes. Not keeping. But people have conviction or they invest for the, if they invest for the right reasons, just keep at it. Another trait of great investors that shouldn't surprise you is they all tend to have a high degree of intelligence. Many excelled academically. But true success as Mary Eardos, the CEO of JP Morgan Asset and Wealth Management, points out, comes from training and continuing to educate oneself. So training on Wall Street, but specifically in Wealth Management, is a very, very long process. We have 2200 analysts starting today and they're going to be working through the summer. We have 3600 analysts across JP Morgan Chase that will start at the very end in the September time period for their full time role. And we work very hard to go through in-depth training and then to work through which ones actually are good at stock investing. Which ones are good at M&A transactions? Which ones are good at helping people understand things in a more simplistic matter? That's a two to three year training program. But that's pretty fast. If you think 10,000 hours is about what you need to master any subject. If someone comes in and has a regular, you know, eight hour a day job, five days a week, it's going to take you about five years to have a base level mastery. On Wall Street, it's more like 12 hours a day, six days a week, that cuts you down to about two and a half years before you become mastered in something. Once they've got that under their belt, they can then join a team. And if they've been successful going through the analyst program, joining a team, then the team will work through how that works. But it is a constant education each and every day. Every morning we start with an eight o'clock meeting and I call it like a mini university. And it's not just about what you've read in the newspapers as to what happened overnight. It's about understanding how all of those components fit together in a client's portfolio. And then what might be right for you would be different than somebody else.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3607,2022-10-16 19:17:58
15322," So what happened overnight? It's about understanding how all of those components fit together in a client's portfolio and then what might be right for you would be different than somebody else. And you're synthesizing all that information every morning and then you're going out and you're figuring out how to apply it to each situation. Dawn Fitzpatrick, the investment chief for George Soros, is of a similar mindset to Erdos. For her, the constant pursuit of new ideas and new voices keep her ahead of the game. So I read a lot, you know, in the morning I'll skim through two or three different papers. During my days I'm meeting with a lot of smart investors and smart people running companies. You learn a lot from there. I talk to peers. But I think part of the trick of this big business is being able to really aggregate and assimilate information. And one of the other tricks of this industry is trying to find sources of information that are different than the other people in the business because you don't want to get crowd thinking. I think that happens a lot in this business. Everyone's talking of the same people and a view becomes consensus that might not be really grounded as well as it should be in facts. Attention to detail also sets great investors apart as described by two real estate legends, Sam Zell and John Gray. You know, one of Sam's favorite Samisms is we suffer from knowing the numbers. I think we've managed to tip through the tulips for the last 50 years by never allowing ourselves to get swept up in the enthusiasm of whatever the current event might be. And I think by maintaining that level of discipline, yeah, we made mistakes. It meant to be expected. But we've all been, quote, controllable. No one mistake was ever catastrophic. The first deal I worked on was a shopping center in Chesapeake, Virginia, the Great Bridge shopping center. It was a $6 million transaction. We borrowed four. So it was a $2 million equity check. And you would have thought I was buying the island of Manhattan. I mean, I was down there for three weeks, I met every tenant, I was counting the car traffic, I was learning the business. And it was an amazing experience because I was the chief bottle washer, I was the waiter, I was the matredee because we were this tiny little business and I was learning it firsthand. Now one of the most famous things in the real estate world is location, location, location, meaning that the location is everything. And also you might say it's local, local, local because most people make in real estate investments kind of in the area they know. We've made investments all over the world. How do you, sitting in New York, know about their value of real estate in Europe or in Asia and how hard has that been to build a global business? So I think the key to that is to have a global footprint, to have hundreds of people all over the world. And it took us a long time to do it. I mean, we've been at this for 30 years and you really need talented people on the ground. You need local people who know the markets. The one thing I'd say though that is advantageous about real estate is so many of the trends we're seeing, particularly driven by technology, are the same around the world. So when we started buying warehouses back in 2010 and we noticed that there were these e-commerce tenants showing up and we started buying more in the US, it wasn't a big leap of faith to say the same thing's going to happen in Canada, it's going to happen in the UK and continental Europe and across Asia. So my view is that if you have the skill set, you can evaluate, plus you travel a lot, like you, I'm on planes a lot. I no longer run the real estate business day today. My colleagues Ken Kaplan and Kathleen McCarthy have done an amazing job, but they have teams around the world on the ground and we're local in those markets and I think that's really important. You cannot buy real estate in Mumbai the way we have flying in and flying out of New York. Next, we look at how skilled investors evaluate risk. We are 100% confident every time we make the investment that is going to be a big company. We are wrong a lot of the time.

Music Music Music Music One of the easiest paths in life is to accept and follow conventional wisdom. But what great investors have found is that path doesn't lead to easy returns. Often, the biggest wins come from going against the grain and taking a risk, especially if you're a leading venture capital investor like Mark Andreessen or Vinod Kostler. Each top and venture firm has its own bar, so it has its own set of criteria for things that you should be done or not. And then the top to your venture firms as a group have a collective bar, which is a top to your venture firm going to fund this company or not. And it's actually easier to answer that second question than it is the first question. After you've been in the business for a while, you tend to have a sense of like, okay, this is going to get funded by a top and venture capital firm or it's not. If it is going to get funded by a top and venture capital firm, and if my firm doesn't think it's a good idea, you do wonder who's right, because the other firms are quite smart. And so this is one of the regular discussions that we have, which is like, okay, if another one of these top and firms is interested in it, that might be a very positive substantive signal. If the other top and firms have looked at it and all passed, that might be a substantive negative signal. That said, some of the best deals in history have been passed on by a very large number of people. And one of the class examples, Uber was passed on by a very large number of venture capital firms. Uber was actually available to be invested in on this site called Angelist, where literally anybody with a checkbook can invest. And so every once in a while you get these outliers. And it's fundamentally a game of outliers, like the money is made on the aberrations. And so I say you want to be generally open-minded and humble about your conclusions about what all these different signals mean. Now a famous economist, Herb Stein, once said, if something can't keep going on forever, it won't. In other words, at some point things settle down. Do you worry that because the economy might soften at some point if interest rates are raised, or just because of the business cycle, the wonderful world of venture capital will slow down a bit, and is that a worry for you? So it's a cyclical business for sure. It has a history of boom bus cycles, basically just like any other sector of the economy. That said, I guess I would say we do not have a great track record in our industry of predicting these cycles. And I think most of how we either perform or fail to perform is micro-not macro, which is to say it's based on the successor failure of individual companies. And if you just look at the history of venture capital and startups, many of the best companies have been formed during the hot periods, but also many of the companies have been formed during the cold periods. And they're pros and cons of those periods. And so look, it's possible there's another cyclical boom and bus cycle. Our plan for that cycle would basically be to just keep working with our existing companies, help them through it, keep investing in new companies all the way through. And basically bet on these sort of micro-level fundamental technological and economic changes that continue to happen. Most of what we do is uncharted territory. I would say the one piece that works really well in art business is go for higher risk higher consequences. So most people in business reduce risk, increase the probability of success, which is reduce risk. But at the expense of making the consequences of success relatively inconsequential, you might make two times your money or something. So I, for art business, what works is I don't mind the 90% share problem.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3609,2022-10-16 19:26:45
15324," consequential, you might make two times your money or something. I, for our business, what works is I don't mind the 90% probability of failure if there's a 10% chance of changing the world. And that's very much the philosophy. It also goes with, it's the right way to make huge impact. It's not just venture capitalists taking risks. Symbia's endowment head Kim Liu also says gains are not without calculated risks. I think the best investment advice I've ever received is the fact that we are in the business of taking risk. And so if you want to produce return, you have to be willing to take risk and you have to be willing to analyze and mitigate that risk the best you can. And to make sure that the return potential of an investment is equal to the risk, but you can't avoid risk. Now, what do you think the most common mistake investors make generally? I think the most common mistakes is following the herd and just doing what everybody else is doing and not making sure that an investment is appropriate for your institution and making sure that the analysis that someone else has done is not appropriate for you or is not congruent with the way you think about the world. I think there are million ways to make money. I think there are million strategies that can work. Not every investment is consistent with your strategy. And so I think there's a lot of herd mentality and that's a huge mistake that happens. Now sometimes risk don't pan out and mistakes are made. Now I might sit and stew over the loss for a decade or two, but a truly great investor like Kleiner Perkins Chairman John Doerr has the ability to admit a mistake, cut his losses and move on. When I first came to Silicon Valley, I hung out at Stanford on the second floor of Margaret Jack's Hall. And down that hall was Andy Bechtel-Schheim, who founded Sun Microsystems, John Hennessy, who became president of Stanford, founded MIPS, Jim Clark of Silicon Graphics. What I didn't do is go down into the basement where Len and Sandy were starting Cisco. So that was a miss on my part. More recently I had the opportunity to invest in an electric vehicle company. The conventional wisdom was venture capitalists ought not to invest in electric vehicle companies, not new car companies at all. There have been 400 new car companies in the nation's history. Every one of them but one has gone bankrupt. But I was still very attracted to the market. And we had the choice of backing a brilliant car designer by the name of Henry Fiskar, or a vicious, slightly crazy entrepreneur by the name of Elon Musk. Well, we made the wrong decision. But Tesla did very, very well and so did electric vehicles. So when I make a mistake, I only think about it for the next 10 or 20 years. How long does it take for you to get over these things? Well, I don't obsess on these, but I won't ever forget. This is a market that over the past few weeks has made it clear it wants to go higher. It got a little spooked by the idea that geocolat will protect it or rise it. When the price of anything goes up, the consequences reach far beyond what you'd expect. But perhaps most of all, when it comes to food. In 2010, surging food prices helped spark the Arab Spring. Lives were lost, regimes fell and the consequences are still with us. Once again, food prices are rising and fast. Energy costs, broken supply chains, and surging demand were just some of the factors that have driven food prices to their first record high since the Arab Spring. And that's all before a war between two of the world's biggest food producers. Ukraine is called the bread basket of Europe, and taken with Russia the two account for about a quarter of global wheat trade. They produce more than half of the world's sunflower seeds in oil, nearly 20% of the barley. Now throwing rising energy prices and processing, transporting, even refrigerating food gets more expensive. Plus, fertilizer production is extremely energy intensive. Less fertilizer means lower crop yield and prices rise even more. The pandemic revealed how complicated and fragile global trade systems are. Global agriculture, perhaps even...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3610,2022-10-16 19:31:11
15325," Less fertilizer means lower crop yield and prices rise even more. The pandemic revealed how complicated and fragile global trade systems are. Global agriculture, perhaps even more so. Unlike metals, for example, food goes bad. And crops take months to grow and are vulnerable to unpredictabilities like the weather. Rising food prices will be felt everywhere, but the poorest countries in the world will be hit the hardest. And as all these factors compound, the real fear is that record high will lead to record high and ultimately to a global food crisis with vast consequences. For you, invent pioneer, disrupt. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. In 2021, Shake Shack was looking to hire a new chief financial officer. The fast-casual restaurant chain found the perfect candidate in an unexpected place. Wall Street. I had worked at Goldman Sachs for about 16 years. I was covering the restaurant sector. Katie and I worked together for a long time. She was an analyst covering our stock. The day that I knew I was looking for a new CFO. The day that I announced it, I went to a recruiter and I said, what about Katie Fogherty? I remember working with her. You think she might be interested in this? That same day, she had heard about it and went to her family and said, this is the job I want. Literally that same day. It was something that I always wanted to take a more of a leadership role at a company. We hit it off. Katie Fogherty spent the first part of her career asking hard questions about corporate strategy. Now she's responsible for answers. I think that there's a number of things that a cell-side research analyst can lend to a company. Especially a company that is in high growth mode. One, it's just really a very firm ability to analyze strategic decisions, to really get into the numbers, into the models, and to have a firm view of different scenarios out there. When those Wall Street executives move into the company seat, they bring in understanding hopefully of the fundamentals company sector, but also what it means to be a stock. The total stakeholder perspective includes shareholders. How are we measuring the incrementality of a great offer like this? Katie's skill set so uniquely is able to harvest in her mind so much data and information. Turn it quickly into tremendous insights that end up driving our strategic priorities. That is her sweet spot. I look at a CFO from Wall Street as someone who can bring a breath of fresh air to a business that often can become very in-bred. They're extremely grounded in data. They're curious about data. They're pushing the data. They know what to do with the data and tie that into telling the story. There's a reality check that Katie brings to the business to say, you know, I know you think this, but let me tell you what the data is really telling us here. She's still looking at data to predict the future. Only now, she's taking it a step further. Before, it was a lot of sitting almost in an armchair type basis.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3611,2022-10-16 19:35:16
15326," She's still looking at data to predict the future. Only now she's taking it a step further. Before it was a lot of kind of sitting almost in an armchair type basis and analyzing different and now you know pieces of information to see where I thought the best investment dollar would be allocated. Here it is actually driving a plan of how we can best maximize shareholder returns. It is about leveraging data analytics, driving real insights through you know not just your own guest data but leveraging statistical models and really kind of figuring out where the best strategic decisions will be made over time. This is an industry that really needs that type of analysis that help the strategic vision now more than ever and so it was incredibly exciting to start to apply that here at ShakeShack. ShakeShack began as a humble hot dog cart in New York's Madison Square Park. It opened its first restaurant as a kiosk in that park in 2004. A decade later there were more than 60 ShakeShack restaurants around the world and in early 2015 the company went public. At the end of 2021 ShakeShack and its license partners operated nearly 400 locations in 16 countries at least 60 more are expected to open by the end of 2022. We always feel like we're just getting started at ShakeShack. Somehow you know we kind of describe ourselves as a public startup. We have a huge footprint and white space out there that we can grow globally and we're going to continue to do that. The pace of expansion is nothing new for this company but maybe different is the shape. ShakeShack has thrived in high density urban locations which provided 60% of revenues before the pandemic. But return to office patterns during COVID have been unpredictable hampering sales growth in cities. Now ShakeShack is exploring new formats as it extends its footprint in suburbs. It is not just a reaction to COVID. This is stuff that we've been working on before. What COVID did was accelerated the pace and excitement for some of the things that we've been planning before. Drive through amongst them as the most important. We were right at a pivotal moment of thinking drive-throughs were obsolete and then COVID hit and it was a saving grace. Right onto the suburban areas, drive-in becomes incredibly important because that's convenience and if a significant percentage of your business is drive-up, you need a smaller facility. So the investment can be smaller. This is the first time the company has ever put in a drive-through. We opened up our first one in December of last year. We have six open, very exciting stuff. Drive through lanes offer long term opportunities to build revenue and increase margins. But right now they carry a higher price tag. Overall we've seen a rise in our build costs. We talk about 10 to 15% higher build costs across the board. Things are just costing more. It makes site selection ever more important. It makes all of the work that we do in real estate and that whole process incredibly more important. Since Katie Fogarty became CFO of Shake Shack in June 2021, inflation has risen at a record rate making her job that much harder. Everything that enters our business, commodities, foods, cost of building restaurants is getting more expensive. I don't see that ending anytime soon and we've got to continue to plan for it. If you look at the price of beef, if you look at the price of dairy, eggs, all of these core things, even paper and packaging. This meaning that everything costs us more and more and more and we're not alone. This is happening to the entire industry right now. The industry is also dealing with a sea change on the labor front. Hourly wages have soared and the great resignation has hit restaurants hard. Labor costs aren't going down because of the training and turnover at the 30, 60 and 90 day mark. If someone's, you know, can even figure the job out, do they stay? That's still not under control whatsoever. So while maybe like the actual wage inflation can taper, turnover and training costs are still elevated. We've invested more than $10 million in our employees over the past year and we're going to continue to invest more. We're testing four day work weeks to help, you know, especially our working parents.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3612,2022-10-16 19:39:55
15327," We've invested more than $10 million in our employees over the past year and we're going to continue to invest more. We're testing four-day work weeks to help, you know, especially our working parents kind of juggle that balance between childcare and your work. I know I deal with that all the time. This is really a people first company. In even an inflationary environment, you're going to see us continue to lead with our people. Do you worry at all about a price wage spiral, not just here, but in the industry, in the economy? And I think that, you know, this is something that, you know, many business leaders are focused on and, you know, time will tell kind of how all of this lands. I think the wage-price spiral continues for quite some time. And I think we probably have been a lot less aggressive than we can be and than many other companies have been. In terms of raising crisis. Yes, we've taken our time. If you look at a 20-year history of pricing in this company, we've taken about 2% a year on average. We've never taken what we could, we've always taken what we should. We have to pay people more. We have been and will continue to do so. We'll take a little bit of a margin compression on that as we've had to. And I think that's the right thing. So that, for the long term, Shake Check continues to be what we're building, which is the next generation's burger joint. Shake Check margins have come down from pre-pandemic levels. At the same time, the company's cash position has improved. During COVID, we actually took two opportunities to raise capital. We have a fortress balance sheet like we've never had before. Good timing, good planning. So when we use that money, we're looking for a great return. The area with the highest potential return is right in Katie Fogridi's wheelhouse, advancing Shake Shacks digital transformation. It's amazing to sit here and think that this is a company that had essentially hardly any digital sales prior to the pandemic. And when the pandemic hit, we went full force on digital with the app, web, with third-party delivery, and here we are now with 43% of our sales still coming from digital channels, even as our in-chat business has developed. That doesn't count the kiosks, right? That does not count the kiosk. So what kind of investment was that? Is it a home run? Is that something where you're like, Randy, this paid off big time. Well, it's something that we continue to invest in. And we continue to see opportunities to improve our app, improve that guest experience, improve the ways that we're incentivizing our guests to really lean into our digital channels. If you simply kind of look at what the higher frequency we get from those digital guests, moving more and more of them into the channels and continuing to invest to drive frequency of that base, it's a really good recipe for strong long-term traffic growth. Coming up, digital investments have boosted Shake Shacks business. Katie Fogridi assures me they're not done innovating. You want the kiosks to be able to identify who you are and what you like to order when you come into the shack. This is Bloomberg. You will shed light on dark matter. You will make aging optional. You will turn 5G up to 11. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You can look at insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent, pioneer, disrupt. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. From its early days as a kiosk and Manhattan's Madison Square park, Shake Shacks brand has combined simplicity and style. The menu features classic items with a creative twist while the ingredients and service are a significant step up from fast food. The concept was an instant success, but maintaining growth and staying relevant comes with a complex set of pressures. We've come out of the pandemic with a new world and where something that might have been an evolutionary change has been a revolutionary change. We've made changes to the way we eat, we've made changes to the way we operate that might have taken years have been compressed into months and days. The role of CFO in a company like ours that's so dynamically growing, so constantly changing, and focus on digital is critical. Candy plays such an amazing role there. She's not just moving numbers around. This is not your grandfather's CFO anymore.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3613,2022-10-16 19:44:27
15328," Constantly changing and focus on digital is critical. Katie plays such an amazing role there. She's not just moving numbers around. You know, this is not your grandfather's CFO anymore. The digital infrastructure, the way we think about things out is a monster that needs to be fed all day long every day and is always hungry. And you could probably have 150 digital priorities today that all our teams will fight about. Ops wants this, tech wants this, marketing wants this, I want this, Katie wants that. Katie's job is to take all that prioritization, think it through, understand which one is going to have the best return on capital and which ones have no return on capital and you still got to do them anyway. That's the reality of the world we live in right now and it's critical to lead that in the right way. I visited a Manhattan shack with Katie Fogarty. Our first stop inside the restaurant was an ordering kiosk. Then on the burger side, you can see the option here for the bourbon bacon jam burger with shallots on top, the avocado bacon burger as well, our beloved smoked shack. The kiosks are an investment in engagement. We just see a gas kind of sit with the menu and really appreciate and understand how they can customize their order or the different add-ons that they have. So we really do believe that this provides them with an even better experience than going to the cash register. What's the payoff? I mean, the cost to put one of these in compared to how much more a customer spends on the kiosk. We do see a very nice lift off of the kiosk and actually this is not even a very fancy kiosk technology as an iPad. What has more investment tied to it, it's just the constant innovations that we've had to make the kiosk functionality better and better and we're driving towards kind of a parody situation where the kiosk and the cash register have exactly the same functionality and we want the kiosk to be able to identify who you are and what you like to order when you come into the shack. Improvements like these take resources. Shake Shack's general and administrative expenses have risen as the companies put capital behind digital initiatives and the changes ripple out from there. As our digital evolution has been underway, we've had to make a number of adjustments to the layout of our current existing shack base and really rethink the flow of the shack that we're building in order to really capitalize and enable and let our digital business thrive. And many Shacks, we've taken out cash registers, we've moved them around. A lot of times it's two or three cash registers that are just taken down to one. We've had to really rethink the way that the flow of our guest journey is in our shack. So one perfect example of it is we put in pick up shelves here at most of our restaurants. Guests who are looking for that to go experience and come in and pick up the order to go and they don't have to sit there and wait with everybody else who is waiting for their food ready to be made. We are constantly monitoring and identifying ways to be better in the kitchen. And it also goes down to the products and the types of offerings that we have. We never want to have something that is going to overly complicate our team members journey. We don't want to have something that's going to slow us down operationally. So you'll see a lot of our LTOs just really be building for menu ingredients and allowing our teams to kind of do a little bit different with what we already have. LTO stands for limited time offer. It might be a special shake flavor or partnerships like a recent venture with the Stiller Makers Mark. But Shake Shack's core offering is the burger. And it's not just any burger. The company pledges to source premium meat that's ethically raised and costs more even when inflation's not at historic levels. I've heard a lot about the importance of the quality to you guys in terms of ingredients. Doesn't that get expensive, especially right now quality beef must be rising in terms of price? I mean, we've always used premium ingredients and those premium ingredients that come at a higher price. We always have an eye on the margin. But we know also at the end of the day, you're running a very dangerous game. If you're trying to reverse engineer into something that you want from a P&L standpoint, the guests might not like it. Shake Shack's standing firm on quality, it's also practicing transparency, announcing plans to raise menu prices by 5% to 7% in the fourth quarter of 2022.

15329," Furnum on quality and it's also practicing transparency announcing plans to raise menu prices by 5 to 7% in the fourth quarter of 2022. Shake Shack is the best example, the definition of a fantastic value proposition. However, not all customers across this country have, you know, that change in their pocket to pay for that average ticket at lunch or dinner. And I think they're very comfortable with that. And I think it's very interesting and very different than what others are doing. I mean, it is who they are. They're not trying to escape it. They're not trying to be something they're not. And the fact of the matter is if they picked a different path and it's fine, it would be hard to pivot back. We are serving fresh whole muscle, hormone antibiotic-free beef. That is a totally different thing than you're going to eat at nearly all other restaurants, certainly traditional fast food. And you got to pay more for that, and you should want to. And when you see things like 10 for a dollar or two for five dollars, we can't do that because our ingredients cost more than that to bring it to you, and you should want to pay more for that. And frankly, who am I to argue? It's a little crunchy, the bacon is a little crunchy. I like that. It's delicious. I might finish this. Coming up, why Shake Shack believes it's got everything to gain by going global. I mean, there's so many opportunities for us to add to our license business. We see there's a huge, white space opportunity for us. And Katie Fogarty tells me what skills she's relied on while making the transition from Wall Street analyst to CFO. I would say just a lot of grit. I never thought it was going to be easy, and it's proved to be quite the learning opportunity. Okay, so you're moving in on me quick. Just trying to be with your fancy hands. I'm going to deal with your night because it's really bothering me. Ah, my night. He's a troublemaker. What did you get up to this weekend? You know, just robot stuff. A lot of chess. I was practicing for you. I know you're pretty good. Ooh, I don't like that. I will take this. Put it over here. Not cool. Not cool. All right, I will, I will concede. I can see. You've got me, Bid. Very good game. Well played. Thank you, sir. Thank you.

The business has grown internationally by working with licensed partners to operate restaurants. That's a trend they intend to keep going. Today we have Shake Shack since 16 countries everywhere from China to Singapore to the Philippines to London and beyond. We see it as a huge white space opportunity for us. Many restaurant brands struggle to move outside of their own core market in the United States. Perhaps it's something that's very New England and when they try to move outside of the New England area, guest reception is just not there. Or it's a West Coast brand that takes 50 years to bleed across the country. The thing about Shake Shack and the magic about it is this is a company.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3615,2022-10-16 19:52:45
15330," It's just not there. Or it's a West Coast brand that takes 50 years to bleed across the country. The thing about Shake Shack and the magic about it is this is a company that can sit here with only 200 restaurants in the U.S. today open up one in a Tier 2 city in China. And the guest reception for that restaurant is mind blowing. These are some of the largest opens that we've ever had. We have big plans for our license business. It's a really asset light cash accretive business for us. We love it. And we love it when our partners overseas make a ton of money because they're going to build more restaurants. So we're going to all continue to grow. I mean, there's so many opportunities for us to add to our license business. And certainly I get so many text messages from people traveling the world. If there is a Shake Shack there, guess which one this one is and if there's not one, why don't you have one here? The first Shake Shack in mainland China open in 2019 and there are now more than 20. Although the government zero COVID policy is weighed on revenues, the company is committed to expanding its presence. China is a fascinating business for us. It's one of the most exciting and biggest opportunities Shake Shack has. Over the initial couple of years of the pandemic, they've faired much better than we did here and much better than most places around the world. Today it has been erratic. It's been lockdown. It's been closures. But here's what's amazing. The resiliency of the Chinese people, our team over there is unlike anything I've witnessed. It is one of the toughest places to do business in the world. But our brand seems to be really resonating with people over there right now. And I see it as one of the biggest areas of growth we have at Shake Shack. Restaurants haven't been resonating with Wall Street recently. The sector has underperformed the S&P 500 for much of 22. But the industry is historically resilient. Restaurants are undervalued right now. It's because a person who has been following restaurants since I had hair. I think restaurants are probably the most flexible and most creative of businesses that we have. The routine and the social engagement happens at restaurants. And that's not changing just because we may or may not go into the recession. It just isn't going to change. And so the restaurant sucks will rebound. This industry is the third largest employer, you know, all the population of workers in this country. This is like the fabric of the economy. And the economy will rebound and restaurants stocks will blow up. If you want to trade in and out of Shake Shack, you know, you just may not be the time for you. If you are a believer in the brand of Shake Shack for the long term, like we are and have been, we're going to create tremendous value for our shareholders over time. We've done that. Shareholders should measure us on are we building things for the long term? And if you want to be here for the long term, my sense is Shake Shack is going to be a good bet. One of Shake Shack's long term assets is a bright new CFO. Katie Fogarty now has a year of experience under her belt. I wanted to know what she sees when she looks ahead. What's the opportunity for Shake Shack in the next 10 years that excites you the most? I have to say it is in watching our people grow and develop. I see a very strong growth roadmap here for the company in terms of units and sales potential but what that really means at the end of the day is that our hourly team members are able to grow a career with us in a way that is unique to Shake Shack and cannot be found at many other restaurant brands. We have a number of people who start off as hourly team members and are now making six figures and have equity because they've grown up through the system and they're paying it forward by training other people to allow them to have such a great career path as well. What's the challenge over the next 10 years that keeps you up at night? It also goes with people. It has been a very challenging staffing environment for the restaurant industry as a whole. It's been well telegraphed that some people have just left the industry altogether. We know when we have high turnover, we're not operating at our best. I do think that there's an amazing opportunity that once the world stabilizes and returns back to normal that we have people considering the restaurant industry as more of an exciting long-term career. In terms of your role as CFO, how do you see that or your role with this company changing and developing over the next 10 years?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3616,2022-10-16 19:57:33
15331," an exciting long-term career. In terms of your role as CFO, how do you see that, or your role with this company, changing and developing over the next 10 years? I think that it becomes ever more important to have a great grasp on the insights that are driving the business, on the factors that are driving your business. And that's very important for CFO to do, but also to collaborate with other business leaders within the company to help cross-pollinate strategies. Whatever I do in a vacuum is not going to be nearly as impactful as our entire executive leadership team coming together and acting on something. And I think that that is ever more apparent, sitting on this side of the table, than it was on the other side as a Wall Street analyst. Speaking of that, what skill or what area of knowledge do you think has helped you the most in your first year as CFO? I would say just a lot of grit. This has been a very challenging industry for sure. I never thought it was going to be easy and it's proved to be quite the learning opportunity. Coming in every day just excited to learn something new and make a difference wherever you can, knowing that I'm sitting here with a team of people growing a company that will potentially have an impact on a number of people's lives going forward. So what advice would you give someone else than who maybe is watching and gets promoted to CFO? What advice would you give to a future CFO? What advice would I give to a future CFO? I guess I would just be get into the details super, super deep and really kind of understand and ask a lot of questions. Peel the onion. I think a lot of people just don't go deep enough and don't ask the questions so that you actually cannot, if you're not versed on what's going on, you can't find root cause and you can't drive change. So I would say get into the details, have an open mind. It's an incredibly fun job for sure, working with people who are coming, everybody's aligned here to drive the future of Shake Shack, but everybody comes at it from a different angle. So it's very exciting to work with an amazing team of people. I'm Matt Miller. This is Bloomberg. What are the moon shots at Amazon that are capturing most of your time and attention? Well, we have a unique way that we go get big new investments. And I'm not sure it's right or wrong, it just happens to be our way. And we ask ourselves when we're considering something for questions, we ask if it's successful can it be big and move the needle in Amazon? Is it being well served today? Do we have a differentiated approach and do we have confidence there and if not can we acquire quickly? If we like the answer to those questions, we'll go pursue it with a single threaded team that isn't distracted by the rest of the business. When it comes to the stock, it has fallen significantly. Do you think investors are missing something or has tech just been overvalued? I have never tried to predict what stocks may do. In any time I've tried to a little bit, I've been wrong. I do really believe that in the short term, the stock market tends to be a voting machine and the long term it tends to be a waiting machine. We have a concept we talk about a lot of Amazon inputs and outputs. The ultimate output for a company is share price. Then other big outputs are free cash flow or profit or revenue. You can't really manage the outputs. You have to manage at the input level and that's where we spend all our time. If you do the right things for the business long term, things tend to work out. I think we've had very good returns for investors and I expect that to be true again. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. The pressure cooker just got far too hot in banning them for the government to handle. You foresee two-thirds of the crypto hedge funds will disappear. Are we close?

Bloomberg, your global business authority. This is really a reminder, isn't it, just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see some pressure on the U.N.

15332," See some pressure on the Yuan, we did see some pressure on the future. That is now being reversed. Imagine simply climbing a cable into space. The concept is known as the space elevator. Not only could it significantly change how we leave planet Earth, but it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space. And they're a scientist who think we could have already built it. We have the material, we have the technology, we have the lasers, we have the climbers, we have all of it. If a private entity wants to build it, or a government, they can build it. It'll change society. We have no clue how colonizing in the space, how really spreading out in the space, really change our society over the next 50 to 200 years. It'll be completely different. The world is a world of science. Searching in vain for solid ground, in an escalating Russian war in Ukraine, and a troubled global economy, and goodness knows in the British Authority's economic management. This is Bloomberg Wall Street week, I'm David Weston. This week, Special Interpreter Larry Summers of Harvard, on the potential next shoe to drop economically. I doubt we've seen the last mine go off. Some of them may be in the private sector, I think more of them may be international. And former New Jersey governor and EPA administrator Christine Todd Whitman, on a path forward on nuclear energy. Nuclear hermitry, a huge role, at least in the transition from fossil fuels to renewables. Global Wall Street spent the week trying to get its footing after things only got worse in Ukraine, as Russian missiles rained down across the country, and NATO chief Yen Stoltenberg had to reassure us that things weren't about to go nuclear. Russia knows that the nuclear war cannot be won, and must never be fought. The IMF released its economic projections, and its chief economist warned that a global recession just may be looming. What we see is that about a third of the global economy is going to be experiencing a contraction this year or next. And if that weren't enough, President Biden told CNN recession may come specifically to the United States. I don't think there will be a recession. If it is, it will be a very slight recession. And then the CPI numbers came in hotter than expected, with the headline numbers still up at 8.2%, and core accelerating to 6.6% year over year. It is not a good picture here. Those who were thinking that inflation might drop off fairly quickly, are going to be disappointed by the numbers here. In the meantime, over in Great Britain, we had a week of financial turmoil, with a very public battle between the Bank of England and Prime Minister Trust's government, which ended up with a new chancellor of the ex-checker, and her giving up on more of her controversial budget. I want to be honest, this is difficult. But we will get through this storm, and we will deliver the strong and sustained growth, that can transform the prosperity of our country for generations to come. But the surprises weren't all bad this week, at least not for former Fed-share Ben Bernanke, who was awakened to learn that he shares with two others the Nobel Prize for economics this year. It was completely unexpected. My wife and I...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3618,2022-10-16 20:05:34
15333," Bernanke, who was awakened to learn that he shares with two others the Nobel Prize for economics this year. It was completely unexpected. My wife and I shut off our cell phones, we went to bed last night not thinking about this issue. And it was our daughter in Chicago who was finally contacted and called us on the landline to inform us that this had happened. And the markets had just as hard a time as the rest of us finding its footing with the S&P swinging five points between big losses and big gains on Thursday alone after the CPI numbers came out. For the week, the S&P 500 was down 1.55%, the NASDAQ down over 3% and yield on the 10 year was up over 13 basis points to close the week just above 4%. To help us sort out a wild week in the markets, welcome now Joanne Feeney, partner in advisors, capital management and Lizanne Saunders, chief investments strategist at Chow Schwab. So welcome back both of you to Wall Street Week. Let me start with you, Lizanne. What happened this week? I feel like we hit by a Mac truck. So I think it was probably mostly technical, the reversal that we saw yesterday on an intraday basis in the first part of the day, you did see the swoon take the S&P to below 3517. And I'm not a technician, but that level was important because it was the 50% retracement of the post pandemic move higher. And that probably kicked in a combination of buying hedges being taken off some short covering and that fed on itself through the end of the day. Maybe you could point to the move down in yields yesterday, the move down in the dollar, but that could also help to explain today's weakness too because you saw reversals there. So Joanne, a fair amount of noise, I think it's fair to say in the equity markets there, but on Friday actually they gave up pretty much everything they got back on Thursday. So when you net net, when you get through it all, what did we learn this week that should affect the markets over the longer term? I think what we learned is that there's still a lot of risks out there facing the future of the global economy, not just here in the US. And those two price reports we got, the PPI and the CPI, reinforce the view that inflation is going to be a really hard challenge for the Fed to solve. It also seems to have removed any wiggle room that people think the Fed has. They're really going to have to be adamant about raising rates, try to constrain liquidity, try to discourage consumer demand in order for inflation to get under control. There's not a lot of room for them to do anything but raise rates now for the next at least couple of meetings. The market finally perhaps is digesting that. Listen, there's a lot of talk about. Sorry, go ahead, please. I think Joanne's absolutely right. And I think there have been these moments where it seems like whether it's in reaction to things going on in the UK, that the markets almost cheering for or looking for some sort of financial system accident. Because of the messaging from the Fed, from Powell, that they're not going to step in because of financial market weakness across any of the asset markets or just volatility, but financial system instability. Maybe what could bring the Fed back in, but even in a situation like that, what they may do is use the tool of their balance sheet or repo facilities. Versus doing a pivot anytime soon on rates, and I'm not sure that's been fully digested by the market yet. Yeah, there could be certainly more digest in the comment, particularly because the risks that are out there are really unusual. You know, it's not just the inflation problem, right? The US has a labor shortage, born of the pandemic, born of early retirees, born of a lack of legal migration, immigration into the US. And that problem is not one that the Fed can solve. And so they still have very high consumer demand and a shortage of supply, no matter what the Fed does to try to curtail demand, there's going to be spillovers to also curtailing the recovery of supply from the pandemic. So they're sort of fighting this problem without having all the tools that are needed. And you know, the risks that are out there, you know, haven't really abated in many ways, although finally we're starting to see earnings estimates come down and market expectations adjust to those risks. LaZanne, I wonder whether part of the problem we have right now is it's not all bad. There are parts of the economy that actually continue to be quite strong. It's sort of like we've gone from a unipolar to a multiple world. We've gone to a multiple economy, it feels like sometimes. We have. And I think that's what's particularly unique about the pandemic, the nature of it, how it unfolded.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3619,2022-10-16 20:10:32
15334," So in multiple world, we've gone to a multiple economy, it feels like sometimes. We have, and I think that's what's particularly unique about the pandemic, the nature of it, how it unfolded, is that we've been in this rolling cycle. So during the throes of the pandemic, when all the stimulus kicked in, both on the monetary side and on the fiscal side, that stimulus and demand associated with it, was forced to be funneled into the good side of the economy, because of the absence of access to services, that became the breeding ground for the inflation, with which we're still dealing. Then as you saw reopening, you saw that pentound demand on the good side, you saw pent up demand on the services side, that tends to be the stickier components of inflation. So even though we're seeing disinflation now on the good side, we've got it on the services side. So it's very different than your typical slow down downturn recession, whatever you want to term it, because at least the last two, the COVID recession, the global financial crisis, in essence, the bottom fell out all at once in the economy. This is happening in a unique way, because it's sort of shifting through the economy and hitting pockets at different times. Well, and some areas of the economy are still expanding, even as some parts like PCs and smartphones, where a lot was purchased during the years of the worst of the pandemic, now those sales coming down, but look at auto production. That industry is still suffering from a lack of the chips needed to finish off cars, and they're putting cars in inventory waiting for that last chip to arrive, for example. And the semiconductor companies that supply them still have a very long runway of demand ahead of them. So there are parts of the economy that are still expanding, while others are being hit by lower consumer demand from high inflation, from the change in sentiment from spending on goods to services. So that's why I think it's become very hard to say, well, what kind of a recession might we get? Is it going to be broad base like recessions in the past? Or is it going to be more specific where lower middle and consumers suffering from the higher interest, suffering from inflation, really curtail their spending, like Walmart saw, whereas the higher end retailers are doing fine so far. So it's a very challenging time to forecast where the US economy is going, and how much unemployment might be created because of this constraint on liquidity from the rate increases. That means it's still possible to find potentially investments that do lead to growth over the, even the near term, as some of these industries continue to recover. And you know, Joanne, to your point about the upper end in better shape, as witnessed by what the retailers are saying, there's also that potential pressure just on psychology because of the wealth effect, given that even though the excess saving story has merit up the income spectrum, they're also challenged by not just equity market losses, but bond market losses, real estate losses. So I think that's why I think we all have to be careful about extrapolating that excess savings up the income spectrum as a guaranteed feed into the consumption side of the economy. I think even there, there might be some hesitancy. Joanne, last thought here, we'll talk about when is the market going to find them out? When is the bad news bound out? When do we know we got it all out? We know how to deal with the wealth from here. Well, I think you almost never know that ever. I mean, think about the risk, the global economy is facing, right? It's not just the US and inflation problems globally. Right? We have the war in Ukraine, and there are some maybe low probability but very large risks associated with that. And then you have China, and they're continuing zero COVID policy, which seems to be having rolling disruptions to supply, which don't help our inflation problem. And now we have more of an economic war against China with the latest round of restrictions on exports of semiconductor equipment and high-level chips. And the real question there is, will there be retaliation from China in terms of restrictions against access to the Chinese market? Which is still, you know, hope to be one of the fastest growing markets in the world, and now we might find that US companies don't get access to that. So we shouldn't assume that the worst is in at this point, and we should expect that markets are going to continue to be volatile as some of those risks get realized or clarified. John Feney and Lizard Sotters will be staying with us as we try to figure out what to do with our money in these turbulent times. Let's go ahead.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3620,2022-10-16 20:14:47
15335," as some of those risks get realized or clarified. Joanne Finney and Liz Ann Saunders will be staying with us as we try to figure out what to do with our money in these turbulent times. Let's go ahead and up next on Wall Street Week. I'm Bloomberg. intimidated again! We make it very transparent to the shopper before they accept an order. What is the order? How much we are going to pay them and how much consumer is paying them. They can decide whether they take an order or refuse it. That is the flexibility of the shoppers to value and transparency they want. Are you seeing a labour shortage right now? What are you doing to combat that? It is different in different places. The demographic of shoppers is completely different from food delivery and our right sharing, where 70% women and half of them are moms. That is because a lot of the job at Instacart is very different than just being in a car with strangers. It is about going to the store, doing a good job of customer service, of really picking the right products for the consumer. And we are seeing that being very appealing to women. Well, this was the week when Wall Street got much of what it had been asking for and then decided quite characteristically that it didn't like it. The economy is simmering down as requested. Industrial production took its worst fall in more than a year. Business inventories are rising ominously. A housing industry's trade association said its members were virtually out of business. That of course was Louis Ruckus here on Wall Street. Back in 1981, believe it or not, 41 years ago now, when all the markets wanted was a slowing economy and the lower interest rates that they thought would come with that. The big move that week was a romantic comedy. You may not remember it with Bert Reynolds named paternity. And the number one song was Arthur's theme from that Dudley Moore film named Arthur. Now the problems are very different as interest rates are on the way up, not down. And the economy is still very robust by most measures. Still with us are Joe Anfini of Advisors, Capital Management and Liz Ann Saunders of Charles Schwab. So Joe Anfini, come to you. What do we do with our money in this world? What does it make sense to invest with this much volatility, this much uncertainty? It's really been challenging time for investors and it really depends what sort of time frame you have as an investor. If you're in retirement, what you probably need is some assurance that you're going to be able to get the cash flow you need off of your portfolio. And so one of the things we've done for our clients in that kind of a situation is to create portfolios with above average dividend yields on the one side. And now as bond yields are rising and we've kept our duration relatively short, we've been able to let bonds mature and then re up at higher yields. So one area to go to is some relatively stable companies, whether it's a general mills or an ABV or some of the others in consumer staples and in energy that have dividend yields in the four, five, six percent range. And that way they can still get that income and they can ride out the volatility in the stock prices and wait this out. And that gives our clients a fair bit of comfort. But you know, it has a monisi real.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3621,2022-10-16 20:19:07
15336," And that way they can still get that income and they can ride out the volatility in the stock prices and wait this out. And that gives our clients a fair bit of comfort. But it hasn't been easy really for anybody, but that's one way to deal with the volatility. Luzanne, what do you recommend these days? Well, first of all, I absolutely agree with Joanne that there's no cookie cutter answer to a question like that. It really does depend on who the investor is, their risk tolerance, their past experience, their time horizon. Whether they're financial risk tolerance and their emotional risk tolerance, whether there's a narrow gap between the two or a wide gap between the two. But I think we're in a part of the market cycle right now where you want to actually focus on fundamentals. And I know that sounds trite and sounds what we're always supposed to do. But gone are the days where you could look at segments of the market, components of say, big tech and look at it monolithically make an assumption that they're all going to go up simultaneously. There's much more differentiation in the market right now. And I'd say look for where things are dear from a macro perspective. So we have declining earnings revisions in the aggregate. So look for the factor around positive earnings revisions, positive earnings surprise. We know we're in a rising interest rate environment. So companies with strong balance sheets, low debt, high cash flow, strong free cash flow, lower volatility. It's just kind of a quality wrapper. And I think that's the best type of approach in this environment. And then the last thing we've suggested for those investors who can do it, if you were a rebalance or based on the calendar, maybe instead of doing it once a year, once a quarter, let your portfolio and the volatility associated with dictate the timing of taking advantage of the volatility by adding into weakness, trimming into strength relative to your overall strategic asset allocation. Joe, and what about the possibility of fixed income at this point? I mean, for a long time, you didn't want to be in bonds, given what was going on in bonds. But those yields have really come up. They're yielding something now. And they do generate cash. It's sort of like dividends, right? Yeah, absolutely right. We're getting in the order of 6 plus percent in yields in our all investment grade fixed income solution. And when you pair that with in a balance strategy with the equity front, you know, you can generate a pretty nice cash flow for clients. And so if you keep duration short and you're really careful about selecting credit quality, because credit spreads have widened here. So you want to be careful that you're not adding risk to the side of your portfolio that it's supposed to be sort of the suspenders on the pants, right? To provide more stability. And so that's one thing we've done in its help our clients. I feel a lot more comfortable in this kind of environment. Liz Anna, you do the point yet where you'd consider duration that is going longer duration for fixed income? So my colleague Kathy Jones, who's a regular guest on Bloomberg, she's our fixed income strategist. And in the sort of four-ish percent range, we have suggested you consider lengthening duration. But I agree with everything that Joanne said too. I think there are finally opportunities. We've gone from a teen environment. There is no alternative to TIA. There is an alternative. And there's income and fixed income again. And there are strategies, a bit more active strategies that you can employ to take advantage of this move up in yields. Even well down the duration spectrum, you're actually generating a yield. If inflation ever came down, we might actually have positive real yields. We're not quite there yet, but I think we'll get there. Well, Liz Anna, I wanted to pick up. That was exactly the point I was going to make is the challenge is that inflation is so high that even if you're getting those appealing yields on fixed income, you're still losing purchasing power. And so that's why we continue to counsel if the client has appropriate risk tolerances in time horizon. The equity side can help you offset the cost of inflation. For example, one of the stocks in one of these portfolios is McDonald's. Now what you want is to find a company like that that has good cash so that can continue to pay its dividend. But more importantly, even, can raise its dividend year after year. And they just announced this week a 10% increase in their dividend. So you're being compensated, more than compensated, for that cost of inflation eroding the purchasing power of your money. And that's something that you're more likely to get on the equity side than you are on the fixed income side. Liz Anna, we're spending so much time on rates and on growth. And for that matter, geopolitics and things like Ukraine, we're not earnings. We are in.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3622,2022-10-16 20:23:28
15337," on the fixed income side. Lizanne, we're spending so much time on rates and on growth. And for that matter, geopolitics and things like Ukraine, we're not earnings. We are in earnings season now. We had the first four banks come out this week that they're earnings, which actually we're pretty reassuring to a lot of people. Is there a possibility that could help the investor right now to the upside? It's possible. I think the rub, though, is that even if we end reporting season with some sort of positive beat rate, we have to recognize that estimates have been coming down since the April, May period of time, both for the second half of 2022 and the first half of 2023. So it has been a lowered bar and much like the second quarter, we're still early, but expectations are that energy pretty much is all the earnings growth. So consensus right now, once the quarter is all said and done, a month from now or so, you'll have 3% overall S&P earnings growth. We exclude energy that goes down to minus 3%. And if that's the case, that would be worse than the second quarter. I think the path of least resistance for estimates is still down. I'd also say really important to watch and listen in earnings season, not just for, did you beat your numbers or your profit margins, what your profit margin outlook. If you're a multinational company, the impact of the incredibly strong dollar, whether you're hedging it or not, the impact of inflation, whether you have a lot of fixed costs or variable costs, what your labor costs are. So I think it's a lot of the details under the surface that matter as much as just the top line reading. Joanna, are you taking account earnings right now in your investment decisions? What are you anticipating? Well, you know, estimates have come down a lot, you know, as Liz Ann was saying. The real question I think around this earnings season is going to be guidance. And given the uncertainty and the real risks that are out there, I think companies are going to be extremely cautious. And I think investors expect that. It's really kind of a waiting game. We don't know if, when, how large a recession will be, how broad it will be. So investors are going to look to companies to get some clues about that. The companies that are out there on the ground, whether it's a Texas Instruments providing chips to the auto industry, you know, or a company providing chips to Apple. And that guidance, I think, investors are going to learn from. And I don't think they're going to hope for too much. I think we're expecting not very strong guidance for the fourth quarter. I think a lot of companies are going to defer and say, we're going to be more cautious. We're going to cut some costs. We're preparing for things to slow down. And that doesn't necessarily mean you have to change your investment allocations, though. Because if you're in it, not for the next six months, but you're in it for a couple of years, three years, five years. Right now, we have a lot of stocks that have become relatively inexpensive. So a little hope out there, at least. Thank you so much to Joe Anfini and Liz Ann. It's great to have you with us.

It's time now to look ahead to next week on Global Wall Street starting with Juliet Sally in Singapore. Thanks David. Chardonnay will dominate the agenda in the week ahead following the party congress. The PBOC sets its one year rate on Monday. Bloomberg economics expects it to remain unchanged. Tuesday will see a data blitz with third quarter GDP likely to show only a week recovery and September activity highlighting consumption weakness and the important role public investment is playing in propping up the overall recovery. Elsewhere Bank Indonesia is likely to hike by 50 basis points and Australia will probably report moderate jobs growth for September. Now over to Guy Johnson in London. Guy. The UK will remain the centre of attention both in Europe and globally. Monday the big question will the guilt market be able to cope without the recent support provided by the Bank of England or will govern a Bailey be forced to step back in? We've got guilt auctions peppered throughout the week. Wednesday we get inflation data. We also get housing data. And then on Friday we get retail sales plus we've got S&P and Moody's both updating their UK credit rating. We've got earnings also throughout the week food giants to know the Nestle are reporting Tuesday on Wednesday. Wednesday we also see the chip equipment maker ASMR reporting numbers pay attention to that one. And then on Thursday we get ABB Volvo and L'Oreal. A focus on earnings in the week ahead with reports from Bank of America. Goldman Sachs Verizon Netflix Tesla and IBM. But also play close attention to chip equipment maker lamb research. The semiconductor industry is reeling right now from the Biden administration's new restrictions on doing business with China. Restrictions that hit at a time when the industry was already grappling with a slowdown in demand. Economic data next week include industrial production, housing starts and existing home sales. Elsewhere shareholders of spirit airlines are scheduled to vote on whether to move forward with jet blues $3.8 billion offered to buy the company. And if you're a sports fan a great week ahead for you the NBA regular season tips off on Tuesday and major league baseball's postseason advances with the league championship games.

15339," Back in 1997, I was interested in the following question, which is there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called sauropod dinosaurs, which had really long skinny necks, so apodosaurus is an example. Now it was at really long skinny tails. So I made a computer model that showed that in fact the tail of these sauropod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip, a bull whip. Now the way a bull whip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. Okay. And that crack is a sonic boom. I think the way they got a date was to impress the females by making loud booms. Net Zero emissions. It's a lofty goal, but times are wasting. Just as John Kerry, President Biden's special climate envoy. Many companies are making promises to be net zero by 2050, but the reality is unless you do enough between now and 2030, you can't hit net zero 2050. And if we're really going to get there, Bill Gates says the math makes a pretty compelling case for nuclear power. You get a million times much energy per reaction as you do burning hydrocarbons. And so it's very advantage if you do the design right. Nuclear physicist and former energy secretary Ernest Moniz says it won't get done without a public private partnership. I think what we need to see is governments moving together with the financial sector and with the equipment providers to get new power plants over the finish line. But partnership or not convincing the public about safety may remain an issue given high profile accidents like Fukushima, Japan in 2011, when an earthquake led to a disaster at the plant causing tens of thousands of evacuations. All the nuclear power plants in this country, they operate really on this precipice of normal routine operation on one side and catastrophic accident on the other. And it's unclear exactly when kind of you'll fall to one side or the other, but it's certainly possible. So the question is what will it take, how safe it can be, and how soon can we get there, even for some who initially oppose the idea, but now embrace it. Given this challenge we face today and given the progress of fourth generation nuclear, go for it. And to give us some answer to these, this is very important questions we turn out to Christine Todd Whitman. She is president of Whitman Strategies. She is, of course, the former governor of the state of New Jersey and the former administrator of the EPA. So welcome to Wall Street Week. Really good to have you with this governor. You've dealt with nuclear energy for years now. So give us your sense of the role of nuclear energy potentially in getting to net zero. Well, I think nuclear and play a huge role, at least in the transition from fossil fuels to renewables. Renewables are not yet based energy. They're peak shaving and we're a 24 seven society, as is the rest of the world. The world is 24 seven. And nuclear is the only form of base power that releases no regulated pollutants or greenhouse gases while it's producing power. And we have an incredible safety record here in this country on nuclear. And actually with few obviously very huge exceptions being Chernobyl and what happened in Fukushima, Daiishi, overall worldwide. It's been, it's been safe and getting safe for all the time. I mean, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission is considered the gold standard on regulatory oversight of nuclear reactors. I don't think given costs and time that we're going to see any more large reactors built in this country, certainly. They are being built in China. They're being built around the world and we can certainly.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3625,2022-10-16 20:36:01
15340," I don't think given costs and time that we're going to see any more large reactors built in this country certainly. They are being built in China, they're being built around the world and we can certainly play a part in developing the parts for those reactors. But I see the future for nuclear right now being in the small modular reactors. Well, let's get to that and, well, first of all, give us a sense of the scope of it already. One of the things that I have learned is nuclear is actually one of the few things that really don't have emissions that can be taken to scale. I think something like 20% of energy in the United States is generated by 70% in France. Right. And you saw, in an example of what happens when you take nuclear offline, when California took the San Anofary nuclear reactor offline, their emissions went up and the cost of their energy went up. I mean, it was totally counter to everything that they were hoping to achieve in my mind. And so what I found over time is that if you have an opportunity to talk to people and answer their very real questions, I mean, it's normal to have questions about the safety and you should ask them. But the answers are really good and they're based on our history. You can prove that in fact, these things work. And once you do that with people, they get much more comfortable with the idea of nuclear. It's just that for so long, it's been used as frankly a fundraiser a lot in a lot of times for the environmental groups. And we need to get the public to understand particularly with the new small modular reactors that are built in a contained facility. They can be placed on site. They're much safer technology. They are much safer way to produce the nuclear energy. So overall, they are really, I believe, have the potential to make a huge difference, particularly if you think about the rural parts of America, where you're not on the grid, or you're not close to the grid. You can take a small modular reactor and provide power for an entire town or an entire business. So they have a lot of potential there. So let's pursue that question of safety because that is on a lot of people's minds without a doubt. And as you've mentioned, we've had some horrific instances. Is the issue with safety that people don't realize that actually the track record is quite good for nuclear? Or is it technological development such as you're referring to small module reactors? No, I think it's because people just don't know. They don't understand. I mean, I get a lot of questions I used to in the past about, well, what about the spent rods? And first of all, I tell them from all that when the time when we had 102 nuclear reactors in this country, and you took all those spent rods and you put them in one place, you'd fill up one foot fall field to the height of the goalposts. They might have gotten slightly above that now because this was data from several years ago. But the point being it's not this massive thing, the size of the state of Vermont that people kind of have in their minds. And the other thing is that what's in those spent rods is 97 to 90 percent fishable material, meaning unused energy. And in France and Japan, they figured out how to reprocess that and to get the energy out of those rods, rendering that what you have is the quote unquote, bad stuff to down to 15 percent, let's say. And it can't be used in a nuclear weapon. So it's much easier to store, much less to store. You have a lot of unused power just sitting there in these spent rods. And we should be using that technology as well. And people have to understand, and when you explain it to them, you can't take one of these rods from a nuclear reactor and put it in a missile. It's not the same technology. It won't work that way. And the other thing that you explained to them because one of the most immediate issues that we had in this country was three mile island. And when that went down, the operators in the utility itself, in the reactor itself, were never exposed to high levels of radiation. And they've been tracked ever since. There were no releases into the community. And even those who were right there in the reactor had no adverse reaction to what happened. And in fact, it was because they overrode the system really that you had the partial meltdown. Fukushima Daiichi, that wasn't because of the earthquake. It was because of the tsunami. And that was because they had their backup power, their generator located physically in the reactor.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3626,2022-10-16 20:40:48
15341," because of the earthquake, it was because of the tsunami. And that was because they had their backup power, their generator located physically in the reactor building. After 9-11, our Nuclear Regulatory Commission said to our nuclear industry, you got to move those out. They cannot be co-located with a reactor itself. So we, that kind of thing can't happen here anymore. Just this week, we saw an announcement of a deal to acquire Westinghouse Electric. Basically, on the premise, in effect, we're going to have more nuclear energy. Do you anticipate at that in the United States? Well, I certainly hope we do, but it was what, not even 10 years ago, I guess there were two, four proposed reactors, two in Georgia and two in South Carolina. We were very hopeful that those were going to come in on budget and on time. And they both ran over and the utilities decided in each case that it just wasn't worth going forward. So it is a question of cost and regulatory hurdles. But you want to have those regulations in place, because that's what protects the community and make sure that things are safe and streamline how you approach them. So that you make them go through all the hoops they have to for safety, but to put it to the front of the line to get this power online. The big problem we have, though, when you talk about all of this, is the grid itself. It's old. It needs to be revamped. It can't handle a lot of new power coming in. And that's one of the big challenges that seems to get so overlooked a lot when we're talking about these issues. Again, you go back to small modular reactors, which can actually function on their own. What about the grid? Are we investing in the grid? We have the bipartisan infrastructure bill. We also have the so-called inflation reduction act, which had money in there as well. Is there money in there for the grid? Is it enough? There is money in there for the grid, whether it's enough or not, I doubt it. Hopefully the money that's there will be spent in a way that ensures that nothing is wasted because we need every penny of it. Certainly every penny that's in there is needed to get the grid updated and to where it needs to be in order to accept the new power, whether it's from nuclear or renewables. I mean, they're going to depend on that as well. Okay, Governor, thank you so very much for being with us. Really appreciate this former Governor Christine Todd, Whitman Now Whitman's strategy. My pleasure. Coming up, we wrap up the week with our special contributor Larry Summers of Harvard. That's next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. Big, expensive cities have a lot going for them. But if you live in one, you probably notice that these big, expensive cities keep getting more, well, expensive. You could always move away. You might have just started working remotely, so there's really nothing keeping you there. But then again, moving is a hassle. Well, what if someone paid you 10 grand to do it? What if they threw in free office space, a bicycle, or a gym membership? Programs and cities and states around the US are doing exactly that, and they're getting a lot of interest. We've had over 50,000 applications. About 90,000 applications. We've had over 1800 applicants from all over North America. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them? Are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns for places looking for an injection of fresh talent?

15342, about org slash now with a music plays on the s o season sponsor bank of america this is wall street week i'm david weston welcome once again are very special contributed wall street week is larry summers of harvard so larry we got the cp i numbers in that we'd waited for this week and boy they came in how to expect it's been doing this repeatedly now what do you read in these numbers not so much hotter than i expected inflation's got a lot of momentum the best single measure to look at for inflation is a kind of super core measure which is wages where you can look at the median component of uh... inflation they've just been running strong for a long time not decelerating so i think team transitory is engaged in a lot of uh... wishful thinking and i must say that i'm struck by the hypocrisy of some friends of mine like paul crewgman are very quick now to focus on housing and the fact that uh... the private indices lead the public indices when the private indices are looking soft but were entirely unwilling to credit that argument or to pay attention to the private indices some months ago when the private indices were obviously pointing to an acceleration of inflation so i think we've got to be very uh... very careful here if we want to be credible about containing inflation how much momentum is built into inflation how can you tell what are you looking at right now they tell you what happens in the fourth quarter and as we go into next year i'm looking at core measures i'm looking at super core measures that take housing out take use cars out in addition to taking food and energy out i'm looking at the so-called median inflation component whatever product it is that's right in the middle i'm looking at the so-called trimmed mean that looks at the middle half of the distribution of product prices and very crucially for me i'm looking at wages um... which is a kind of super core measure because labor goes into everything and all of those are saying that inflation is not really coming down very fast if it's coming down at all and that it's way above uh... the two percent target or any acceptable level besides the cpi numbers larry a very big story throughout the week has been and continues to be great britain uh... where you had the bank of england come in with their emergency buying of long-term guilt that is due to expire on friday and this week same time we now have a list trust coming out and making some changes give us your a take on what's going on in the british economy and put more importantly the management of the british economy look i think this is probably going to be a textbook case of crisis creation followed by uh... crisis uh... mismanagement i'd be surprised if we were in the seventh inning of uh... this particular set of challenges uh... i had said before that people hook now i think understand very clearly that when you do a military intervention you should never give a sunset date when you're going to leave because it just in bolden's the opposition and i think something similar is true of last resort finance where the kind of deadline the bank of england gave i think is asking for trouble uh... down uh... down the road so i think we're gonna see more tremors more aftershocks more problems at the same time i think we need to recognize that as serious as the british policy errors were this might well not have happened if global economic conditions uh... were more normal and the kind of excesses we've had uh... in the system mean wherein,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3628,2022-10-16 20:49:11
15343," If global economic conditions were more normal and the kind of excesses we've had in the system mean we're in very complicated territory. Well exactly Larry, I guess I'm asking to say we have global, slow down, IMF this week came out and said we're looking at a global slow down at the same time we have central banks and development countries really all raising rates at the same time. What is the likelihood we're going to see similar, won't be the same but similar sorts of problems elsewhere, particularly when it comes to very highly leveraged places and places that are more difficult to see some of the private credit, some of the non-bank banks. I doubt we've seen the last mine go off. Some of them may be in the private sector, I think more of them may be international. Something that disappointed me at the IMF World Bank meetings this week was the number of countries who were reporting that they're having substantial difficulty in getting market access. And I must say I'm sort of disappointed by official sector people, people from the ministries of finance and the central banks who are talking about how we're going to work with the private sector to catalyze trillions of dollars of finance for green transitions in all these countries. But don't seem to be doing anything about the fact that many of these countries can't even issue a bond today. So I think there's a whole set of very important challenges with respect to developing countries and emerging markets. And I'd have to say that I don't feel those challenges were really met this week. There are some fires burning and fire department is still mostly in the station. So as we speak to you, you are in Washington for those IMF World Bank meetings and the IAF as a practical matter. You were very outspoken in a project syndicate piece, also actually speaking with David Melpest, they had the World Bank. About the role of the World Bank right now on things like sustainability. What is going on there is the World Bank playing the role it should be playing and what should it be doing? No, I think it is playing its usual roles in its usual way. And I think generally the economic crisis of the moment demands major changes in approach just as the security crisis in Ukraine demanded major changes in approach. And we're not really quite seeing it yet. The World Bank needs to be much more aggressive in the use of its balance sheet and it also needs to get much more capital. Instead of having a fight about which of those two things is more important, we need to do both of them. Because the one mistake we're certain not to make is over investing in the green transition. And so we need to make sure we're doing everything we can to support that transition. So if there is a lack there Larry, often that lack comes from a lack of leadership. Do we not have the leadership we need either from the United States Treasury, the White House, or for that matter at the World Bank? And would you ever consider taking over that role? I think that we do need leadership that points towards larger changes in business as usual than we're seeing in the financial area. And I think there's some mistakes being made right now at a very, very difficult moment in Africa, at a very, very difficult moment in Latin America. Larry, very difficult moment in parts of Asia. Larry, one piece of news which was actually really hit the markets but has not gotten too much attention is what the United States did. It was picked as semiconductors. And China, the chip's market really went down substantially. It took a lot of the tech with it. At a time of so much difficulty globally, what are the possible effects of those sorts of trade actions? You know, the kind of large-style cutoff on cooperation and semiconductors that the Biden administration announced. I don't think it's possible to pass an overall judgment on that without understanding the security.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3629,2022-10-16 20:53:29
15344," Biden administration announced. I don't think it's possible to pass an overall judgment on that without understanding the security risks that they saw, which depend on classified information, which those of us on the outside don't have. But this was a highly consequential increase in economic aggressiveness. This is different than a trade fight over a specific product or a specific trade practice. This was a pretty across the board effort in something that's very, very difficult to challenge China's ability to grow and to develop technology. And so I think it's going to have some far reaching implications. Very finally, we did have the announcement of three of your fellow economists receiving jointly Nobel Prize for Economics this week. Tell us about what you took away from that award. Look, I think it was the analytical recognition of something that practical people had known for a long time, which is that banks and finance are different, that they're subject to confidence crises that are kind of apart from the fundamentals of what's going on, and that you got to be very mindful in public policy to maintain confidence in financial intermediation in a way that's a bit different than you have to with respect to manufacturing companies or airlines or something else. It was very fundamental research, theoretical research in the case of Diamond and Deb Vig using mathematics. Careful, historical study in the case of Bernanke that I think served him very well during his time at the Fed. Okay, thank you so much to Larry Summers, our very special contributor here at Wall Street Week. Coming up, you can't always get what you want, no matter how much you're willing to pay for it.

When money is no object, watch out. Let's face it, toys usually cost money. And the bigger the toy, the more money it costs. Take for example Jeff Bezos' new yacht, the largest sailing yacht in the world at 417 feet and costing upwards.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3630,2022-10-16 20:57:24
15345," toy, the more money it costs. Take, for example, Jeff Bezos knew yet the largest sailing yet in the world at 417 feet and costing upwards of $500 million. Or Elon Musk agreed to plunk down $44 billion for the prize of owning Twitter. Something most people think is worth a lot less than the price tag. That is if he ends up paying it. There's two options here. One, you know, the deal falls apart and this stock that has been sort of artificially inflated is going to crash. Or if things go the way Twitter wants, then they get the guy in charge who, you know, for the last three months has been saying that Twitter's been lying about its user base. But what happens when you spare no expense? Go all in, put all your chips on the table and don't win your dream prize. Consider the case of Hillary Clinton's campaign spending $1.4 billion on the 2016 presidential race, substantially more than Donald Trump's $960 million and coming up short. This is not exactly the speech at the Capitol. I hoped to be giving after the election. More poor Columbia pictures, which in 1987 decided to make Ishtar, figuring anything with Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty just couldn't fail. But for some reason, a movie about two lounge singers involved in a coup in the made up country of Ishtar didn't quite land with the audiences. Columbia lost around $40 million on the deal, almost $100 million adjusted for inflation today, and the dud established Ishtar as the synonym for box office flop. This is the oasis. Does this look like an oasis deal? Yeah, look at the birds. Are those cultures? And now we can add Steve Cohen to the list of those who went big and lost. The hugely successful hedge fund manager paid around $2.5 billion to buy the New York Macs. And this year took it to number one, at least in player salaries. But sad to say for fans of the Amazons, number one in payroll doesn't mean number one on the diamond. The team lost the third game of a wildcard playoff by a score of six to nothing. It was executing pitches and the wheels fell off. I don't know why. We just couldn't figure out a way to get some runs, some off things going. Leaving Mr. Cohen to spend the winter going back to first base. And thinking hard about whether that $278 million in player salaries just maybe wasn't enough. They're going to get to this great point and they have all this momentum behind them and then they then they blow it. That's the match. That's met's thing. That does it for this episode of Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. This is Bloomberg. See you next week. I think it's a market that over the past few weeks has made it clear it wants to go higher. It got a little spooked by the idea that real political attention was rising. It's crucially important and I think we've moved from this attitude from its intelligence a waste of time almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s and so it makes it a really exciting field because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3631,2022-10-16 21:02:07
15346," We're in the 1970s or 1980s. And so it makes that a really exciting field, because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harnessed to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart. If you can spit back a lot of facts. But if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what you bring, figures out what you're sleeping. We will never break. We will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never. There's an old saying in finance that cash is king. But when it comes to payments, the debt is suggests that's no longer exactly the case. According to the latest World Pay Report, cash now figures less than 20% of in-person transactions around the world. The payments tend to the street from the beginning is really focused on getting people to use electronic forms of payment. In fact, if you look at the US, for example, you basically have been moving around 2 to 3% of payments from cash and check to some form of direct electronic just about every single year. Total card volume of X China today at $20 trillion. And there's another $14 trillion worth of cash and check left to digitize. Even at 80% level, card penetration is growing. So yes, we are moving towards a cash-less society. A new technology is promised to kick these trends into a higher gear. The terminal on the till of the merchant. Now, depending on how old one is, one is used to that, at least in the developed world. But that is not everywhere. But everyone has a phone. So electronic payments can end up in a super simple way in everybody's hands. And for our business, that's a massive growth opportunity. Mastercard is already seizing that opportunity. After dipping in 2020, revenues shot past pre-pandemic levels in 2021, driven by a rebound to consumer spending. CFO Sachin Mehrer knows this boom is likely to fade. And he's set on finding ways to keep the momentum going. The key to being successful in this kind of an environment is to have a diversified portfolio. You've got to be nimble from an expense standpoint. You've got to be very disciplined. As a finance officer, what I've got to do with I've got to make sure that we are investing in those resources, which are currently in demand from a customer standpoint. But at the same time, I'm not losing sight of the long term. CEO Michael Meebak, Counts on Mehrer, do more than just oversee the balance sheet. The top line for me is, um, advisor and confident. He's your conciliary. Yes, he's quite happy pushing back and saying, uh, vice versa. The role of the chief financial officer has actually changed fairly dramatically over this 20 plus year tenure that I've had. You know, in the past, it was more of a function of, you know, let's make sure the numbers are good. Let's make sure we get a great control environment. Let's make sure we're actually able to close the books on time. Let's make sure we've got all the financial elements of the business in order. The job of the CFO in our view, in my view, is a function of making sure we're creating the right linkage between what the purpose of the businesses, what the strategy of the businesses, and delivering on the financial returns for the company, or while driving long term shareholder value. We're in the business of leading beyond the numbers. It's great that we know what the numbers are. How do we use those numbers to better drive execution of the business to accomplishment of the strategy of the company? Music MasterCards core business is no surprise, cards. Carded products currently account for over half the company's revenue. The company said ambitious growth targets that is 2021 investor day, committing to expand this",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3632,2022-10-16 21:06:42
15347," Cards. Carded products currently account for over half the company's revenue. The company said ambitious growth targets at its 2021 investor day, committing to expand this core and to diversify beyond it. We've been on a six-year strategy to be a multi-rail company in plain English that means whichever way you pay people enabled at. Despite the fact that Cards is in our name, it's essentially any type of payment. We have the reach, so I think we're reasonably well positioned. I mean, you've just got to recognize not only where the consumer is today but where they're going to go because a lot of what we've got to do takes time to implement. And is it difficult? You'll get some, you'll get it right sometimes, you'll get it wrong sometimes, but hopefully you're getting it right more often than you can get wrong and you're working your way through that. Forecasting preferences is complicated by an uncertain economy. Consumer confidence has been plunging to historic lows and recession calls are getting louder. Still, a slowdown isn't likely to cause a crisis for MasterCard and its peers. Contrary to what people often perceive, I think payment as an industry will be quite resilient in the downturn. Generally speaking, even during a recession, the amount that consumers spend actually does not go down. It continues to grow. I think the thing that people are worried about more in the payments industry is kind of how does the mix of spending change. The first thing that typically happens if you're going into a recession environment is people tend to pull back on discretionary categories of spend. They move into the non-discretionary categories of spend. They pivot into food, they pivot into rent, those kind of payments which are most important for them to meet. But the real still stay the same. So the real which run debit and credit are exactly the same. The technologies are the same, the distribution models are the same. So those areas don't necessarily change by virtue of moving into more of a debit or credit environment. One area that MasterCard has been moving vigorously into is B2B payments, a market expected to reach 25 trillion dollars by the end of the decade. We think this tremendous promise in the B2B area, the card business as in the elements of the B2B space which are served by Cards are doing well, are they doing very well. It's in the small business space, in the mid market, it's in the large corporate space, all of them do really well. On the accounts payable site, I would say we're in the build phase. And here we're about building an open loop environment to enable payments on accounts payable rails. Whereas the opportunity in that space is different to consumer payments where there is a global standard, the global standard is MasterCard, the global standard are card payments because that's been established. That isn't quite established yet in B2B. And I think the more benefits we bring into the payments that are easier than just making a really complicated cross-border payment, I think we will find out way there and we're going to see an explosion of creativity and a lot of other companies coming in and using those rails innovating on top of them. Pursuing new opportunities takes capital. MasterCard has spent billions acquiring companies that add capacity and diversifies infrastructure. Acquisitions and partnerships have helped MasterCard offer more value-added services to their clients, tapping into a lucrative revenue stream. What we call services, which includes data, insights, consulting, managed services, loyalty and our fraud capabilities, is roughly 35% of the revenues of this company. Wow. So it's not insignificant. So oftentimes people think MasterCard and think card. Very important, but there's a very different part of MasterCard as well. From a balance-chef perspective, MasterCard has maintained a healthy leverage ratio even as it's put more resources into acquisitions and taken on more debt. Given the company's flexibility to continue investing. We don't go in and say, well right now valuations are low and they were a year ago, let's go and buy something. That is an opportunistic approach and doesn't work for us. For me, it always starts, what are we trying to accomplish from a strategy standpoint? What are inherent capabilities we as a company have? What are the gaps in our inherent capabilities to meet that strategy? And then for those gaps, is it best to build by or partner? And then we're out there and we're trying to find a right companies together and it's going to make sure that we have a clear view on short and long-term synergies and so forth. And then we both talk to shareholders and to investors to explain what we're doing and why we're doing it and why it's good. For us for the officers the other part is...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3633,2022-10-16 21:11:28

Shareholders have reason to appreciate MasterCard's capital allocation strategy. It's included annual share buybacks and steadily increased dividends. How do you prioritize the amount of money that you put toward innovation and toward building out different businesses versus share buybacks and dividends because MasterCard has traditionally had robust program in rewarding shareholders? Right. First call of capital is towards growth of the business. After we have done that, it's about making sure we're being good stewards of capital and returning excess cash to shareholders with a bias towards share buybacks. And then once you start to come to say, I have dealt with my strategic priorities. I either have invested in my organic growth or in acquisitions, then access cash, we will return back. Generally with a preference for buybacks over dividend because it gives us more flexibility, but that's been a good model for us. It's been working well and it's been well received by the market. Coming up, how the tap has taken MasterCard places that the swipe alone could not. What it's really made a difference on has been in terms of how it's driving a shift from cash to electronic forms of payment, particularly on the small ticket items. And later how MasterCard has staked out a place in the volatile universe of cryptocurrencies. In the crypto world, we play the role as an on-gram. This is Bloomberg. What's Bloomberg's surveillance early edition for the news you need when you need it? I'm not in a little bit of Kayleigh Lyme's in New York and N-Adwords in London. The straightiest central bank raises interest rates twice as much as bull cars. Then surveillance for in-depth analysis. Besides Tom Kane and Lisa Brownbott, some Jonathan Ferro, the RPA, fronts and cents. How does Japan get away with not raising rates? Can it sustain its normal at a time when everybody else is facing a very different reality? Bloomberg surveillance. Be informed. Be prepared. Be ahead of the game. Such and Merra joined MasterCard as group executive in corporate treasure in 2010. Over the next decade, he took on several different roles before being appointed Chief Financial Officer in 2019. That's a very different path than the one he started out on. I grew up in India. I went to school there. I went undergrad there. I worked with a family business there. It's a textile business, which my grandfather started. My dad and my uncle took over. And then my brother and I got into. And I worked with him for three and a half years. Then I came here for business school. The moment of truth came on graduation day. My dad got on the phone. He congratulated me. He said, well done. He graduated. I'm looking forward to having you back home. My brother was older than I am. Went to business school to his well, and went back home and worked with my dad. Got on the phone. He congratulated me and said, so such and what are you going to do with your life? And I'm going, well, why are we having this discussion? Dad wants me to come over to work with a family business. He's like, yep, that's what dad wants you to do. What do you want to do? And then it really got me thinking. And I said, hey, given a chance, I'd love to work in finance in the US. Mira took the chance, even though it took him six months to land his first job at General Motors, where he worked for over a decade. Then it was on to the energy industry at Hes Corporation before finding his way to MasterCard. Today, my dad couldn't be proud of the fact that I chose the path I did. Obviously, he misses the fact that we're not there as a family. But that's just part of life, right? We've all got to grow in blossoming room. Did he accept it at the beginning? It took him all of 30 minutes to get there. When Mira gets together with his team and the employee, Cafe, and MasterCard's campus, it's clear that he's in his element. Well, more important, more fun stuff. What's the plan for the weekend? And of course, the Cafe provides a demonstration of the tap and go technology that's changed the game for payment companies. Can I just get a regular coffee with you? Can you want regular coffee? With both of these. Yeah. OK, that would be 571. You got it? All right, we can make this work. There we go. I think contactless is a very powerful catalyst for accelerating gas Japan conversion in the last two years.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3634,2022-10-16 21:15:49
15349," I think contactless is a very powerful catalyst for accelerating gas Japan conversion. In the last two years, what we have seen in the US is God penetration could road trade annually has doubled versus what was the average in the prior five years. The pandemic was one of the reasons people didn't want to touch cash. There's a lot of e-commerce purchases. The contactless definitely contributed to this growth as well. It's made a change. It's really made a difference. What it's really made a difference on has been in terms of how it's driving a shift from cash to electronic forms of payment, particularly on the small ticket items, which is really, really important. Because at the end of the day, our model is as much about converting the dollar value of the spend as it is about the number of transactions we can get over our network. And even though it happens to be a $2 transaction, a transaction is a transaction on which we may have an e-commerce. Mastercard introduced PayPass, its first contactless payment system in 2002. But the technology took some time to gain traction. I would say we first invested in this many, many, many years ago. The adoption rate on this in the early part, even in markets like the UK, Canada, Australia, was fairly slow in the early part. The inflection point of when it really started to hit its right was when it was used in the transit vertical. So what we figured is, let's get all the transit systems around the globe, enable for contactless technology. That will create muscle memory for the consumer who will like the experience in transit and will use it elsewhere. How do you judge the revenue proposition for Mastercard with an innovation like that and the adoption and the pace of it? For us, we're agnostic as to whether somebody is using the chip technology or the contactless technology or using the MagStripe, which was the old way of doing business. We own revenues which are quite similar across both of those. The revenue potential and upside for us comes from the fact that now more spend is being done on card-based forms of payment than was being done in the past. So we're converting that cash over to electronic forms of payment, which is where the incremental revenue comes from. If contactless payments is the current revolution sweeping the payments industry, what's the next one? I think pay with you smile. So biometrics, I think that's where it's going to go. And I think we've reached that point and people are sick of too many passwords. People are sick of typing in stuff and there's also too many wallets and other IDs and stuff that is around. So why don't you just, everybody has a smile. So just play with you smile. There you go. And I think that's what you're investing in that. How quickly do you see that becoming the next tap and go? Yeah, so look, I think this is going to take a while. These things have an adoption curve, which typically is fairly flat in the early part and then you start to see some level of ski. MasterCards next breakthrough may be borne in one of its global tech hubs. The company has opened innovation centers in Australia, India, Europe, Canada and the United States. These are spaces where we draw in customers, where we draw the local community. We have them in big cities where the latest technologies and the players are all around us. In New York City, it's in tech alley and everybody in the tech industry is around us. It's a point where people want to work and be attracted to the best talent. And we go and this brings us back to the CFO. We go and look at our vitality index. So how are our revenues looking? What is generated from new products? What do we see? Is their real momentum? Is their real growth? And if you overlay that and link that back to our tech hubs in these regions where we have them, clearly that is what is driving our new solutions. From an investment standpoint, we try and make sure we've got our foot in the door and all of these new and emerging technologies. Because what we don't want to do is play favorites with one versus the other. We want to make sure we're investing just appropriate amounts of money to have skin in the game to know that if this thing is got legs to it, we want to be at the inflection point for them to write out. Can you act like Bond, James Bond? You're one of the Q movies and the laboratories we walk in and you sort of face off and clear the system and they sort of do this.

So long as we follow our principles, we think we're in really good shape. And Sachin Merra tells me what advice he'd offer a CFO just starting out in the job. I think it's important to stay calm. I think it's important to recognize that change is going to happen. You can't fight change. This is Bloomberg. We will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never break.

Why do the biggest names in business choose Bloomberg? That's a great question. Great question. Best question I get all night. Bloomberg, top experts, great questions. Like many of its counterparts in the payments and financial services industry, MasterCard has developed products and partnerships that bring cryptocurrencies into its networks. I think from the payments and payment system perspective, the players and members that make up that ecosystem are really agnostic. To them, crypto is just another occurrence, literally. Just another asset. At this point, the overall revenue contribution is still so small. It's very early. But if I am a hard company, it's better to invest and also lean in any partner with some of these companies. For future revenue growth rate versus kind of sitting on the sidelines. Crypto is a term that encompasses a number of different projects, including central bank digital currencies and private sector stablecoins. Also, digital assets like Bitcoin, whose volatile valuations and susceptibility to fraud, have raised plenty of anxiety among investors. MasterCard's long-term plans to stay in the space haven't wavered. We're not really in the crypto hype of investing around crypto. We like the fundamental technology and the promise that it brings to solve problems that have not been solved. So if we see more revenue coming out of B2B solutions, that leverage blockchain technology, for example, tokenized bank deposits, just to throw out one example, cross-border payments, whatever it might be. In the crypto world, we play the role as an on-gram. So people use MasterCard products to buy crypto, our debit and credit products. So that's the on-gram if people want to spend money as in fee-adcurrency to buy crypto, and we act as the off-ramp. And the off-ramp is when people want to encasher, we help them actually gain access to be able to use their crypto balances everywhere MasterCards accept it. We engage with central banks on central bank digital currencies. We engage with governments on how a policy could look like, how regulation could look like, we engage with the startup community and say, come on in.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3636,2022-10-16 21:23:36
15351," By digital currencies, we engage with governments on how a policy could look like, how regulation could look like, we engage with the startup community. And say, come on in, let's sit around the table in one of our tech hubs and we discuss what solution actually is needed by whom and how we can bring it together. They have the greatest idea, but the greatest idea needs a path to scale. That's what we can bring. Is there a potential liability because of the volatility, because of how Bitcoin and certain other cryptocurrencies have been painted? Is there any liability for MasterCard? Yeah, well, so long as we follow our principles, we think we're in really good shape. And the principles we care deeply about are stability, as in stability of the currency in question. Point number two, it must meet consumer protection requirements. It must meet the laws of the land. And this is not new news to us. We've done this in this space for the last 50 years. For everything we've been working with regulatory financial institutions on. And so, which is why when we got into this space, the first thing we did was to find principles. And we will keep abiding by those principles and what we do. Yeah, I feel happy because we're in the discussion. We're shaping the ecosystem. And then one day it'll look like what we have done in many other spaces over years, over the past years. Such in Merra is a leader within a company that has the power and reach to shape ecosystems. And he'll be making strategic and financial decisions that shape the business. I wanted to know what he sees when he looks ahead. What's the opportunity for MasterCard in the next 10 years that most excites you? There still remains a very sizable consumer payments opportunity, which we stand very well poised to actually capitalize on. This is the trend of the shift from cash to electronic forms of payment. If you think about it globally, there's still a ton of cash, which remains to be electrified. And that opportunity is huge. The second pillar for me is around we have identified over the past few years a sizable total addressable market in what we call new payment flows. Bucket number three is around services. It goes back to our insights, analytics, our fraud management capabilities, and everything we're doing in that space. And then the last piece around new networks, which is around open banking and digital identity. What are some of the challenges for MasterCard over the next 10 years that keep you up at night? It's around staying plugged in on what's going on from a technology innovation standpoint. And making sure we're leading from the front, not turning our back to it and saying, we're going to walk in the other direction. We've got to engage with people who could potentially be disintermediators, competitors to let them know what value we can bring while they're executing on their strategy. So that's number one. Number two is, look, I mean, the world is getting more and more into a regulatory environment, where regulators are playing a bigger role. Nationalism is playing a bigger role. It's important for us to continue to do everything we're doing by being deemed local. It's important to be a global company, but be deemed local. And that's going to be important for us to execute on. Because at the end of the day, sitting in my role as the CFO, strategies, grade, visions, fantastic, but what really matters is, can you really deliver and execute? And we've got to stay focused on execution. And that's what we do every day. What's the biggest change that you see a role having over the next 10 years? That's a very good question. Honestly, I'm not really in the business of predicting that much as it relates to how it's going to change. But I can see happening is greater emphasis on making sure we're leading from the front on executing, but also failing fast. And that's where a CFO can play a big role. And by that, I mean, you're not always going to win. The things you're going to do, hopefully you get more right than wrong, but recognizing things which are not working out and making sure you actually fail fast on them and get out of them. Because you can fall in love with stuff, keep doing it, keep wasting resources, to only realize that it's not going to pay off. And I think the emphasis around that is going to only increase for that for CFOs in a scarce capital resource environment. What advice would you give a CFO today? I think it's important to stay calm. I think it's important to recognize that change is going to happen. You can't fight change. What really matters is how you can get up and actually deal with that change. That's super important for a CFO. Being really clear and crisp in your communications. The outside world wants to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3637,2022-10-16 21:28:39
15352," and actually deal with that change. That's super important for a CFO. Being really clear and crisp in your communications. The outside world wants to hear in very simple terms what exactly this company stands for and why they should believe that you are a good investment. And notice I've said nothing about financials and I've said nothing about necessarily financial infrastructure and systems because I do believe as a CFO. Those things are table stakes. You've got to make sure that stuff happens. You've got to leverage technology, you've got to drive efficiency in the business. You've got to get the numbers right. You've got to have a good control environment. But what's going to call you apart is the other elements which I spoke about. If MasterCard can meet ambitious goals for growth in its core business and build on strategies that are taking payments to the next level, such in memorable deserve a lot of the credit. I'm Lisa Brahmowitz. This is Bloomberg. So is there more pressure when you're trying to win a basketball championship than when you're trying to please investors? Where's the greater pressure? I think it's definitely trying to win a championship. It's hard because when you invest and you know this, when you're investing, you can control a lot more things. When in a basketball court you can't control whether somebody's going to make a shot, you've got to get lucky. What's the greater pleasure making five times your money on a distressed debt investment or winning the NBA championship? They're both fabulous. I wish I could do one each year. That would be great. But I think there's a great feeling in being right on an investment. You've done a tremendous amount of work and you've made money for your clients, which I think is great. I think winning a championship is, it's a very surreal feeling because there's a whole city or state that is actually behind you. You know, we had 70,000 people at the finals and we had them all outside. We had 17,000 in stands and then literally like 60,000 people outside. And when we won, like just the joy that you had brought to the city was phenomenal. Hydrogen has a very special place in the universe. It's the first element on the periodic table. It is the most abandoned element in the universe. And when clean energy advocates think about what can we find which would be as easy to use as fossil fuels, they think about hydrogen. The fuel that will, when burn, only produce water. We like to imagine that if we just built enough of these and these, we could ditch fossil fuels and save the planet. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. There are some things where you just need a good old-fashioned combustible fuel. Now startups around the world are betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century. You will put a woman on Mars. You will bring forth global cooling.

15353,"... Before the COVID pandemic upended the way the world does business, logistics was one of those industries that might have been taken for granted. That's not the case anymore. Due to all the turbulence of the last two years, customers are now realizing how important it is to have a reliable logistics partner on their side. How are people doing a quiet complex job? People think, oh they just deliver passes somewhere, that's an easy thing. If you think about what are people doing, it's quite complex. Businesses and consumers are suddenly thinking a lot more about how things they need reach places where they're needed. It's thrust the sector into the spotlight. Logistics and supply chain has become a household need. It's dramatically different than pre-pandemic. Yes, it's grown, whether that's in market power, revenue, profitability, investor interest. For Deutsche Post DHL Group, that's created opportunity to build on momentum and set ambitious goals for service and performance. When you look at our footprint, we're the most international logistics company there is. We want to become more digital and we want to be much more sustainable than we have been. DP DHL's revenue has soared since 2020 with full-year profit nearly doubling in 2021. CFO Melanie Christ is a key leader of the team that's delivered these results. She views her role as much more than just a number cruncher. There are unfortunately these clichÃ©s that finance is boring and it's kind of like been counting in the back office to be successful in finance. You have to have the financial expertise, but we also have to be credible business leaders in order to really impact the business and steer the direction. She is extremely smart and bright. You need somebody who is able to digest a lot of information rapidly and can distinguish what is important and what is less important. She has tremendous skill in that. She's not afraid to call people out, to call out other members of the executive team if she feels that something isn't being. She does that in a very nice way actually. She helps me tremendously in steering the company because she is highly regarded by my other colleagues in the senior team. And typically if they have a problem they share at first with her before they come to me. When I think about the conversations I have with Frank, the shortest part is actually about the analysis and the facts. It's more the debate about, okay, on that basis, what are the options? What can we do? My role is essentially saying in three sentences, what is working well in this company, where do we have challenges and what should we do going forward? Do you post DHL group consists of five divisions, express, Germany's post and parcel service, global forwarding and freight, supply chain and e-commerce solutions. Each of these segments has seen revenue growth in the last four years, while the surge of e-commerce volume during the pandemic has had a direct impact on the trajectory. Have you seen e-commerce as a very structural and fundamental growth rival for us as a company? What we now saw under the pandemic was a structural acceleration. It took us forward to a point in terms of e-compensation, which we probably would have reached on the normal circumstances in three years time. So it was a big step forward. DP DHL was well prepared to take this step. The company's strategic plan recognized e-commerce as a growing trend in the logistics landscape, but no one could have forked off.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3639,2022-10-16 21:36:39
15354," Prepare to take this step. The company's strategic plan recognized e-commerce as a growing trend in the logistics landscape. But no one could have forecast the speed and breadth of the transformation. We are now seeing that also, under the pandemic, not only domestic e-commerce has taken a faster growth trajectories and anticipated but also cross-border e-commerce. And we see that very clearly in our express network but also in our e-commerce solutions division. What are the other big structural shifts that you see on the horizon? Is it e-commerce B2B? Is it increased trade as globalisation restructures? What are the shifts that you're seeing? The board B2B e-commerce is still at a very early stage. So we believe that there will be a huge post-opportunity there. And we also see that when we are talking to our customers now, I guess everybody has been now realised that being dependent on just one supplier in one province in one country is probably not a good idea. So they want to build more resilience into the supply chain. I think our international footprint, our global strengths, is really something we can leverage for the benefit of our customers. Another factor in the company's favour is its balance sheet. Since Melanie Christ became CFO, cash flow has improved significantly. One of my priorities over the last years has been to really focus the whole organisation on better cash generation. It's not just a finance job. Making sure that ultimately revenue converts into EBIT and into cash in the bank account is the responsibility of the whole organisation. She says, we can't be successful as a company. If we are not collecting the cash for our services, we have provided. And she has not missed one single opportunity to talk about that. I think it's a very comfortable situation, particularly in the current environment, to have a strong balance sheet. I think in that respect, I'm very conservative. And I'd rather have a bit more on the balance sheet and a bit more buffer. Spell out for us what the priorities are, the longer term priorities, in terms of putting some of that cash to use for you. The first priority here is organic growth. We clearly indicated also this our CAPEX budget, 12 billion for the next three years, that we will keep investing into organic growth. We are very focused on our regular dividend payment. And then, if there is something left, which is fortunately the case at the moment, we will think about inorganic opportunities, and we will also think about other means to allow our shareholders to participate. That is why we are currently running a 2 billion euro share by VEC programme. Inorganic opportunities include M&A, like the recent purchase of beverage shipper, Hila Brand. But deploying cash is always subject to careful consideration. Does Melanie ever turn around and say, no. When you are pushing through or pushing for a particular package of spending? Yes, she does that quite often, because she has... She is a person and that is great if you have a CEO who is riskabrous, because you need somebody. The business is always too optimistic. Melanie might be something too pessimistic, but that is a very healthy discussion. If we then jointly come to the same conclusion after a debate, then we are probably in the right spot. How often do you find yourself saying no to divisional heads? When I was promoted into the CFO position, my team gave me a stamp with rejected. It sits on my desk. I think the fact that people know it sits there, already has instilled quite a lot of discipline in the organisation. So I think when I get a proposal, it has already gone through a number of iterations and is normally of such a high quality that I don't need the rejected stamp too often. For the time being, Christ should be able to keep that stamp in a drawer. CEO Frank Appell has expressed a commitment to service quality and confidence that customers will accept higher prices that come with it. If you are too expensive, you will be out of business, but if you don't provide the right quality, you will be out of business as well. So we want to be, we will never be the cheapest in town. That's not doable. We are the premium provider. That's our strategy. Of course, it's also more challenging for us when our customers are under pressure. At the same time, I think, over all the last two years have shown that...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3640,2022-10-16 21:41:27
15355," provider, that's our strategy. Of course, it's also more challenging for us when our customers are under pressure. At the same time, I think, over all the last two years have shown that a reliable high-quality supply chain comes at a certain price tag. I definitely see that inflation is having a huge impact on the logistics industry. And there's been substantial price increases in the last few years. I do not see that changing. There's a lot of innovation happening. And I don't see the inflation necessarily going away. It might level out a bit, but it's not going to go away. The logistics companies may have pricing power with customers, but their stock prices haven't been so robust. I think that the issue there is the increase in interest rates has made everyone rethink and be concerned about the level of inventory that is out in the system, if you will, and with the level of disruption. I think what's happened more in the last three months is the more of a view that we're actually heading into certainly in any coming slowdown, maybe a recession. With more than half its revenue coming from Europe, investors may see DBDHL as more exposed to recession risks than its global peers. The company insists it can meet its revenue targets in the event of a downturn. It's counting on diversification as a cushion. I'm not so pessimistic that there is really a deep recession at our doorstep. But even then, our portfolio is very much balanced. We are everywhere in the world. The world will not go entirely in recession. I doubt that. Would it be a stretch to suggest that DBDHL is, to some extent, recession-proof? I wouldn't go as far as to say recession-proof, but I think we are very well positioned to deal with all different types of recession scenarios due to the breadth of support for you. The balance of support for you really gives us a lot of resilience against any type of headwind. Coming up, a look at DBDHL's investments in action. Melanie Christ shows me around the company's state of the art in logistics. What I love about this building is it actually shows the big mega trends which formed our strategy 2025. This is Bloomberg. So before you invent pioneer, just run. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. As the chief financial officer of one of the world's largest logistics companies, Melanie Christ has made her mark in global business. That's not what she originally attended to do. I really wanted to go into research. I wanted to become a physicist and that was where my passion was. But then during my studies, some friends of mine started doing this strange thing. They went into management consulting. I didn't even know how to spell it. And I had no idea what it was about. But what they told me was quite interesting. And so I ended up doing an internship with a consulting firm. And I learned more in the two months there than I had in the last two years in my physics job at university. That is how I ended up in consulting. She started her career with three years at McKinsey. Then spent four years in private equity with APAC's partners in London before joining Deutsche Post DHL Group in 2004. I was brought into the company to do international M&A project. That was at the time around 20 years ago when we were really building the company in the current shape, acquiring lots of logistics companies around the world. The M&A part was the first thing. And I then wandered into a more mainstream finance field here in the group becoming the CFO of our digital express division. So from then on it was more leading towards the CFO role.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3641,2022-10-16 21:45:35
15356," And then, a field here in the group becoming the CFO of our Dietary Express Division. So from then on, it was more leading towards the CFO role eventually. Malely Christ now heads the finance team with around 11,000 employees. Success in this role is as much an art as a science. If you do the greatest piece of analysis and you see it all and you know it all, but you can't convey that message and you can't convince the rest of the organization that we should move into a certain direction, it's useless. DP DHL is sending a consistent message with its investments. The company spent 123 million euros to upgrade its logistic centre at the Clone Bon Airport, designing it around key strategic goals. What I love about this building is it actually shows the big mega trends which prompt our strategy 2025, which was in all-graded in 2019 when this building opened. So globalisation connecting the world. E-commerce, we have a lot of sortation facilities here for smaller e-commerce shipments. Sustainability, it's a very sustainable building, there's solar panels on the roof and everything. And digitalisation and well, you can obviously see that it is quite automated. How did the team pitch this investment to you initially? And how hard was it as a sell for them? How quickly did you turn around and say yes, this is worth the 123 million euros? Of course, you always have to make sure that you have the right capacity for the growth in the network. And at that time, they came and said, hey, we will really see a strong growth in e-commerce volumes on top of the regular B2B growth. We need more sorting capacity, we need this building. And of course, there are always debates, doesn't really have to cost 123 million euros and so on. Unfortunately, they convinced us because then with COVID and the volume search, we urgently needed the capacity. At the same time as COVID accelerated demand for logistic services, disruptions in the labour supply hurt productivity. Advances and technology like this digital sauter have helped offset some pressures, but automation also raises questions. Does this tell us that this is a business grows? This is going to become a more automated business, that is going to be less need for labour, for workers. Well, you still see people here. And I think what you can nicely witness here is the combination of technology which supports people. So for example, when you look at the customs area, it used to be a very manual and sometimes confusing process. Now, the people are supported in picking the right shipments for customs inspections by light. And they are automatically sorted in this sauter to go to customs inspections. So it is also helping the people with the jobs they do every day. We're all the sets, you know, in 2019-20. You know, we might get one-third less jobs in their current setup until 2030, if we digitalise our organisation. But we are very sure that our company will be at least 50, maybe 100% bigger and we will have more jobs to offer than that. At the beginning of a couple of years ago when we started that journey, people said, oh, you know, I might lose my job. I haven't heard that in the last two years as a question any any time hold. This airport hub also showcases DP DHL's aviation fleet which both small than 320 dedicated cargo aircraft. The biggest tank of our aircraft but we also have short and medium and long term leases and visit growth in our business we anticipate that the fleet will keep going. You've talked about investing of course in insustainable fuel. Yes. When does that come online? How significant is it? Is it just the critics might say that's just window dressing around a part of the business that is of course very very carbon intensive at least a lot of emissions. Yeah so you absolutely write the problem with our beautiful aircraft is the CO2 emissions and when you look at our overall CO2 emissions two-thirds are from aviation. It is about flying these birds with more sustainable fuel and we said that we're really willing to spend billions on it we now really hope that we will see the uptick in supply over the next years. Spending billions isn't vague hyperbole. The company has pledged to put seven billion euros towards sustainable technologies and fuels by 2030 with a goal of climate neutral.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3642,2022-10-16 21:51:26
15357," They hyperbole the company has pledged to put seven billion euros towards sustainable technologies and fuels by 2030 with a goal of climate neutral logistics by 2050 Sustainability makes good business sense anyway Especially if you are in a business that is Energy of fuel hungry as a compliance element that not just operators in the logistics sector need to consider But also their customers so being transparent becomes part of the service about their impact on The globe we had a lengthy discussion should we make a Financial commitment how much we want to invest for the next decade in our sustainability and we had a long debate Is it right to say we want to invest seven billion until 2030? There were pros and cons but that was a very intense discussion melody in I had where we finally came to the conclusion that This is the right number. This is the right approach. We convinced our colleague and that's the reason why we are where we are We are seen as somebody who really commit they're not that many companies. We have quantified their future investment Still ahead how one of the business world's most influential women is working to strengthen Gender equality within her company. I think the great thing is that now across the board in finance But also in the group overall we have role models which show young female talent that everything is possible This is Bloomberg While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines the reality is that even if every car on the roads today won electric It wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total US greenhouse gas emissions So what about the other 71% buildings across America burn fossil fuels to operate what we want to do is make that all electric Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need we want to do a hundred percent clean energy All electric we want to turn buildings into Tesla's Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels We want to do that with our buildings and if we can do it in one building we can do it in all buildings and if we do it in all buildings We'll reduce 30% of US greenhouse gas emissions Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world recalibrates After decades of stagnation Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation Corporate giants, policy makers and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that Every week on Japan ahead right here on Bloomberg television No one covers the world like Bloomberg The pressure cooker just got far too hot in burning them for the government to handle You foresee two-thirds of the crypto hedge funds will disappear are we close? The European Union will support and defend Ukraine's territorial integrity With unmatched reach and resources from more than 120 countries the moment news breaks 24 hours a day Bloomberg your global business authority Deutsche Post DHL Group's CFO Melanie Christ is often named to lists of the most powerful women in business And while men still outnumber women as finance heads of large companies There are signs that the balance is shifting The number of female CFOs across major US companies has risen to an all-time high according to a study by Chris Colder Associates And executive search firm Cohen Partners reports that 36% of new CFOs hired by notable companies in the first half of 2022 were women I asked Melanie Christ if she's encountered obstacles as a woman rises",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3643,2022-10-16 21:53:53
15358," She was hired by notable companies in the first half of 2022 were women. I asked Melanie Christ if she's encountered obstacles as a woman rising through the executive ranks. I have to say I have not made many negative experiences. Maybe I was also a little bit in the even thought thinking about these challenges so much. So I mean, when I studied physics, there weren't many women, so I was somehow always used to it. And it can also be an advantage when you're kind of like the only girl in the room. I mean, the boss at the end remembers your name and not the 19 guys who all kind of like were dark suits and white shirts and look alike, right? So I never experienced it as an external stress factor. I have to say for me personally it was more balancing my own expectations around kind of like getting family and the job combined. But that was probably more of a pressure I put on myself thinking that I had to be perfect in every dimension and not something where the pressure was put on me from my male colleagues. So how do you take that experience and put it to play in terms of how you advance the role of women in this organisation? I think the great thing is that now across the board in finance but also in the group overall, we have role models which show young female talent that everything is possible. In finance, we have a share of women in management of 32%. So we are ahead of the group. We want to get to 35% by 2025. I think we are now at a position where if we have a vacancy, I want to have at least one woman on the shortlist. Because we have enough female talent. So every shortlist should contain a woman and then the best person in the race should win. CEO Frank Appell says Christ sets an example for the entire organisation. And he believes her success may influence the entire industry. She has proven that she is an outstanding CEO. She's definitely a role model in many dimensions that you know what I like about there. She is still you know a very warm and nice person and that makes such a big difference. So you can get to that level without compromising on how nice you are as a person. I think she's a great role model and a hope that this has had positive impact for many of us. From the big picture down to the smallest operational details, Melanie Christ is fully engaged in guiding DP DHL into the future. I wanted to know what she sees when she looks ahead. What do you see as the biggest opportunities for DP DHL over the next 10 years? I think we have a fantastic portfolio and we just have to leverage the growth opportunities which are there both on the ECOM site and also on the traditional B2B site. And the key differentiators for us will be digitalisation, sustainability and our great people. As you look ahead 10 years, what are some of the challenges? What keeps you up at night as you think about the business going forward? I think we have to keep this focus and the ability to adjust in a very agile way. Sometimes when you kind of like think about all the risk controlling and stuff, people tend to create the impression that you can preplan everything. That's clearly not the case. So I think we have to stay focused and keep the ability to react in a very agile way. But looking at what happened over the last 24 months, I'm very optimistic that we will also be able to cope with whatever happens next. And how do you see your role changing in the years ahead? I think it is changing at a very rapid pace, which is a great thing because it never gets boring. Those elements I just mentioned for the group overall, digitalisation and sustainability are also hugely relevant for the finance role. It's like a new language you have to learn. And you learn the vocabulary, but then you also have to develop a feeling. If I kind of like put so much capital into this decarbonisation measure, I get so much in terms of return out of it. But that's a fascinating opportunity where we can make a huge difference for finance and for the group overall. As you look to the future, Melanie, what do you think is going to be the skill sets, the knowledge bases, they're going to be essential to the success of future CFOs?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3644,2022-10-16 21:58:42
15359," As you look to the future, Melanie, what do you think is going to be the skill sets, the knowledge bases, they're going to be essential to the success of future CFOs? Yes, probably the two most essential new skills will be to get even better at lifelong learning, because we will have to learn so much new stuff every year, be it in the digitalisation area, be it on sustainability. So this ability also has a 50-year plus old person to keep learning and keep the curiosity. I think that is going to be super essential and the second element will be being a great team player. The world is complex, you can't know it all, so you really have to work even more strongly with your team. What advice would you give to someone who's just recently been appointed CFO? That's a great question. I think I would probably simply say, be curious and ask as many questions as you can, try to learn as much as possible, not only in the finance area, but get close to the business, try to really understand the business, because only when you are close to the business and you understand the fundamental profit drivers, will you be a really great CFO. I'm Tom McKenzie. This is Bloomberg. I'm going to name a couple of your babies. I don't know if I'm asking you to choose amongst your children, but some of the most recognizable buildings by you, of course, the Millennium Bridge, London City Hall, the Reichstag, and the Great Court British Museum. What was your favourite project to do? The Reichstag does stand out because, first of all, it's an energy manifesto. So it transformed something that was dependent on fossil fuels. It uses all the technology to produce something which is essentially carbon neutral and there's a public building. That's a statement. It's a symbol of a city, it's a symbol of a nation, it incorporates works of art, it's recycling and existing building, which as I mentioned earlier, is the ultimate in sustainability. If you can get a new life to a building, it also creates public space. At the roof level, it's the most visited parliament in the world, so it puts the public above the politicians who are answerable to them. And that, of course, was made possible by the politician. So it's a demonstration of democracy in action. So what's the best investment advice you've ever been given by anybody? The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day and if you keep added and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's not just interest. It was always said above compound interest returns, compound business returns, compound human returns. They're all very additive because you'll learn every day and if you keep at it, it's very, very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make? Selling it the wrong time. And they sell when the prices go down? Yes, or yes. Not keeping. People have conviction or they invest for the, if they invest for the right reasons, just keep at it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3645,2022-10-16 22:02:37

I'm Manabow Draula's in Hong Kong, we're counting down to Asia's major market opens. Good evening from Bloomberg's World Headquarters in New York. I'm Kathleen Hayes. Now the top stories this hour. Ceasing pink warrants of dangerous storms ahead, opening China's party congress with a defiant message on issues from Taiwan to COVID-0 and tech. Asian stocks may tumble on persistent inflation concerns. But it's trade is abracing for possible yen intervention, the currency tumbling towards a key psychological level. And financial markets set to deliver their verdict on the UK Prime Minister Liz Trusses' economic reset as she fights to save her premier ship. Kathleen Hayes, this is the side of another trading week here in Asia of course. And this is really going to be the first chance for traders to react to President Xi's speech at the weekends. That two hour address to the National Party Congress highlighting some really key areas here specifically the environment, tech, national security. So off that some strategist saying what's what happens in the China Ex? This is basically China's answer to the Nasdaq here. We actually had seen it rallying into the party congress on Sunday. So that was the last close on Friday there. Otherwise COVID-0 still this maintained emphasis on these very strict virus measures. So life really over the economy and because of that that's really going to be hitting trading sentiment. This is how futures are looking on other contracts. And then the property sector as well. One to watch that the property stocks some mixed signals on that sector. But let's change on. Take a look at the setup across Asia because of course a China a big driver of sentiment in the Asian region. So we've got New Zealand already online in the red it Sydney futures last close like this. And also keeping an eye on what's happening in the Japanese yen because we are coming off nine straight weeks of losses here. Kathleen so that is a key intervention level as we get closer to the key one fifty level. Well Lenobo let's get a quick check on Wall Street to see what kind of sentiment we'll kind of momentum is going to maybe carry over into Asia. The big story on Friday was the University of Michigan consumer survey inflation expectations. The one year ahead look now is 5.1%. It's up from 4.7%. That's after 300 basis points of rate hike since March by the Federal Reserve. Maybe they're not working working as well as a Fed thought they would. So what we saw was the S&P 500 down about 2.5%. It raised all the week's gains was felt like a bullet week last week not by Friday the Nasdaq down about 3%. The lowest level now since July of 2020. So what do we see today? Not too surprising I guess after a rather nasty Friday we've got some rebound here. We'll see again how that carries over into Asia trade later today. Ten year yield bond market about 4.01% in the cash market above 4% Esther George from the Kansas City Fed saying that maybe we're going to have to raise rates more to get inflation under control. Hit bonds also boosted the dollar dollar index up on Friday but about 0.7% looks like carrying through to today. Looking at the pound continues to climb after the new the new essential checker said he's not on board Heidi. With all these big tax cuts and spending gave the pound a boost. Andrew Bailey endorsing it or the weekend at the IMF was another factor here. Yeah this idea that perhaps investors are feeling like more of those unfunded tax cuts might see you turn from this trust. Well the UK Prime Minister certainly facing market judgment still into a new week. Without now the support the emergency support measures from the Bank of England. That exit leaving UK assets ever more exposed than Kathleen. It's really interesting how we continue to start to see the cracks between going from this all hands on deck. Central banks and governments on the same page on the same agenda as we got through the pandemic. In now those parts are really diverging and we're starting to see.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3647,2022-10-16 22:11:49
15361," All hands on deck, central banks and governments on the same page, on the same agenda as we got through the pandemic. And now those parts are really diverging and we're starting to see just that cracked in that relationship, right? But certainly UK financial markets, whether you talk about the FX markets or guilt markets, will be key this week after we saw the long dead end yields really spiking. The pound, as you said, advancing so far in the early session, but that was after the sell-off on Friday. So we continue watch for volatility here. Sure, sure, sure. And of course that rally in the pound started over the weekend. And it was interesting at the IMF meeting on Friday, at the G30s section. It's something that's always done every year on the side lines. We saw Andrew Bailey, a very interesting conversation on a big, big panel of central bankers. He said that, again, he thinks that this move by Jeremy Hunt, the new ex-chancellor's ex-chapter, what they talked about ahead of time. So that was also important to the markets that the B.O.E. is endorsing his move. Bailey also saying that they will not hesitate to raise rates to meet their inflation target. And it's probably going to be a stronger response than in August when they raised rates by 50 basis points. Governor Crota, B.O.J., Bank of Japan, no surprise, sticking to the stimulus guns, appropriate to kidney and monetary policy support. And of course, this was after Dollar Yen got nearly to $149 on Friday, the weakest since 1990. Inflation's up to 2.8 percent, but Crota not sure it's going to stay there, led by cost push, not by demand as in U.S. and Europe. And finally, very funny, cloth's not Heidi. He is one of the hawkish members of the ECBs ahead of the Dutch central bank. And he said it's going to take two more significant highs to get to neutral. Presumably that could include 75 basis points. Where are the inflation that were forceful than response? But there was an audience question to him where this woman asked, what keeps you awake at night? You sound pretty okay, but what keeps you awake? He said, well, nothing keeps me awake at night. Unless, of course, we were to have a crisis like the UK. Got a pause and laughter from the audience. A serious issue, but certainly one that everybody, even in Washington, can joke about. The other major risk for markets, of course, is what's going on in China, Kathleen. And we heard from a defiance, his MPing over the weekend on Sunday, taking to the podium to open the Communist Party Congress, reaffirming policies that are at the centre of frictions with the United States. Let's get more on that speech. What we learned from that, let's bring our chief North Asia correspondent, Stephen Angle, in Hong Kong. So Steve, it was a two-hour speech, and it felt a lot of a built on this idea of, you know, he's spoken about it before, the Chinese nation standing up. What stood out to you? Yeah, I mean, this was a speech that didn't surprise me much. Only in the fact that it was much shorter than it was five years ago, and it was in excess of three hours in 2017 at the opening of the Party Congress. This time it was just under two hours, but he touched on all the hot button issues, but didn't really get into many specifics. And if investors are waking up this Monday morning, wondering if he gave a road map out of COVID-zero policies, you're going to be disappointed. But those others say that perhaps the fact that he didn't harp on the negatives and the need for further lockdowns and the specifics of that, gives room for the party as Xi Jinping to perhaps relax going forward. If he gave a hard date or any kind of hard criteria to relax, perhaps he would be bound by that. So that is in a way to look at a good news if you are concerned by the continuing economic dampening effect of COVID-zero. Now, he did touch on a lot of ideological main points of his rule so far over the past decade. He referred to Marxism more than markets, common prosperity more than the property woes. In fact, he didn't even mention the drags of the property market, which was not too surprising, given that's a negative aspect. But again, he has a firm hand on the tiller. He talked a lot about metaphorical terms, about strong winds and high waves, and even dangerous storms. And that is where the defiant tone came through, shining, that he can offer an alternative to the world led by the U.S. and its allies. So he also talked tough on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3647,2022-10-16 22:12:52
15362," came through shining that he can offer an alternative to the world led by the U.S. and its allies. So he also talked tough on Taiwan's seats. Should we take this as kind of boiler plate? Of course, he's going to say that over and over. Or did you get any sense that there's more of a sense of moving forward on that? But this is something that's bothering him and he wants to address. Well, obviously reunification is a key part of his leadership. He wants to see it. In fact, he said complete reunification must be revealed or rebelled. Yeah, must be, must happen, excuse me. And without, and can be realized, I'm sorry. So essentially, he's reaffirming the same kind of messaging. I'm messing up my words. Let's hear from C to P in directly. Resolving the Taiwan family is a matter for the Chinese. A matter that must be resolved by the Chinese. We will continue to strive for peaceful reunification with the greatest sincerity and the utmost effort. But we will never promise to renounce the use of course. I reserve the option of taking all measures necessary. And again, speaking in metaphors, he essentially said the wheels of history are rolling towards reunification and also the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. All right, Chief North Asia correspondent Stephen Angles summing up so well the key points about very important speech. Now, onto a delayed statement from G20 finance ministers and central bankers that's laid bare divisions on a variety of issues, including Russia's war in Ukraine and ways to deal with climate change. For more, let's bring in Bloomberg's Eric Martin who has been in Washington, where he always is covering the IMF World Bank meetings for about our week or so now. So what was in the statement? And of course, it was what delayed for three days unusually showing that there's some very major disagreements here. That's right, Kathleen. Well, we were at IMF headquarters since Thursday awaiting this statement and trying to get, of course, any kind of a draft copy to know what was coming, trying to get inside the room metaphorically in terms of understanding why the G20 was taking so long to come up with the statement. And what finally we got today was a chair statement. Now, this is different from the communique that we were typically used to getting out of a G20 meeting. But what we heard from sources throughout the last couple of days was that the reason that this took three days longer, then it normally does to come up with any kind of a readout or a statement from the meeting was because of the divisions that were in the room. I'm going to read to you now from the statement. I want to get this verbatim because, you know, these are the kind of statements that every word and every comma is parsed and socialized within the countries who are represented there. This says many members strongly condemned Russia's war against Ukraine and expressed the view that Russia's illegal unjustified and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine is impairing the global economic recovery. So that was many, but not all of the G20 nations. And of course, the G20 includes Russia, includes countries that have not been as dead fast in their opposition or criticism of the war, including China and India. And so, you know, trying to get close to 80% of the world's GDP countries that represent that to all come to a consensus on an issue. This contentious has been a really tough order for the presidency of the G20 this year in Donisia. Eric, these meetings also come at a time where we're starting to see an emerging tug of war between governments and central banks. Absolutely. And that was something else that that was talked about here as well. There was a section about currency and currency policy. I want to read to you for a moment from there. It says recognizing that many currencies have moved significantly this year. With increased volatility, we reaffirm our April 2021 exchange rate commitments. And those commitments were to not target exchange rates for competitive purposes and to refrain from competitive devaluations. And we know that the US officials",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3648,2022-10-16 22:15:51
15363," were to not target exchange rates for competitive purposes and to refrain from competitive devaluations. And we know that the U.S. officials who were present here did hear from officials from emerging and developing countries about the pain that's being caused to them and to their populations by a strong dollar, which of course increases inflation, increases their debt burden in dollar terms. And so, you know, it's something we spoke earlier in the week. We have Sreen Molliani-Indrawadi, the finance minister of Indonesia, the person who is in charge of organizing these meetings and trying to get consensus. She visited us in our Washington office and she talked about a hurricane of risk in her words, a very strong hurricane that's facing emerging and developing countries. And we know that this is something that these countries and that their delegations pressed the U.S. and pressed treasury on during these two days of meetings. One big Eric Martin there with the latest. Well, as Eric mentioned, effects, of course, top of mind for policymakers and currency traders also bracing for another possible yen intervention after it had a three-decade law against the dollar. Very close to that psychologically key 150 level. Let's get more from Bloomberg's Chief Rates correspondent for Asia. I'm live contributor, Garford Reynolds, Drensons now, and Sydney. So, Garford, kicking off the new week with currencies and focus, not just the yen, but of course, we've been watching the pound as well. Yeah, very much so, Heidi. In some ways, the two markets are kind of mirroring images. They're both your court in this conundrum between your monetary policy and politics in the UK. The problem is that your relentless tightening that the BOE is part of is put a lot of strain on your country that's also facing the extreme inflation and gas supply shocks they are. In Japan, their central bank is confident that inflation is under control within Japan, and so they're sticking with the world's only really loose monetary policy. The problem is the yen keeps sliding, and that becomes a political and societal problem because the Japanese are not used to this sort of level, and even if the BOJ insists that there's not structural inflation, that whatever inflation there is, is transitory. It does have an inflationary impact, especially on ordinary people. Anything that gets imported is being driven up in price. So, it becomes difficult for the authorities to say, well, we're going to keep on pursuing this policy to spur inflation when they're looking at the yen, ordinary Japanese people, they're looking at the yen and saying, well, there's your inflation. In fact, there's too much of it. You need to stop it. So, 150 yen, that's a big figure that's going to emphasize all of those difficulties I talked about, and the particular difficulties that Japanese authorities face is they've intervened once. That was quite some time ago, and the yen's gotten a lot weaker since, and with what went on with the Michigan survey and some of the Fed comments, the expectations are, the Fed is going to go 75 basis points in November, and then maybe it'll do so again in December unless you get some sort of an impact. So, in that situation, can the Japanese really do anything to stop the yen going past 150 and beyond, at least in the medium term? Okay. Well, interesting, Garfield. Going to the U.S., bonds, stocks, both selling off last week on Friday, and a lot of traders saying, oh my gosh, the Fed's going to cause a recession and thinking, that's going to slow them down. Interesting to me, at the IMF World Bank meetings, when I spoke to Philippine Medaille from the Philippine Central Bank, Jim Chalmers, Australia's Treasurer, asked the what about, should the Fed slow down, should they do less? They said, oh no, they have to do this, and that was mainly the sentiment at these meetings. What does this mean for the markets? Just sit back and realize this is where they're going, and don't get too bullish until we are much closer to done. Well, that's the difficulty, Kathleen, because markets are kind of hard-wired to be bullish as soon as they possibly can. The fear of missing out, the infamous FOMO, is always just around the corner. Bond yields are as juicy as they've been in years, but that's based on the idea that inflation will revert to where it was.

15364," Based on the idea that inflation will revert to where it was. Brake ebens are all looking at 2.5% inflation over the coming 10 years or so. That seems extremely unlikely and unless you get progress towards achieving that, the Fed is going to keep hiking rates and we're going to risk a recession and we're going to risk elevation staying like maybe it'll come down but will it come all the way down to 2.5%. So all of that makes for an extremely difficult trading setup, not just for bonds but also for stocks. Probably the easiest one is looks like plenty more dollar strength coming down the pipe. That seems for sure doesn't it? Bloomberg's chief rates correspondent for Asia and M-life contributor Garfield Reynolds. Now let's get over to Vony Quinn but the first word headlines. Vony, how can you thank you? UK Chancellor of the X-Jechar Jeremy Hunt has declined to rule out delaying by a year the Prime Minister's plan to cut the basic rate of income tax. Such a move would amount to another U-turn on a key plank of Prime Minister Liz Trosses mini budget. Hunt has made clear that calming the markets is his priority and says he intends to show that the government can account for every penny of its tax and spending plans. The European Union's executive arm is planning a mechanism to curb price volatility in the block's biggest gas marketplace. It wants to prevent extreme price spikes and derivatives trading to rein in the region's energy crisis. The temporary mechanism would impose a dynamic price limit for transactions on the Dutch title transfer facility. That's the benchmark for all gas traded on the continent. The Australian government will reportedly pledge $6 billion US dollars for infrastructure projects in its October budget. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told News Agency AAP that the spending would create jobs and unlock growth and productivity. And the Finance Minister told Sky News it would not add to inflationary pressures.

It's impossible the industries in an arms race that will lead to spending itself into an oversupply. I mean, that has happened before. We've looked at this very carefully, and the digitization of everything. Tell me what aspect of your life family isn't becoming more digital. Well, I'm trying to prevent that, but yeah, I think it's happening. And COVID has accelerated that. The industry cost $500 billion last year, the semiconductor industry overall, and estimates are $1 trillion a doubling by the end of the decade at that point. I believe those estimates, it's not that there's not going to be some blitz and turns on the way, and the majority of that is driven by leadership process technology, of which only three companies can satisfy that need.

15365," IQ Monday on Bloomberg. Even though September, US inflation came in stronger than expected last week, our next guest thinks the strengthening dollar might force the Fed to slow down. Let's get more now with Kim Forest, founder and CIO of Boka Capital Partners. Now, Kim, I want to start asking you about this, the view of inflation, how it's going to enter time with the markets, how the dollar might help. Because we're going to show the University of Michigan inflation expectations chart, and you can see that the one year out expectation rose from 4.7% in this very closely watched survey. It's a very important measure of inflation expectations to 5.1. After 300 basis points of rate hike since March, the Fed in many ways, especially after you look at that strong and expected CPI, it's a lot of rate hikes and not much reaction. Is there any room at all to give the market that kind of Fed easing up a bit that it wants? Well, I think the consumers have spoken, because that's who is asked in that survey, and they are saying the Fed has not done anything, even though they've increased rate heights, rates really quickly. You can see that throughout the world, we have the highest interest rate overnight rate of all the central banks. So I would say consumers say it's not working. So what does that mean then? If the Fed looks like it's in the position, not to slow down, but to potentially even to get a little more aggressive, both in keeping the rate hikes big and having a higher terminal rate, possibly next year, that's what Esther George in the Kansas City Fed was indicating on Friday. Sure. No, I completely agree, even though my notes say I don't agree, but the Fed is going down its path, and it refuses to divert, because it's been told it has a two focused mandate, one is containing predictable prices and then full employment, and they're willing to sacrifice employment for inflation at this point. But I think we all have to think deeply about where inflation came from this time, and given our low interest rate since the past 12 years, and we only had inflation really start last year, I would say that the Fed did not create this by low rates. So higher rates aren't necessarily going to fix it. Kim, I thought it was quite interesting that you say the kind of current oversupply that we see in some areas is temporary, and that firms are actually getting better in the post pandemic era of forecasting demand and supply. If you take a look at the stocks and the companies that are particularly good at this, are those some of the opportunities? They are, and actually the semis are actually pretty good at this, but everybody got confused, and I think both clothing manufacturers, clothing sellers, and people that use semi-conductors, all kind of got confused because of the great supply chain issues that we had starting in 2020. And once that they got that through kind of contained, we now have oversupply, but I think most businesses now, because they use technology to track what their warehouses have in it, and that would be their ERP or accounting systems, and that's pretty good now. And they also use CRM or customer relationship management software to figure out what their pipelines are. Most countries or most companies can figure out what they need to buy, and who's going to buy it? Kim, always great to have you with us, which I'll talk more later, Kim, for us founder and CEO of Birke Capital Partners, more to come here on daybreak.

15366," While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today won't be electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building to cross America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels, we want to do that with our buildings. If we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.

No I think the speech is really about continuity there were really no big shocks in there there was no continuity on Taiwan continuity on COVID-0 continuity on Xi style of managing the economy continuity frankly on ideology and the strength of the party where one needs humility is about personnel changes and we are going to get that in a week or so We spoke to Jude Bunch at on Friday and he said you know building on these themes is a concern that in the next five years 10 years we will see a China that is more self-referential paranoid and more reactive and it seems like that kind of you know the Chinese nation will stand up feeds into that That's possible I think we do have a sense in western countries that China is decoupling from us China isn't decoupling from other parts of the world the global south africa southeast Asia the Middle East and the like but yeah the the overriding theme and one that runs through all Chinese policy making is the competition with the United States and that feeds into the sorts of things you talk about there in other words the possibility that it could lash out at some stage because the you know the the aim to take Taiwan to be unification re-unification is actually baked into the cake and sooner or later that is going to come to a head And these are the policies that won't change regardless of the leadership you know long-term strategic rivalries the geopolitical tensions public health policy for example with COVID-0 but the approach that matters because Xi has been very forceful in his policy making Yes there's two ways of looking at that I in some respects are in the other school that these as you say these policies won't change no matter who is leader and a stronger China and China is stronger these days it's richer it's more powerful Inevitably that leader of the country will be more assertive Now Xi is particularly assertive and particularly in his control of China itself as much as foreign policy but I think it doesn't matter if Xi is there or not you know we're on a certain path at the moment and it's hard to know when we get off that Richard is Calping Hayes in New York you know a lot of attention on the the remarks he made very forcefully I think about technology and not being held back and moving ahead and clearly a big boat of a contention now these are the United States with the chips where is that heading? Well it's very hard to know where it's heading except that both sides are digging in and trying to ensure that they have their own indigenous independent technologies to ensure that each country doesn't have leverage over the other Now that's been settled Chinese policy for some time it's been the explicit",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3653,2022-10-16 22:37:30
15368," Independent technologies to ensure that each country doesn't have leverage over the other. Now that's been settled Chinese policy for some time. It's been explicit Chinese policy for some years. And that of course has simply been hardened by the sorts of measures announced by the United States, particularly last week, which are potentially the most far-reaching ever. So I think each side is going to be investing massively in their own independent technology. The lot of commentary about the challenge that means for China that a lot of the technology they have now has come from other countries, whether it's come directly or through back channels. That that may be actually a spot where they are not as strong as you think would like them to be. What do you see there? What do you think they need to do? Is this a bigger challenge maybe than people realize? Well, they're definitely not as strong as she would like them to be. I don't think any country ever becomes totally technologically independent. But to be fair, China's done extremely well in some areas in electric vehicles, in the whole supply chain surrounding solar power, wind power and the like. China, in making batteries, China has a dominant position in those industries already. So as other countries with Japan catch up. So it's not as though China is behind in all sorts of areas, whether it can ever catch up on say semiconductor technology, foundries and the like. Well, that's an open question and it's possible they will struggle. You pointed out his ability to spin crises and turn them around. Is that limited though because we're getting to a point where perhaps growth has been constrained by China's mode of governance? Yes, well, I think she's Achilles Hills. There's no doubt about it. It's the economy and of course that's been exacerbated by COVID-0 and there's no end inside to COVID-0 at the moment. So how does that flow on to other policies? You know, I think the big crisis that she spins to is benefit. Internal politics is US-China competition. If you people believe you are an existential battle with the United States, she can wrap himself in the flag or the party in the flag like any national leader can. How that plays into lower growth, living standards that aren't rising as quickly, that's difficult to know, but I suspect there's a negative interplay there. It always plays into the existential threat to the party, doesn't it? I'm wondering the assertiveness of this political transition. Does that now become precedent or is there a chance of a backlash after this leadership? I think there's always a chance of a backlash against she. And he's got a lot of enemies of all manner of different kinds inside China. The trouble is that he has the system locked down so tightly, the security, the military, just about anywhere you look, after the transfer of personnel on the next week or so on the government next year, that is likely to be even more the case. He's demanded loyalty, he has the means to enforce it. So it's hard to see where the challenge comes from, but would require a real crisis within China for that to happen. Richard always great to have you with us. The low institute senior fellow for East Asia, Richard McGregor here. We're sticking with the China Party Congress for morning calls. Let's bring out a book, take a look at the key takeaways for investors from President Xi's speech. So, Bell, what are we hearing from Goldman Sachs? Yeah, well, Heidi, so it's interesting. Goldman Sachs has done a textual analysis here and they've looked at some of the key terms. So the ones that disappeared or dropped in significance from this party congress the last one five years ago, well, they were terms like economy, market reform, and then you compare that to ones that rose. The counterparts terms like security, people, socialism. So it really does give clues as to the broader outlook for President Xi and the party moving forward. Because of that drop in terms like economy, market reform, well, Goldman Sachs says that really is not an inflection point for policy changes. They're also looking at where COVID-0 goes from here and they're saying that we're not going to really see any sort of pivot until at least the second quarter of next year. And they're also sticking with terms and focus.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3654,2022-10-16 22:41:55
15369," where COVID-0 goes from here and they're saying that we're not going to really see any sort of pivot until at least the second quarter of next year and they're also sticking with terms and focus areas like common prosperity. Now as for what they see in terms of the equity market, implication of this, if you just change on now, Goldman Sachs is sticking with their preference for H shares over offshore equities. This chart here having a look at the premium of H shares over H shares, all vice versa, and you can see here we're currently trading at about a 50% premium. So Kathleen, that's a little bit higher than the five-year average of around 32%. And about what about the reaction from HSBC? Yes, they're taking a slightly different take on this because what they see, rather than an absence of the economy and the techs, they're actually looking at these key themes that came out like the environment, like sustainable growth, tech innovation, all of these can be sustainable growth drivers in the years ahead. The other area that they're focusing on is the property sector. What was really interesting in the, in she speeches that he dropped a key term of this is housing is for living. Now that came out five years ago, did sort of start this broader crackdown on housing and affordability in the country because it was absent in this text or this speech rather well HSBC says we actually could start to see a big housing support package coming through perhaps in the next couple of months and that would of course be welcome news, Kathleen, for any property sector investors because you've seen around a 40% drop in China real estate stocks. Yeah, for an investor or maybe an investor wannabe. Now let's get the first word news with Bonnie Quinn. Kathleen, thank you.

Australia's treasure says his country's economy faces some tricky territory in the near term as the world grapples with inflation and the pandemic's aftermath. I spoke to Jim Chalmers at the IMF's annual meeting in Washington as he prepares to deliver his first budget later this month. Well, I think now is the time for some blunt talk about prospects for the global economy and the truth is that the global economy is treading a narrower and more perilous path right now. I think that's recognised really right across the board around the G20 and other participants in these discussions. Australia enters this difficult period from a position of relative strength but we won't be spared a global downturn. We're putting a budget together that I'll hand down in less than two weeks now and it's absolutely crucial that we can factor in the real-time thinking of economic decision makers around the world and that's why the last couple of days have been so valuable to us. What's the most worrisome message you heard here? I think everybody's worried about inflation and that's why we've got this quite blunt and brutal tightening of monetary policy around the world and that risks a...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3655,2022-10-16 22:46:17
15370," I think everybody's worried about inflation and that's why we've got this quite blunt and brutal tightening of monetary policy around the world and that risks a hard landing, frankly, in some countries around the world. I think that's the most confronting reality that we face. It comes to us courtesy of the war in Ukraine, of course, but other issues around supply chains, the aftermath of the worst part of the pandemic. All of these challenges have come together at once. And again, I'm relatively optimistic about Australia's medium-term prospects, but in the near-term, we're going to have to navigate some pretty tricky territory. What is the Suring Dollar me, if you right now, down about 12 cents recently, and it's certainly at least in part of it, it's got to be this aggressive fed rate haste. Yes. It's put it made the dollar very strong. In addition, that looking over your shoulder, whatever is going on in Australia, you see a global economy that is slowing down. I mean, certainly what's happening with the US Fed is putting pressure on our dollar at home. And we've got a dollar, Australian dollar down in the load of mid-60 cents, which is quite low by recent standards. And so that's obviously something that we're monitoring because that has, makes our imports more expensive. And so that's a challenge. But I think more broadly, the issues that the US Fed is confronting, and I had a good conversation with Chairman Powell yesterday about this, the issues that the Americans are facing are pretty common around the world. We've all got some combination of high and rising inflation. We've all got rising interest rates in one way or another. And so the challenge for us is to build our defences, build our buffers against that global uncertainty. The best defense against this global uncertainty is responsible budgeting and responsible economic management at home. And so that's our focus. Australian Treasurer Jim Charm was there speaking to Kathleen in Washington. Well, come me up.

Big banks, the EOS, speaking about recession risks on their earnings call last week. And they remain in focus this week if Bank of America follows its peers and reporting earnings early Monday, very important sector. Everybody wants to see how it's going. The numbers of Kenan is joining us now. The message from JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, City, the big guys are okay. At least for now. And yes, there was a headline from Barons that seemed to sum it up. Bank earnings weren't terrible. And that seems to be enough for investors again, at least for now. Bank earnings kicked off Friday, as mentioned, for the biggest banks out there. Everyone waiting to hear because it was so known. This has been a brutal year so far. And especially investment banking. We knew there'd be a sharp drop in profit because of the drop in deals and IPOs. But they were fine. Few surprises. You're looking at the year-to-date losses. And some of these banks were actually up on Friday. So that's the brutal year. A city reported a 25% decline in profit, citing challenging markets. Their investment banking revenue fell more than 60% from a year ago. Wells Fargo's surge in various factors, drove in earnings beat. But they were cost-tied to a prior scandal. JP Morgan's profit shrank. Let's get into JP Morgan. It shares also under pressure for the year. Its CEO says its US customers are healthy. It gave an optimistic look forward. And results were far better than expected. It earned 9.7 billion in the third quarter. A 17% drop from what it made a year ago. That said, it's quarterly revenue rose to nearly 30. It's $3 billion record net interest income. So it, like Wells Fargo beat, did have a mixed assessment of global economy going forward. They hope to resume buybacks next year. Investors cheered by that. Morgan Stanley missed on an equity trading beat on fixed income. The CEO indicating they may have to cut jobs. This got a lot of attention. There was some clarification, this is not necessarily layoffs, but headcount is under review. This is echoing what so many banks are now saying in terms of taking a closer look at how many people they need. In some Morgan Stanley also said they thought they showed strong signs of stability in what have been difficult times and a very difficult environment. So that was another key theme. It's been a rough ride, but there you have made it through. Long growth is in focus for Bank of America. We know the mortgage lending has slowed. Yeah, Bank of America is one of those banks that is tied a lot to consumer lending as well. It's about to release third quarter earnings ahead of the opening bell. And it has delivered some of the best earnings so far this year, delivering positive growth in revenue long before some of the others do. In fact, one big banking analyst out there, Mike Mayo said, NII to the sky has legs. That's been a theme. And as mentioned, long growth is in focus. NII revenue from customer loan payments minus what the company pays depositors. For Bank of America, it is expected to total 13.6 billion. That would be up from 12.4 billion in the second quarter and 11.1 billion last year. The big focus on that Goldman Sachs reports later in the week, revenue and profit. It also declined from a year ago, which was boosted by investment gains. They have a very strong investment banking arm. Again, that's the area that's been hit in almost every bank, we're pointing so far. A lot of focus there as well.

It's one of the biggest floating solar plants in the world. Floating solar rays have been gaining traction in Asia, including countries like Singapore and Thailand. Floating projects typically benefit from an easier connection to the power grid. They can also restrict algae blooms while keeping the solar panels cool. This one in particular has healthy local economy. When the power plant was first proposed, residents were given the chance to invest. Some locals were also offered jobs during construction. In fact, it was the community that requested the panels to be shaped as flowers to look more appealing.

Solar plants like this one may help the country reach its net zero goals. I've always been a person who has been attracted to hair. I like to sit and think and theorize how I can manifest these visions that I have for braiding and how I can take something that may seem like it's a line drawing in my mind and apply that to someone's scalp. We are the only culture that has hair that grows out of our head the way that it does. Anyone from the African diaspora is born with this amazingly curly hair that can be shaped into a variety of different ways of expression. I want black people to love themselves for how they naturally appear and also to appreciate the cultural practice such as braiding that our ancestors have practiced for centuries. We will never know. We will never know. You are watching Deep Rake Asia come into you live from New York, Sydney and Hong Kong. We are counting down to the market opens in Tokyo and Seoul.

15374," The top story is this hour. Investors are bracing for another volatile week with Asian stocks poised to open lower world watch for possible yen intervention as the currency tumbles towards the key psychological level. Xi Jinping warns of dangerous storms ahead to opening China's party congress with a defiant message on Taiwan COVID-0 and tech. Plus, financial markets are set to deliver their verdict on Liz Truss' economic reset, as she farts to save her premiership. Well Heidi, we've got the start of market trading in Australia. We've just seen the ASX200 ticking lower for the start of trading here. We're looking for losses around 1.5% of futures or an indication. But certainly, a lot of trading themes for us to be getting through this morning, starting off what we're seeing in inflation as well because that's still the broader market theme across the week. Kathleen, you probably get through the details of that university, Michigan surveyed, but we can't overall see inflation expectations ticking higher on a one-year basis. That's playing into the direction of what we see in Bonyls this morning, the three and ten year both moving higher. Also in line with the moves that we've seen in treasuries over the past few sessions. If you change on that, also plays into the direction of yen trading because we are very close to that key 150 level. Goldman Sachs saying that we could reach it within three months and that has given that ongoing policy diversions between the central banks in the US and Japan. Also keeping an eye on what's happening with the pound this morning. It is moving higher. So it does seem that investors are liking the more renewed focus on fiscal stability in the UK and also the prospects that more of ListTrust's package of unfunded tax cuts could be reversed. Now, the other thing we're keeping an eye on this morning as well is what we see in China because we will have investors having their first chance to react to President Xi's address yesterday. I'll let Steve get through the details in just a moment but broadly this is not being seen as too positive for the direction of markets, Kathleen. Well, you're leaving us down the right path there and about when it comes to the markets because the stock market took quite a beating on Friday, the S&P 500, down about two and a half percent completely erasing the week's gains. The NASDAQ was down 3%. It was the lowest level since July of 2020. We're still not too surprising. You can see in some green here on the S&P and NASDAQ futures a bit of a rebound potentially waiting to see what happens next. Bonds, the 10-year note is back up to topping 4%, again 4.01% is the level we're seeing some positive there as well, just a little bit. And I mixed crude, interesting was down 4% on Friday back to about $86 a barrel in West Texas Intermediate. No surprise, there is so much concern about a global recession. If you paid attention to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank meetings last week over the weekend, you have to get ready for a recession, partly because central banks are going to be so aggressive, Heidi. Investors also watching what comes out of China over the next few days. We heard from a defiant Xi Jinping taking to the podium on Sunday to open the Communist Party Congress for affirming policies that are at the center of frictions with the United States for more and see speech that's bringing our chief North Asia cross-border Stephen Angle in Hong Kong. So, certainly a strident see that we heard from was a building on the same themes and as we say frictions, they're already in play. Yeah, I mean, there were not a lot of surprises to me other than the length of the speech was much shorter than five years ago. So, it was under two hours this time as opposed to more than three hours in 2017. But he did hit on all the hot button issues. And if you want to kind of see what is the hardest news that came out of it, well, he didn't give a roadmap or any kind of clues as to whether the country is going to come out of its restrictive COVID-0 policies. He essentially touted the party's successes at saving lives. And it is important and it is something that will potentially stay in place in China. Now, the fact that he didn't give actual time frames or any kind of specifics on what would require them to loosen restrictions gives the party opportunity to perhaps gradually reduce. So, if there's any good news, you could see, say, what he didn't say is positive news. Telling great news is, to now show more financial introduces Matrix were forces, not numeric",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3660,2022-10-16 23:08:12
15375," Bikes instead of cuts, spending cuts instead of spending boosts a far more prudent approach, which means, and we had Bank of England governor Bailey over the weekend essentially confirming this, the B.O.A and the UK government are now not necessarily going head-to-head against each other. So that is the sort of thing that's going to lead to the pound gaining, at least in the short term. We still have a situation where the politics is very, very dicey over there. You know, a lot of focus on how Premier, how the UK Prime Minister, recovers from this extremely volatile beginning to her leadership, and whether you can get some calm in number 10 and number 11 downing street in the next few weeks, and whether than that translates to a healing process for UK assets. You guilt, still bear the scars, everybody's wondering, has the force selling from those pension funds? Is that gone? Are there any other wounds that are going to lead to fresh chaos coming from other parts of the UK market? You know, all of that remains in play, but the overall tone, as I said, is a lot more hopeful. When bags two freight crossbowner for Asia, I'm live contributor to Gafio Reynolds. They're delayed statement from G-25 ministers and central bankers that laid bad, the divisions on a variety of issues, including Russia's war in Ukraine, and ways to deal with the climate change for more on its brim, when bags are arric matter. And let's set off with a geopolitical side. Where did we see the divisions, and how was that really present in the communique? Absolutely, Heidi, where we saw the divisions really breaking down, are between, you know, to a large extent, between the 19 other G-20 members and Russia, you know, trying to read between the lines of the communique, but also using what we heard from officials in the past several days. Nadia Calvino, the economy minister of Spain, which chairs an IMF advisory board, the IMFC. It's called a disgust that basically all of the members were on one side all 19, and then you have won the country that was on the other. Many of these issues. One of the key sentences I'd like to read to you here from this chair statement that was issued by Indonesia early on Sunday here in Washington, says many members strongly condemned Russia's war against Ukraine and express the view that Russia's illegal, unjustified, and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine is impairing the global economic recovery. And then there was also a note that one member, you know, which everyone has their guess as to who, but that one member said it's actually the sanctions imposed by the West that is the main pressure for the global recovery. So, you know, trying to read between the lines, you know, and kind of parse the messaging here, but certainly the divisions caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, preventing the G-20 for the second IMF meetings in a row from coming to a consensus for a communique. And interesting on fossil fuels, there was a member suggesting that even though climate change and the green steps needed to avert it, there's another side to that, which is the need for fossil fuels right now while this transition is being made. And that is a very contentious issue among people who make policy on this, who talk about it. Do we, and presumably Russia being a major oil producer is in the campuses, hey, don't go too fast, but for obvious reasons. Absolutely, Kathleen, one of the frictions and one of the, the fracturings they were heard about behind closed doors during the G-20 meeting was on the issue of oil, that there were some clashes between really the US and the G-7 and the Saudi authorities who were there. And this is always an issue as well when you mention climate change and the renewable energy aspect of this. This is an issue for large emerging markets. A country like India, a country of one billion people, you know, looking at this issue and saying, you know, we're being asked to be producing green fuels or renewable fuels, not able to use the fossil fuels or asked not to use the fossil fuels that",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3661,2022-10-16 23:16:30
15376," be producing green fuels or renewable fuels, not able to use the fossil fuels, or asked not to use the fossil fuels that the West has really used in order to become an advanced economy and to enrich themselves. A lot of the G7 kind of vicariously here. And yet a country of a billion people that's looking to make those kinds of advances is being told you can't use the same fuels that were used in the past. And so this is something that we often see surfacing. We saw it in the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework Talks in LA last month. You know, of India and other countries saying, well, wait a minute, we're a developing country. We need to be able to use these fuels for a period of time in order to reach a greater level of development. â And thanks, Eric Martin, there. Let's get you now to Voney Quinn with the first wet headlands, Voney. â Heidi, thank you. UK Chancellor of the X-Jackery Jeremy Hunt has declined to rule out, delaying by a year, the Prime Minister's plan to cut the basic rate of income tax. Such a move would amount to another U-turn on a key plank of Prime Minister Liz Truss' mini budget. Hunt has made clear that calming the markets is his priority and says he intends to show that the government can account for every penny of its tax and spending plans. The European Union's executive arm is planning a mechanism to curb price volatility in the block's biggest gas marketplace. It wants to prevent extreme price spikes and derivatives trading to rein in the region's energy crisis. The temporary mechanism would impose a dynamic price limit for transactions on the Dutch title transfer facility. That's the benchmark for all gas traded on the continent. The Australian government will reportedly pledge $6 billion US dollars for infrastructure projects in its October budget. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told News Agency AAP that the spending would create jobs and unlock growth and productivity. Treasureer Jim Chalmers told us the global limitation of fight highlights the importance for Australia of responsible budgeting. We can't have in budgets spending which is excessive or poorly targeted. If we have money spraying around in all directions in budgets, that will make the job of our independent central banks that much harder. And so our intention is to provide some cost of living relief that has an economic dividend by which I mean it won't make the inflation problem worse. Senior White House officials says the US could change its approach to providing security assistance to Saudi Arabia. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told CNN that President Biden could make a decision on relations with Riyadh after consulting with lawmakers following November's midterm elections.

15377," Well, I'm trying to prevent that, but yeah, I think it's happening. And COVID has accelerated that. The industry cost $500 billion last year, the semiconductor industry overall. And estimates are a trillion dollars of doubling by the end of the decade at that point. I believe those estimates. It's not that there's not going to be some blips and turns on the way. And the majority of that is driven by leadership process technology, of which only three companies can satisfy that need. Taking a look at the week ahead, the PBOC has set to release its one year medium-turned lending facility rate later Monday, with economists expecting the rate to hold at 2.75%. On Tuesday, China's third quarter GDP data will likely show a feeble recovery after growth stalled the prior quarter. We're also expecting numbers on China's industrial production and retail sales. And the major Chinese banks' loan primaries are expected to stay put on Thursday. I'm going to continue market turmoil in the UK. We're expecting to see inflation figures out Wednesday to rise at a double-digit pace. We're also getting inflation data from New Zealand. And in Japan, where economists expect an uptick in consumer prices. And Hong Kong chief executive, John Lee, will deliver his first policy address on Wednesday. Sources say he may ease property taxes and visa restrictions trying to curb a pandemic brain drain. And that's your week ahead. We'll continue to focus on the party congress in China with President Xi Jinping opening the Congress signalling no change in direction for the two main risk factors dragging down China's economy. Of course, strict COVID rules as well as property market policies. Let's get some reaction now from Shane Oliver, who's ahead of investment strategy and chief economists at AMP. Shane, great to have you with us in person, post-pandemic. Let me throw up this chart, which takes a look at political risks following these big meetings. And typically, they fall because we know more about the direction for the next five years. This time, though, we know that even with the leadership transition amongst the top positions, we're not probably going to see much change when it comes to things like COVID-0, when it comes to the property market. So this suggests that we're seeing import-slow exports are slowing, consumer to ponds pretty depressed and generally contracting growth ahead. What can investors take away from this? Well, I guess the good news is there's no great negative surprises in there. It seems like more of the same from President Xi's speech. I guess the downside, though, is that there's not a lot of upside there either. There was hardly any focus on economic reform compared to previous addresses. Not much action, perhaps, on COVID. I mean, hopefully we're heading in a direction of some easing of restrictions, particularly as eventually, mRNA vaccines are used in China, and you get antivirals being used. But that's not going to happen quickly. So, in the great scheme of things, I don't see a big change. I think you may get some relief rally that investors say, oh, well, there's nothing too negative in there, and that gives you a bit of a relief rally. But I wouldn't see a lot beyond that. It's our contracted growth that then, of course, has implications for a lot of Australian companies, for example. Is that the angle that a lot of your clients are taking in terms of how do these policies have a flow on effect to tech, to mining, to overall, you know, the sort of demand that we see elsewhere. Yeah. I mean, obviously Australia remains incredibly sensitive to what happens in China. And on that front, the outlook has become bleak. Yeah. Yes, the resources, energy stocks, helped hold us up to some degree in a relative sense through this recent downturn in global markets. We've been a relative out performer. There is a question mark as to how long that can continue, though. Longer term, I mean, it depends how quickly the adjustment in China recurs. If China's growth comes to a dead stop, obviously, that would be very bad for Australia. If it's a gradual, Jeff.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3663,2022-10-16 23:25:04
15378," It depends how quickly the adjustment in China recurs. If Chinese growth comes to a dead stop, obviously that would be very bad for Australia. If it's a gradual adjustment, then I think Australia will move on. Much like it has over the last three years, when we've seen bands on various Australian commodities going to China from lobsters to coal, Australia manages to survive right through all of that because a lot of its exports are fungible. You can just switch them to another economy and keep going. So that's the case that I think Australia manages to pull out of this OK. But there is still that question mark, particularly if China runs into more difficult problems as its property down to and continues. What kind of a risk appetite would you need to have, or a time horizon, to have exposure to China right now? To be honest with you, it's... I mean, the bigger issues affecting markets right now are perhaps US centric, European centric. In China, there's just more question marks. A decade ago, you could say, well, it's moving in a liberalisation direction. Growth is strong. You've got urbanisation, all those sorts of things. A lot of those themes are now fading or are questionable. And that, I think, means that investors in China, it's questionable whether you can paint a great short-term picture or even whether long-term picture is as good as it once was. So that makes China exposure a lot more difficult. Hi, Shane, it's Kathleen in New York. Great to see you. In terms of the trade numbers, we get two reports this week. We get Singapore, we get Indonesia. But broadly, Asia... Excuse me, China is such a big player, such a big driver of trade in many ways in this region. If they stay slow, if they... And in fact, at the global economy slows. You know, there's this big risk of recession now. What does that mean for trade numbers for not just these countries, but other countries in Asia, many of which are very export dependent? Like it does leave Asia quite vulnerable. I guess a lot depends on what happens with the inflation problems globally. But I mean, the China backdrop is still a negative one. I think we will see some easing in COVID restrictions as we go through next year. I think we will see some extra stimulus. So I don't think China's growth is going to collapse from here. It just remains subdued. And that obviously puts a dampener on things. Obviously, in the short term, the risks are on the downside for Asian economies. If you look out through next year, though, I suspect it starts to swing a little bit more positive as inflation comes under control and central bank starts to get off the break a little bit and maybe on the accelerator. I can't give a quick question, though, Shane, because you talked about inflation and central banks. The Fed, the latest numbers on inflation, not good, very little reduction in inflation quickly. What does that mean for Asian traders, Asian investors? Look, it's clearly a short term negative because it keeps the Fed hawkish or ultra-hawkish for longer, which means upwards pressure on the US dollar in a broad trend sense. And obviously, at risk of financial accidents. And obviously, that's bad news for Asia. Longer term, though, I think at some point we will get a downside surprise on the US inflation numbers. But maybe sometime the next few months, but obviously we haven't seen that yet. And we're still waiting for that to occur. There was a glimmer of light in those numbers, in that the goods price inflation numbers are slowing down. And goods price inflation tends to lead services inflation. But obviously, the lags can be several months before that starts to flow through. Shane, great to have you. As always, Shane, I'll have a head of investment strategy and chief economist at AMP. More to come, this is Bloomberg. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the road today went electric, it wouldn't be...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3664,2022-10-16 23:29:33
15379," While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total US greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building to crowds America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do a 100% clean energy all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels, we want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of US greenhouse gas emissions. Alright let's take a look at what we're seeing when it comes to trading in FX. We have seen mixed trading for the US dollar but watching the yen as well as sterling. This is Bloomberg. Think of a battery. For most it's what we use to power devices for both work and play and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades they've gotten way more powerful, long lasting and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi trillion dollar opportunity and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How will we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. Let's just be honest. We've had sort of a shift in are we in some sort of cypheration fears moment. People were talking about that all day yesterday. You have to look at UK and it's been a Greek tragedy what we've seen in UK over the course the last week with some of the policy announcements in the back and forth. We're at risk of talking ourselves into a worst position than we are. This is not yet looking to me like a very steep and deep recession. Also in some of the other markets where housing is a major component of their economy. So whether it's Hong Kong or Australia, you start to wonder if they aren't the next ones to look. The Chinese economy has been in a recession for some considerable time. In the real economy, for example, bankruptcies. We see already bankruptcies increase. It's only in Spain in Europe and then the UK very clearly. And now it's reaching Italy and then France and Germany. To me the next risk in markets, the next downturn, is the realization that the economies and have to slow a substantial amount to meet those inflation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3665,2022-10-16 23:33:37
15380," and now it's reaching Italy and then France and Germany. To me, the next risk in markets, the next downturn, is the realization that the economies and after slow a substantial amount to meet those inflation goals. It doesn't mean the whole world is going up and smokes simultaneously, but when you have a situation where we've had very low interest rates for so long and the world was adapted to it, now that central banks are raising interest rates, it changes things. Blue boat TV guests there on our M Live poll survey question, where is the next recession? And let's get into those results in more detail because we had nearly 500 people casting their views in this poll and some pretty bleak findings coming out of it, starting with who will go into recession first? And you can see here a fairly even split between the UK and the Eurozone with the UK, just taking out the crown here. So perhaps a sign of course of these lingering concerns around the financial stability of that country, even though investors, if you take the trading in the pound this morning, do seem to be liking these changes that we saw from Liz Truss, the Prime Minister at the weekend, including replacing the finance chief as well as that potential for the U-turn on the policy of unfunded tax cuts. But just 7% of people saying that the US will be going into recession first. So also a sign that this divergence that we've seen between the US and the other side of the Atlantic, that the US is in a better position to weather these storms like the war in Ukraine, also the energy crisis. Have you changed on now? The next question that we had the respondents going into, which economy will emerge as a winner here? And you can see really the vast majority of respondents saying that the US will recover from this first. They're in a better position here, as I was saying, versus what we see in other parts of the world. So where to put your money? Well, survey also indicating that the US, the premium that we have if you change on now for US stocks will remain in place. And that as peak hawkishness does become apparent, will invest as they are prepared to return to the US treasury markets in their droves. Now, the other greater finding that came out of this, Heidi, is when you look at where to invest over the longer term, well, at some point, the survey found that the US will be the best place to put your money. Well, the IMF's first deputy managing director says the weakening yen could pose risks for the Asian financial system if companies or banks have not properly hedged their borrowing. Giddygob and Ufft told Bloomberg's Tom Kane that many nations are in for a rocky ride as they adjust to dollar strength. So when you have sizable movements in the dollar, it has very sizable implications for the global economy because it's so dominant in trade and finance. But the important thing to keep in mind is that there are fundamentals that are driving these large movements. They seem very quick, they seem very steep. The differences in the path of monetary policy, tightening is one factor, the differences in high energy, prices are affecting countries is another factor. So I think this is going to be a bit of a rocky ride for countries, but they will have to adjust to it. So they have to use their own monetary policy tools to be able to keep inflation. We're going to speak to Robert Rajin here about emerging markets. Let me stay with the major countries with you, Dr. Gopinath. And let's look at the Yen experiment. All of this meeting in the world, John Farrow is transfixed by Yen 147. What is the council of you and your chief economist to the Japanese to extricate themselves from their unique yield-courved control experiment? I mean, there were fundamental reasons for that particular divergence that we see in the currency. Japan has decided to stay the course in terms of keeping interest rates low, while the Fed has decided to stay the course in terms of raising interest rates very decisively to bring down inflation. And that, of course, is one of the primary drivers of the different, of the fact that the Yen has lost value relative to the dollar. Now, of course, over time, monetary policy will have to figure out what the best course is, depending upon inflation development in Japan. But as of now, I believe, given the diverging trends, you know, currency movements will look like they do now. With all of your expertise, if Japan capitulates to a more normal monetary policy, and Yen goes strong 148...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3666,2022-10-16 23:38:36
15381," Now with all of your expertise if Japan capitulates to a more normal monetary policy and Yen goes strong 148, 150 took just as a pick a number out of thin air, 129, what will that do to the Pacific Rim financial system? We have to look into that and see how, what that happens in a disruptor manner, it happens in an orderly manner, right? We always have exchange rate movements all the time. When you have big movements and exchange rates, the problems that come up is when you have funds or banks that have borrowed and multiple currencies and haven't sufficiently hedged themselves. So those get affected. But if you hedged yourself, I mean these are movements that you should be using. As IMS first deputy managing director Ketigopanath of Bloomberg's Tom Keenan, Keenan I should say in Washington got another Keenan coming up right now. Wall Street lenders remain in focus this week. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs said to follow their peers in reporting earnings. Bloomberg's Keenan joins this and see the message from J.P. Merck and Citi Wells Fargo seems to be that the kids are okay. At least for now. And you know, Barron's had a headline that kind of summed it up to paraphrase. They said the bank earnings weren't that bad and investors may be happy with that for now. Bank earnings kicked off on Friday as mentioned for the biggest banks out there and everybody knew it's been a brutal year so far, especially for investment banking with deals off IPOs down. We knew that'd be a sharp drop in profit. And yet the earnings that came out were relatively fine with few surprises. That's why you saw green on the screen actually Wells Fargo and J.P. Morgan beat estimates. If you look at the year-to-date returns or performance of these stocks, you see the real red and the indication there's been pain for these banks. Citi reported a 25 percent profit decline, citing challenging markets. Revenue was up 6 percent of that's been banking was down. 60 percent Wells Fargo's surge in interest income. Drove an earnings beat but they were cost tied to that account scandal. Let's focus on J.P. Morgan because their profit shrank but its CEOs said US customers are healthy and other good news for investors. They may resume their trade buy back early next year. They gave a guidance increase on their net increase income which came in at a record. They are 9.7 billion. A 17 percent drop from what it made a year ago. That said it's quarterly revenue was to nearly 33 billion. And check this out. It's investment banking fell by 47 percent. That was less than expected. Slightly different story from Morgan Stanley. We missed on equity trading beat on fixed income. Banking was down some 55 percent and the CEO is suggesting that headcount is now under review actually saying headcounts under review suggesting there may be some cuts in the ranks. Job cuts sent if you know are a big issue on Wall Street but from what we're hearing from different CEOs it seems like all of the major banks are checking out how they can be more efficient, how they can cut costs and cutting jobs or at least cutting headcount I appears to be one of the ways. And navigating slow and low growth in particular when it comes to mortgage lending is going to be key for Bank of America. Yeah Bank of America is one of those banks that is looked at because it has a foot investment banking and consumer lending it reports before the bell on Monday. It has delivered some of the best earnings so far this year delivering positive growth and revenue long before the others did so that's another special reason it gets a lot of scrutiny and investors will be focusing on interest rate growth, how their interest rate trading performed. NII to the sky is how Mike Mayo has been calling the theme for some of these other banks NII is revenue from customer loan payments which are then used to pay depositors they're expecting to see a big increase there. We'll know later in the Monday open back to you.

15382," The E.L.I.V. goes where it's out for commentary and analysis from Bloomberg's expert editors. Other key earnings to watch out for this week, including Netflix, they could see that turnaround in the stock performance. Of course, we know that Netflix is moving into an advertising model, also watching Tesla reporting third quarter earnings as well. It's been battered by not just disappointing quarterly delivery numbers, but also CEO Elon Musk's surprise decision to revive his offer to buy Twitter on all of the uncertainty related to that deal. Let's get you to Vony Quinn now with the first-wed headlines, Vony. Heidi, thank you. Hong Kong media reports say China may further relax its border restrictions with the city by year end. The South China Morning Post cites Hong Kong's deputy to the National People's Congress standing committee saying that the current seven-day hotel quarantine period could be cut to four days. Singtow Daily also reports that the mainland may allow more visitors to cross the border from Hong Kong each day. Pakistan's former Prime Minister Imran Khan has won the majority of seats. This is in by-election, building momentum in his campaign for an early national poll. Khan was contesting seven of the eight seats in play, and with 90 percent of the vote counted, had won five of them. He laughed a resign from all but one seat, but the victory suggests many voters support his political narrative. South Korean boyband BTS has performed together for what could be the last time in years. Saturday's concert in Busan was to promote South Korea's second biggest city as a candidate to host the 2030 World Expo. In June, the band said it would go on indefinite hiatus as its members focus on solo projects. The oldest singer in the RuPaul so faces a deadline this year to begin compulsory military service.

Bonnie, thank you so much. Australia's treasure says his country's economy faces some tricky territory the near term is the world grapples with inflation and the pandemic's aftermath. I spoke to Jim Chalmers at the IMF's annual meeting in Washington as seat propelers to deliver his first budget later this month. Well, I think now is the time for some blunt talk about prospects for the global economy. And the truth is that the global economy is treading a narrower and more perilous path right now. I think that's recognized really right across the board around the G20 and other participants in these discussions. And Australia enters this difficult period from a position of relative strength but we won't be spared a global downturn. We're putting a budget together that I'll hand down in less than two weeks now and it's absolutely crucial that we can factor in the real time thinking of economic decision-makers around the world and that's why the last couple of days have been so valuable to us. What's the most worrisome message you heard here? I think everybody's worried about inflation. And that's why we've got this quite blunt and brutal tightening of monetary policy around the world and that risks a hard landing, frankly, in some countries around the world. I think that's the most confronting reality that we face. It comes to us courtesy of the war in Ukraine, of course, but other issues around supply chains, the aftermath of the worst part of the pandemic, all of these challenges have come together at once. And again, I'm relatively optimistic about Australia's medium-term prospects but in the near term, we're going to have to navigate some pretty tricky territory. What is the Suring Dollar me a few right now? Down about 12 cents recently and it's the, certainly, at least in part of it, it's got to be this aggressive fed rate hike. It's put it made the dollar very strong. In addition, that looking over your shoulder, whatever is going on in Australia, you see a global economy that is slowing down. I mean, certainly what's happening with the US Fed is putting pressure on our dollar at home and we've got a Australian dollar down in the low to mid 60 cents, which is quite low by recent standards. And so that's obviously something that we're monitoring because that makes our imports more expensive. So that's a challenge. But I think more broadly, the issues that the US Fed is confronting, I had a good conversation with Chairman Powell yesterday about this. The issues that the Americans are facing are pretty common around the world. We've all got some combination of high and rising inflation. We've all got our rights.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3668,2022-10-16 23:47:03
15383," About this, the issues that the Americans are facing are pretty common around the world. We've all got some combination of high and rising inflation. We've all got rising interest rates in one way or another. And so the challenge for us is to build our defences, build our buffers against that global uncertainty. The best defense against this global uncertainty is responsible budgeting and responsible economic management at home. And so that's our focus. Australian Treasury, I'm Jim Charmers. They're speaking to Kathleen in Washington. We'll come out. We'll be speaking to Japan's biggest travel agency about the country's tourism revival. JTB President and CEO, Agera Yamakita joins us next. This is Bloomberg. What's happening on Wall Street? I think, Jay Powell said things that were indefensible. Need to catch up? This is Bloomberg Wall Street week. I'm David Weston. We've got the information and insights. We think that's the next second shift. From business's most influential and instrumental. It's mocking it at the bullfrog. It's a challenging dynamic. This is a level of uncertainty that we've ever had to deal with. Bloomberg Wall Street week, live Friday with replays all weekend on Bloomberg Television and Radio. I'm David Weston. Keeping an eye on the Yen on Friday, of course, the Yen nearly reached its lowest level since, I believe it was August of 1990. It's today, you can see Dollar Yen a little bit weaker, so a little bit strength there for the Yen. But against the other major currencies, it's kind of a mixed bag as we look at Yen, Ossi, and the Yuan Yen. So again, with so much pressure, it is a big deal. But let's move on to another side of this story. Japan has lifted almost three years of tight border controls that kept tourists out of the country. As one of the last remaining developed economies to reopen for tourism, there's anticipation of an economic lift that could eclipse the pre-pandemic travel boom. Joining us now is Aijiro Yamakita. He's president and CEO at JTB Group, which is Japan's biggest travel agency, going back to the early 1900s. What a history. So welcome to the show. I want to start by asking you about your sense, I told you in the break that I am dying to get back to Tokyo. I assume there's other people who are looking to do the same thing. What is your sense right now of the demand for foreign travelers to come back and how welcoming and open Japanese people still kind of worried about the COVID as many people are going to be? This is exactly the timing that the foreign tourists are coming back to Japan. And Lolo Binqvari is coming in from a travel agent abroad. And the our flagship product, like Sunrise Tour is back in business. And in the economic world, economic world, I'm surveyed, reduced in May this year. I'm showing that the Japan ranked number one in the tourism sector. And this demonstrates the popularity of Japan and the Lolo customers are really having a high level of experience.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3669,2022-10-16 23:50:51
15384," sector and this demonstrates the popularity of Japan and the a lot of customers really having a high intention to come back to Japan. But how about the Japanese people themselves? How about the, you know, many people of course, like in any country, benefit from tourists, you know, restaurants, hotels, so many things like this. But what about the Japanese citizen? Do you get a sense that people are a little bit hesitant or that they feel COVID is behind them, behind the world and it's time to move ahead including bringing people back to Japan? They're getting ready to accept the foreign tourists and the step-by-step preparedness of the destination is now complete. And the, for example, the hotels who used to receive the large-scale, large-size group, it's now adopted to accepting the individual tourists because people really want to avoid the crowded place. So like making a smaller size bus and the small dining rooms and that is the big change at the destination site and they're ready. How have you seen or have you seen, actually, say the weekend really playing into the outlook? This impact a lot. In a 44-entourist, Japan is very affordable at this moment and this depreciation of Japanese then affects tremendous and the humidity, many, many, many tourists is coming back to Japan and the, and also it is important to note that the Japan is ready, acceptance is very important so, so, booming is coming. What does it mean for domestic travel though? Because obviously domestic travelers will perhaps think twice about going overseas with the weakness in the currency making it not as affordable but if you have it in flux of foreign visitors, is that just going to create quite a backlog of demand domestically? They're going to spend quite a longer time than compared to the Japanese travelers and that affect very much positive to the destination but because of this, the capacity of the hotels and the, you know, the digitalization is going on and we, for example, we are ready to prepare the platform, this platform to support the destination together with the Balkan who is the member of the TripAdvisor Group. We do have the digital platform to accept the foreign tourists so, so, Japanese travelers also can enjoy the Japan trip so the capacity is now and the people are ready. Japan has so many wonderful destinations to visit, I'm curious if the people's interest of where they want to go has changed, you know, and what kind of, is that reflected in the kind of tours that are popular now? Attraction of the destination remains the same as they before, the COVID, but the new development is like, you know, for the first time travelers, still the Golden Root like Tokyo, Hakone, Osaka, Kyoto and Mount Fuji, you know, this is still popular but for the repeated travelers, the adventurous tourism is the getting popular and also the people's attention is awareness is on the sustainability so that they can enjoy the local food and the, you know, awareness is increasing and the involvement as well so, so, you know, this nation should be diverse than before, you know, that's the new attraction. We also have the new route on the Sea of Japan side in accordance with the extension of the Buritren Sinkansen which is running.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3670,2022-10-16 23:55:03
