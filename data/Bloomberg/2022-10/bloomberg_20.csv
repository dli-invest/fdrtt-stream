16039," We choose to do this because we love this work, but it is a business. And if you do not treat it like a business, I guarantee you that the promoter is, and you will be left broken, broken at the end of your career. Each of us have an individual story, but as with anything you take enough of these individual stories and you see not only crossover but intersectionality. A group of former UFC fighters that are suing the UFC scored a key legal victory on Thursday when a federal judge said he would grant their lawsuit class action status. There have been fights in every major US sport about workers' power in the labor market. I don't think there's a guy in the sport from the guy who just got his first fight all the way up to the Conor McGregor's that is pleased with the way the UFC treats fighters. The way we've been strong armed, the way we've been coerced. Fights over unionization in some sports, fights over free agency in baseball, and in boxing the Muhammad Ali Act, which restricts the kinds of contract terms that can be imposed on boxers. The fighters who brought this lawsuit see it as the continuation of a tradition in sports of athletes fighting to have agency and power in the terms of their work and who they do it for. Mixed martial arts used to be pretty culturally and legally fringe in the United States. It was banned by most states. John McCain had famously called it human cock fighting. There are some rules in the UFC, but to a large extent all sorts of body parts and tactics and attacks are on the table and people get seriously injured at times. My nose has been broken multiple times. I had my right pectoral torn off, had to get that reattached. I've had my jaw broken in two places, I've had my neck broken. I had my left ankle broken, had to get that repaired. I've had a torn right labor in my shoulder. He broke my eyeball, I mean the bone that holds up my eyeball. I've had my left eye, orbital fracture, twice where my eye caved in. I was walling my own blood, I knew, don't blow your nose or both eyes of the world. At the time that UFC was bought for just $2 million by the former boxing coach, Dana White, and a casino owner. He'd been friends with Lorenzo Fertita and his brother Frank Fertita. UFC was struggling as were other mixed martial arts promoters. It was pretty much a fixer-upper. The money that they spent to actually purchase it for $2 million was much less than the money they quickly had to sink into it in order to revitalize it. They've hold off a multi-pronged strategy that was quite successful. First, they did what White has referred to as running towards regulation. They found ways to make compromises with state regulators so that the sport would not be illegal. And at the same time, they also popularized it. They made gambles like paying the production costs themselves for the first season of a reality TV show, The Ultimate Fighter on Spike TV. It is all over. The AGO setch is The Ultimate Fighter. UFC, Under Dana White, had a gift for weaving, compelling personal narratives and rivalry. People throwing shoes, a guy coming to the oxagon with who let the dogs out playing while he was dragging another guy on a leash. My first contract with the UFC is kind of an interesting story because here I am on this reality show The Ultimate Fighter. And they started to realize how big of a stepping stone this was going to be for the UFC. It's at us all down individually. Put a contract in front of us and said, hey, we realized that this is going to be huge and we really want to have you all a part of this UFC family moving forward. So we want to",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4385,2022-10-19 00:01:45
16040," Contract in front of us and said, hey, we realized that this is going to be huge and we really want to have you all a part of that UFC family moving forward. So we want to go ahead and get this out of the way just sign this simple contract and we'll be able to move forward as one unit. But as I'm looking at this thick contract and wondering what I should do, Dana White looks at me and says, don't worry, this thing takes off, we'll take care of you. The fighters would say at the heart of UFC's power is the contracts that it signs with fighters. Before boxing had competition boxing used to be dominated by a few dominant promoters and the contracts were ported over from boxing and the contracts are basically designed to control every aspect of a fighter's career. They're long term, they last multiple fights. Fighters under these contracts are bound to fight only for UFC for a period of time and UFC can extend that time if a fighter declines a match or if a fighter gets injured. They control who the fighter fights, they control when the fighter fights and then they have a number of different clauses that make it very difficult for a fighter to ever break free from UFC if that fighter ever did want to become a creation. Contracts are so one-sided, there really is no negotiation room for any of the things, especially as you're coming up and as their stranglehold on the sport of MMA got so much stronger. Part of what's at the heart of this lawsuit is the ways that UFC successfully took other competitors off the board. The UFC had such a stranglehold on mixed martial arts and as they were buying up so much of the competition shutting them all down, they really became the only option for anybody that wanted to do this professionally. If you follow Dana White's Twitter or watch him on YouTube, you could have seen Dana White calling himself the Grim Reaper and bragging about how he has defeated or derailed or acquired one after another company that tried to compete with the UFC. In 2011, UFC acquired Strike Force, which at the time was the most prominent rival still standing. The CEO of Strike Force Scott Koker has said in the past that he saw himself like Luke Skywalker up against the Death Star trying to compete with UFC. Eventually, when Strike Force was bought out by UFC, my only option was go to UFC because they had the rest of my contract. Now I'm under a contract where it's only an 18 month contract with six fights, but five years later, I'm still stuck in the contract. The month before UFC's parent company Zufa completed its acquisition of Strike Force, a UFC executive sent an email and the subject line of that email was we own MMA. And the UFC has admitted in documents that have now become public that they've almost never lost a fighter that they wanted to keep. In internal UFC emails, we now know the company referred to what it was doing as choking off oxygen to the company.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4386,2022-10-19 00:05:54
16041," Colonel UFC emails, we now know the company referred to what it was doing as choking off oxygen to the competition. The most important oxygen that UFC allegedly ran a foul over the law by cutting off to its competitors is the fighters themselves. And not only did they make it clear to us, they made it clear to the whole mixed martial arts world, there is no negotiating. These are very strict, never-ending contracts and that's the case for this day. The UFC just says, oh you want to fight for us, you sign here, if you don't want to, we've got 20 other guys that will take your spot. They have 70, 80, 90% of the top fighters under exclusive contract, meaning that those fighters are not available to any other MMA promoter. And fighters, even if they wiggled their way out of the very restrictive contract that UFC imposed on them, didn't have another professional mixed martial arts option because there weren't robust rivals to go sell their work to. On Tuesday afternoon, a class action lawsuit was filed in US District Court in San Jose against a Zufa LLC with fighters, Kung Lee, Nate Corey and John Fitch attached to the suit. Rampe Jackson came to me and says, hey, come, I know this lawyer, he will help get the fairness for the fighters in the marketplace. And I decided I wanted to step up for all the fighters that being affected. At the end of 2014, more than six years ago now, a group of now all former fighters filed anti-trust class action lawsuit against UFC. And in broad terms, the case is an antitrust case where we're claiming that the UFC is both a monopoly and a monopsony. Usually when we talk about monopoly, we're talking about the power that a company has when it becomes the only one selling something. Monopsony is about the power of being a monopoly purchaser of something, and particularly a monopoly purchaser of labor. A key argument in this lawsuit has been about as UFC succeeds in its revenue sores, how much should we expect that absent illegal conduct, the fighters pay would soar as well. In UFC, year after year, the share of the company is revenue that goes to actually paying the workers doing the fighting has hovered around or below 20%. And what this analysis shows through complex statistical regression modeling is that if the UFC was competitive and did not allegedly violate the antitrust laws, it would pay its fighters 50% or more of the revenues is generated just like baseball, just like hockey, just like basketball, boxing. If instead of paying 20% of the revenues generated, it paid 50% or more of the revenues generated the fighters would have made $1.6 billion more during the period that we measured 2010 to 2017. Sometimes when you write about allegations against companies and particularly about lawsuits against companies, those companies don't want to say a whole lot about them or are pretty dismissive of the significance of litigation against them. UFC in their comments to me has been pretty feisty about this, saying that they see this lawsuit actually as a threat to the ability of businesses to take risks and succeed, and that they don't want to roll over, that they want to fight it and they want to defeat it. The fighters I talk to describe having side jobs, being reliant on UFC in part because after taxes and expenses, they weren't making enough money to feel financially secure. The overview of my career from a financial perspective is something that I had a challenge in admitting, I can tell you now that I lived in my mom's attached to a rock the entire time I was fighting in a head.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4387,2022-10-19 00:10:29
16042," The perspective is something I've had a challenge in admitting. I can tell you now that I lived in my mom's Natasha Coraggs the entire time I was fighting and I had a second job as a boutser and a bartender, a third job as a personal trainer just to make ends meet. Nate Quarry told me that over his time in UFC he fought fights while he was tens of thousands of dollars in debt coming into the fight. They get so disheartening because I've seen fights that are called the fight of the year. This is just this brutal war and they battled for four and a half rounds until one guy's body just gave up and then you find out, oh that guy made $60,000 for that fight. In one of the hearings in this lawsuit UFC's attorney argued that if the fighters were really the product, if all that UFC were selling were the fighters, then the fighters wouldn't need UFC at all. That a fighter is not themselves the UFC product any more than an Apple engineer who makes a cool iPhone is the product that Apple is selling. We the fighters make this whole thing happen and it's been driven by Chuck LaDelle. It's been driven by Reyna Gattour. It's been driven by Conor McGregor. It's been driven by Brock Lesnar. It's been driven by all the greats that have walked before us and that walk this path right now. We are the product. If the fighters are not the product, then go ahead and release us from our contracts. You'll do fine without us. Clearly. It's the identity and rank and popularity of those fighters that attract the eyeballs and make the sport what it is. If you can lock all those up and keep them from other promotions, you can dominate the sport, which is what they've admitted they've done. William Isaacson, a lawyer for UFC, said in a statement that UFC has spent many years building a world-class organization, enhancing the brand of our athletes, and championing the sport of MMA. UFC pays its fighters more than any other MMA promoter with average fighter compensation rising by over 600% since 2005. Our efforts have raised the global popularity of the sport and the overall revenue potential of all MMA organizations and athletes. In December of 2020, the judge announced a crucial step in this lawsuit, which is that he is going to certify it as a class action. Class certification makes this lawsuit a much more significant threat to UFC, and the judge made clear long before saying how he planned to rule that he expected whatever he did to be appealed into federal appeals court and on from there to the US Supreme Court. So we are likely in for many more months and years of wrangling over this. Kyle Kingsbury said that he doesn't think any settlement would be acceptable unless it includes a change to the restrictive contracts that UFC uses to keep fighters bound to the UFC. My son is about to turn six years old and it started when he was in the womb. We're in this thing to the end to change the sport forever. We want the same freedoms that are offered in any other major sport and we're every other major sport has gone through what we're going through right now. We'll tell fighters, you know, just shut up, look at how lucky you are. Well no, actually we're fighting for what we believe in. We're going to continue being fighters and that's how we how we're made.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4388,2022-10-19 00:14:52
16043," We're off! The catVee is ready to catch us! Every nation that's a coastal state has some region of the seafloor that falls in their territorial waters and many countries including the US, the area that's under water exceeds the area that's above water. So huge amounts of nations, areas and regions are just really unexplored, uncharacterized. We don't really know what's there. We know less about our seabed than we do about the surface of the moon or Mars. Only 20% of it has been mapped. A map of the seafloor could lead to all kinds of discoveries like numerous species and rare earth minerals like cobalt that we need for electric cars and mobile phones. The value of all the gold deposits alone on the seafloor is estimated to be around 150 trillion dollars. A map could also help us when tragedy strikes. Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared from radar screens. Matting of the ocean floor is being carried out. Problem is that the southern Indian ocean is just so incredibly huge. To me, a map is a fundamental piece of understanding of who we are, where we are, where things are. Once you understand something you start to value it more. But when you start to value something that's when you start to really think about making it healthy and preserving it and keeping it going. A map is the first step. It's the basic understanding that you need to figure out where you are. Oceans. They cover over 70% of the planet, but most of what lies underneath is a mystery. The seafloor is a really fascinating landscape. We don't have a lot of data to describe the shape of it in detail, but in places where we do, there are spectacular features, there's neanderings channels with all kinds of interesting topography, there are canyons, there are sea mounts, mid ocean ridges, all kinds of things that we see on land that are just basically hidden from us by the water. As it stands, this is what a map of the seabed looks like. All that black? Those are the parts we haven't mapped yet. At present, most people think that the seafloor is actually mapped because you'll see a world ocean map and you can see some shape of the seafloor, but most of that is based on prediction. Roughly 80% of what you see for the world ocean floor is modeled based on measurements of the sea surface height and a computation based on gravity. In 2017, the Nippon Foundation and the General Bathometric Chart of the Oceans, or Jebco, launched seabed 2030. It's a collaborative project to collect and collate data ocean wide and create a complete map of the seafloor by the end of the decade. To do this would take one ship around 350 years at a cost of up to $3 billion. That's why data is harvested by all kinds of vessels from fishing boats to freighters. Because there is so little data, it's important that vessels that are capable and willing to acquire data when they're just moving around the ocean do so. So we have a lot of data that's collected during transit. There's a lot of academic requirements to make data publicly available. There's industry data that's starting to become more and more available. There's government data. So there's a lot of different ways that this data is coming in and it's a really messy and challenging puzzle to put together. But what's exciting is that it's a puzzle to put together. Since seabed 2030 launched, the area map has risen to 20% and all the information collected is freely available.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4389,2022-10-19 00:19:14
16044," Since Seba 2030 launched, the area map has risen to 20% and all the information collected is freely available. The more data we have, collectively, and other people can access, the faster the discoveries are made, which really pushes forward our understanding at a faster rate than if you held on to that data and it was only you with that data. Things like machine learning and artificial intelligence are also going to kick in in the next decade. Because with all this data, they'll be able to make connections that are much faster than perhaps we would have been able to, which then again feeds our human understanding and also gives us new ideas, new ways of thinking, of exploration. Until the early 20th century, mapping technology was simple. Usually a weight attached to a long rope known as a lead line. After the Titanic sank in 1912, explorers proposed using sound waves to find its hole in the North Atlantic. This led to Sonar, the most common technique used for mapping today. Operated by the Schmidt Ocean Institute, the Falcourt is an 82 meter long research vessel, equipped with two multi-beam sonar systems that have helped Deborah Smith and a team of other marine technicians to map over a million square kilometers of the sea floor. You go from somebody with a rope with some knots to Sonar acoustics that is, I call it math magic, but it is incredibly advanced mathematical technology to be able to measure the distance and time of travel of sound on a moving ship. Many mapping works by using Sonars, so Sonar is taking sound and measurement of time. You have a multi-beam sonar and it sends out a ping of sound. That sound travels through the water column, hits the sea floor and comes back to the ship and we measure that time and we're able to calculate the distance. Each individual ping of sound has many, many beans, so it looks like a giant fan across the sea floor and that fan is moving along the sea floor. You have many tiny little beans going across and they're traveling along a track. You can look at that data and look at both the peaks and the valleys and the highs and the lows and create a three-dimensional image of the sea floor. The accuracy of multi-beam sonar really depends on the water depth that you're in. Think of it like a flashlight beam and if you're holding a flashlight and you're shining it on the floor, the closer you get to the floor with your flashlight, the smaller that beam is. If you have 400 of these beans all across, I think of 400 people holding a flashlight. The closer they hold that flashlight to the sea floor, the smaller your beam is, which also means the smaller that you can find information or data about. So it really depends on the depth of the sea floor in order to see how much you can define an object. This variation in depth means that mapping resolution will range from 100 by 100 meters in shallow waters to 800 by 800 meters in the deepest parts of the ocean, which go down as far as 11,000 meters. Remotely-operative vehicles or ROVs can then be sent down to investigate sea bed features up close. We've just crossed the 1000 meter mark. It's 4.6 degrees C and now we're going to drive the ROV down at a high rate towards the sea floor. On a recent mapping expedition, scientists on the Falcon discovered a 500 meter tall coral structure in Australia's Great Barrier Reef, the first to be discovered in over 120 years. A place that is incredibly popular, well-visited, well-traveled, we're still finding new things. You don't know until you map it. And so until you get that high resolution picture, you don't know the sand waves or the old riverbeds that used to be there or the waterfalls off the side of a volcano that used to be above the surface and now is below the surface. It's a little bit of everything. Think of let's say Hawaii or someplace where you see a volcano above the water, picture that below the water. I'm really kind of obsessed with the whole concept of scale here. Although we can create 3D models and kind of come up with these visualizations, it's not the same as that feeling of looking out over this big landscape. It's like I've changed the earth, the geography.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4390,2022-10-19 00:23:46
16045," that feeling of looking out over this big landscape. But I mean, I think we'll get there soon with VR and other kinds of technology, but it's really spectacular to think about, especially with the familiarity that some of us have with these features, like what it looks like. We look out at the ocean and it just looks flat, maybe with little bumps. We really don't think about all of this that's underneath, and it's really an amazing landscape that's just hidden from us. With more than 90% of the ocean deeper than 200 metres, fleets of autonomous vehicles could make the data gathering process faster, cheaper and safer. And new discoveries might help with exploration of all kinds. I think the ocean can actually provide us with huge insights as we go out into space as well, and look for life and other kinds of life forms. I also think in this next few years, we will have a different kind of access to the ocean because of virtual reality and augmented reality. And so that will allow us to sit in our living rooms and really experience what's underwater in a different way and see this different alien planet. Since the dawn of man, meat has been on the menu. And even with growing trends of vegetarian diets and plant-based substitutes, around 89% of the world population consider themselves omnivores. And even with growing trends of vegetarian diets and plant-based substitutes, around 89% of the world population consider themselves omnivores. We have come a long way from our hunter and gatherer roads. We have managed to establish a whole industry designed to feed almost 7.7 billion people. We've maximized production and we managed to reduce hunger over the past couple of decades. And although we've become exceedingly efficient at putting meat on the table, raising livestock animals by the billions comes with its own set of consequences. If animal agriculture continues to expand the way it has, there is a race that we won't be able to stop climate change. But with rapid advances in technology, we might soon see a food industry that leaves all those problems behind. I'm Bade Tobi, one of the world's first commercial customers for lab-grown meat cultured meat. It's meat-just as the company and I'm very, very excited. Here is the chicken meat. Looks pretty crispy outside. I'm going to make a chicken meat. I'm going to make a chicken meat. I'm going to make a chicken meat. Looks pretty crispy outside. It's really good. I mean, look, it's really tasty. Here at 1880 in Singapore, culture chicken is being served under a regulatory approval granted by the Singaporean government. It's the very first time a cultured meat product, meat made from animal cells grown in a lab, has been approved for commercial sale. Eat just, the company behind these chicken nugget-style dishes, is based out of San Francisco and got their start in 2011, developing plant-based egg substitutes, like mung bean scrambled eggs and mayonnaise.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4391,2022-10-19 00:28:12
16046," Chicken nugget-style dishes is based out of San Francisco and got their start in 2011 developing plant-based egg substitutes like mung bean scrambled eggs and mayonnaise. But it wasn't until 2017 that they announced they were shifting focus to a cultured meat product. In order to feed the world that we live in, a lot of animal protein, we need to take a third today and it'll be more tomorrow of our world and make it dedicated to feeding chickens and cows. We go to areas that are filled with biodiversity rainforests, taking a bulldozer to them and planting soymcorn to feed the chickens that we climate change is accelerated by the kind of animal production that we engage in. When we bring animals in tiny little spaces, it accelerates the probability that more zoonotic diseases are going to impact our families. And from a morality perspective, why do we need to cause any harm to any other living thing? To have dinner that tastes good, it does not have to be that way and those things underlie the force of this idea. The meat alternatives that have made it to the market thus far have been plant-based. Imitation beef and pork made from ingredients like pea protein and coconut oil by companies like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods. That's a very different proposition from cultured meat, which is made from actual animal cells. I'm a huge fan of any company of any person trying to make a product that's improving the food system, including all the plant-based proteins. Maybe in some future menu you'll have this kind of cultivated chicken and you also have a plant-based version. That's fine. But I guess you have to ask yourself in our lifetime, is that diner likely to also remove the conventional option on the menu too? We do think we need a more permanent solution. We do think we sort of need, if you will, an end game to this problem. And we just think this is more likely to be the path to achieve that. So animal cell technology has been around for several decades for applications such as development of vaccines and other biotherapeutics. The first known prototype of cultured meat was done by Mark Posts earlier in 2011. And essentially it was developing beef patty. It was a very expensive prototype. If I'm not mistaken above 250,000 euros at the time to produce just one beef patty, it was more of a proof of concept to really demonstrate that this technology is possible and that it can be done. The weight that we grow and produce culture chicken is essentially a wheat isolate chicken cells from the chickens without having to kill them. So from a small biopsy, for instance, we immerse these cells in a liquid broth that contains the nutrients that the cells need to survive and be healthy and to grow. We really need these cells to multiply to reach the numbers that are sufficient to make a meat product. We're looking into the cells that are really important for meat. So we think about muscle cells, fat cells, by the isolation, we are able to form those muscle tissues in culture. The culture happens inside of a fermentation tank, what we call the bioreactor, which is essentially providing the same conditions as the animal body. Warm temperatures, some sort of mechanical stimulation, so that the cells that are exposed to very similar conditions that they have inside of the animal. After the cells proliferate and reach a certain density, the final step is essentially to separate those cells from the liquid broth that they are in. We just make sure that the product meets our quality and safety standards and then those cells are ready for consumption. Milk, cheese, yogurt, a lot of those derived from fermentations. The only difference is that they are starting from a different cell type. In this case, we're just using the animal cells as the initial and beginning of the product. Eatjust has developed chicken nuggets so far with far more textured chicken breast plan for the future. But another cell-based meat startup Memphis Meets has already started working on culturing other animal cells as well.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4392,2022-10-19 00:32:18
16047," textured chicken breast plan for the future. But another cell-based meat startup Memphis Meets has already started working on culturing other animal cells as well. We've done beef, we've done duck, we've done chicken, and these are things that are favorites in various parts of the world. For instance, you know, people in America love beef and chicken. People in China love duck, so we wanted to show that we at Memphis Meets can produce meats that we as a global population love to eat. There's a lot of similarity on how we grow the meats from various animals or fish. But they're also different because of nutrients they need and how they actually come together to form the final product of meat. And I think it's very similar to how we also grow various animals. There's similarities in the feed that we gave cows and pigs and chickens, but there's also differences how we cultivate and it's very similar for us as well. So we've been working with the FDA and the USDA for the last three years and really developing the guidelines on how this food should be regulated when we come to the market. As soon as we get regulatory approval in the United States, people will be able to go to the supermarket and buy it and enjoy it. They'll be able to go to a restaurant near them and order meat directly from animal cells. But it's not just getting the meat right. Once approved, the gates open to a very high potential demand and scaling becomes the next big hurdle. Before we can only make chicken for myself, my friends, my girlfriend, my family, my colleagues, now we actually have the ability to make chicken for millions of people. So that allows us to invest and to allow the economies to scale to drop the price. The second is we need to reduce the cost of the nutrients that these cells are consuming. So they think chicken feed raises or drops a price of chicken. The nutrients we feed ourselves does the same things. We need to drive that down. The cell density is another technical element. We need to continue to increase that and hammering on those things. Of the course, the next five, 10, 15 years, we'll put us in a place where we're significantly below the cost of this animal protein. And that will be one of the main inflection points that we'll lead to a new way of eating meat. So here is a close-up of a half-eaten crispy chicken bite. You know what? What I'm really thinking is, just I'm eating chicken. I like chicken. No, the normal chickens, I don't know where they came from. And so I don't know why I should be very stressed where this came from either. The meat market is worth more than $1 trillion annually and there are over 60 startups in the cultured meat field. Cultured meat has attracted several prominent investors including Sergei Brin, Richard Branson and Bill Gates. What is also interesting is that even meat giants such as Cargill and Tyson have invested in space, it's this destructive potential of the market as well as the promise to greatly reduce the climate impact of meat production that has attracting investors. It remains to be seen who will get regulatory approval in which countries and whether consumers will like lab-grown meat enough to make the switch. And while there's no evidence that lab-grown meat is any less healthy than traditional meat, there's an ongoing debate over how healthy eating meat is in general. But if these products are a success, they could be the beginning of a more humane, less destructive meat industry. The food and ag industry is the most innovative industry in the world. It's always figured out how to feed a growing population and we've never failed doing so. And it's been very clear to us that we are part of that and we're going to figure out how to feed the next three billion people joining us. And I just see an evolution. We can do this a bit differently. We can do this in a way that is consistent with the kind of people that we want to be, the kind of planet that we all want to live in. We can build a food system that reflects really the best characteristics of who we are. And that makes me really hopeful.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4393,2022-10-19 00:36:49
16048," collisions In possible foods might be the world's most ambitious company. Just listen to founder and CEO Pat Brown. People wonder how big the plant-based meat industry is going to be. It will be the meat industry in 20 years. We're going to look back and basically say, well, remember back in the day when we used to use animals to make meat? Yes, impossible-stated gold really is to replace the use of animals as a food production technology globally by 2035. That would mean supplanting a $1.2 trillion industry not to mention a source of sustenance as old as time. To be fair, the company has got a lot of people talking about its products. So there's a thing called the Impossible Burger. What's called artificial meat, the realest, the biggest burger in the world. Not bad. But, before impossible foods can take over the world, it's going to have to overcome strong competitors, penetrate tough new markets and generally transform its product from a conversation piece into a ubiquitous staple food. With the coronavirus turning the world of food upside down, this could be the moment when impossible's new fangled meat goes mainstream. Impossible foods was founded in 2011 when Pat Brown, a longtime vegan, was nearing the end of an accomplished career in biochemistry. I've been astounding just my whole life and just came to this realization that by far the most important scientific question in the world is, what makes meat delicious? Pat Brown, someone called a zealot for his mission. He really doesn't hold back when it comes to talking about wanting to completely replace animal agriculture. Producing meat from animals is the most destructive technology on earth. And if we're going to avert catastrophic climate change, we have to find a better way to produce meat. You've probably heard about the dangers of cow flatulence. The digestive systems produce large quantities of the powerful greenhouse gas, methane. In fact, it's estimated that livestock farming is responsible for nearly 15% of all greenhouse gas emissions. Impossible claims it takes 89% less GHGs, 87% less water and 96% less land to produce its burger. The key, of course, would be to get people to actually eat the thing, which is where the company's secret ingredient comes in. Him, a genetically engineered substance with a bloody, iron-rich taste like red meat. So him is a very controversial part of the Impossible Burger. It's also what makes the Impossible Burger what it is. There are a lot of consumer groups and anti-GMO groups that oppose the Impossible Burger because of the him. The studies on its safety are a pretty short term, but the FDA has approved it and the company says it's completely safe. And there isn't any evidence that it isn't. Critics have also challenged the company's claim to health advantages over traditional meat, pointing out that while the Impossible Burger has less fat, sodium and calories than its beefy cousin, it's also more highly processed. Let's be real, we're talking about mimicking hamburgers here, not kale salads. These burgers are definitely better for the environment, so that's a plus, but they are not necessarily better for your health. After years in the lab, Patton's colleagues were confident they had a product even Ron Sponson could love, and the Impossible Burger made its debut in 2016. Better Burger,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4394,2022-10-19 00:41:16
16049," Athens colleagues were confident they had a product even Ron Sponson could love. And the impossible burger made its debut in 2016. Their burger began its life in the public when it was sold at David Chang's Mama Fuku. And they went from sort of higher-end, fine dining restaurants into higher-end burger restaurants, like Bare Burger and Mommy Burger. And then suddenly they started popping up everywhere. It tastes like a burger. It tastes like meat. This is all meat from plants. All made from plants. This tastes like beef. Doesn't that just look like real meat? So meat-like. They always say it's what they say. Just like a burger. It tastes like... Yuckers. The full is the world. Relax. No, it doesn't taste like a burger. Opinions differed on the impossible burger's relative meatiness. But the debate itself was fantastic free advertising, helping to propel impossible into major chains like white castle. And then in the summer of 2019, into more than 7,000 burger kings across the US. To date, the company has raised over a billion dollars and a funding round in March valued the company at around four billion. But fake meat is a happening space these days and impossible faces some daunting competition. So now for the stock of the hour. And that is beyond meat shares of the faux meat or plant-based protein company are soaring today. Beyond meat is also making a very meaty burger from plants. They're very non-GMO. They stress that all the time to differentiate themselves from impossible. It'll be much easier to genetically modify plant material to make it take on the texture and appearance and aroma of animal protein. But we won't do that. Beyond meat had one of the biggest IPOs of the year in 2019. So impossible, which is still privately held, has some catching up to do. But you won't hear Pat Brown knocking his biggest competitor. I wish them nothing but success. They have the same mission we have. The only rival we care about is the incumbent animal-based industry. Rivals or not, impossible and beyond certainly agree on one thing. The true prize isn't the American market. It's China. 27% of the world's meat is consumed in China compared to just 9% in the US. The Chinese population eats a ton of meat. They are a huge market. China is a really interesting case because they have long had vegetarian cuisine as part of their culinary culture. And whether they are looking for meat replacements is still an open question. What we found in our reporting is that some consumers are excited about them. It's just we don't know if it's going to be enough. To improve its prospects, impossible is developing a plant-based replacement for pork. Globally pork is the most widely consumed meat. It's almost 40% of all the meat consumed globally. Number one in Europe, number one in China. So if we're going to achieve our mission, pork is right up there. No word yet on when impossible pork will be available. This morning, growing concerns about the nation's food supply. From butchers to national supermarkets, supplies now limited and prices rising. The impact of the coronavirus on the price and availability of meat has given a boost to companies like Impossible Foods. Over the four weeks ending April 19, sales of plant-based meat increased. But Impossible has acknowledged some negative effects from the pandemic as well. This being a product that has primarily been served in restaurants, they took a pretty big hit with all the food service shutdowns, although the company doesn't want to say, you know, how much of a hit. They have, however, announced some new retail rollouts. Recently, they announced that they're going to be rolling out with crogr supermarkets. And that's big. That's great for them. The question of whether this is like a long-term sea change for these companies. I don't know. Just have to wait and see. It's safe to say Impossible stands in the world.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4395,2022-10-19 00:45:22
16050," from sea change for these companies. I don't know, just after we've seen. It's safe to say impossible stands a slim chance of achieving its goal of replacing the entire meat industry. But it's early days for the science of plant-based meat, and it's not impossible that these products could one day contribute to a greener, more humane future. In the meantime, as the technology improves, we get to look forward to many more years of this. This is meat. No, this isn't possible. Yeah, that's what I thought. This is the meat burger. I like it better. It's not even close to a veggie burger or tofu burger or anything like that. It's very, very much. What are is a strategically important point on the map of Pakistan? It's very close to Iran, actually, on the very southern coast. It's about a 10-hour drive west of Karachi, but it's only about an hour drive to Iran. The area is extremely poor. It's very arid. It doesn't have enough water. Electricity has been very spotty. One of the most surprising things about visiting Guadar is the high degree of security that is absolutely everywhere. There are armed guards that are required to escort foreign visitors everywhere. You go because it is contested in the region, because there have been militant attacks in the past. Despite all this, Guadar is a key part of the China-Pakistan economic corridor, also known as CPEC. The crown jewel of President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative. We will leave no stone unturned in ensuring that CPEC and all the projects under its umbrella are materialized in time and in full. So far, just one-third of all CPEC projects have been completed. In Guadar, none of them have been, and the promised improvements for local people like Job Creation and Better Infrastructure have not materialized. So what has China got to gain from developing this seemingly obscure city on the Pakistani coast? We have seen this movie before. An outside power comes into Pakistan. It spends heavily on big infrastructure projects. China is not the first to do it. Right after Pakistan became independent in the late 1940s, early 50s, the US was sending advisors into Pakistan to help plant economy. The US was doing infrastructure projects there too. Those early projects helped the US gain Pakistan as an ally against the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The US has provided about $80 billion in aid to Pakistan since its independence, but overall the result is disappointing. One of the recent attempts was in the late 2000s, as part of the US effort to combat terrorism in Afghanistan. The number one item on that aid package was to build these high visibility infrastructure projects. So there are literally projects that the United States tried to do or Pakistan proposed to the United States in the 2000s during that period that have become Belt and Road projects. China is stepping into a gap which has been left by retreating ambition from the US. The Belt and Road Initiative is China's President Xi Jinping's signature foreign policy initiative.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4396,2022-10-19 00:49:24
16051," The Belt and Road Initiative is China's president Xi Jinping's signature foreign policy initiative. Launched in 2013, it comprises an overland belt stretching through China, central Asia, into Europe, and a maritime road stretching around Southeast Asia through the India Ocean and up past East Africa. So a benign way of characterizing China's Belt and Road Initiative would be infrastructure for influence. So when Xi Jinping announced the Belt and Road Initiative, shortly afterwards China designated Pakistan as its showcase flagship project. So the China Pakistan Economic Quarter was going to be the biggest and most important showcase for the success of the Belt and Road. Pakistan is in great need of infrastructure development. They wanted to create a railway, a highway road, all kinds of economic development that is intended to help Pakistan. And it's meant to provide jobs, 2.3 million jobs for Pakistanis. It's meant to provide a 2.5% boost to GDP growth. And China would gain economically as well. CPEC was intended to reduce oil and gas routes from the Middle East by thousands of miles, a way to cut overland into western China instead of going around Southeast Asia by ship. Projects in Pakistan also provide Chinese state owned companies with an additional market. Chinese workers are brought to Pakistan to build infrastructure and then take wages home. CPEC is also strategically significant for China and Pakistan. China wants to strengthen this relationship to counter their shared rival India. CPEC is both an instrument of Chinese power as well as a test of Chinese power. If it succeeds, China will be demonstrating that it's able to do what great powers have not been able to do in Pakistan, including the United States. Which is why Guadal is so important. It's in Pakistan's Balochistan province, an area with serious electricity and water shortages. Balochistan province is actually populated by people who are of Baloch origin. There are different ethnicity. They speak a different language from the majority in power in Islamabad. And they feel as the poorest province in Pakistan, they have not sufficiently benefited from some of the economic achievements that the rest of Pakistan has had. That area is quite contested by the Balochistan Liberation Army. The people who feel that even Pakistani people have encroached into their territory. So quite a number of people are still staging attacks and they attacked the biggest international hotel in Guadar. Shout up the lobby and killed I think five people. But this unsettled city is where the China-Pakistan economic corridor is supposed to lead to. Authorities plan to develop Guadar into an international port city. Guadar port has an interesting history and an interesting location too. It's located in Balochistan. It's about 120 kilometers from Iran. Pakistan purchased this territory from Oman, I think of the 1950s. And so for a long time, Pakistan has had on its agenda trying to develop this area. Since the 70s, it's wanted to build a port in Guadar. Actually approached the United States in the 1970s and tried to convince the Nixon administration to pay for a port. Even offered naval access if the United States was willing to pay for that. The US rejected Pakistan's offer. Concerned that the port would not be commercially viable and would cause geopolitical tension. But in the early 2000s, a Chinese company was awarded the contract to build the port and they completed phase one of construction in 2006. The port was then managed by a Singaporean government entity. In 2013, a Chinese port operator took over from the Singaporeans. In 2015, China announced that it will expand the port as part of the CPEC initiative. But five years later, little has happened. When you look out at the port, you can see it has only three births.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4397,2022-10-19 00:53:53
16052," It will expand the port as part of the CPEC initiative, but five years later, little has happened. When you look out at the port, you can see it has only three births, and all of them were empty. And the only ship that was in the port at the time was a Pakistan naval forget. And so it indicated to me that the port is not particularly operational for commercial purposes. And a number of analysts have talked about the strategic importance in a military sense. If eventually China were able to use the port of Guadar as a military base. You know, no one would be surprised if China did use it in that way. I don't think in the short term, like it is set up in Djibouti, where it has a permanent base. I think it's more likely to use it as almost like a sort of forward-based resupply option. I'm something I can use when it wants to. Other projects like building Pakistan's largest airport in Guadar and two special economic zones have been delayed. A 19 kilometer highway linking the port with the Macarankoastal highway in Balochistan is under construction too. Most of the people who live there and work there already are fishermen. They rely on access to the sea. The way that the highway expressed highway from the port was originally proposed to cut off their sea access. So that was a real point of contention with the community. There have been some proposals to allow them at underpass. It's still a little bit unclear how that is finally going to be resolved. Even if those projects are eventually built, there are serious questions about who will work there. There is a problem with manpower, of course, in Guadar. It's a very small city. And so one proposal has been well, we'll just ship Chinese workers in from China and build lots of fancy housing for them. The first Chinese built community in Pakistan, a $500 million development spanning over 10 million square feet with over 60% open spaces. That kind of proposal is what makes a lot of the Pakistani local people quite upset. A Guadar-based journalist expressed concerns to Bloomberg over projects like this. The journalist spoke anonymously for fear of persecution from the Pakistan government. These projects are creating jobs, but they're not really creating jobs for the local people of Guadar. They're not against economic prosperity, but they're against the development that leaves them behind. Pakistan doesn't have the money to build these projects. It's gone to the IMF for its 13th bailout since the 1980s. By engaging in CPEC projects, the government of Pakistan has incurred more debts from China. Not only posing challenges for Pakistan, but possibly the international community, if Pakistan eventually defaults on its debts. But CPEC is still set to go on. Even if most current projects haven't been completed, the two countries have recently signed new projects worth $11 billion. Pakistan's Prime Minister said the country's economic future is linked with China. It's hard to imagine how the China-Pakistan Economic Quarter is going to be the game changer that the Pakistan government would like it to be. We're not seeing the economic growth or benefit from the projects that were set out. We're supposed to see by now, we're not seeing the job creation. Project delays accumulating debts' commercial viability. These problems of CPEC are also typical of Belt and Road projects around the world. For China, though, it's never the narrow accounting perspective that matters. It's the bigger strategic benefits. As China's dollars continue to flow, as China's concrete continues to pour, China's influence continues to increase.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4398,2022-10-19 00:58:17
16053," Kemoto pass There was some degree of runaway expectations. I think there was also some degree that they were an extremely forthcoming with the state of the game. The Cyberpunk 2077 story is very much a story of everything that can and will go rock in game development. The release of Cyberpunk 2077 in December of 2020 will go down as one of the most disastrous game launches in history. And it instantly rewrote the narrative of its celebrated developer, CD Projekt Red. Larger studios with bigger budgets weren't able to create the same quality of open-world game. The inside story of the making of Cyberpunk depicts a process marred by unchecked ambition, unrealistic timelines, and a focus on marketing at the expense of development. When CD Projekt stock was at its high, it was the largest stock in the Polish stock market. Cyberpunk was supposed to be the biggest game of 2020. This was a game that was starring Keanu Reeves. This is a game that was from the makers of the Witcher 3. This was supposed to be the big temple release of last year. And for it to become such a disaster for so many people, I think, will have pretty far reaching consequences. CD Projekt Origins are somewhat unique in the game's industry. In the West and Japan, the late 80s and 90s were dominated by games through the home console market, and characters like Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog were becoming household names. The same was not true in a post-Soviet and economically depressed Poland. Most gaming was done on PCs, and most games were copied and sold in small markets around the country. We go to the market down the street in Warsaw and buy in cell CDs. These two guys, Marcin Lewinsky and Michal Kaczynski, decided they were going to start selling CDs, and they wound up striking a deal with the people who made a game called Baldur's Gate, which was the seminal role-playing game in the late 90s. It was never a business. It was lifestyle. So we're actually pretty bad with counting money. You can kind of think of it almost like Nike, where Phil Knight was selling shoes out of the trunk of his car. You can kind of think about it the same way. It was just selling physical goods and then evolving that into a much broader enterprise. CD Projekt, named for selling CDs, would move on from just reselling games to localizing Western and Japanese made games into the Polish language. But it wasn't until 2002 that the company would make its own game, The Witcher. The Witcher is a huge, huge series, huge fantasy series in Poland. So it was a pretty big deal that these guys got the race to make the video games. The Witcher book series is a source of national pride in Poland. And as CD Projekt released The Witcher 2, the video game series would become an important economic symbol for Poland as well. The CD Projekt Red had become this behemoth of an institution in Poland, and they were really big in the Polish technology scene because they were getting more worldwide attention than most Polish companies do. And making a lot of money. And in 2011 when Barack Obama came to visit Poland, the Prime Minister actually gave him a copy of The Witcher 2. I confess I'm not very good at video games, but I've been told that it is a great example of Poland's place in the new blo-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4399,2022-10-19 01:02:51
16054," I've been told that it is a great example of Poland's place in the new global economy. But it would be the launch of the Witcher 3 in 2015 that would elevate CD Projekt Red from representing the best of Poland to representing the best of the game's industry. I mean really the thing people look for first and foremost I think is that the game is just good and Witcher 3 was just a phenomenal game. There's a level of just storytelling, an emphasis on making every side quest count on top of the atmosphere, the dialogue, the character interactions, the different way stories can end. They nail that. Other open world games felt empty and forced and the developers of them gave excuses as to why there couldn't be more rich story or interactions. And the Witcher 3 blew them out of the water. CD Projekt Red was beloved. They were seen as a studio that was willing to make what the player wanted and to truly put in the love and effort required to make a high quality game that really connects with the people playing with it. And the winner for Game of the Year 2015 is The Witcher 3. The Witcher 3 would go into an over 250 game of the year award. But along with being a critical success for CD Projekt, it was also a financial success. Estimates put the sales of Witcher 3 at around 28 million copies in 2019. A huge step up, considering by 2014 the Witcher and the Witcher 2 had only combined to sell 8 million copies. And with two large expansions for The Witcher 3, CD Projekt also helped separate themselves from other AAA publishers at the time. And the game award goes, oh man I have to pay a micro transaction to unlock. That's so stupid that this has to hold on. I got this guys. Here we go. Other games and the most notorious one to do this was EA's Star Wars Battle Front 2. They got really aggressive on micro transactions in a game that already cost at least $60. You could have paid more if you bought the premium editions. But not only was it that they were being very aggressive and trying to get you to spend money, but you could actually get items that helped you win. Well, gamers kind of draw the line in the sand there and they don't like them. CD Projekt had done this phenomenal job of marketing themselves as a gamer friendly company. We've said this a million times and I'll say it again, worth gamers first of all and we all like to be treated fairly. So it only makes sense that as developers we apply the same principle to everything we do here at CD Projekt Red. So giving everyone a bunch of free DLC was an absolutely no brainer. They said we're not going to sell you DLC that's like horse armor packs and other nonsense. We're going to just give you a free stuff and then we're going to sell big expansions as part of the Witcher 3. And not only were they really good, they were offered at a fair price. And this is a company that was seen as just like a company that really cared about quality and cared about its customers and we're not doing anything to kind of screw fans over the way that that fans see that EA and Activision and all the other big publishers do. With a critically and financially successful game, as well as the goodwill from the gaming audience, all the focus which shift to CD Projekt's next release.

16055," [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ It's actually funny. They first announced it through like a press release. And then they showed off a trailer of the beginning of 2013 that was like the CGI trailer of like a woman. And there was all sorts of cool cyberpunk stuff flying cars lots of stuff but it wasn't really until after the Witcher 3 that cyberpunk began really like building up this fever level of hype. CD Projekt Red though wouldn't put out another trailer for Cyberpunk until 2018 at the E3 trade show. And they showed off a it was like a two minute trailer of Cyberpunk look pretty rad. [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ And then they showed behind the scenes for E3 attendees for press and anyone else who could get a score an appointment in there. They showed this 45 minute demo and it blew people away. [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ Welcome to the gameplay demo walkthrough of CD Projekt Red's upcoming title, Cyberpunk 2077. The gameplay you're about to see is from a work in progress version of the game. Everything you see is potentially subject to change. [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ This if they can live up to what they showed me, it's game over. [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ It all looked incredibly impressive. They had enough action, enough narrative beats with just the right amount of tension. They touted how each of these NPCs, their thousands of them, each one with their own daily routines and everything. We've greatly enhanced our crowd and community system to create the most believable city in any open world game to do. So yeah, so people were certainly blown away by this demo at 1 E3 awards and just people left the theater just in awe. What they didn't know of course is that the demo was completely fake. Fake demos are common at E3. Studios put together builds of games to show off what they intend the game to be like rather than the actual state of the game. What was unique about this demo was that it was impressively long. It kind of plays into this idea that CD Projekt is very much a market-and-driven company and so demos were really, really important to them. So it was really important that they make this demo blow people away, which it did. But that might have come to the cause of some time they could have been spending on the game. A year later, at E3 2019, fans would get another big surprise. Whoa! No way! Oh what?! These welcome. The beauty of being there, of walking the streets of the future, is really going to be breathtaking. You're a bref, Jason! The Cyberpunk trailers showed gorgeous cities, beautiful lighting, really cutting-edge technology when it comes to the rendering of the game itself. People were very excited to be immersed in this gorgeous Cyberpunk world. They saw over 8 million pre-orders, which is a ridiculously large amount for any title to sell. Let alone pre-sell. And you saw the stock price start to go up and up and up into the right. Pretty much in a straight line. If you just look at the polished stock market, like the Wig Index, when CD Projekt stock was at its high, it was the largest stock in the index. And that was around the time that they announced that the game would be coming in April of 2020. Behind the Seaheens, people were pretty shocked that they were saying April. I don't think a single person who worked on that game actually thought they had a chance of coming out in April of 2020. So in April of 2019, I published an article for Kotaku about the making of a game called Anthem, which was a game from ByWare that was disastrous in many ways and the article ran through why that...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4401,2022-10-19 01:11:11
16056," I published an article for Kotaku about the making of a game called Anthem, which is a game from Byware that was disastrous in many ways and the article kind of ran through why that was. Afterwards, I started hearing from other developers who had stories to share that they said sounded a whole lot like Anthem. The deadline is unrealistic, the direction keeps changing, things are floundering, we're going through a lot of problems. And this sounds exactly like what you wrote about Anthem. Around that same time, perhaps coincidentally, I heard from VCEO of CD Projekt Red who wanted to reach out to me specifically to talk about Crunch. CD Projekt Red had a reputation for Crunch, especially during the development of Witcher 3. Their management wanted them to have a reputation for treating workers well and not forcing them to go through Crunch. So, Marchinevinsky, who's a co-founder and co-CEO of CD Projekt Red, came to me and said, hey, I want to make a vow right now that we're not going to force anybody to crouch, that people will not have to work mandatory over time on this project. Over the course of reporting, Bloomberg has conducted interviews of more than 20 current and former CD Projekt staff, most of whom requested anonymity, so as not to risk their careers. CD Projekt declined a comment on the process, or provide interviews with this story. The company would end up delaying the game three different times, first pushing from an April 2020 release to September, then November, and once again to December 2020. In order to meet the deadline, the studio would scale down the size of Cyberpunk's main city, as well as canceling some features. And while those measures helped, developers still said they were under significant crunch, including one former audio programmer who claimed to work up to 13 hours a day, five days a week, and stating he had seen friends who had lost their families over this. This was not a big secret in the office that the game was not going to be ready, but a similar sort of thing happened with Witcher 3, and a similar sort of thing happens with a lot of games where they don't seem ready until suddenly everything just clicks. Some of the best games ever made, like we've created through this process. I don't know that it's the most efficient, or the wisest way to make video games, but it's what a lot of people too. I think that management there has genuinely tried to change it, or at least said they wanted to change it, but it has proven very difficult to change that when you make games in this one specific way. Game studios, some of them see crunch as part of their core culture, that all of their games that they've made under crunch have been successful, so it must be a core element to the magic recipe for creating good games. And that's really not the case. We've run studies and seen that at eight weeks of working 60 hours plus, the output of a professional is the same as if they were working 40 hours a week. So chronic overwork degrades how effective someone is to the point where then it becomes negative, and overworking them is just getting new less and less productivity. And so these guys, the people at CD Projekt, having made the Witcher 3, were kind of riding on that high, you could call it arrogance or confidence, or whenever you want to call it, of having made the Witcher 3. And I think that like having a certain level confidence can certainly be a good thing, but in this case it could also be dangerous because it kind of blinded them to the reality, which was that this game wasn't going to call us. So, I understand why I always ask, to the second thing because it has been incredibly tough when we're all doing that, maybe we only do that again, other than to the physical、組 and everything, right, to do the math, not even a botanica, just the technique that I'm dealing with, and to it only so I feel like no other games than the first generation, no more games that I would think, like rather than a So many pictures entertainment is reeling from what may be the biggest and most devastating computer hacking in Hollywood's history.

16057," Sony Pictures Entertainment is reeling from what may be the biggest and modes devastating computer hacking in Hollywood's history. Hackers attacked in waves. First crippling Sony's internal systems, then leaking five Sony movies online. Today, the US government pointed the finger of blame directly at North Korea for the devastating cyber attack against Sony Pictures. Sony pulling the plug on the interview, saying it will not show the controversial comedy about an assassination attempt on North Korea's leader. The Sony Pictures hacking was taken very seriously because it wasn't attacked on the free world. What we had been building in terms of our civilization and our freedom and our ability to exchange information freely have been disrupted by a country that we knew very little about. North Korea has reportedly made attempts to steal COVID-19 vaccine technology by hacking from the city of Gujian Faza. The Justice Department has charged three North Korean hackers over a wide ranging scheme that included the attempt theft of billions of dollars for multiple companies. Despite so many attacks blamed on North Korea, there was not much known about the people behind the hacking attacks. And my aim was to reveal who these people are and what they are like, what their operations are like, and on what their dreams and fears were. My name is Sam Kim. I'm a reporter for Blue Mug News, and I wrote a story for Business Week about North Korean hackers. My story is about people who are sent from North Korea to countries like China to hack the regime, spy on enemies, and make money. North Korea's cyber abilities began about in the 1970s with a lot of students going to countries like Russia, China, and even East Germany to learn coding was aimed at improving the productivity of factories at home. But in some time in the 1980s and 1990s, the current leader Kim Jong-un's father, Kim Jong-un, thought that it would be a good idea to develop a team, an army of people who could hack for North Korea's military. So they began this team of hackers who would spy for the North Korean regime, and also go out there and make hard currency for the regime. I think Kim Jong-un takes the hacking ability more seriously than his father. He also enjoys a bit of tech sadness as well. He's often shown traveling on his airplane where on the desk there's a Mac computer. He understands the importance of computers. He understands the importance of employing technology to improve productivity of his economy. North Korea is an isolated country with its economy pretty much dilapidated nowadays. It's been under impression pressure and sanctions from the US and the international community basically. It does not have the resources and money to build a kind of conventional weapons that other countries are able to build. So what happens is North Korea concentrates its resources on building nuclear arms and missiles, which exports coal basically a symmetrical weapons. It's the kind of weapons that gives North Korea an instant edge. Think of cyber hacking abilities in that context. It doesn't cost them much money, but if you have the right people, and if you have the right training, you are able to cultivate an army of people who are able to penetrate into computer systems of other countries. And that's what North Korea is after.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4403,2022-10-19 01:19:43
16058," able to cultivate an army of people who are able to penetrate into computer systems of other countries. And that's what North Korea is after. But if you consider the fact that there are only about a thousand IP addresses in North Korea available and many of them are basically loaned from Chinese communications companies, you can kind of tell why North Korea is willing to send its hackers abroad rather than operate from within. What's the matter with operating from within? Well, first of all, it would mean that a lot of information would have to be coming in from the outside world, which could risk exposing the government and the people to whatever truth there might be about them. So they're sending their trained hackers to China and other countries where access to information is better. But at the same time, because these are allies, and also because they have their diplomats station in countries like these, like China, they're able to regulate and control these hackers better. But formally, North Korea denies engaging in hacking and describing accusations to that affect as enemy propaganda. It took me at least half a year to track down these people. It felt like a wall of loose chase in the beginning, because a lot of the people like these are protected by the government in South Korea. But at the end, I was able to find a person who had pretty extensive ties to the North Korean defective community here. And then I was also able to gain access to the people who had actually done programming hacking from North Korea before coming to South Korea. And Jung is one of them. Jung actually is not a real name. I knew before meeting Jung that he was in his late 30s. But when I actually met him, he looked at least a decade older. He wouldn't open up. I mean, it took me, I think at least an hour to make sure that he would trust me enough that he would share with me his life story. When he was first sent to China, he was a student studying computer science at a university near the border with North Korea. And he came back and realized that there was a lot more to do in China because he had more access to information. And he asked that he'd be sent back to China. And there was also recruitment going on for people who would actually do coding officially, but really hacking from North Korea. So he applied and he got the job. Once he got to the border, he crossed by foot and from there he took a bus. And then when he arrived at the station that he would spend years in later, he learned that the three-story building in the heart of a city was actually provided for free actually by a Chinese man who had business ties in North Korea. There were actually two other people that I had met. They all said that they go to this freelance website for programmers and clients from around the world would come and give them orders, give them jobs to do. Some of the jobs given to Jung were cracking open, commercially successful anti-virus programs. And once he was able to open that up, he replicated that program into another product which his client would repackage as a whole different product to be sold to other people. He also created what we now call bots. They are very popular online games including lineage. He would create a bot that would just roam around without any supervision from the user and basically trade items without a user on that game. He would grow that bot on lineage and sell it for almost $100. Another defector said the money from clients was wired primarily.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4404,2022-10-19 01:24:10
16059," He would grow that bond on lineage and sell it for almost $100. Another defector said the money from clients was wired primarily via PayPal to accounts controlled by minors because they were the only ones with access to legitimate bank accounts. Chang had to make at least $100,000 in a year and he doesn't get to keep most of it. Most of the money goes to the minors to the North Korean regime but if you don't meet the quota and the minors will make sure that they'll put enough pressure on you and if that happens repeatedly you will face the growing odds of being sent back home. Among the three people that I spoke to and there's a common thing that they all tell me which is that on every Saturday they have to do this propaganda session which is basically about gathering all the hackers together into a room and they have to recite whatever message, whatever lines come from Pyongyang about the Kim family about socialism. If you're especially someone who with a free set of mind that's stressful. One person actually was really stressed out what he heard about North Korea once he was in China during the propaganda sessions he just couldn't take it. The young wind is the wind, the wind is the wind, the wind is the wind, the wind is the wind, the wind is the wind. Chang was a senior member of the unit that he belonged to and he was good at Chinese as well. Whenever a senior North Korean official came from North Korea to check on the hacking units in China Chang would accompany that official. He doesn't provide me details but it calls it unsavory instant that happened between him and an official that he was traveling with him and that altercation prompted him to defect but there was no one that he could turn to after affecting him. He would in disguise roam around China. He called me that he actually enjoyed it. He actually enjoyed the freedom of not being known to anybody. Just roaming around a country that was huge. How did he make the money that he needed to carry on? He did the same thing he did. You know at the North Korean unit he would take orders, he would reverse engineer a software to make money but at one point he said he was just sick and tired of it all of a sudden. He just wanted to find a place where he could just settle down and he contacted South Korean authorities. Now he lives in Korea. He met a woman here. Last time I checked the head of baby, he worked for a software company ironically, an antivirus company. What keeps coming up in my head, even long after I spoke to these people, is there was one common thing about them which was the sense of disillusionment. One day had access to outside information. One day we were able to freely roam in the internet. There was a spark and once they realized that there was a discrepancy between what they think is really happening and what North Korea is telling them every Saturday morning. That's when the spark gets bigger. Their little fire is what eventually drives them to decide to leave, even if it takes a huge risk on their lives.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4405,2022-10-19 01:28:28
16060," Jem vibrates......... Step into the shopping center of the future. A world filled with exciting ideas. Since they started popping up in the 1950s, malls have been the quintessential American shopping experience. Useling temples dedicated to the wonders and excesses of retail, food service, and entertainment, the rise of the mall coincided with the growth of the suburbs. The heyday of the malls really is the 1970s, sometimes referred to as the malling of America. They really thrived at providing some sort of public gathering space, some sort of social life, in addition to actually giving people places to shop. Over the past few decades before then, lots of developers were building malls and it kind of coincided with the growth of highways. So as more people started traveling and interstate started being built, developers really wanted to put something to attract people to stop. Take a look at an average American mall today, however, and you'll see a very different picture. Closed stores and empty hallways became the norm in many malls even before COVID-19 delivered them another set of problems in 2020. So what happened? This is the story of the rise and fall of American malls. When malls work best, they survived and thrived thanks to their anchor stores. Those are the stores that are on the edges of the malls and that are outward facing to the parking lot. So if you're a shopper, you're going to walk through one of these big, usually a department store. So if you're thinking about maces or sears or JC Penny, those are called the anchor stores. So once shoppers are done shopping there, maybe they wander to the middle part of the mall, shopping at the other apparel shops, or even going to buy some food. But you really had to have a reason for people to shop in the first place. Because anchors bring in all those people, they tend to pay very little rent. Around 80% of income from mall owners come from the inline stores inside the mall. Over the past few decades, malls have been facing challenges from all sides. The first being, there's just too many of them. As early as in the 90s, the malls were beginning to compete with each other. We have a lot more retail square footage per capita than Canada. We have only seven times more retail square footage per capita.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4406,2022-10-19 01:32:47
16061," Compute with each other. We have a lot more retail square footage per capita than Canada. We have only seven times more retail square footage per capita than Europe. After the 2008 financial crisis lowered retail spending across the board, malls and especially their department stores also had to contend with a new challenge that was growing fast. malls started to suffer in the early 2000s with the rise of online shopping. Suddenly they didn't have that captive audience who had to go to the mall to buy something. You didn't have to get up, get in your car, drive all the way to the mall and then see a bunch of other people. You can just do it from the comfort of your own. Department stores overall have become less relevant over the years. Many have fallen totally off and that's Sears, JC Penney. Several bankruptcies in this space have really hurt the industry. But as department stores go so does the mall oftentimes. So if department stores start closing locations that means they're usually leaving malls. This is the Green Briar Mall in southwest Atlanta, Georgia. It's in many ways emblematic of the problems facing malls today. It's been there since 1965 so for more than half of a century it's been serving this area of Atlanta that's predominantly black and also as middle class neighborhood. It started with anchor stores that were department stores. So you had JC Penney and then Riches which was later bought by Macy's. So you had these two national chains. It had the first Chick-fil-A in a mall like that type of format. So when you think about the history of malls like Green Briar had like the perfect template but now Macy's will be exiting the mall. Meaning that the mall will be left without an anchor which is vital to attracting other shoppers to come into the stores. Green Briar then because it's kind of an example or a test for all these other middling malls across America about what do you do when these large department stores as a business decision on their end are trying to just stay in the high quality malls. How does a middling mall survive? What's their next strategy? Green Briar is a textbook example of how closely the deterioration of the middle class in the US is tied to the health of its malls. The median income for the surrounding area has reduced by $6,905 over the past 15 years to a total of $20,756 per year and yet residents and store owners hope that Green Briar mall will see better days. Malls are made up of the people and communities that help fuel them. Green Briar is still a place that people go to and cherish even if on paper it doesn't have the elements that make it a thriving mall. A lot of the existing constituents and residents there feel in many respects that they worked hard their whole lives to be able to experience the American dream, the single family suburban house in a leafy yard near a big mall that had a great NACI's and they're very reluctant to see that taken away from them. Now that NACI's is gone, Green Briar may try to take inspiration from what many malls were doing in the years following the financial crisis, focusing not on shopping but experiences. That was a trend we were seeing in 2016.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4407,2022-10-19 01:37:13
16062," from what many malls were doing in the years following the financial crisis, focusing not on shopping, but experiences. That was a trend we were seeing in 2016, up into the pandemic pretty much. And by experiences, I mean, everything as dramatic as a water park, or hosting concerts to have people want to come other than just to buy stuff. Having Instagramable moments, making sure your store is pretty that people want to take a photo and post it on Instagram or Twitter. Historically, the mall has always been a place for teenagers. You like to hang out, see your friends, and also kind of be seen at the mall. And that hasn't completely changed like before the pandemic, about 95% of Gen Z. So today's teenagers had gone to a mall in a three month period. So teenagers are still going to the mall, and they've always been key to having thriving malls because they're coming into their spending power. And once you win over teens, hopefully you're really winning over a loyal customer for life. But thanks to lockdowns across the country, most malls at one point or another were shuttered in 2020. That means no one using the multi-billion dollar American Dream malls indoor ski slope. No one going to the King of Prussia malls indoor skydiving attraction. Basically, the pandemic gave malls what they didn't need, another problem. What would your net income or net operating income have been in 2022 without COVID and what is it now in a post-COVID world? So our view is it's roughly 10% hit to net income over that period. That's Vince Taboni from the analytics firm Green Street Advisors, which rates American malls from 8 a deed just like a report card. And if malls did have a report card, they wouldn't exactly make honor roll. Here in the US, out of the thousand malls in the country, there are roughly 250 malls, we grade a minus or better. The B&C quality malls, which is the vast majority of the malls by count, we think are on a negative trajectory. And it's going to depend on a lot of the local dynamics, ownership, decisions, around how much money to invest in the property. We'll determine whether this mall can survive as retail, or so, you know, rapidly melting ice cube. While there have been a few bankruptcies among real estate investment trusts that own mostly B2D malls in the past few years, A malls really are doing just fine. Some of the most productive shopping centers in the country are super high-end. So I'm talking about bowel harborshops down in Miami, Florida. There's Americana man has it in Long Island's Gold Coast, the Grove in Los Angeles. These are places that have all high-end stores and have done quite well. A lot of that has to do with efficiency of their property, so their sales per square foot are really high. But also, they've invested a lot in their actual mall, because it has to look beautiful. It has to have all the services that a wealthy shopper expects. So what will the future hold for less sought-after malls that can't revive their golden years? For many of these malls, it will mean closure, and then hopefully conversion. If they can't get a new use to come in, it's expensive, but you can just demolish it. And there are still quite a lot of sites just sitting waiting. Amazon has been picking up more and more of those, building their big fulfillment centers. Also, a lot of communities think this is an opportunity to redevelop, re-enhabit this dead mall, to help that community meet the challenges it was never originally designed for. The number one reuse of an existing mall is as workspace. It's actually pretty easy to just throw some carpeting down, cut a few more windows, and turn it into office space. The sort of number two reuse of malls is either medical, health care, or education. Lots of great examples of community colleges all the way down to elementary schools. Moving into malls, then the third strategy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4408,2022-10-19 01:41:41
16063," examples of community colleges all the way down to elementary schools. Moving into malls, then the third strategy that I still, I wish happened more is actually just demolishing the mall and re-grain it. Either reconstructing the wetlands that used to be there and that, frankly, we never should have built on in the first place or providing community parks and gardens. While most analysts say post-pandemic retail shopping could breathe some life back into the American mall, many are not long for this world. Depending on where you live, it might be time to make one last visit, grab some food, do some shopping, and say farewell. President Trump traveled to Utah today where he dramatically cut back the size of two national monuments in that state. When former President Donald Trump announced plans to scale back two national monuments in Utah, there was outcry from a lot of people. One company in particular. The Pentagon really is a resistance brand. They embraced the liberal resistance against President Donald Trump and really put themselves at the forefront of that movement. In 2017, it sued the Trump administration for sort of slashing the size of these two national monuments in Utah that were kind of mechas for climbers. It's said at the time joining the legal fracas was both extraordinary and obvious. The company's general counsel said it took exactly one email to the board to decide to actually do that. I send the case is still out. Well, I think the only thing this administration understands is lawsuits. We're losing this planet. We have an evil government and I'm not going to stand back and just let evil win. This year it got even more active, it changed its mission statement to quote, Patagonia isn't business to save our home planet and then it manufactured these little tags on some of its clothes that if you flip them up, it says both the assholes out. Very implicit running up to the election and it launched a digital tool to help people find the polling place and on that digital platform, it says both the climate deniers out of office again and again on the loop. This isn't the first time that taking a stand has paid off the Patagonia. The business which is now worth over a billion dollars was built on it. I couldn't care less about making more money, but by doing the right thing it always ends up making me more money. So it's this all a strategy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4409,2022-10-19 01:46:00
16064," By doing the right thing, it always ends up making me more money. So is this all a strategy, a sort of premeditated strategy? Who knows? I mean, Sean Arts has been very vocal from the start and makes no bones about. He calls himself a dirt bag climber and an accidental entrepreneur. So I don't think he's fudging this, but what's important is that it's sort of a textbook marriage of philanthropy and profit. If you want to understand the entrepreneur's study that juvenile delinquent, because you know, they're saying, you know, this sucks. And I'm gonna do it my own way. Of course, like every other teenage kid, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. When I was 16 years old, I took off and drove across the country, went into the Wind River Range and discovered mountains. The Patagonia was born out of rock climate, Avantio, and Arts first business, Schuwan Art Equipment, which made and sold climbing supplies. Ivan Schuwan Art was a blacksmith in the 50s, and he started selling climbing gear out of the back of his car. That was less harmful to rock faces. This is sort of the origin story of the company. It's called itself the activist company, a activist company. Six months out of the year, Avantio Art is a blacksmith. He makes mountain climbing gear. The other half of the year he climbs. In 1968, Avantio Art and four friends, including Doug Tomkins, the late founders of the North Face brand, embarked on the ultimate road trip from California where they were based to Patagonia in Argentina. The mountains in a good mood, dazzling sun, calmer all day. If this weather holds, they could be on the summit within days. This trip became a documentary about these friends who were hippies in the 70s climbing in Yosemite where the sport became a lifestyle. And how these friends became pioneer of the outdoor industry. Schuannard moved from selling petons to polyester and in the 70s Patagonia was born. In 1973, Schuannard and his wife Melinda opened the very first Patagonia store in Ventura, California where the company's headquarters remained today. Melinda Schuannard was the driving force behind many of the employee benefits, like on-site childcare, that helped the company achieve an impressive 4% employee turnover rate. The retail and consumer product sector average is more than triple that at 13%. I do think that Patagonia was a leader, one of the first corporations to take into account, you know, the human capital and make sure that their staff, all their employees were cared for in many ways, not just wages, but also they just cared about their people and knew that that's a good business model. Patagonia began donating 10% of its profits to grassroots organizations in 1985. This later became the 1% of sales that Schuannard labels an Earth Tax. I don't think it's for land free. It's rent for us living on this planet. While Patagonia was creating the blueprint of how to be a socially conscious brand, it was also turning a profit. It even made Ink Magazine's list of the fastest growing privately held companies. So every time the company makes a decision to do something socially environmentally active, it is met with success, and that isn't lost on Schuannard or any of the other leaders of the company. The more money Patagonia made, the more it gave away under its philanthropic program. Between 1989 and 1991, the payroll grew by 40%.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4410,2022-10-19 01:50:20
16065," Money Patagonia made, but more it gave away under its philanthropic program. Between 1989 and 1991, the payroll grew by 40%. But trouble was on the horizon. I think for 1991, we are looking at a recession. The question is how deep that recession is going to be and how long will be in it. Sales fell flat and the bank called in the company's revolving loans. A company that prided itself on taking care of its own laid off 120 people, roughly 20% of its workforce. That was when we decided that we were going to start doing things differently. And we were going to start running the company as if it's going to be here 100 years. With a renewed sense of purpose, Patagonia was ready for what it called business unusual. It started with the costly move to recycle an organic materials before launching a clothing repair service to discourage fast fashion. And Patagonia's influence was growing. What was intended as Schuwenard's philosophical handbook for employees became an international blueprint for sustainable business printed in ten languages. What's interesting to me is that all this, I hate the term on brand, but it's very on brand. It really works for the kind of company he's created. It works for the kind of employees he's been able to recruit and retain. It all is very seamless in terms of the identity of him and the company and what it means in the marketplace. So over time, the company's mission and its marketing have become the same thing. The inflection point came in 2011, actually Black Friday. Patagonia took out a huge ad in the New York Times that said, don't buy this jacket. And it sort of got into the nitty-gritty on the carbon footprint and the water footprint that goes into a piece of a peril like a parke. And at the time Schuwenard said, the best jacket for our planet is one that already exists. So the company at that time said it needed to address the issue of consumerism, which coming from a for-profit business hits pretty hypercritical. As the company encouraged its customers to buy less, its annual sales increased by almost 40%. The stance of this is hypercritical is loud and constant talking about consumerism in a critical light while very much being a part of it. This fashion is top on the list of environmental destruction and not just destroying the environment but impacting human health. They are in the fashion industry, they're clothing retailer and to come head to head with that is courageous. You're not only just trying to create a product that'll last, but you're also educating and entire generational people to understand that whole ideology that you don't need to change out our outfits. In 2014, Rose Macaria was appointed as CEO. During the next six years, she grew Patagonia into a billion dollar company while also scaling up its environmental goals and bringing a more political voice to its activism. Vanna had this model where he was basically saying you can have a great business, you can make quality product, but you can also do the right thing by the environment, by your employees, by your community. That to me was like the most holistic vision of business that I'd ever seen. Right now, Patagonia has a team of about 20 people solely focused on activism and grants. This all comes at a time in the past decade when consumers are paying much more attention to the social footprint of companies and where they buy their goods. What's happened is all this is good business for Patagonia in the past 10 years, revenue and profit at the company of roughly quadruple. It's private, but estimates are it does about a billion dollars in annual sales, which is sizeable. That's part of the reason why it's been such a fortuitous cycle as it's ramped up its activism and become more vocal on these things that's resonated with the market.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4411,2022-10-19 01:54:41
16066," would recycle as it's ramped up its activism and become more vocal on these things that's resonated with the market. As the company branched out into other areas, including Adventure Capital Fund for Environmental Causes and Sustainable Food, revenue reached a new peak of over $1 billion in 2017. But this was still small change compared to fast fashion heavywaste like Nike, who made $37 billion that same year. Patagonia's conscience hasn't always been reflected in its customer base either. Personalized vests have become the go-to corporate uniform, and the expensive price tag has helped the brand earn the nickname Patigucci. It's expensive stuff, it's expensive apparel, and that is part of their calculus in terms of the activism, a lot of the more sustainable parts of this pie chain are there's a premium for organic cotton or sustainable down. The Patigucci label is a symptom of that. So Patagonia products are very popular, of course with people who are active in the outdoors, but also with people who are not as active. For instance, people in finance where the Patagonia vests go to the office. And that's because of the image that the brand projects. And so they have to leave with the fact, although they preach for the environment and want to stand for good, they're victims of their own success. Patagonia set sales records in the first three years of the Trump administration. Now in 2020 things have changed. This COVID-19 brought the business world to a halt, and the American people voted in a new administration. Patagonia appointed Brian Gellert as CEO. As far as its CEO transition goes, this one's happening quite strangely. There's no real budget for next year yet because of everything that's going on and all the uncertainty around that. Patagonia's new focus is going to be on forging a relationship with the Biden administration. It should be a more close relationship, but Gellert still has his guard up. During the Obama administration, they didn't always agree and he expects the same with Biden in the White House. They plan to bring litigation wherever needed against any government needed about the issues that they care about and that's climate change in the environment.

It is. It is. But I would say the thing we're really excited about are these new buildings because we were building sustainability into everything we do. So really forward-looking for our good. Okay. From one of the newest workspaces at the Googleplex in Mountain View, California, this is Bloomberg Studio 1.0 with Alphabet CFO, Ruth Porat. We're not far from her childhood home. Her father was a physicist at Stanford, her mother, a psychologist. After graduating from Stanford herself and then earning a couple more advanced degrees, Porat landed her first job on Wall Street in 1987, where she would spend almost three decades until Google's co-founders lured her to Silicon Valley. It's wonderful to be here with you. It's great to have you here at the Googleplex. Thank you for having us. So we are at Google headquarters in Mountain View and at this very same time you are making massive investments in New York office.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4413,2022-10-19 02:03:34
16068," to have you here at the Google Play. Thank you for having us. So we are at Google headquarters in Mountain View. And at this very same time, you are making massive investments in New York office real estate. You're expanding headcount in Atlanta and Chicago and Washington, DC. What's the strategy behind all of this? Well, at the core, we believe in hybrid work. So we do want to bring people back on campuses, but not full-time. We're thinking it'd probably be a three, two work week, but we think coming together is just such a core part of innovation, serendipity, culture, every element of it. And we're growing at a really rapid clip. So we are excited to be expanding our real estate footprint. And then we also wanted to make sure that we're meeting people where they want to be. And so enlarging the number of sites that we have available for people in particular sites where you have great, diverse populations. Soon, Dar just told me that Googlers will have this option to work in a hybrid mode forever, literally forever. Obviously, you're embracing this massive cultural shift. But what are the risks? What are you worried about? So the positive we've seen is there's a productivity uplift we believe in giving people the opportunity to be at home some of the time, not do the commute, be able to deal with everything else in their life, and coming into the office. So the risk is, I think, about my career. And so much of the benefit in my career was the informal coaching being pot-pron into meetings. And all of the touch points that you have. And so I think that one of the most important things for all of us as leaders is we need to evolve the way we lead. We need to make sure that we're thinking about this hybrid work life and why that's the way to be the best magnet for talent and make sure that we're continuing to reinforce all of those great practices while opening up new great practices. Speaking of your career, before you were CFOs, alphabet you were CFOs, Morgan Stanley, and you started your career on Wall Street in 1987. Talk to us about the journey of going from big banks to big tech. Why did you make that leap? And what impact did you want to have? Well, I love seeing it work in Stanley. And I became CFO the day James Gorman became CEO, yes. I needed to join him in that journey. And that was January 2010. And we were still recovering coming out of the financial crisis. There were still some pretty rocky days and a lot of decisions that needed to be made. And then I got to a point where I felt like we were in a great spot at Morgan Stanley. And obviously, it's continued to do really well. And I just wanted that next chapter. On my view, in my career, I've always been focused on and I've continually learning. And I feel like when you hit a plateau, the right questions, what's my highest and best use? And it's been an extraordinary time. You also survived Wall Street in the 80s and 90s, which is notorious Boys Club. And Silicon Valley has sort of come to be known as a Boys Club of its own. How would you compare those two cultures? Well, when I was starting my career many decades ago, it was tough and much worse than it is now. And it evolved. No question about it. Not where it needs to be, but certainly evolved. And I saw it through my career. I would say the biggest difference out here is the level of impatience. And I love it. As the view is, if you can do some of the extraordinary breakthroughs that we have out here, if you can do natural language translation, everything we do with AI, with VR, with self-driving cars, why can't you fix this now? And that level of impatience, I think, is fantastic. Legend has it that when you got to Google, you were going to rain in the spending, tighten up on the moon shots. Your nickname, I believe, was Ruth Vader. Was that a tough job to take on? So I think the narrative was written before I got here. And what I find most interesting about that is I firmly believe the single most important thing in capital allocation is investing for long-term growth. I think if you don't, you are sowing the seeds of your long-term decline. And I learned that really early on in my career. Now, if you're investing in an industry like this and trying to do truly transformative things, by definition, everything can't succeed. And so by definition, you should have the metrics and data and milestones to assess, is it working or is it not? Because if everything's working, or if you think everything's working, I would say.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4414,2022-10-19 02:08:02
16069," By definition, you should have the metrics and data and milestones to assess, is it working or is it not? Because if everything's working or if you think everything's working, I would say one or two things are wrong. Either you're not reaching high enough or you're not being honest enough with yourself about the pace of breakthrough, whether you're going to get there. So to me, a really natural part, you know, kind of a sister organization to investing for long-term growth, is actually thinking about how are you doing with the risks that you're taking, stack rack them, and figure out what's at the bottom so you can redeploy those resources to the top. They go together, actually. And so I find the narrative, it's a false choice to think that it's either about growth or it's about pruning stack ranking. They go together and you have to think of them as actually empowering one another. You advised the Treasury Department during the Great Recession, what lessons did you take away from that? What struck me is a lot of the lessons from the financial crisis are relevant in good times and bad times. So the most important is it's easier to prevent than to fix. And so, you know, that was really clear during the financial crisis. The financial crisis was about liquidity and it dried up quickly and it would have been really easy six to 12 months prior to build in durable liquidity. You couldn't do it in the moment. And so this notion about really building a solid foundation on which you operate, you need to do that ahead of time. It needs to be all of the work we do on trust and safety and content, moderation, security. That is the foundation on which you can build everything else. The Hangpunson at one point said to me, you have to have the will and the means. And too often by the time you have the will, you no longer have the means. His comment was, be decisive, act early, even in the absence of information. I think that's true in this whole notion of investing for long-term growth. Because if you're not actually assessing progress along the way and you just assume, you know what, we can keep investing in everything. At some point down the road, you'll say, I wish I had made those tough calls to double down on the things that really matter. What times are we in now? What's your read on the economy today, especially with rising inflation? Well, I think back to March of 2020 and where we were. And I think of all of the intervention and steps that have been taken since then. And you've certainly seen the recovery coming out the back end. And it's been really gratifying from those painful days to see the breakthroughs that we've had not just on the medical front, but we've also seen the improvement across businesses. I think one of the biggest concerns in particular, as you're seeing us, go through a digital transformation and the acceleration of it is ensuring that everyone has the skills, the digital training and skills to thrive in this new economy. Google now reaches more than half the people on the planet. Why shouldn't we view Google as a monopoly? We often say that people come to Google not because they have to, but because they want to. It's really opening the world for so many people, so that's the intent.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4415,2022-10-19 02:12:06
16070," I want to talk a little bit about regulation. You were drawn to M&A in your early days at Morgan Stanley. Microsoft is making some big acquisitions, deals that some think Google maybe would have wanted to win in a former life. Is antitrust scrutiny constraining any of your business plans and your ability to compete? So the main thing that we've done throughout our life of Google is really invest in innovation, its organic growth, and we're continuing to do that at a really rapid clip. We have then layered onto it, tuck in acquisitions and larger acquisitions and we're continuing to be active. More on the smaller ones and the add-ons to be fair. But we think there's a lot of opportunity still ahead of us and so we're continuing to invest in partnerships and in some acquisitions and do think that there's still upside in a lot of different areas. So would you say this regulatory scrutiny isn't slowing you down? It's really important for those of us in certain leadership positions to be very focused on constructively engaging and working with regulators on what are the issues, what is it they're trying to solve and how can we constructively engage with them. At the same time our engineers should focus on innovation and continuing to kind of up the bar on everything we're doing, address what is most helpful for our users. Google is facing more serious legal threats at this time in the United States than the other big tech companies. How are those conversations with regulators going? Are they frustrating at this point? Well there's certain elements that are frustrating because I listen to the outline of some of the proposed legislation and I think it's inconsistent with some of the priorities for public policy. So as an example there are a lot of focus on what is called self-preferencing or you're putting too many of your own products together. But during the pandemic one in three small businesses said they would have failed without digital skills. Why? Because what they were able to do is connect with their users in different ways. So if you go search for a small business you can then go to a map and you can get directed to the small business. That's a good thing. We have 6,000 small businesses who wrote in and said you know what we need these digital tools and skills. Same with a number of things on racial equity. Real surge in searches about where can I, where's a black owned business near me and the ability to direct people through search and maps. So I think that what's really important and that's why I said it's about constructive engagement. So make sure we understand what they're trying to solve and work with them on what is it that we're trying to address through products so that the products are helpful in the ways that they want. Facebook has taken a serious reputational hit. Has that had ripple effects or created collateral damage for Google? I think that whenever there's a backdrop that's challenging it has ripple effects. But what we're really underscoring is all of the steps and investments that we are making to really protect the ecosystem the way we are commitment to our users. So we know how sacrosanct that trust is and it's all about privacy and what are the steps that we're taking to make privacy protected for our users. What is it that we're looking at to protect content and content moderations. Google now reaches more than half the people on the planet. Why shouldn't we view Google as a monopoly? So I go back to the earliest days when Google, I first learned about Google back in 1998 and in those earliest days when I heard about this like eighth search engine the question is why do you actually need it? And back at Morgan Stanley it's working with our research analyst Mary Meekers. She actually had her team put up white pages all around the conference room and was doing this comparison. Well provided the most responsive results most rapidly and all of a sudden you could see the wind with this Google thing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4416,2022-10-19 02:16:17
16071," was doing this comparison. Well, provided the most responsive results most rapidly. And all of a sudden, you could see, well, when did this Google thing actually, maybe we do need something new. And that's been the ethos at Google since inception. It's just continued to innovate to make this 8-net, ever better experience for users. And so if we can deliver on that, which is what drives people here, it's really opening the world for so many people. So that's the intent. Facebook and Twitter are exploring digital currency. What is your thought on the crypto market? And is there a play for Google? So we look at it. There's nothing to comment on now. I think we're much more interested in blockchain and the underlying technology and the implications for the business and also for the way we can support our cloud customers. So certainly a lot of effort there. There's considerable chatter in the crypto universe that Web3 and the blockchain could circumvent the power of Facebook and Google and more. What do you think about the next frontier of the internet? At this point, I think there are a lot of different things ahead of us that are actually studyingly exciting that enable us to actually continue to address different needs and requirements. I look at, for example, in something like health, where I think blockchain will be very valuable when you think about health and health records. There are also a whole host of other areas where the data analytics that we provide are absolutely critical. Should we make excuses to our employers? Should we tell our, like, if I have to head to a parent to teach your conference or take a kid to the doctor, do I tell my boss that I want to hear? You don't tell your boss. You've got to get over the guilt. F You survived breast cancer twice. What was your biggest fear at that time and how did you overcome it? Well, the biggest fear was I wouldn't make it. I remember when someone at some interview while I was going through chemo said, where do you want to be in five years? I froze because it was I want to be alive. I learned a couple of really important things. One, given breakthroughs in medical technology, I learned to love the word manageable. This journey does become manageable. Not for all cancers, but for many more cancers. And that gave me a lot of confidence talking with other survivors about it is manageable, get the best care. And just plow through it. I was just very grateful. I'm grateful for all of the investments people have made over the years, but for anybody out there and I think everybody sadly will be touched by cancer either themselves or someone they know and love. Many of these cancers are manageable and just go at it with gusto.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4417,2022-10-19 02:21:29
16072," up there and I think everybody sadly will be touched by cancer either themselves or someone they know and love. Many of these cancers are manageable and just go at it with gusto. So that's what I did. You're a mom of three sons and I find that especially remarkable because I also have three sons. How have you managed that over the course of this incredible career? How do you find that right mix of focus and free time to spend time with your family and doing the things that you love? Oh my kids give me energy. They're remarkable. And I think one of the important things for me is this notion that you do have to have a mix. It's not about trying to find balance, the physics of which is really challenging. I think when people try for balance they always feel they're failing on something because something's out of whack. So this metaphor that life is like a kaleidoscope and you need to have different shaped pieces of glass and different color and sometimes one is larger than the other and what's beautiful about life is when it's constantly moving around. And so to me that metaphor has actually been sort of an anchoring principle. The other is you have to put the kids first. So like they know that I'm there when they need always. And I think that just making sure that you're setting the boundaries the way you need to, I would say it's much easier today than when I was growing up in banking. We had a cubicle. There was a computer room. You were anchored to the computer room. One of the many beautiful things about going through this evolution in work is understanding that hybrid works. So how do we get rid of mom guilt? Especially in this new work world. I want to shake my mom guilt. How do I do that? So even when you feel it, just say you know what, it's an investment in my career because I can stay in this longer and be operating at a higher level if I'm really getting the stimulus from all parts of my life. So you've got to drop the mom guilt and when on the other side mom guilt with kids, I think they get it. I think they understand what we're doing. And you know, they'll never forget during the financial crisis at one point I was working on AIG. And around the clock I came home to shower that one like right as we were landing AIG and my three kids had each written me a yellow sticky note with a message on it. And one of them was based, you know, the essence of which was I get why you're doing this. And they saw it as the right thing for the country. I don't need to over dramatize what it was, but that's what it felt like at the time. And that level of pride, I still have those three stickies right by my bedside. Because I get it, I get the mom guilt. I wish there were certain elements I could have done differently. But I also see the relationship we have and they understand what it means to actually be engaged in society and doing something you care about. No mom guilt. No mom guilt. Thank you. It's not allowed. Thank you. Should we make excuses to our employers? Should we tell our, like, if I have to head to a parent teacher conference or take a kid to the doctor, do I tell my boss that I'm wrong? You don't tell your boss. You don't tell your boss. Guys don't tell their boss. So what do we say? I don't think you say anything. I actually made this point at an event at Morgan Stanley. I'm like, do not tell your boss. You've got to get over the guilt. The only way to move on from it is realize I'm a professional. I do things when I, when I can and it makes sense and I get it all done. I just do it on my own timeline. And I actually had a woman who emailed to me afterwards and said, I know you said I'm not supposed to tell my boss. So I won't, but I can't not tell somebody. So I'm going to email you. And I'm like, okay, that's step one. If I'm five step journey, do not tell your boss. You're tell your boss, you know what? I need to do certain things for myself and I'm getting, I feel guilty doing it, but I get everything done. There's no question you are so beyond having to check in with people. Well, thank you. So do not. We're in the middle of this so-called great resignation. And people are reflecting and changing and making big decisions. It's your advice to people in this big evolution, you know, huge choices ahead. Well, I think you framed it really well. I don't think it's the great resignation. I think it's the great reshuffle and people are reflecting on what do they want and how do they want to work and how do they want to live their lives. So I think for all-.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4418,2022-10-19 02:25:21
16073," Well, I think you framed it really well. I don't think it's the great resignation. I think it's the great reshuffle. And people are reflecting on what do they want, and how do they want to work, and how do they want to live their lives. So I think for all of us thinking about what does that mean for our institutions, it is about evolving the way we work, the way we interact, the expectations that we have to say, but I grew up in a cubicle on the 26th floor of a skyrise. It doesn't work anymore. And so what should we do as leaders? And I think that this generation appropriately, and it's very exciting, expects more from all of us. And so it's not just in how we work, but it is in what we do. And I think all elements of what's the mission, are you delivering on the mission? Is really important. OK, so if you rapid fire questions, someone you'd love to have dinner with? Well, I'd love to say my parents, because they passed away in over years ago. Favorite family ritual? We do this crazy thing that we've done for years, which is everybody gets to pick where we travel. We come up with the five different locations, and then we all vote, and then we get the grid. And that's where we go. What's your favorite getaway? Probably, I would say maybe Iceland was the vast. That's an amazing one. New Yorker, California. Ooh, so unfair. Well, sitting here outdoors right now, and knowing I can do that for the rest of the years, I'm pretty nice with the energy from New York, so I'm not going to, it's like, I don't pick amongst children. So, in closing, Google is a massive company, multiple divisions, many bets. Where are you spending most of your time now? I'm spending most of my time on your very important question about capital allocation, because if it really goes to this core point, you've got to invest for long-term growth, and making sure that you're investing with the right intensity, I often say, I don't want to get to the two-yard line but not score. So you need to make sure you're investing with the right intensity to support long-term growth. That's the most important area where I would say, I spend the bulk of my time. And then, of course, you have to prioritize in order to recycle to support those efforts. What kind of discussions are you having with Larry and Sergey now about this next phase of Google? So when they made the announcement about the role of change, they were very serious about moving to this board role, and they're amazing board members. Sundar, of course, relies on them for council wherever, whenever, but most of the interaction is really around what are we doing at the board level? It's been great. And you have your freedom to allocate capital as you like. I work closely with Sundar and Phillip and Thomas. Yes, we work as a great team. So what's the vision for Google then? 10 years from now. It's fascinating. I think I have the same reaction you do when I heard Sundar say search is the biggest moonshot. And I think that continuing to find ways to be helpful to users, to solve what they need where so many people are coming online and is video going to be the way they understand it's going to be about search is going to be a different type of experience. So much of it's going to be about voice first and language translation. So it's going to continue to evolve. And what about for you personally? Where will you? It's been so amazing to hear about your journey. And I'm just curious about your personal growth. What you feel you've accomplished in the last, since you've been here and what you hope to accomplish. I find that the opportunity to try new things and to invest in new things. And as we think about, well, what does that mean for each one of our areas? I think that intellectual curiosity keeps you young. And I think that continuing to learn is like your brain is like silly putty getting pulled in a lot of directions. So to me, it's continuous learning. Ritpoort, thank you so much for joining us. It's been wonderful for me here. Thank you. You're great to have you on campus. Come back anytime. Thank you. You",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4419,2022-10-19 02:29:50
16074,"cing Thank you so much for doing this. Well thanks for doing it. Of course. So, sorry I'm late and I'm coming late. Not at all. We're doing well. Yes. How often are you coming into the office these days? About two to three days a week. How about you, I guess you come in. Yeah, I'm in every day now. So, no more kids on the set. I have to ask, is your son still mining Ethereum? He and I literally were talking about it last night. He's like, Dad, you're the one who made me give up on it. I'm like, no, no, I didn't. But, yeah, the thing that's good about this is, I think, it excites a whole new generation about technology, which is really interesting. new generation about technology, which is good. I really appreciate you taking this time. Well, thank you for doing it, and thank you for coming down to do it. I'm ready to go when you guys are. From Google headquarters in Mountain View, California, this is Bloomberg Studio 1.0 with Alphabet CEO Sundar Pachai. Born and raised in India, Pachai had almost no access to a computer until college, but just years later found himself rising through the ranks of the world's largest search engine. In 2015, it was Pachai that Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin chose to run Google and later Alphabet. Now valued at more than $2 trillion, it's one of the most powerful companies on the planet. Sundar, it's great to be with you today. Thanks for doing this. Great to be here in person. Google just hit a $2 trillion market cap. Alphabet, I should say. Where is the next trillion dollars going to come from? You know, I've always felt your market cap valuation is an effect of the value you provide. And I feel fortunate our mission is timeless. There is more need to organize information than ever before. I still feel searches are biggest moonshot as a company. You know, people will want radically more conversational experiences. They will want what we call multimodal experiences. They may speak to search. They may look at something and ask what the information is. Being able to adapt to all that and evolve search will continue to be the biggest opportunity. We are so excited about the YouTube, Cloud, or hardware products, Google Play. So we're building a diverse set of businesses. But underlying all of the investments we are making in AI, we've invested $100 billion in R&D in the past five years. And so applying AI in a deep way is probably where we will create the biggest opportunity ahead. Microsoft is making some big acquisitions. Apple's anti-adtracking technology is shaking up the industry. What do you make of these competitive moves? Your competitors say they're on the right side of history. Are they? I look at the fact that there are three billion people who have access to knowledge of their fingertips. I look at the opportunity we provide. I look at the skills people are learning through YouTube.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4420,2022-10-19 02:34:29
16075," There are three billion people who have access to knowledge of their fingertips. I look at the opportunity we provide. I look at the skills people are learning through YouTube. You know, I feel that everywhere when I go talk to people and and providing access to information and knowledge, I think we'll end up being on the right side of history as well. Your predecessor, Eric Schmidt, told me that he feels the latest Facebook revelations are disturbing. Google also has access to massive amounts of our data. Why should half the world's population, more than half the world's population, trust Google to do the right thing? We are trying to do more with less data. One of the biggest changes we made was making auto-delete the default setting for new users signing in and now over two billion users have the data continuously being deleted. Look, we rely on trust for people, you know, every day when people come to Google, you know, they place their trust to us in vulnerable moments. Maybe a healthy shoe on which they are trying to understand. You know, there's no more important responsibility we have than doing right by that trust. You know, when we provide Gmail to journalists and realize that that accounts may be under attack by an authoritarian government, I mean, that's what motivates us to make sure be privacy, be it security, be trust, we are doing the right thing. Over time, regulation will have an important role to play here. I think privacy regulation is important in areas like AI regulation will be important. And so I think, you know, those will be part of the answers as well. The Facebook fallout, that Instagram can be toxic to teens, for example, has this raised more or new concerns for you about the impact of technology, tech addiction, algorithms, YouTube even on our children and their development and their mental health. I mean, you're a parent and you also have a lot of power over how this plays out. You know, I mean, like you, you know, bringing kids up in this modern digital world is something, I think all parents are anxious about rightfully so. I think, you know, it's part of why a few years ago when in YouTube, you know, we were exposed to a set of concerns, you know, we invested, it became our number one priority to work harder. The reason YouTube invested so much in developing YouTube kids as a safe destination for young children, so on. Technology is going to play a big role in helping give children the next wave of opportunity as well. So the answer is to develop it responsibly. We have changed our balance in these areas and saying, we think about content responsibility first and then the pace of development or new features in areas like YouTube. And so that's how we approach it for a while. Facebook and Microsoft are all in on the metaverse. What do you think about the metaverse? What's Google's metaverse strategy? It's always been obvious to me that computing over time will adapt to people and people adapting to computers. You know, you won't always interact with computing in a black rectangle in front of you. So just like you speak to people, you see and interact. Computers will become more immersive. They'll be there when you need it to be. So it's always been excited about the future of immersive computing and being computing AR. And we are in that count as the metaverse. Is that what that is? You know, metaverse is I think it means different things to different people. The way I think about it is evolving computing in an immersive way with augmented reality. As part of that, there'll be many experiences. Some of which will be immersive, interactive virtual worlds, which is the metaverse concept. But I think this doesn't belong to any company. This is the evolution of internet and the web, the internet, all of it will continue to evolve. Google was famous for its campuses where you could go and never leave. You had everything you ever wanted. Now you've said they can be flexible. They can work from home. They can work at the office. They can be hybrid. They can work remotely permanently, perhaps. Are you committed to really letting them do this forever? And if so, how does that change the future of work and society? Look, we have really embraced the fact that the future is going to be flexible.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4421,2022-10-19 02:38:10
16076," So how does that change the future of work and society? Look, we have really embraced the fact that the future is going to be flexible. At Google, we've always tried to give agency to our employees. But we do realize the importance of bringing people together the creativity, community, and collaboration that comes with it. So the balance we are striking is this notion of 3.2. And what we are giving the strength of our companies, we have more locations than most of the companies. So we're giving people a choice to move anywhere in the world. Four weeks they can work from anywhere. We're going to accommodate 20% of our workforce to be remote over time. So we're going to embrace that flexibility. Forever? Forever. Yeah. And we're committed to it. Through it to all, it forces us to design better products. And since people use Google Workspace to run their companies, I think gives us a chance to innovate and bring all that out. I think there is so much value in giving people more flexibility between their personal and professional lives. And I think it will lead to people being happier. And I think companies can be successful in that model. And so we are trying to get the best of both worlds, but embrace the flexibility and see where we go. How confident are you that when you look back, you'll be able to say Google did enough to help save the world? We are putting so much energy and resources into it. You grew up in India. You lived through droughts. Water was scarce. How has that experience shaped your feelings about the urgency of stopping climate change? You know, I grew up in Chennai, India. And a big part of my childhood was really pretty severe water scarcity. We would get water trapped in for the streets and stand in lines and carry a few buckets of water at home. There was no running water for many years. And but fast forward a few years ago, Chennai had one in a hundred-year flood, which was a very extreme event. Kind of drove home. That combined with a few years ago waking up to the orange skies here in the Bay Area, seeing the look of concern on my children's faces and having to explain it, all kind of drove home in a deeply personal way for me. So I think it's the most defining issue we all face. And definitely something very motivated on working towards. I remember waking up to those orange skies, too, and having to have that same conversation with my kids. Do you think the commitments at COP26 went far enough? Encourage by many things, we have to tip our hat to the people who are working soon.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4422,2022-10-19 02:42:29
16077," that COP26 went far enough. You know, encouraged by many things, you know, we have to tip our hat to the people who are working super hard. The issues and the tradeoffs are genuinely difficult, you know, you have to keep the economies growing, you know, it really matters. And but at the same time, it's a pretty severe urgent issue. So I'm encouraged by the progress, I think it builds on the Paris agreement so I can see the forward progress. There is a deep anxiety that it all may not be enough, but you know, we have to be optimistic and keep pushing. Google has set some aggressive targets to run entirely on clean energy to be the first tech giant to do so 24 hours a day. How confident are you that when you look back on this time, let's say a decade from now, you'll be able to say Google did enough to help save the world. We are putting so much energy and resource into it. It's always been kind of a founding value for us. We've been carbon neutral since 2007. We've been matching our energy consumption with renewable energy over the past few years. So this, you know, we are now pushing its moonshot to be 24, 7 carbon free. That means every search you do, every email you send that we can do it carbon free. We were at 61% in 2019. The number is now 67%. We have set our goals to be 100% by 2030 and to do it globally. That means we have to solve the new things which we haven't done before. Wind and solar alone won't be enough. We just started geothermal and Nevada. We will be investing in newer technologies, including carbon capture, etc. over time. So that's what excites me. We are a technology company at heart. So, part of that are many answers to this problem. Some of it is that we are going to have to innovate our way out of it. And, you know, we want to push as hard as possible in doing that. Our Bloomberg New Economy Forum is happening this year in Singapore. And the Asia Pacific region is one of the fastest growing Internet economies on the planet. Where do you see the most room, the most opportunity for Google to grow there? You know, it's such a fitting timeframe. You know, glad you're focused on the region. It's the most vibrant region we see. It's our 20th year since we opened our office in Tokyo. It was the first office outside the Bay Area. You have two and a half billion people on the Internet. There are many areas in which they are leapfrogging trends which are here and embracing the future digital payments is a great example. So, many of our products originated from APAC, Google Maps, Google Pay. A lot of our journey to bring computing to more people is playing out in Asia as well. I am excited about also the work we are doing through cloud. Because the companies there are rapidly transforming themselves digitally. So, a chance to provide that is something very exciting for us. So, super dynamic region. I feel like we are learning as Google, being in the region. And so, I think it will transform the first 10 years I would have said we took products here and brought it to APAC. Over the past few years, we are beginning to build things there. And some of our future global products will be APAC first and rest of the world later. You can't talk about APAC without talking about China. And you're facing stiff competition from Chinese tech giants there and beyond. What should US policymakers know about competing with China? You know, there's a lot of conversations about you. A lot of conversations about US and China, the competition is fierce. When you look at areas like AI and quantum computing where we are investing a lot. You know, Chinese companies are neck to neck. What I think about, you know, was encouraged by the news coming out of Glasgow, about the US China Agreement on Climate. To me, while we talk about all the areas where we are competing, some of the biggest areas which are common challenges for all of humanity. The pandemic was one. AI and AI safety over time will be a shared one. Obviously sustainability is another area like that. So I think these are all areas in which the countries can come together. And so I think that's a way by which we think about.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4423,2022-10-19 02:46:55
16078," one, obviously sustainability is another area like that. So I think these are all areas in which the countries can come together and so I think that's a way by which we think about as, you know, when we compete on the internet and there may be different visions of how the internet plays out. So I see opportunities both sides. What are the chances that Google search will ever come back to China? Or that Google Cloud would ever come to China? You know, today we don't provide most of our signed-in services in China and I don't see that changing. But you know, there are ways, as I said, in areas like AI or sustainability, I think there'll be opportunities for us to work together. Through Cloud, we will support multinational companies which have presents everywhere and so maybe there are opportunities to work that way as well. AI is advancing at an astonishing rate and it is hard to understand sometimes what this really means. In concrete terms, how will our lives look different? Let's say 10 years from now as a result of AI. You know, done correctly, you know, in many ways it's going to be helpful to you. You'll take it for granted. The same way today, for example, in India, over one third of the queries on many phones come through voice. That is something people take for granted. You can do it. So over time, you'll expect to speak and be able to understand any language in the world. And, you know, those are all ways it's going to make it better. You may go to a doctor's office and go through a scan and the system may be prioritizing for the radiologist so that they don't miss some important things, maybe giving them a second opinion. So these are all ways in which it will seamlessly start playing a role and I think we'll see that. You mentioned if done correctly. And there are concerns. There are fears that AI will replicate the worst of society, even under Google's own roof, from your own researchers. What scares you most about AI? What keeps you up at night? It's the most profound thing we are working on as humanity. And, anytime you're developing technology, there is a dual site to it. The journey of humanity is harnessing the benefits while minimizing the downsides. The good thing with AI is it's both going to take time. I think I've seen more focus on the downsides early on than most of the technology we've developed. So in some ways, I'm encouraged by how much concern there is. And you're right, even within Google, you know, people think about it deeply. We publish a lot of research. There are, I think it's more important that there are outside academic institution, governments, nonprofits looking at this issue as well. So I think it'll be an issue which will have a lot of attention, which gives me a lot of comfort as well. You said you'd pick up some new hobbies in the pandemic. What did you start? Cooking pizza. Just learning cook, which I was never good at. I'm caught on a little bit better.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4424,2022-10-19 02:51:08
16079," You have presided over Google through massive social movements that reverberated in and outside the company. What have you learned as CEO since the walkout? For me, it was a moment. I think it changed the company for the better. We've always been committed. It gave us an insight on what more we could do. We undertook deep commitments. And the biggest overall and diversity and inclusion, I think if you're committed and you actually put in the effort behind it, you can make a difference. Now we have stated clear goals. We are on track to meet those goals. But it forced us to think about new answers. For example, tech companies used to talk about the pipeline problem. But we are now going to places where the talent is. We are working much harder. Going to Atlanta, going to DC, going to Chicago, going to New York. That's improving our diversity and representation at all levels. The war for talent is even more competitive now in this new world. What are you offering? Elon Musk has said, big tech is a place where talent goes to die. How do you respond to that? I look at the fact that, you know, we are looking to hire 30,000 people next year. I look at the impact we have on many people coming and working in the latest cutting edge things. Many people come in, people leave Google. We are proud of people who have left Google. There are, I think there are over 2000 companies that have been started by whom we call as Zooklers. I'm equally proud of that. Right. I think we are one part of a big, big system. And, you know, I think I think I'm proud of the role we play in bringing in people. And that's what I am proud of. That's just a wrap. That's the lot you have said. Alright, that's most of the heavy stuff out of the way. I'm going to do some rapid fire to get to know you a bit better. You said you'd pick up some new hobbies in the pandemic. How do you get the pizza? Cooking pizza. Just learning to cook. I was never good at. Squid Game or Ted Lasso? I watched both. The Ted Lasso is much more common. And so I'd rather take Ted Lasso over Squid Game someday. I know you're a voracious reader. So what's the last good book that you read? You know, I've been on a podcast bench. So a lot more podcasts than books nowadays. Okay. Favorite videos you watch on YouTube with your kids? A lot of music videos, music videos. This whole notion where creators are watching other things and commenting on it. It's a trend which my kids are really into. And I've kind of gotten used to it now. So, you know, watching other games, it's a phenomenon. Screen time policy that's worked for you as a parent. And what's not worked? You know, I've kind of given agency to my kids. The only thing I tell them is that I can look at their digital well-being once in a while with them. And so... How do you do that? I asked them to show it to me and they show it on their phones. So, you know, so that's pretty much the only thing. So beyond that, you know, it's agency and, you know, talking to them about it. And making sure we are spending time doing other things. And making sure they develop good habits, basically. That's right. Metaverse or real world? Done correctly. You know, you shouldn't feel the need to make a choice. You know, you always want to be present in the real world. And when you feel the need to do something, you want to do that. But, you know, I do think presence and the realness of the real world will end up mapping for humans for a long time. Do you own any crypto? I wish I did. I've dabbled in it, but, you know, in and out. In and out. Okay. Larry and Sergey, I'm not going to make you choose. How many times a week do you talk to them?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4425,2022-10-19 02:56:13
16080," I did, I dabbled in it, but you know, you know, out. In and out, okay. Um, Larry and Sergey, I'm not going to make you choose. Uh, how many times a week do you talk to them? Uh, you know, I, I talk to them regularly. Uh, you know, uh, it kind of ebbs and flows. Uh, you know, and so there are times we get excited about something and we spend a lot of time talking it through, but it depends on, uh, you know, what I mean. A piece of advice you wish you had in your 20s and a piece of advice you wish you had in your 40s. Uh, 20s would be, you know, being patient. Um, you know, I think when you're young, you're very impatient, which is a great thing, but sometimes you do amazing things by slowing down and being really focused and doing it over a period of time. And so I would advise the young, you know, the younger version of me to be more patient. Maybe at 40, I would say, you know, when I look at climate, you know, I want, want all of us to be impatient. So, you know, I feel like when there's an urgency towards something and putting the world needs to be impatient. So that's the advice I would give to a older version of me. How much do you personally wrestle with the decisions that you have to make? And how much longer do you see yourself being the CEO of alphabet, not just alphabet, but also Google? Yeah. Uh, on the, on the first one, there are moments we all have to make tough decisions and, you know, in some decisions way on me. Uh, and, but I, it's a privilege to do it. I have very good people helping me think, think things through. So I think the combination makes it all, you know, fine. Well, on the second thing, I am, look, I'm so energized by the things we need to do. You know, I, I didn't have much access to computing growing up. It changed my life a lot. The one laptop or child goal really motivated me to come into technology and, and when I look at last week, us launching a affordable smartphone in India, the chance to bring the next billion users in Asia and in Africa online, that gives me a lot of energy. All right. Well, we'll be watching from afar. Sundar Patai. Thank you so much for joining us. It's wonderful to be here. Thanks, and a pleasure to be here. Welcome to daybreak Australia.

16081," ==== accusation ==== Jeff Bezos shocked the world when he stepped down a CEO of Amazon. Less shocking was his choice for successor. Annie Jassy was not only one of his longest tenured lieutenants, but the architect of Amazon's multi-billion-dollar cloud business, Amazon Web Services, a moonshot that helped transform Amazon into not just e-commerce, but enterprise juggernaut. Jassy then needed to find his own successor, tapping a former colleague who helped grow AWS in its earliest days, but had since left to run Seattle software giant Tableau. His job to continue the reinvention of AWS and in turn, Amazon. Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, new AWS CEO, Adam Salipski. You worked for AWS for 11 years and then went on to become CEO of Tableau Software in 2016. Then you get a call from Amazon to come back and run AWS as CEO. Tell me about that call. Well, I was having a one-on-one at my prior company and my Apple news alerts went off like everybody else's did. It's at Jeff Bezos, who's taking on a new role and Andy Jassy's taking on the CEO role of Amazon. Of course, Andy and I worked shoulder to shoulder about 20 feet apart.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4427,2022-10-19 03:04:15
16082," This is taking on a new role and Andy Jassy is taking on the CEO role of Amazon. And of course Andy and I worked shoulder to shoulder about 20 feet apart for 11 years. So of course I reached out and congratulated him and we started talking. And you know the conversation turned to some of the possibilities and next thing I know a little while later. Here I am back at Amazon, absolutely delighted and honored to be the CEO of AWS and helping to shepherd this amazing business for our customers. In that process did you talk to Jeff as well? I had some communication but it was you know principle with Andy who of course was knew the AWS business best and of course was taking on the CEO role but yeah there was contact as you might expect with a small handful of other people. So what did Andy tell you he wanted in the next chapter for AWS? Andy reminded me nothing I needed reminding but that it has really still day one for AWS and for our customers it is still so early in this business and we shouldn't think that just because the business has grown rapidly or just because we're currently the leader in the cloud that it's anything close to mature and so he really reminded me that we have to stay hungry, innovate as quickly as we ever have done in the past. You're about half a year into the job. What changed while you were gone that surprised you? I think that so many more customers have really adopted the cloud and really decided that they're going all in. So I mean it was a pretty decent sized business when I left but it's really grown and the customer base is really expanded and so now we have very deep relationships at the CEO level, the CIO level across every country, every industry, every use case and we're regularly interacting with the most senior people at our client organizations. So you were working at real networks in the early 2000s and I understand you were offered a job at AWS without even really knowing what it was. I guess AWS was in stealth mode. Well it was very secret. So it was hard that the company didn't want to talk too much about it but of course we had to talk a certain amount about it. So the call I got went something like we have this initiative to turn the guts of Amazon inside out and expose it to other people. And it sounded intriguing though I confessed I didn't fully understand what that was all about. So I came in and started talking to Andy and a few of the other senior leaders and eventually to Jeff and I would have to say that even by the time I took the job I thought I mostly understand what they're talking about and it sounds like a good idea and I'm in but I also was like well we'll just have to see how it goes and Amazon is a big place. And so I think we got a lot of intent to succeed here and that's the thing that impressed me was Amazon really had the desire and the intent and the belief that this could be a really good business. AWS comes out of stealth mode and is the first to market with a cloud infrastructure service in 2006. How important was that first start and do you think AWS still has an advantage today because of that? I think the time to market advantage that we had which was probably honestly five to seven years had start before other companies really started to take this seriously was an enormous frankly it was just one of the biggest things that happened to us in the early years because at the beginning a lot of people didn't get it I would get asked a lot in 2006. So what does this have to do with selling books? And I didn't have to slide with kind of a pile of books on it and a question mark next to it and the answer was it has nothing to do with selling books but the technology which enables us to sell books being global being at a massive scale being secure being low cost being highly perform it all that technology has everything to do with offering these types of services externally. Now AWS isn't a scrappy startup anymore and you do have big rivals even though AWS is still the leader Microsoft and Google are big rivals. How do you make sure that being big doesn't slow you down? It's a great question because we are currently the leader and I mean depending on which third part of you you look at we're probably a little bit more than twice as big as number two and it's really.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4428,2022-10-19 03:08:33
16083," And depending on which third party you look at, we're probably a little bit more than twice as big as number two. And it's really important to continue to act as if we're insurgents and to be insurgents and not to start to act like incumbents. And I like to talk about actually managing the business. We want our senior leaders to be managing product and managing customers. And I think as you get bigger and you put more and more layers into your company, it's all too frequent that you start managing math. You start managing ratios and percentages and growth. And I think it's a real disease if you stray away from really focusing at a deep way on the product you're building and at a deep way on what your customers are telling you. And so we try and organize both with our org structure as well as just with our culture and what we choose to focus on on really making sure that everybody is thinking about one or both of those two things, product and customers. And if you keep even the most senior leaders engaged at that level, then all of a sudden you maintain the urgency and you keep acting like an insurgent. We got to feel that urgency every day. So keep acting like an insurgent. That's the motto. Absolutely. And structure yourself and build a culture that allows you to. It's one thing to say it, but it's easy to say it, but it's much harder to put in place enabling mechanisms that enable you to do so. And we focus a lot of effort on those mechanisms. Now, do you think the cloud keeps getting bigger and that AWS and Microsoft and Google just get bigger pieces of an ever-expanding pie? Or at some point, does it become a zero-sum game? And that fight for market share becomes more brutal and more bloody? Well, I mean, this is a very large market segment. If you look at global IT spend, it's in the trillions of dollars I've seen estimates like $3 trillion. It doesn't really matter how many trillions it is. It's very, very large. And we've always believed that this was too good a market segment opportunity for the really to only be one winner. And sure enough, you've seen robust competition emerge and we all compete vigorously, but it is. The segment is just growing so rapidly that I think really for us, we believe that the winning business strategy for a long time to come and I would maintain forever is to focus not on the competitors, but to focus maniacally on customers and wake up every day understanding exactly what it is that they need us to build next and then work backwards from there, back internally to how can we build those things. And if we do the best job at building the most quickly, the things that are most important for our customers, then I'm really not worried about what the competitors will do. You've worked 10 feet away from Andy Jassy in the early days. Tell us something about the Amazon CEO that no one knows, but you. You're going to get me in trouble, aren't you? You getting mad?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4429,2022-10-19 03:13:21
16084," You worked 10 feet away from Andy Jassy in the early days. Tell us something about the Amazon CEO that no one knows but you. You're going to get me in trouble aren't you? I grew up in Seattle and Andy coming from New York has this fascination I don't understand with New York sports teams. So I've had to endure that for a lot of years. New Yorkers. So what are you going to do? I think come to adopt some of the Seattle teams, particularly the new hockey team, the Kraken here. As he should. Exactly. How do you expect Andy will be different from Jeff or how has Andy already been different from Jeff? Well, I think we're all different as leaders. I think it's all important that we all bring our own stamp to it and operate within ourselves. I don't think I would be a very good Andy. I don't want to presume but I would assume that Andy wouldn't be a great Jeff because Jeff's Jeff, Andy's Andy and I'm me. So I think that Andy was certainly bringing a great depth of experience from AWS which is one important part of the business and we'll having operated that business for so long. I expect that will also give him an opportunity although he was involved in other parts of Amazon certainly for a number of years. We'll be able to bring a fresh perspective to the whole company just as I hope to bring a AWS and I think that fresh perspective is often helpful I think just the mere act of change is useful for the business, for customers, for employees and just to shake things up a little bit. So I think just a fresh perspective. How will you be different from Andy? Well, I think that the world around us is changing so much that we're going to have to be different. It doesn't matter what we did yesterday and right after I joined we actually added two new leadership principles which is very exciting. One's around striving to be Earth's best employer and the second around focusing on the fact that success and scale bring broad responsibility. And those are things about which I personally am very passionate and so I really personally look forward to digging in and helping the company to figure out what are those things that we have to figure out where can we innovate to be Earth's best employer and then also to figure out externally what can we do to really be great citizens of our local communities, to be great citizens of our national communities and to be great citizens of the global community. And I care a lot about those things as a lot of other people do here but I plan to put a good amount of energy and time and focus and hopefully help Amazon innovate in all of those areas. How closely do you work with Andy day to day? Does he regularly weigh in on AWS decisions or not? Well, he's got a pretty broad scope of things to worry about now so he's got a pretty intense day job I believe. So he's really focused across the company as you would expect him to be but that being said obviously AWS remains an important part of Amazon and so we touch base regularly be it in person or via email just on the most important things going on in the business. Does Jeff ever weigh in on AWS decisions? Yes, I mean really from the beginning, Jeff was involved at the very, very beginning at some of the most fundamental decisions. How do you price EC2? What do you name S3? What does the detail page look like? Obviously over time we, the business grew and but this Jeff was always available when we needed him and I certainly anticipate that will be the same going forward. So is he still available now and what do you understand that Jeff's priorities are? Sure. Well, let Jeff speak to his own priorities. But certainly Jeff has been available when, for example, we've been doing our annual planning cycle as many companies have and it's been great to have Jeff weigh in on really where we're heading for the next year and beyond and to just make sure it's easy to get focused on the details of the business and it's great to have multiple people who can help you pick your eyes up a little bit. Now you don't...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4430,2022-10-19 03:17:15
16085," for the next year and beyond and to just make sure it's easy to get focused on the details of the business and it's great to have multiple people who can help you pick your eyes up a little bit. Now you joined AWS in the middle of a pandemic. You came back to AWS in the middle of a pandemic. That's hopefully moving into the rear view mirror. Moderna is one of AWS's biggest customers. If it weren't for the cloud, if it weren't for AWS, would we have had a vaccine as quickly as we did? I've got to tell you I'm I use, but it's been an absolute privilege for us to work with Moderna because what they're doing obviously is literally life saving and they've been so innovative and so creative. So Moderna took a drug development process to get to the vaccine candidate. That process would typically have taken them 20 months and doing that on AWS in conjunction with all the innovation on their side reduced that 20 months to 42 days. 42 days to get the vaccine candidate, the M R and a vaccine candidate for COVID-19. And that was really running on running multiple parts of Moderna on AWS. So if you look at the drug design part, they had their drug design studio running on AWS all the way to manufacturing with the new digitized manufacturing that they call their digital manufacturing platform. So it's really end to end and the ability to use massive amounts of resources and to pick the exact type of service and capability for each part of the job and and to really bring the full set of resources to bear. In addition to not having to focus on the idea and the infrastructure and the technology and rather letting Moderna focus on the all important job of drug discovery. So working in partnership, it was just magnificent to see what they accomplished. Since you joined AWS, a number of longtime AWS leaders have moved on to Microsoft, to Stripe, to Tableau. Does that concern you? Well, actually retention has been very good. If you mentioned the senior leaders, if you look at the VP plus ranks, the VP and above ranks at Amazon, the average tenure is over a decade, over 10 years. So that's actually very, very strong retention. So of course, you're always going to have some level of people coming and people going and at the end of the day, that's actually healthy for the business. You want new perspectives to come in. Of course, in the right proportion. Amazon has opened an investigation after 550 employees supported a petition, claiming a culture of discrimination, harassment, bullying and bias. What's the status of this? Well, we are incredibly focused and I personally believe it's incredibly important to really have a very diverse, you know, inclusive and equitable environment. And we're going to make sure that whatever it takes that we've got that. So we believe that we're really doing a lot of things to deliver on that. And we've got a lot of innovative efforts around bringing in a diverse workforce, which we have to have both because we're going to serve our customers best, they're diverse. We have to match that diversity. And also, I just believe it's our responsibility and it's the right thing to do. And at the time, there is any possibility that something is not gone the way we wanted to. We're going to investigate it thoroughly. That's what we're doing in the middle of doing in this case. And we'll make sure that we're operating in a way that's consistent with our values and that's always the only goal. If you could rewind to the early 2000s, the earliest days of AWS. Is there anything you would have done differently to build an inclusive culture, to start with a more inclusive culture, to make sure that it didn't become a, you know, a boys club? Well, I don't think that's what we have. I think that we do have a really fun, exciting innovation led and inclusive culture. And that being said, these are hard problems. I think we've done a lot, but we are nowhere close to where we need to be. We're going to be restless and dissatisfied with our progress on DE and I just as we are with every other part of our business. Mark Zuckerberg is making a big bet on the metaverse.

16086," Our business. Mark Zuckerberg is making a big bet on the metaverse. How big do you think it's going to be? Such an interesting sense. The metaverse is real. A.W.S. has the biggest trove of sensitive corporate data in the world. I'm curious how you think about the balance between data and privacy and freedom and civil liberties in the modern era. I mean, there are governments. There are nation states around the world that want that information. Hackers and criminals want that information. We are very clear to start with that. Our first job is security. We often say security is job zero. It was on the first page of our operating plan pretty much every year that I can remember. But what about when governments request that information? So it's a peanut that information. Sure. Well, we are very clear that our customers data is their data. So the data belongs to our customers. And not everybody operates that way. We are not going to look at customers data. We are not going to compete against our customers using their data. Their data is their data. And furthermore, we have all sorts of architectural best practices that our customers should be and are using for any sensitive data. And so a lot of that really relies around encryption. And so we build a lot of different encryption capabilities so that any sensitive data, which could leak for any reason, be it to a government, be it to a hacker, be it to anyone else, any form of security breach, that it's encrypted and useless to anybody else. Given the broad array of encryption solutions that we provide, it's actually very doable and powerful for our customers to safeguard their data that way. Mark Zuckerberg is making a big bet on the metaverse. Is AWS going to have a role in the metaverse? I think AWS already has a big role in the metaverse. So I think the cloud enables the metaverse. So if you think about all of the compute capacity, all of the storage, all of the machine learning which is required to create, compelling and delightful end user experiences in the metaverse, a lot of that is ready today running on AWS. So if you take Epic Games, for example, so Epic Rens Fortnite, massively popular game, 350 million users worldwide and Epic runs almost everything on AWS from the backend, servers to the analytics and everything in between. So I think that's a great example of the metaverse at work and all that's happening today on AWS. And we anticipate that's only going to grow really rapidly in the future. How big do you think it's going to be? Such an interesting sentence, the metaverse is real and yet it's virtual at the same time. I think that if we continue to do...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4432,2022-10-19 03:25:46
16087," It's going to be such an interesting sentence. The metaverse is real. And yet it's virtual at the same time. I think that if we continue to do what we've always done, which is to provide a technology platform that allows organizations to transform, then these gaming and entertainment and social media and other companies will be able to do what they do best, which is to focus on innovating on behalf of their end users. And I think that the metaverse in many other areas will be rich with inventions. So this next conversation will happen in the spheres, in the metaverse. That's where we'll next meet. That could be. I'll meet you in the metaverse. All right. See you there. Now, I know that climate change and stopping climate change and your data center footprint is a big passion of yours. How fast will Amazon's data centers get to carbon neutral? Amazon is already the largest purchaser of renewable energy in the world. And we intend to be 100% renewable energy by the year 2025. We originally said 2030. We actually accelerated that by five years to 2025. And that's part of our broad or climate pledge that Amazon created, and to which we've now gotten 200 other organizations to sign on to. And the climate pledge is to be a net zero carbon by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Accord target. So we know how to do some of that. Other parts are going to require invention, but we really look forward to it. And I think it's one of the most important things we can do for our generation. Amazon counts some of the biggest oil and gas producers as its customers. Isn't that a contradiction? Should you be kicking them off your platforms? Those customers are trying to get to sustainable business models which rely on new energy sources. And so many of those customers are figuring out how do they get to wind, how do they get to solar, how do they get into batteries, all new business models relying on renewable energy. And I think rather than abandoning them and having them maybe dig in more on fossil fuels, if we can enable them to move faster, to be more innovative, and to be more agile in figuring out new business models, new technical solutions, experimenting, failing fast and moving on to the next idea, then the whole world will get to the renewable energy solutions that we need. At this year's re-invent conference, it'll be the first time that Andy Chassi is not giving the keynote. You will be, give us a preview. What can we expect to hear? We're going to have a lot of really exciting announcements. So I think across our service portfolio, you'll see that. We have a lot of exciting partner announcements. The partnership system still remains to this day so important to what AWS is doing, and we have some great announcements lined up for that. And then I think people are going to want to see that we're making it easier and easier for them to consume the cloud and to work with AWS. And so we're going to continue to, in addition to building more powerful basic capabilities, we're going to continue to make it easier and easier in a variety of ways to interact with AWS.

16088,"instrument Alright, so here we are, one of the elephants. As this very first YouTube video was uploaded 16 years ago, the world's most popular video network has exploded to more than 2 billion users in the farthest corners of the planet, now raking in billions of dollars every year. It's evolved a long way from cat videos to become a one-click journey to the center of the zeitgeist, pop culture, and kid culture. While identifying some of the brightest and sometimes darkest traits in all of us, while YouTube has elevated a generation of creators and educated and entertained generations of viewers, it's fought misinformation, terrorism, racism, and violence many clicks along the way. Lately, YouTube's biggest battles are focused on eliminating COVID and vaccine misinformation and keeping the platform safe for kids and teens. On this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, we rewind to talk about where YouTube has been, and fast forward to where it's going next, with one of the longest tenured employees and women at Google, the CEO of YouTube, Susan Wajitski. It's been five years since we last talked on camera, and we have a new president. We are weathering a pandemic. The most watched video on YouTube is... Baby Shark? Baby Shark. So, a lot's changed since 2016. How do you feel about YouTube 2021 versus 2016? I feel good about it. It's definitely been a while, and in technology things move so quickly, so a lot of things have changed since 2016. And overall, I've been really pleased that we've continued to grow and grow our ecosystem of creators, and we've invested a lot in responsibility. And that's been a really big focus for us, and with weather through a pandemic and a lot of hard challenges, but overall, I'm feeling really good. You've been at Google for 20 plus years going all the way back to Larry and Sergey in the garage. You've been the CEO of YouTube for seven plus years. How has your job changed in that time? Since I joined being the CEO of YouTube, I would say one of the biggest things that has changed, certainly, has just been maybe the recognition of the importance of digital video. So, when I first joined, actually a lot of people would say, oh, like, why did you join? I was running ads beforehand, and that's been the main way Google generates revenue. And so, a lot of people said, like, why did you leave that and go to YouTube? But I always believed in digital video, and I believe that now we see that the world also believes we've seen a lot of adoption of digital video and the benefits that that can have. You've championed this diversification strategy at YouTube since you started. What's working and what's not working? Well, our main way of generating revenue is from advertising. But we also have really grown our subscription revenue, and that has been really, really important from many different reasons. So, that has enabled our users to have an experience where they can have music, YouTube music, and premium. We just announced.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4434,2022-10-19 03:34:32
16089," really, really important from many different reasons. So that has enabled our users to have a experience where they can have music, YouTube music and premium. We just announced the 50 million subscribers that we were really excited about. But we also see other ways that our creators generate revenue. So our creators, for example, generate revenue with channel subscriptions, they may sell merchandise. We also have things like digital goods, so like super chat, super thanks. And so we've basically diversified the number of ways that our ecosystem is generating revenue. The original tagline for YouTube was broadcast yourself. And that concept has exploded. You have ordinary people in the spotlight. When they grow up, they want to be an influencer. They want to be a YouTube star or a YouTube creator. What do you see as the future of the creator economy? I see a lot of possibility with the creator economy. And because I see that many people have a lot of interest and they have a lot to offer. And beforehand, they went up and able to have shared that with the world. And so there's so many people depending upon what their talent or their interest is, whether it's a sport or cooking or gaming or hairstyles that people have come out and really been able to share that and create a lot of jobs. So we actually see, like our, we actually saw a 35% increase in the number of creators that are generating six-figure income out of YouTube. And in the last year. And so that's just an example of like how the creator economy is continuing to grow. Well, and for years, YouTube was the only company that actually paid creators. But now a lot of companies are paying creators. Facebook, Instagram, Snap, TikTok. How do you see that competition playing out? Who wins? Well, it is a competitive landscape. And in general, competition is good. It makes everyone work harder and that's good. I mean, we look at creators and we say, they're going to come to us if we do the best job. And creators come to us looking basically for fame and fortune. Like, how can I have a skill or I have a talent? Something I want to share with the world. Like and YouTube can help that be known, can help them provide that fame, but also we can generate revenue for them. And so as long as we're doing a good job of that, creators are going to come to us. If we start to fail, then they're going to leave us and they're going to go to another platform. And so we just need to work really hard to make sure that we deliver that for our creators. A year ago during the Black Lives Matter protest, YouTube made big commitments to Black creators in particular. What's been the progress there? And how do you see the potential for YouTube to be used as a tool for social justice? Well, so we've made an announcement that we were going to do a hundred million dollar Black Voices Fund. And so we're continuing to develop content there. But one of the other thing, and I think there'll be, there's been a lot of great content that's come out and we'll certainly see more. But you know, because YouTube doesn't have any gatekeepers, like you can just post and become a creator, we have seen a lot of people of different backgrounds and underrepresented backgrounds become creators and have audiences. We never really measured it beforehand because we didn't have a way. And so one of the things that we've done is we've with enabled creators to now tell us what backgrounds they they affiliate with so we can have a better understanding of how they're doing on our platform. Let's talk about YouTube shorts. It seems to be a top priority. Yeah, we all know that TikTok is on the rise. How important are YouTube shorts to the platform to the company? So YouTube shorts, it's very important. We see that creators and users want to watch all types of content, long form, short form. It turns out that the first video that was actually ever uploaded to YouTube, me at the zoo, was an 18-second video. So it was a short form video. And we have lots of short form videos and we've had it way before TikTok did, but what we have really been leaning into more is just enabling those to be found. And then a lot of the creation tools. And so bringing a lot more mobile creation is really important for us going forward. Did you notice that viewing time was being lost to TikTok? Did you see that trend? And do you see TikTok as a sort of existential threat? I mean, we definitely see many competitors in this space. What we're just focused on are our own metrics. Do we see our users engaging?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4435,2022-10-19 03:38:58
16090," as a sort of existential threat. I mean, we definitely see many competitors in this space. What we're just focused on are our own metrics, like do we see our users engaging, where's our opportunity, and we're always looking around and seeing what our competitors are doing. And if they're doing something that we think would be good for our users and our creators, we're also gonna look at how we can improve our own economy, creator economy, and what's good for our users. I think a lot of people, we talk about vaccine hesitancy and they blame social media. They say YouTube's not doing enough. One of the big things for us is to continue to work with public health experts to get their messages across. Music today's your big day are you excited? Mama is tired. They speed apart. You have to feed your creativity. So this tree house, you guys ready for the movie? See what we can do. Hey, you're so nervous. At this point, YouTube has become a hub for discovery, for information, for, you know, it satisfies our curiosities, right? That comes with a lot of inspiration, but also with misinformation. When it comes to vaccines, vaccine hesitancy, videos that cause a public health risk, where do you want to see YouTube do better? We've taken responsibility very seriously. It's been one of my top priorities. So first of all, we want to make sure that if there's information that violates our policies, we came up with 10 different policies around COVID. Then if that's a violation of policies, then that's something that will remove. We removed over a million videos associated with COVID. But we also want to make sure that we're raising up information that we think would be, that come from trusted and authoritative sources. And we've really been able to do that. I think a lot of people, you know, we talk about vaccine hesitancy and they blame social media. They say YouTube's not doing enough, you know, how do you respond to that? Yeah, I mean, I think, first of all, we're always learning. I just, just to be fair, like, we're always thinking about how can we do better? We're looking at the feedback and working with public health experts across the board. And, you know, I think one of the big things for us is to continue to work with public health experts to understand, you know, what are the ways that we can partner with them to get their messages across. And I really believe that that is something that has really changed is the evolution of bringing, you know, creators, musicians, experts talking about public health. We never would have seen that before in the pandemic. How much do you internalize the criticism of YouTube's content? Do you take it personally? And how does that influence the decisions that you make as CEO? I want to be doing the right thing. And I care about that. I care about the legacy that we leave. I care about the world that we leave to our children. And I care about how media is consumed by the next generation and by everyone today. And so I really have...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4436,2022-10-19 03:43:26
16091," And I care about how media is consumed by the next generation and by everyone today. And so I really have put a lot of time and effort to make sure that we are acting responsibly. And there's always a balance between the free speech and the right, but being responsible and taking down content that we think could lead to some kind of real-world harm. And so I mean, sure, I think whenever you're in a position like that, there's going to be a lot of criticism. But our goal is just to continue to talk to experts and evolve. And how do you make decisions in those tough moments where it's a tough call? Like how much of it is making a decision or leading by consensus and how much does it come down to you? The goal is that when we have tough decisions, they're not, we're not, they are like improvising in some way. Like we've made a concrete set of decisions beforehand and then we're looking and saying, is this something that meets our standards? Is it a violation or not a violation? And if it seems like there's some set of issues with the content that we have on the platform, we're going to go back to experts and then re-evaluate is that should we be making changes to our policies? YouTube helped keep a generation of children connected, educated, entertained, distracted through the pandemic. What have you learned from that experience? And what do you see as the potential future of YouTube as a tool for learning, as a tool in schools? When I meet people and they find out I'm the CEO of YouTube, almost always, they tell me about something they learned on YouTube or someone that they're, something their family member learned. So I see that as being a very significant part of YouTube. And during the pandemic, we certainly saw that a lot more education went online and we had all the homeschooling, we had people who had to also just learn a lot of skills that they hadn't learned beforehand. But probably the biggest thing that we also learned was just, and that I really saw was the need for us to continue to work with educational institutions. And the need for us to be able to integrate with some of the learning tools that the kids are all using because they are using YouTube. And there's a lot more that we can do to really help educators have YouTube be a key part of the curriculum. My kids are on YouTube a lot and sometimes more than I want them to be. And sometimes it's super productive and they're learning something cool. And sometimes it's not productive at all. How are you innovating to make the time that kids spend on YouTube more valuable and of course safe? It's very important to me as a parent to make sure that we're giving parents options about how what they want their kids to see. And that's one of the reasons that pretty much as soon as I got to YouTube, we started working on YouTube kids, which is a separate app, which is important for kids in terms of how we can control the quality and we can give parents a lot more control about what kind of content is appropriate for them and their family. And there are many other things. We actually just came out with a supervised experience for tweens because tweens was one of the age groups that was actually hardest. They usually don't want to be on the kids app, but they're not 13 to be on the main app. And so the supervised experience is something that we recently came out with. The Wall Street Journal has been doing some in-depth reporting on Facebook. The report is that Facebook knew that Instagram was toxic for teen girls and didn't do anything about it. Does YouTube look at the impact it has on teen users, the influence it might have on someone's body image or self-esteem? First of all, I think it's a very important topic. And we do have a panel of experts that we work with to be able to help us understand what are the different ways that our product could be used or what are, how do we face some of these challenging issues to make sure that we're getting the best advice. And we certainly do see for a lot of really tough issues that YouTube can be a really valuable resource. So body positivity, mental health, we see a lot of creators actually talk about mental health and that for a lot of kids, it's really, it like destigmatizes and enables people to talk about what's happening and what's going on with them. The potential long-term impacts of YouTube on teens and on children, whether it is toxic or whether it's addictive, is that something that you wonder about, is that something that you struggle with not just as a CEO, but as a mom? Billio.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4437,2022-10-19 03:47:49
16092," on children, whether it is toxic or whether it's addictive. Is that something that you wonder about? Is that something that you struggle with, not just as a CEO, but as a mom? We certainly want to make sure that we are doing what we can to be responsible with kids and in every way possible. And that's one of the reasons that we actually have worked hard to give parents as many options as possible for them to decide what is important for them and their family, whether that's limiting screen time, like limiting what is the content they actually have access to. I mean, even letting parents just say, these are like the 10 videos. My kid can only see these 10 videos. And so that is really important for us to give the tools back to parents for them to decide what is best for them and their family. Are you concerned about looming regulation? There may be regulation that is well intended, but actually then has a really negative impact. I'd like to begin by addressing the heinous attack on the United States Capitol. Like all Americans, I am outraged by the violence, lawlessness, and mayhem. How much did President Trump test YouTube, and how much did it test you as a leader? Election integrity is something that we see incredibly, is incredibly important. And I think that's what I'm going to say. I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that incredibly important and have leaned into in every way we possibly can. We treat all public figures, and all public leaders, the same as we treat any individual. And so, meaning that everybody is held to the same standards. And so we definitely held President Trump as we would hold all other presidents and all other elected officials to the same standards that we hold our creators and anyone else on YouTube. What was that difficult for you as the CEO of the company? I mean, that's kind of, that's like a big responsibility. I mean, yeah, it is difficult, but it is very important and we also are global. So we're dealing with leaders from all over the world. And there were a number of leaders that, and there continue to be a number of leaders that post or that there's content that may be a violation of our policies. But we do hold a consistent standard across everything that we do. YouTube was the last platform to ban Trump. And you have said, his channel will be reinstated when an elevated risk of violence has subsided. How and when specifically will you make that decision? Well, we'll make that decision based on a number of different factors, whether that is like events in the news, signals were seeing from the government. And we'll certainly continue to evaluate that based on a large number of signals that we see. And will he ultimately be reinstated? I mean, we've stated that we will reinstate him when we believe that there is no risk to public safety or no public danger. We'll just move to voting.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4438,2022-10-19 03:53:59
16093," risks to public safety or no public danger. Google just removed a voting app for Russian opposition leader Alexi Navalny. The Russian government seems to be stepping up requests to take down content. You've talked in the past about your family history, your grandparents living behind the iron curtain being concerned about censorship back then. And Russia is a huge YouTube audience. How concerned are you about Russian government overreach? One of the things that is important to us at YouTube is the fact that we do enable so many voices and that we do enable people to express themselves and really celebrate the freedom of speech. And we certainly, that's a core value of ours. But when we work with governments there are many things that we have to take in consideration, like whether it's local laws or what's happening on the ground. And so there's always going to be multiple considerations that we're going to have to take into consideration. Navalny said that YouTube deleted a video, one of his videos. Was that at the request of the Russian government? We certainly get requests from governments. And we look and consider why are we getting the request, what's actually happening on the ground. And based on a whole bunch of different factors, we make a decision. So we don't always, those are not always requests that make sense for us to honor, but uncertain cases. We will honor them in that country. The Biden administration seems to be targeting big tech. We've seen Mark Zuckerberg. We've seen Jack Dorsey now testify before Congress multiple times. And I've heard it said that YouTube is getting a pass. Do you think you should be up there testifying? I think we do go a lot of scrutiny. I feel like there's a lot of scrutiny. And because YouTube is part of Google, Sundar has testified a number of different times and answered many different questions on YouTube. So I do believe there's a certain amount of scrutiny. And you know, if I were ever asked to testify, I certainly would go and testify as well. You're one of the most senior women at Google. It's not the most senior woman at Google. Google has faced a lot of scrutiny for how it treats women in recent years. How much progress do you think Google has made in hiring and promoting women across the company? And how much progress do you think still needs to be made? I see a really big effort across technology as a whole to be able to be more inclusive. And I think that is really positive. I've been a big supporter of it. It's the very beginning. And I mean, I think at Google, there are many efforts and there's a lot of a lot of work that has been done. And I'm sure there's a lot more for us to continue to do. And if you just look at the stats, you can see they're not enough women. We need more women in technology. And I think we have made a lot of progress. But it's still hard. It's harder to be a woman in technology. It's harder to be a minority of any kind. And so I think there's still a lot of work for us to do when we last spoke five years ago. You know, I asked you about being a mom. You have five kids and you said something that really stuck with me. You said being a mom makes me a better leader. I prioritize better. I see something growing fast and I run towards that. If something's growing closely, I'm like, I don't have time for that. How has that management strategy played out for you? I think it's played out really well. I mean, prioritization is everything when you look at it because we have a lot of opportunity. There's a lot of moving pieces, very dynamic environment. So if you can prioritize and say these are like the most important things to do, then you're going to get there faster. Lauren, sorry, I have no left. How long do you plan to keep running YouTube? How long do you plan to stay at Google? As long as I have a mission that I believe in and that things that I'm excited about getting done. So I have a lot of ways that I see that YouTube can continue to grow. I have a lot of products and ideas and things that aren't yet released and things that we don't aren't yet doing. And I'm excited about getting those done. So I think if there comes a time where I no longer have a list of projects where I feel like I don't have that much more to add, then it'll be probably time to do something else. Would you throw your hat into the ring to be Alphabet's next CEO or if the board asked you, would you step up and do that? Well, I think Sundar's doing a great job. Please.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4439,2022-10-19 03:56:19
16094," It's next CEO or if the board asked you, would you step up and do that? Well, I think Sundar is doing a great job. Very, very, very, please. I think he's doing, I mean, it's a very challenging job. There's a lot of different constituents and a lot of product, a lot of different issues. And I mean, I'll just say I'll always do whatever would be, wherever I could be most helpful to the company. Do you still talk much to Larry and Sergey? I do still see them socially though, not workwise. Do you ever talk about work? I mean, sometimes it would be casually, but our business is very complex right now. And there's a lot of things that are happening. And so it's hard for, I mean, people may have different opinions, but to really engage it's a long conversation. What do you want your legacy to be? I am proud of the way that we've been able to enable people to have a channel, to have an audience. Like I just met with a number of three creators. And like YouTube really was able to let them shine and create audiences in a business and employ people that otherwise never would have happened. And so that's certainly one continuing to grow that. I'd say second, it's been really important to me, too, to see a lot more women in technology that has been just a personal goal of mine is to be a role model and try to support women. And I feel very fortunate to have gotten to where I have. And I know it was due to many different factors. And I want to support the next generation of women and see technology as like an open place where anyone can come and be successful. And then probably lastly, continue to grow what we're doing with education. Susan would get to be to have YouTube. Thank you. Thank you so much for having me. legislature,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4440,2022-10-19 04:01:13
16095," He's the meantime, falling to the lowest levels since December of 2019. I want to get to a trending story on the terminal from Bill Gross, because he's criticised the total return bond fund that he popularised. GTV go for our clients for the additional perspective. This is the former bond king. He comes out once in a while, and this time he says that the strategy is failed to live up to its mission. He actually singles out the PIMCO product and Jeffrey Gondlocks double-lined total return bond fund. So they've lost about 17% this year. Individual investors have chosen these funds for their 401k retirement accounts, believing that's going to be defensive in times of crisis. They have been misled. The other big move is in the currency markets. Let's talk about dollar and a little bit. It is at the weakest level for the Japanese currency since 1990. Yes, that was when West Germany won the World Cup. But what's important to note here is that we are inching closer towards the 150 mark. If you take a really close look, there's a lot of chatter that Stealth Intervention might be taking place to try and prevent it to get to that level. We'll see whether the bank of Japan after doing this succeeds. Yeah, when do they blink? We seem to miss those signposts. Let's talk about stocks, Yursef, because what we have is a back-to-back gains. S&P up what? Nearly 4% in two days, Nasdaq, up over 4% in two days, and what Bank of America are saying. We are entering a period of macro capitulation, investor capitulation, and crucially policy capitulation. Not if you listen to Cash Carry, the arch dove to the arch hawk. But the issue at play here is when do we see a pivot? Stocks are rallying, of course, Netflix injected a whole new narrative to the tech narrative, yes, so along with Alphabet, we'll get Tesla later today, 14% up after ours in Netflix. Let me show you what's going on in the oil market. The F-15, we've had the final 15 release of the SPR that was announced in the spring from the White House, so 180 million barrels in total was the objective, the final 15 are to go, and what we want to hear today as oil rises by 1% is what are the plans for additional SPR sales, what size and scope will we get? The US plans to buy crew back at $60, $70, $72 in the United States of America. Long way to go before you get that, and all the voices of OPEC, the UAE, Hathem, Elgath, the Secretary General talking about the potential for a real global recession, a real slowdown, and this is why they cut. That's the narrative coming from the OPEC side. We'll investigate that throughout the morning. I'm Rita Sen joins us later in programming. Let's check in on the markets around the world, Juliet Sully's in Singapore with the very latest, she's been waiting for intervention quite literally. I'm on intervention watch all day, every day, Matt, but let's start with what's happening in Hong Kong as well, because we've been hearing from Chief Executive John Lee really trying to lay out rules to make Hong Kong more attractive to foreign workers, and also of course the reopening too, and it was interesting to see John Lee start his speech without his mask. You are seeing Hong Kong's market, though, as a whole, lower on the lunch break, but we did see an uptick coming through in those property stocks. They've paired some of that earlier rally, but certainly the changes to housing stamp, Judy being welcomed by investors. We're also looking at weakness in China as the party Congress continues, and of course we're waiting for as well, the GDP print to come through. And then when it comes to the tech players, a little bit of downside as we continue to see some woes about the report here of the iPhone 14 production cut. I want to show you as well what's happening on a broader trend with Asian equities, as we see this correlation with the US and a little bit somewhat of a downturn here in terms of the correlation starting to trend lower with the S&P 500 index. But a lot of analysts that we've been speaking to say, look, continue to look at the reopening theme, particularly amongst Southeast Asian equities. They are among the few bright spots globally, and they could see some further upside coming through as tourists return to the region and boost revenues that will help offset the impact of inflationary pressures here in Asia. Manus. Jill, thank you very much. Think of beauty that, John, all the momentum that you need to see. Let's talk about Netflix a little bit more detail now. It's sort of an extended trading following the welcome earning surprise. A growth in subscribers after several shrinking quarters.

16096," Several shrinking quarters. Bloomberg see Keenan has more. So Sue is the worst over what's the guidance from Netflix? Well, that is the message from Netflix, the co-founder and CEO, Aureed Hastings said, quote, thank God we're done with shrinking quarters. And so that's why you have this sigh of relief on both Wall Street. Add in Hollywood, the Global Streaming Service is growing again, added more than 2.4 million customers in their quarter, that not only exceeded Wall Street's expectations, it exceeded Netflix's own internal forecast. Netflix, who in all regions of the world and setting shareholder letter, they expect to sign up another 4.5 million globally this period. And that is in fact due to the release of a strong slate of programs that are attracted millions of viewers, a stranger thing's one of those popular TV series of the world. They had the Korean smash hit extraordinary attorney Wu. You're looking at the after hours, the stock was actually up as much as 16% before pairing back to just over 14%. A lot of tech stocks moving with it because of the message that, hey, if you have strong content, streaming service can still provide growth. You're looking at that year-to-date stock chart that shows the opposite down some 60%. Of course, the reality is the streaming more still exists. There's a lot of competition out there. And so despite the relief rally, some analysts point out the results and outlook were mixed. Keebang Capital Market said the third quarter net adds exceeded expectations.

I mean, I'm still recovering from the binge of Stranger Things. Sue, thanks for that. That's Sue Keenan in New York. Let's get to President Biden because he is set to announce plans later to tap into additional oil supplies from strategic reserves. For more, let's bring in Bloomberg's Energy Report of Steve Szefchensky. So, Stephen, this is a bold move given how drawn down these reserves already are. Absolutely. I mean, if you look at just where they are, they're at the lowest level in years. And this is the end of a large RITSPR release. They had committed 180, the last of that's coming in December with 15. And then when you look at what he's doing going forward, he said, maybe in January, we'll release any more. With strategic reserves at the lowest level in decades, that begs to question, when will they buy back? And the answer to that is when prices fall. If prices fall to that high 60 low 70 level dollars per barrel for WTI, then the U.S. will buy back. What they're effectively doing is they're putting a floor under the oil market to a degree because they could have a lot of capacity to buy back oil barrels. So, when you look at that across the board, despite what we look at with the weakness in the market with the potential recession, at least if it were to fall further from this level, the U.S. would, to a degree, provide support to lift prices higher. Another thing they have to take a look at is, well, OPEC plus do going forward. You know, the U.S. says they might do more to release barrels. That would be a bearish factor in the market. Would, would OPEC plus say, hey, we're going to cut output even more if you do that as well. And so, there are a number of things to think about going forward. And there is this geopolitical element sort of in the background between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia as well as Russia. And data, we heard from Secretary General, Haytem El-Gaes, a very real potential for a global recession. Some say it's already started. But of course, it's the politics of the gas prices at the pump, Stephen. That's probably what matters the most. Students to Chinsky, they're in Singapore.

16098," I've always been a person who's just been attracted to hair. I like to sit and think and theorize how I can manifest these visions that I have for braiding and how I can take something that may seem like it's a line drawing in my mind and apply that to someone's scalp. We are the only culture that has hair that grows out of our head the way that it does. Anyone from the African diaspora is born with this amazingly curly hair that can be shaped into a variety of different ways of expression. I want black people to love themselves for how they naturally appear and also to appreciate the cultural practice such as braiding that our ancestors have practiced for centuries. What a foundation strong enough to stay we will know. Global economy continues to face significant headwinds. Blacen remains high. Central banks are raising interest rates at a pace not seen in decades. Meanwhile equity markets are well off the recent highs. Geopolitical instability and energy shocks are not going to concern and GDP growth expectations are declining. If we don't see progress in underlying inflation or cornflation I don't see why I would advocate stopping at 4.5 or 4.75 or something like that. Back on the back of the day. Markets are taking a cue from the strong corporate earnings. The latest fund manager survey from Bank of America suggests full capitulation. A rally is set for 2023. Screams of macro capitulation. We will come back to capitulation behavior in a moment. Let's get to Malta Malone, chief economic advisor to Alphabet. There is no reason for me to pause because inflation is so sticky and we don't see progress. Why would I stop at 4.75? Is that the zone of policy mistake rearing its head again? With policy mistake on the way up we didn't get started soon enough. When do we enter policy mistake on doing too much? Unfortunately, it's very difficult to say. This second half of 2022 is very interesting because the consensus forecasts of inflation have been really budged in the second half of this year after being ramped up over the last 16 months. But central banks have hiked 200 basis points and markets have hiked even more than central banks. We all know they're behind. We're going to get potentially another 150 basis points before the end of the year from the Fed on November 2nd and on December 14th. The big problem for all of us, both the central bank and the markets, is the rollover in inflation and the big declines in inflation are only going to come in 2023 and the big rollover is not going to come up with April and May. And unfortunately markets would access volatility don't like waiting. And this is the dilemma. Martha, the conditions were ripe for a short squeeze in equities and we're seeing quite a bit of a move to the upside over the last three trading sessions on the S&P 500. We're above the key 200 week moving average. It's a go for the additional perspective. What kind of sounds are you looking for here that could tell you this is just a bear market rally? What kind of transp are you looking for let the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4444,2022-10-19 04:21:15
16099," 100 week moving average, GTV go for the additional perspective. What kind of signs are you looking for here that could tell you this is just a bear market rally? Well, potentially it's a bear market rally. It all depends on what happens in 2023. As we just mentioned, central banks are going to do at that last they've been pulled to high rates. Now they all want to high rates. That's pretty, very good news. And very good news for the US on like any country in the world. They have a huge lease from the dollar around 20% in the last 18 months, which is also an anti inflationary measure. And so the surprise of 2023 will probably be a collapse in inflation. Remember inflation in 2020 was zero. OK, with a collapse in inflation then, what does that do to the dollar? We're looking at the Bank of America survey. It's screaming capitulation, macro investor and policy cash is at levels we haven't seen since 2001. And investors are heavily underweight equities. But 68% see the dollar overvalued. If inflation collapses next year, will the bully in the school yard, the dollar roll over and take a thump? Yeah, so we have one word for this manus and that is, you know, the most of this year everything collapsed for stocks, bonds, commodities, crypto. But if we shift from the stagnation trade, everything imploding to the peak trade. And the peak trade is centered on one issue. And that's the inflation. Peak inflation means peak interest rates. Peak inflation and peak interest rates in America means the peak dollar. We've been bullish dollar for almost two years, expecting DX1 to go to 120. We almost touched 115. The third value of the past half century. So the answer to your question is all down to the word peak. Peak inflation peak rate. And we will get peak dollar. I'm looking at the UK story where the government is catching a breath even if it's just for a few hours maybe same for the Bank of England and for some investors as well. Run me through what the thinking is on year-round when it comes to the inflation data that is expected late in a day. Because that is the market's life question. Will 10% inflation break UK guild markets? And no, we've already broken the UK guild market. UK guilds going to almost 5%. Mortgage rates in the UK going very, very synergy to the US. Almost close to 7%. And the major problem actually is the Bank of England itself. And the Bank of England has a policy range just to run 2%. This policy rate has to be 5% or potentially even higher. So we don't have any peak in UK inflation. And we're not confident in the road over. We're not confident in this piece of the decline. So on the point of view, the Bank of England is still in the bad books. Martin fantastic analysis much appreciated Martin Malone their chief economic advisor at Alphaboke. Thanks again.

China has been that guy around the corner with a bouquet of flowers to Africa, the US, Europe and the UK. I have time and time again say be careful of the flowers you see out of the window they have thorns on them. To buy has become the world's best performing luxury housing market in the past year with prices for high-end real estate rising in the 50% Bloomberg's Zina Fata looks at why. This is the one at Palm, an ultra luxury building in Dubai operated by the Dorchester. Apartment prices start at $15 million and go up from there. But what would justify these prices? Let's go inside and check it out. This is one of Dubai's most luxurious residential towers. Buyers of the 90 apartments in this building come from all over the world and they're willing to pay big bucks for the amenities here. That includes a private beach, indoor and outdoor pools, 24 hour concierge, gym, sauna, private cinema, you name it. Luxury real estate has been on a tear in Dubai ever since the pandemic hit and caused lockdowns all over the world. Dubai managed with about three weeks of full lockdown initially, but the city soon after started gradually opening up, returning life back to near normal within few months. That drove some of the world's wealthiest to buy homes in Dubai and some moved their families to the city. But other factors include lower taxes and a seven-year price lump that made property in Dubai more affordable than other global cities. Also, Russia's invasion of Ukraine brought in scores of wealthy Russians looking to shield their money from the bite of sanctions. Prime real estate prices shot up more than 70% this year outpacing gains in London and New York. For the wider housing market in Dubai, prices rose 9% and rental rates surged 26% in the year through September. For now, data shows transaction volumes are still going strong despite rising interest rates and worries about global recession. Senator Fattar, there are inside, we have it on good authority, the $50 million apartments that years have been looking at. Money shouldn't be an obstacle. What does it for me is a cinema. The exclusive cinema and watching Bloomberg, David Middle East, on a massive screen in the morning. The line of 22, the line of 2022, money shouldn't be an obstacle. Tell me what, I haven't got $50 million. Well, I'm trying to get into your kind of way of thinking. In my zone, I tell you what, it's much cheaper. I can assure you of that. As is my pension fund, as we all know, it's been spanked by 22% this year. Yes. Yes. Everybody's pension. All in on American equities. You're going to be with me until I'm 90. There you go. We've got a double-punch back on you. I'm going to head out. Is that what finished Yusuf off? He bailed to the palm to $15 million apartment on the prospect of another 10 years with me. Back-to-back gates on US equity markets. The point is, city is saying that actually, US equities have priced the highest odds of recession, more than bonds, more than other astroclasses. And there I take you to the Middle East equity markets that track the global investor sentiment. So we have quite a bit of a moment of the upside here with Abu Dhabi Abadami stocks, up 3.5% that the dollar is up 2%. Quite a bit of action as well. And Petro Chemicals will get to that in a moment.

Indeed, Matt, I send the other big thing for investors here in Asia has been the first speech, policy speech from Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee. You can see Hong Kong's market is the lagged on the lunch break down by more than 1% as investors react to some moves in terms of policy and of course waiting to see whether or not there is going to be a pivot away from these very strict COVID restrictions. We've also got the party congress continuing in China sentiment there on the back foot too with the CSI 300 down by about 9 tons of 1%. But elsewhere you can see it is a pretty positive session. You mentioned intervention watch. We are never far from that and we heard once again from authorities in Japan, particularly Bank of Japan, excuse me, Governor Corota saying in parliament that recent and one-sided weakening of the yen is negative for Japan's economy.

16102," And of course, our use if we continue to watch for that 150 level for some potential stealth intervention too. Yeah, and from FX, let's talk property. Because in Hong Kong, we've got quite a bit of news. One has John Lee outlined with relation to that sector. Yeah, well, exactly. This is one sector in not only Hong Kong, but broader mainland China, two of our investors have been hoping for some support. And one of the key things that John Lee did outline at the top of his speech was some restriction and loosening of stamp duty, particularly for foreigners as well. So that actually saw the Hangseung property index rise by almost 3%. As John Lee was talking, we paired some of those earlier gains and you can see on the lunch break only up by about four tenths of 1%. The government may also relax rules on an extra 15% stamp duty that non-resident property buyers need to pay. And if we just flip the board and have a look at how the Hangseung property index has of course, fared over the past year, it really shows you some of the support that is needed for this sector. We've seen some very significant falls as we continue to see, of course, regulations come into play here too, Yusuf. Jules, thank you very much for some of those highlights. That's Julia Sali there. I want to get to Erniek's season that is in full gear in the Gulf as investors weigh resilient energy prices against a potential global recession. Sali Petrochemical giant SIPCAM was the latest company to miss analyst expectations. Let's bring in Yap Mayer, he's the manager director and head off equities research at our Comp Capital. Yeah, let's start with the sector that is meant to be the most resilient in times of volatility abroad, but at the same time, pretty high oil prices. What is your read on some of these announcements coming through from the likes of SIPCAM? No, we've been actually, I mean, on a way, it's the sector because it's one of the most vulnerable for the global slowdown with spreads narrowing because of demand destruction. That's happening and oil prices increasing. So their spreads are narrowing. So we know that the third quarter will be tough one, so we expected on average 25, 30 percent lower earnings year over year and even sequentially down as well. So there's no surprises from our end. Having said that, we've started to increase our positions for the sector. SIPCAM already trades about 10 times earnings, anyway, on press earnings. And we've recently added SABIC to our core portfolio. This is mainly reflecting resilience of Euria, which is over 20 percent of their EBITDA, as well as a 5 percent dividend yield because the balance sheet is completely debt free. So this is how we've been playing the sector, which is relatively vulnerable. As the markets started to price in, let's say, expose value after the 20 percent decline year today. And a new CEO at SABIC. So let's see whether there's any shift in strategy, but that's highly unlikely. And Bank of America had record nims. That transfer is around all of the banking system. On UAE banks, we've had a large as-nemic expansion in the third quarter. Now, does that continue? I see the terminal rate. What is the consequence of a higher terminal rate I presume on nims and who benefits the most? Who's the most underpriced on the nims story? Yeah, so the plays on higher rates are the EUE banks, but also the Saudi corporate banks. So if you look at Saudi on an aggregate level, margins are not up because the retail banks, Islamic banks, suffering from substantial margin and compression. Like, our OSH is down 50 base points every year. But at the same time, you see likes of Saudi British Bank, Saudi National Bank having substantial margin expansion, as well as the EUE banks. And within those, we think Emirates, and the Dubai Islamic Bank are the best positions over and over about 80 base points of nims expansion for Emirates and the EUE for the year. And obviously, the rate across from Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and the indexes are not a best proxy, to be honest, but the retail banks provide a very strong rate across for the sector. And I think there are substantial earnings upside risk for EUE banks and the Saudi corporate banks. The CEO of extra was one of the larger consumer plays in the Kingdom was on the program last week, and he kind of explained, kind of spoke about how Saudi consumers were still very much out there and putting money on the table. What do you like at the moment in that space? What are you telling clients? Yeah, so inflation is quite moderate in Saudi, and the consumer spending is up. Part of that is the number of experts increasing by 1.5 million, so there's about 11% decrease in number of experts, the total population is up about 3%. So that's providing a positive read across for the overall spending. Don't worry about possibly.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4448,2022-10-19 04:38:58
16103," in, so there's about 11% decrease in love or expats, the total population is up about 3%. So that's providing a positive read across for the overall spending. There's a reopening story, so mobility is happening, travel is increasing, so one way to play that is sorry, ground services, or your catering is an interesting idea for the second half. Within the electronic space, we prefer Javier, because they benefit more from the reopening of the school reopening. So we're back to school, only this quarter. So that's a nice play, as well as all theme, which benefits from the same theme. Now we've just played out a piece of palm property. I mean, it's great pictures, great story. What do you get for 15 million bucks? Renser up 26% year on year for the average villa, which could have a sting in the tail. Translate that into the equity narrative. All to the debt structure, let's say, in the builders here and across the region. How bullish are you on the builders? And again, that kind of monster moves 70% up in prices in one year at the top end. Is that reflected in the equity valuations? Not yet. I think there's further upside in E-Mart and E-Mart Dev. E-Mart itself is trading at below book value at the moment, the PE, which is our six or seven. So it continues to offer very good value. It always has offered a substantial value, but for the third quarter, we expect almost 100% of the earnings growth. So these are very spectacular numbers coming through. Hospitality is doing obviously very well, but also the development part is doing extremely well. E-Mart Dev is an interesting play on his own because they can reinstate a dividends, which gives you an 8% different yield handle. So I think both are very attracted to play. Plus, E-Mart is also an index play. It's increased the foreign ownership limit. And because the foreign room narrowed up quite a bit, we recognize the increase faster. So therefore, we think the inflows will happen in December. What about some of the IPO activity we had guests on this program over the last few days who are beginning to be a little bit cautious about some of the companies that are coming to market at this particular juncture in the global market? What is your thoughts? That's all depends on the pricing, I think. So if you do it this smart, you discount it versus the existing companies that are out there as your peers. Price is there, that 20% discount. Do you leave enough room for the aftermarket performance? We've seen some examples where there was not the case. Obviously, those IPOs had a mixed success. But if you continue to do that, I think there's continue to be appetite for IPOs. OK, yeah, thank you very much. Yeah, my, the managing director and head of equity research at R-Campel. So some breaking minds on Credit Suisse, we know different parts of the business, maybe, on the block, the asset management business, the securities business. But this time, Credit Suisse's loan portfolio is attract Japan's M-U-F-G's interests. So yes, it was about the asset management business. M-U-F-G said to vet some of the Credit Suisse loan portfolios. Again, this is all about reducing risk-weighted assets, reducing the size of the investment bank, reducing the capital structure and dependency, which will all flow through to the amount of capitalists bank ultimately needs to raise to grow. Yeah, and at the same time, we're also running a story here about how they are still losing talent, city group hiring four private bankers from Credit Suisse in Hong Kong to fuel plants to build their wealth franchise. When are they going to be able to put a stop on this? Maybe it's going to be with this new strategy update that we are going to get in a few days. Once we're coverage ahead, this is Bloomberg.

Let's just release the third quarter trading update the result show revenue up 28% versus the same period last year. So let's dig a little bit deeper into the numbers we've got Nandin. He's the CEO. Welcome to the show. Good to see you. Good morning. So here we are. A great set of numbers on very sort of first reflection. Where has the biggest portion of growth been for you in the business? So the good news is we're seeing growth in both the Middle East as well as Africa. Our business is oriented towards helping banks offer electronic credentials to their consumers as well as helping merchants accept payments. And we're also seeing growth in both our lines of business. So we're fortunate to do business in great geographies and we're fortunate to be part of a great industry. Yeah I'm looking here at the breakdown. The direct to merchant T PV. I mean retail is up. Supermarkets are up traveling into payment are up. For our global audience you really have a finger on the pulse of what is happening with consumer spending. Are you seeing any signs of stress? Is there a shift lower in any portion of some of that spending data that you have? Not yet. As you've seen from our results our growth is exceeding the growth of the GDPs in the markets in which we operate. And that is facilitated by a secular shift from cash to electronic payments which is why I said earlier that we're in a great industry. But also network has been in business for 25 years. Great set of capabilities. And I think our market leading capabilities are the other factor that are propelling our growth in our markets. Let's talk about growth. Obviously you last year I think you what did 42 billion dollars worth of total processing volume. The question that everybody wants to know is how interested are you in neopay the part of masher business? Are you genuinely looking at it as a possible acquisition? Can you just clear up this story for us? Because it would double the size of the company. Is that your ambition and are you interested? Okay so let's go back to capital markets day when we laid out our capital allocation strategy. Our focus our primary focus is on organic growth. And that's because we are doing business in very very attractive markets. The Middle East and Africa high growth markets. We also said that we would look at inorganic opportunities as and when they arose and we'd be very disciplined in analyzing these opportunities. You won't expect me to comment on that. But I mean that was the capital market day and the world has moved on. Are you interested in an acquisition at this level? So we said three things in terms of our our M&A or the opportunities that we would look at. We would look at in market consolidation. We would look at acceleration of growth in the new markets in which we are entering. And we would look at acquiring new capabilities in the payment space. So you would expect us to keep our eyes wide open as these opportunities arise. Are you open to doing multiple acquisitions or tie-ups? Let's say you are or you aren't talking to NEOs. You know that's one player. But is the strategy of such agility that you'd say you know what we do NEO and we do whatever else because that's what the note from city is saying is that the sector is ripe for consolidation. So maybe this is your chance to pose some leadership. So I couldn't agree more. The payment sector is a sector of consolidation. Payments as a scale business. Payments as a local business. So it would be natural that payment companies, especially readers in their space are focused on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4450,2022-10-19 04:47:46

Talk to us about the one thing that we've covered quite a lot of is massive ramp in property, massive influx of new level of workers in this city. Talk us through what's going on, perhaps with some of the ticket sizes in the business, with some of the actual structural transactions that are going on. Are they getting bigger as a result of population changes? What can you tell us about the underlying payments, nature and size and margin? Yeah, absolutely. So I think the economies that we do business in including, but not limited to the UAE, are bored by a series of structural changes that I think you've covered in your show over time and today. I think but not limited to the influx of people from, you know, from new parts of the world. And so population growth is good for us in our business. Inflation, coincidentally, is also good for us in our business because it increases the ticket sizes. What we're not seeing is a reduction in the number of transactions. So that could be a combination of, of course, the population growth, but also the secular shift from cash to payments and then inflation. And of course, the trickle down effect of a strong economy, bored by, for example, higher oil prices is contributing to the tailwinds in our business. I mean, we've checked a lot of boxes now with you on positives and things that are going in your direction for your business. But I don't believe any business exists that doesn't have its challenges and its risks. As the front lines of your company, what is the biggest risk right now as we look down a potential global recession? Sure. So I think for us as a company, focusing on opportunities on the right opportunities is something that we spend a lot of time on just because the number of opportunities as I outline is quite significant. Payments is also a technology business and technology. The advances in technology are quite rapid. And so we have to keep up. We have to keep pace with technology innovation to remain at the forefront of what we're doing. So do you want to buy a tech company? We are a tech company. I know your tech company. I don't want to make more acquisitions directly in tech and software and solutions. Is that where you would look to grow? So as we said, one of the pillars that we look at in terms of M&A is acquiring new technology capabilities. Absolutely. Does that extend into cryptocurrencies at all or into any crypto related technologies not cryptocurrencies per se? So our role is to help economies and businesses grow. And we believe accepting all stores of value is important to helping merchants grow their business. And if cryptocurrencies is properly regulated and is available in a market, we will provide cryptocurrency payment acceptance to our merchants. Hansen, you're not giving much away today now. What else have we thrown? Well, let's give it one more row to the dogs. Go for it. You're not going to answer me on Neo. But when you come back and hopefully this is a new series of conversations that we have, merchant solutions is 46% of the revenue in 2021. Issue solutions are 52%. It may well have changed in this morning's Q3 update. I think we are merchant is up 39%. Where will the business be over a period of time? Where do you see the biggest level of growth? Is it going to be an issuer or is it going to be an merchant because you've not got society? What's the big leg up? I'd say it would be in the acquiring business, the merchant solutions business, because as you rightly point out, we're very, very pleased that we've just received our acquiring license in both Egypt as well as Saudi Arabia. And those are markets that we've been eyeing for a while. We're ready to go. And these are attractive high growth markets. So if you were asking me to put the finger on the pulse, I'd say our merchant solutions would probably grow faster than our issuer solutions. That's real deal deal first. Sorry. That's real deal deal first. The time will tell. No, no, no. It's not keeping his cards close to his chest as you'd expect if you're doing a $42 billion worth of transactions of 2021. Maybe next time we'll get a bit of a closer look at some of the numbers, some of the other numbers and some of the guidance. Not done, Murr, the Annette Worker International CEO.

Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never. Saudi Arabia has issued five billion dollars in bonds in Sukuk and its first foray into international debt markets since last November. It's been a long time since the last year. So quite a bit of a shift in strategy. It seems to be about continuing its engagement with international debt markets. Saudi Arabia has made a lot of money on higher oil prices this year. But this is as you pointed out, the first foray in international debt markets since last November. Because of those oil revenues, Saudi Arabia needing to stay engaged in the market in the long term. It has lots of plans to keep building stuff ahead. And so yes, while we are retiring, potentially some near term debt, pushing out the duration, this gets it into play, gets it in the mind of international investors. I want to point out what we have seen in Saudi bonds recently, particularly looking at your 10 year debt. We have a GTV show. We have seen a particular run up in yields over the last couple of months, no sign from the Fed that that may be changing anytime soon. So maybe a desire to get in while we are still at these 5.2% yields before we see anything move even higher. And Abu Dhabi is going to say good to have you back. It will transfer the ownership of the state carrier Etihad to the sovereign wealth fund ADQ. Now what is the thinking behind that? Maybe what are the ramifications? Yeah, officially this part of a policy that Abu Dhabi has had to try and make itself a transport hub. ADQ already owns a lot of aviation assets. Is there Abu Dhabi, it's a majority stakeholder there. It actually purchased as well. Some of Etihad's operational assets last year. And then earlier this week, it did a transaction or made an offer for a transaction rather that would leave it with a 59% share in the publicly traded company. Abu Dhabi aviation, we've seen shares spike in the last couple of days on that. So important, the potential, the succession questions around Tony Douglas, the CEO of Etihad. There's been some significant speculation that he may go and try to lead a new Saudi carrier. Like he does leave, it would be helpful probably to have someone with this overall vision.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4452,2022-10-19 04:55:43

It would be helpful probably to have someone with this overall vision, some fun with this overall vision, being able to determine the future of it to had. And then, Nostra Ali, it has ended its recognition of Western Jerusalem as the Israeli capital. What's behind that? If our minister, Penny Wong, calling this decision a cynical play by the Morrison government, the previous government to win a bi-election, they described the conflict and distress that this had created in the international community. They hadn't actually physically moved the embassy from Tel Aviv. But this was, so this was mostly a rhetorical decision rather than one that actually has a huge impact on the ground. But this really underscores a lot of the international concern about the policies that Israel has had over the last couple of years in terms of trying to find a peace agreement with the Palestinians. This is something that is a core issue for Ya'yulah Pied and the upcoming elections. He essentially very critical of Abynia Mi'n Netanyahu, the previous prime minister for what he had done some of the hard-line policies that he had adopted over the past couple of years. Does this move the needle in the elections? That probably not the case, however. So, thank you very much for some of those updates that somewhat Fox Man at the Cardiff Financial Center in Doha from the realm of geopolitics that take you back to some of the corporate news. This one from one of the largest listed companies on the Dubai Index. This is the logistics heavyweight Aramex. They're announcing a deal. They're basically purchasing the e-commerce enabler platform, MyUS. Now, if you've used shop and chip service of Aramex, you would have used MyUS. So, this is a competitor and it comes at quite a significant ticket price here for approximately all cash at $265 million. The transaction marks Aramex's largest acquisition so far this year. And they are saying the press release that they've obtained all the necessary regulatory approvals and they've completed the acquisition. We'll see how the stock reacts at the open in about an hour's time. I take you from Aramex to equity futures in the United States where we're looking at the continuation of this pop back in stocks. I mean, over the last two trading sessions, the NASDAQ has been up almost 4% or 4.2% now looking to extend that by an additional percent. We're talking earlier to Martin Malone from Alpha Book and he was saying, yes, this does look like a bear market rally, but this could extend well into 2023 and largely depends on what kind of Fed communication we're going to get as we count down to the end of 2022. Looking out at US Treasury yields as well where we are so close to the highest level since 2008, US tens at 402.52. We're looking ahead to the beige book and some of the housing data laid in the day as well. Let's more coverage ahead. This is Bloomberg. Apple's the laying. It's next major iPad software update, iPadOS 16 by about a month from September to October.

16108," date, iPad OS 16 by about a month from September to October. Apple made the decision for a number of reasons, including a still buggy, stage manager multitasking interface, and an order to link the launch closer to the more similar Mac OS Ventura. Still, it's an unusual move. Since shifting the launches to the fall in 2011, Apple has released its new iPhone and iPad software updates simultaneously each year around September. By staggering the releases, users may find some issues around compatibility with cross-device features like retracting and editing messages in iMessage, the new shared iCloud Photo Library, and the new feature for transferring FaceTime calls between iPhones and iPads. It will also make it a bit harder for developers to launch apps that run on both the iPad and iPhone that require new APIs and features found across iPad OS 16 and iOS 16. Regardless, it was still of course the right move. Stage manager on iPad OS 16 is still quite buggy, I don't find it particularly intuitive, and it's not compatible with most iPads and many third party apps on the app store. The feature clearly needs some more polish, and complaints from consumers about stage manager will now no longer probably overshadow the earlier launch of the iPhone 14. This is a market that over the past few weeks has made it clear it wants to go higher. It got a little spooked by the idea that geoclid will potentially arise. This is Bloomberg Daybreak Europe. I'm Danny Burger in London with Managed Cranny in Dubai, and these are the stories that set your agenda. PMQs and QT, UK Prime Minister Liz Trust faces a crucial show, dying in the comments today amid a tussle at the top while the Bank of England proposed to start its delayed bond purchases. Netflix can chill, shows in the streaming giant, shoot up and late trade after posting a beat on subscribers. After nearly a year of disappointing results, Wall Street continues its rally and mid upbeat earnings season with European earnings. Getting into gear, SML hits the tape, Nestle follows shortly thereafter. And with that, I'm mine, Ms. Burger. Good morning. We have SML, which is of course Europe's largest semiconductor equipment maker, net sales 6.1 billion to 6.6 billion. This is the projection going forward. The estimate was 6.13. So quite a wide, but a new upper range, net sales in the food quarter expected to be 6.1 to 6.6. And the estimate was at 6.13. And of course 15% of their revenue comes from China. Danny, good morning. Good morning, Managed. Yet we are watching out for any commentary. They might say on those US new restrictions on exports to China. Gross margin also coming in Managed for the third quarter. It was a beat around 52%. The estimate had been for 49 and a half. However, for their look forward for the fourth quarter, gross margin, that is weaker than expected. 49% is what they say the estimate had been for 50.3. Managed recall that two of its key customers, TSMC and micron have cut spending. So that is a headwind for them. Of course, they've also told us there's a delayed revenue recognition going into 2023. We'll find out a little bit more on that. I mean, the essence of the chip angst is that Biden is expanding the curves on US tech selling into China. Those restrictions have everybody running for the exit. Number of big players are beginning to pull people out of China. But in the very first instance, it's about the fourth quarter, guidance, Danny. And that looks to have moved incrementally to the upside of 6.6 billion. What else have we got in the slate? Well, we have just so many earnings, Managed. And there are some of the companies that we're going to be watching out for.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4454,2022-10-19 05:04:34
16109," the upside of 6.6 billion. What else have we got in the slate? Well, we have just so many earnings, manness. And there are some of the companies that we're gonna be watching out for today. Let me take you through those. Shortly, we are expecting to have Nestle. It's the world's largest food maker. It's a key one to watch. Concerns about the consumer, economic turmoil, soaring inflation and the fallout from the Ukraine war. We're also gonna get mining companies, Antifagasta and real estate investment firm Kepler. And that comes as real estate is under pressure from slowing economies, manness. Okay, let's just take a quick snapshot of where we are on risk. We'll find out more from the Biden administration on what additional SPR they might release. The voices from OPEC coming out warning about the economic risks like this, the Hill Island, Missouri, and Secretary General Houthym, L.G.S. but of course oil up 910th of 1% cable studies itself at 113.22. The Bank of England will do QT. They just won't do it at the long end of the curve at 30-year paper. Using the United States of America pop higher, Kashkari makes it clear. Why would I pause? Why? Until I see sticky inflation stepping back. Why would I pause? And the dollar is flat at the moment. The bully in the schoolyard is still punching above its weight. Danny. Well, man, the good news for equities is that almost all hope is lost. That was the latest from the Bank of America survey. I know we're gonna get into that later in the show calling for full capitulation. Even city saying this morning that US stocks out of all assets are pricing in recession the most. So what do we have? We have a third consecutive day of gains for this S&P 500 future session. 2.8% is the gain we've seen so far to start this week in the cash session. We are seeing tech outperforming. Netflix, those earnings coming in extremely strong with the surge in subscribers. We're gonna be talking to Aggie about that in just a moment. You're up playing ball here as well. Up six, 10% of 1%. The region that isn't playing ball, however, Manus is Asia. That is still down three, 10% of 1%. So we've got quite a lot to get through today. And let's do it with our reporters from around the world. Lizzie, she's at Westminster for a crucial day for UK data and politics. Aggie Cantrell is gonna take us through those Netflix numbers, Manus. Steven Strasinski is on hand to talk about. Jules, as ever, is in Asia where there's a bit of a wobble going on but we'll get to that in just a moment. It's gonna be a huge day again in the UK. It's a huge day every day, isn't it? September CPI on the data front recording. That's gonna hit the tape in just under an hour's time. You've got the embattled Prime Minister, Liz Truss. She might speak in Parliament today. She's hoping to regain authority. Emma the fallout from her government's mini budget. You turn Lizzie is out and a bite today. So the Prime Minister needs to give a performance of a lifetime, really, at PM Hughes to pull it off because the polling says they want Boris back. Indeed, and unlike Boris Johnson, Manus, Liz Truss isn't known for her rhetorical flourish at the best of times. As you say on Monday, she even sent out her former leadership rival, Penny Morden, out to bat for her at the dispatch box. But today is likely to be an even more difficult day because the opposition leader, Keir Starmer, is likely to argue that she's lost all credibility having sacked her friend and chancellor, Quasi Quartang and his replacement Jeremy Hunt having undone pretty much all of her economic strategy. You can expect Starmer to focus in on what he has dubbed austerity 2.2 because Quartang's replacement Jeremy Hunt still has to find 40 billion pounds of tax razors or savings in order to plug the whole in the finances. So all government departments have been told to find savings of about 15%. The chancellor hasn't even committed to continuing the triple lock on pensions, which says that they'll rise with either the highest of earnings inflation or 2.5% very important for the Tory court. For our audience, he may even raid bank profits. So it's all a gift to Labour. As you say, Labour have the biggest poll lead over the Tories of any political party in 25 years at this point. And the chancellor's due to address the 1922 committee of Tory backbentures at 5pm. So if she doesn't give the performance of a lifetime could be curtains for his trust. So that's on the fiscal side of things, Lizzie. On the monetary side of things, the BOE after.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4455,2022-10-19 05:09:14
16110," form and silver lifetime could be curtains for his trust. So that's on the fiscal side of things, Lizzie. On the monetary side of things, the BLE after a lot of conflicting reports is going to be starting its delayed bond sales early next month. What sort of statement was it trying to give yesterday with this surprise announcement on QT? Yes, it is going to start the sales. It's going to do it a day later after the Chancellor's Halloween budget. But it's not going to be doing it at the long end, because of course this is where the difficulties arose the market turmoil after Quasicuarteng's mini budget. This is the Bank of England really making the point that it is focused on fighting inflation. It won't be a backstop for the government, but it is going to protect financial stability. I have to say, after winning the game of chicken with Quasicuarteng, Andrew Bailey seems to be putting a confident foot forward here. OK, Lizzie, thank you very much. Lizzie, burden there outside of where the action is happening. Man, as we were talking about ASMR to start the show and their earnings, we've got a quick line coming in on those new US rules and their impact. You take it away. Yeah, I mean, this comes down to the impact that shipments, the regulation we know from the Biden administration has got everybody hopping and itching, but the impact is going to be limited on 2023 shipments for ASMR from the US rules. And this is about their lithography products. It's going to be limited, but you've got US supplies. They're beginning to withdraw staff from one of China's leading chip companies. This is in the wake of the regulations. The Biden administration has angst over and wants to restrict the export of some types of chips that help in AI and they've got an un-barified list of companies, but this is the first instance, ASMR, the impact in 2023 shipments will be limited. Donnie, Netflix and chill. Netflix and yeah, super chill. It's shares have jumped and extended trading in the US after the streaming giants stemmed its subscriber loss in the third quarter. There were a lot of hit shows season four of Stranger Things. That helped it add 2.4 million members, that easily beating expectations. Let's get more from Bloomberg's Berlin-based tech reporter, Agi Cantro. Agi, is the worst over for Netflix? It seems like at least when it comes to the subscriber growth, that the worst is over for Netflix. After two quarters, consecutively of diminished subscribers, we've seen 2.4 million added this quarter alone and they're projecting for even more over Q4 that of course also incorporates the holiday period for Netflix, which is a key time for them when it comes to new content that they're putting out. And also, it's interesting to note now that Netflix itself is saying that it's going to be moving away from announcing these subscriber numbers and focusing more on revenue. And that might be part of a broader trend that also comes from them about to launch this ad option in 12 countries originally in November. And that they're trying to move towards not just focusing on growth, which has seen them have to buck a trend that they saw in the first half of this year, but also looking forward to potentially building their revenue going forward and looking at that as potentially more of a mature media business. Agi, good to have you with us. We'll see you a little bit later on. That's Agi Cantro. There are tech reporter in Berlin. Well done, first shout out for Agi. She's on the show in her new role. She's gone to print. She couldn't take TV any longer. Let's talk about President Biden. He set the top end to the additional oil supplies from the strategic reserves. The effort is to ease the gasoline prices. So let's get more with Stephen Stuchinski, our energy reporter in Singapore. Is there a political move? Excuse the pun and the question. Stephen. I mean, it's hard to say it's not a political move. Is it a political move in response to OPEC plus cutting output by two million barrels a day, a large decrease, a largest decrease since 2020, or is it a political move to shore up support before the election? If you're able to bring down oil prices, that also brings down gasoline prices, and people care about what they pay at the pump. And if prices are trending more towards that $4,000,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4456,2022-10-19 05:13:25
16111," If you're able to bring down oil prices, it also brings down gasoline prices and people care about what they pay at the pump. And if prices are trending more towards that $4 level in the U.S. for gasoline, that's going to be a problem when they vote next month. So the Biden administration is sort of likely combating this on both sides, not just at home and abroad, but it's challenging because when OPEC plus is eager to rebalance the market when they're looking at potentially a recession already starting and reducing demand for oil, they already did the two million barrels they cut. Could they cut more in response to this SPR release and what Biden said a future release potentially in January? There are a lot of moving parts and it could be a long political game between all of these nations. Okay, Stephen, thank you very much. We'll also see you later in this show. Stephen Subchinsky there, our energy reporter in Singapore. Let's now check in on the Asia markets, get back to Singapore with that. It's really at Sally, hi, Jules. Hey, Danny, you were particularly watching Hong Kong assets today because we had the first policy speech from Chief Executive, John Lee. You can see Hong Kong investors haven't reacted very well to that. We're down by about 1.3%. Interestingly, they're trying to lure expats foreign workers as well. They've announced a two-year visa for those earning around $320,000. US dollars Singapore about six weeks ago announced a five-year for those earning about $250,000. So certainly the talent war continues. They did announce an easing of stamp duty for non-permanent residents, but you have actually sent a bit of a tick down coming through in the Hanksang Property Index in late trade. And of course, we're still on party congress. Watch in China, COVID cases in Beijing, a four-month high, certainly a bit of nervousness there too. And watching movement in the yields, particularly in New Zealand, the two-year-up, some 12 basis points as well after that hot inflation print yesterday. Let's put the board because as always, Manus, we are on intervention watching. There has been a couple of big spikes coming through in Dolly Yen. There's the music behind me. We are very much waiting to see whether or not there has been some stealth intervention. But you can see these big moves where there is speculation perhaps there has. Once again, the finance minister Suzuki is saying he's increasing the monitoring of FX moves. He heard from Governor Corota in Parliament saying, not surprisingly, this one-sided week momentum in the Yen is bad for Japan's economy. So nearing that 150, that 32-year-low, Manus. Yeah, and that thumping dollar. Do you like your theme tune? What theme tune do you want? Jules, I'll sing it again. I didn't love that one. I think you need to work on that. You didn't like that. Something more joyful. OK, there you go. No. That's the end. That's Jules. OK, I'll check in with you before we sing it on there. Jules, Sally and Singapore. I'll speak to my other co-host. She's friendly. Coming up on the show with Danny and myself. We've got the big hitters of the European earning slate there, do you? Nestle hits the tape in just a few moments. How much did you pay for your sparkling water, your haggen does, those treasures of life? Did you pay up? This is Blaine Bag. Deep is crucially important. And I think we've moved from this attitude, from its indulgence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s, and so it makes that a really exciting field, because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harness to further expand our understanding.

16112," further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harness to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts. But if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what you bring to use out while you're sleeping. Everything you need to get set for the start of U.S. trading. Bloomberg the open with Jonathan Terrell. Drilling down in the numbers and preparing you as only Bloomberg can weekdays on Bloomberg.qué.org is a range of seven to eight percent. So will be at that eight percent. But man is to be clear estimates were for something higher that estimate had been for eight point three percent. The other important thing to note here is Nestle like everyone else in this world facing high costs of raw materials. However, they are still keeping their margin estimates operating margin. They say will be around 17% percent. It's all about raw materials and it is all about consumer strength, man. It is on the other side of that coin to the input side that you're seeing is that the pricing on the output side, your Hagen does, your various products, the kick-cats that you see in on your screen at the moment, is of course prices, prices at seven and a half percent for the nine months. The estimate was 7.1 percent. And again, that's the inflation reimpact coming through in the top line on pricing. But of course, the questions, Annie, they can go to who? There again. There you go. By the way, it's the biggest price rise in decades, eight and a half percent on the gross side, but it's the biggest price rise in decades. So that just gives you a sense. Okay, Mark Schneider is going to be with the team a little bit later on. He can answer those questions on how enduring his inflation. There's this food giant. It's an exclusive. It's nine thirty this morning. London time. Danny. Yeah, Manus, I actually literally didn't hear what you said. Hence, hence, my confusing answer. But, you know, it's just, it's just, it's just me and my lack of hearing anyway, Manus. Let's dig deep up. You want to be great for that? Yeah, maybe then I'd hear everything you said if you just saying it to me, Manus. All right, well to save us both and to get a break from day break karaoke. Let's get to our guest is Randi Pso Malphan manager at MNG Investments, Randi, joining us in the thick of this earning season so far feels like this consumer is holding up. We saw it in US bank earnings, Nestle, they're doing okay. We also saw it in Netflix earnings as well. What's your takeaway of the consumer, is that you're going to be looking at the earnings season? Across the board, the consumer is doing fantastic. You look at your nighted airlines, be it British Airways parent IAIG last week. The consumer is not yet feeling the cost of living crunch or the interest rate increases that we've seen across the board in developed markets this year. I think there's going to be a lag, but so far the company results, no matter which industry you look at so far, so good. Also on the positive side of the market, the consumer is looking at the cost of living crunch or the interest rate is increasing, other than obtaining people, all other supply channels seem to be clearing pretty quickly again, a bit positive. Good to see you this morning, Randi. I want to get your sense of perspective. City have a big note out this morning, they're saying, look, the one asset class, which is discontent at recession, but perhaps not fully is US equities, down 22%. We're going to get to the top of the market, but we're going to be looking at the top of the market, on the side since 2000 and one, but they're talking about capitulation. When you hear that kind of narrative cash, at the highest levels in 21 years, and an equity market, which is dying 22%. Those extremes, are they capitulatory extremes to you on the binomial? Well, they are",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4458,2022-10-19 05:22:56
16113," dreams to you on the binomial? Well, they are in a respect, like you say, equities at the highest lowest level, cash at the highest level. There's also a lot of cash out blows that we're seeing from European equities at the moment, just in anticipation of, potentially, bad, the energy crisis is going to get this winter. While things look bad at the moment, I think the anticipation is that we haven't seen the full effect of both the Fed, the Bank of England and the ECV, which has only just begun, increasing their interest rates. As that continues, there has to be an impact on the economy, otherwise inflation stays pretty much where it is, and we're likely to see even higher interest rate increases. So while, you know, while it sounds like it looks like a speculation, I think the point more is that we probably haven't seen the bottom yet. Company earnings do not yet reflect the wider macroeconomic expectations that we're likely to see. And that isn't likely to dissipate until probably Q1, early Q2 of next year, once we've got through what is likely to be quite a rough winter. And as your guest stated earlier, we're likely to also see at least one branch of the US government change, IE the House of Representatives, come November the 8th. All of that is, you know, concerns at the market is seeing. So, okay, a lot of uncertainty, Ranty, when do you know then that it's time to step in and go long? That's the most difficult question out there. I think what you look at is on a case by case basis, broad stocks by far have been impacted. The mods, you know, have seen elevated valuations really come back, but it's happened across the board, not just in certain areas. For example, Intel, IPO and mobile IE, and they're IPO and the same price they paid back in 2017. Google have seen their, well, Google's parent alphabet have seen their market cap, 430% is a unique business model, churning out 65 billion of cash per year. Yes, it's likely to see a drop in advertising revenue, but no one's expecting it to stay there. It all matters on your time horizon. Ranty, we've seen a reprieve in UK, as I say, on the currency side and on the guilt market. Q2 is coming, maybe not at the longer end of the curve. My question to you is, and it's a question of the day for Bloomberg, which is, will 10% inflation, which we expect today, break the guilt market again, because the assumption is 100 basis point height from the Bank of England next month. Are we ready for 100 basis point height from the Bank of England next month? I mean, the swap market has priced it in. That's not everything, though, is it? I mean, the positive that we had sterling is up, like you say, the two, the five, the ten-year guilt yields on that down, in some cases more than a percent. The UK market has started to calm down. There is a bit more confidence now with a new chancellor, Jeremy Hunt. 1% will be huge, but it would only be needed to where the Fed fund rate is, and that's likely to increase at the next meeting, as well, the ECB potentially talking about 75 basis point to 1% as well. With inflation at these levels, it's likely to come. But again, and then this is the point I mentioned earlier, this disconnect that we're currently seeing between residential companies results, versus where we think the macro-economy is trending later this year, around the beginning of Q1.

16115," I've always been a person who's just been attracted to hair. I like to sit and think and theorize how I can manifest these visions that I have for braiding and how I can take something that may seem like it's a line drawing in my mind and apply that to someone's scalp. We are the only culture that has hair that grows out of our head the way that it does. Anyone from the African diaspora is born with this amazingly curly hair that can be shaped into a variety of different ways of expression. I want black people to love themselves for how they naturally appear and also to appreciate the cultural practice of such as braiding that our ancestors have practiced for centuries. This is really a reminder isn't it just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see some pressure in the U.A. and we did see some pressure in the future.

Let's see. That's my best attempt to reach the wrong one. Maybe next. It's coming. There you go. There you go. This is the risk reversals. They're pairing their short bets on the point by the fastest pace since 2016 and that says to me this goes back to what Middish Parikh said to us from Sean felt it's so hard to be short the sharp ratios have moved so aggressive the whole world was short there was such a demonstrative short position and that's with the virulence of the turn around in the skew car in these movements come where the calls are favored by the most since 2016.

Well, President Biden is set to tap the additional. Oil supplies from the strategic reserves in an effort to ease the high gas line, prices gasoline, not gas line. Steven Stuchinski is all over the story. He's our energy reporter in Singapore, Stephen. This is not just the final release of the initial flurry from the SPR, but we're getting ready to hear the size and the scale of the next release. Yeah, you know, I think that's the big message. Well, we are finishing up with a last 15 million tons, about million barrels in December, which is what was expected. He did say that they are going to look to release more going into January, especially if oil prices don't fall. What possibly could go wrong, this is something that he is trying to do to try to curb or at least add some sort of downward pressure to oil prices, especially ahead of the elections in November. You know, the Democratic Party is going into a really difficult midterm election season. Gasling prices are a hot topic, and he's running out of ways to reduce oil prices. You know, you have this chart on the screen of the US strategic petroleum reserves lowest level in decades. If he's going to release more in January, that puts the risk. When do you refill it? He said he would refill it if prices hit 67 to 72 dollars per barrel, but if you have to refill it at a higher level, that just adds more pressure to the government and could potentially increase prices if it's a huge buying flurry. So that is a challenge that they're going to have to temper, but right now, it really seems that politics are in play for the Biden administration. Yeah, I mean, it's all about politics at this point, and there's been a lot of commentary on this cut in the politics behind it. Stephen, speaking of which, I mean, we've had OPEC plus nations commenting on the output cut. What have we heard from them? Right. So OPEC plus surprised the market a few weeks back, and they said they were going to reduce output by two million barrels a day, the largest cut since 2020. At the time, they said that's because of the view that the turmoil in the economy, there could be economic slowdown, a recession, maybe is already happening, and because of that, that's going to reduce oil demand. And what we've seen over the last few weeks, and just recently, this week, is these officials repeating that. Now, the US accuses them of this being a political sort of game between the US, Russia, and Saudi Arabia, especially as countries kind of fight back against Russia over the invasion of Ukraine and their view that they don't want to import Russian oil. Now, OPEC plus says this is not political, this is not to hit the Biden administration anyway or affect them before the midterm election. This is purely just looking at where we are in the OPEC plus officials continue to say, look, it looks like we're in a recession right now, perhaps, and demand is going to fall. We're trying to get ahead of this. We don't want there to be some sort of oil crisis later. We want to get ahead of this now, reduce prices, and stabilize the market. And they could do more potentially in the future. So that's one more thing to think about. As the Biden administration looks to keep prices lower, OPEC plus could make moves at that increased prices. It's also a geopolitical sort of a malstorm in the making as well. It certainly is. There's a lot of rhetoric flying backwards and forwards and press releases, aren't there? Stephen, thank you very much. Stephen Staczynski, Oblomberg, energy reporter in Singapore. Let's get context. I'm ready to send. Founder Director of Research at Energy Aspects, Ms. San, good morning to you. So, here we go. What size of an S, what size of an additional SPR release are you expecting? The timescale and I'm ready to, is it just political to get through the midterms for Biden? Well, I'd say that look, we are going to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4462,2022-10-19 05:39:29
16117," And, Amrita, is it just political to get through the midterms for Biden? Well, I'd say that look, we are going to see continuous threats of more. Like he's expected to announce right now, the latest round is only 15 million barrels, which just completes the 180. Beyond that, there are a couple of options, including the legislative 26 million barrels that's due for this fiscal year anyways. We've heard murmurings that that's what's going to get released over December January or perhaps into January and February. That's definitely an option. And then of course, there is the possibility and we know that they've been considering a much larger volume, potentially up to 100 million barrels, but with a very specific buyback clause. But again, given how low the SPR already is, releasing that volume is going to really put the overall kind of context of drawing down an SPR at a time when energy security is at the center of government worries. It's going to become a real kind of focus. And ahead of the midterms, I'm not sure the administration necessarily wants that because right now, with the 15 million barrels to be released in December, the US SPR will go below 400 million barrels. What is the risk scenario when it does go below 400 barrels? What is the thing that they need to avoid by releasing too much? Well, you do have the IEA regulations or stipulation, I should say, that OECD countries should have 90 days of import cover as strategic reserves, which effectively amounts to around 220 million barrels because the US has turned around from a big, big net importer in the past few decades ago. And then right now, it exports a lot of products. So you can net those numbers off, but it's still 220 million barrels. But remember, the US already has over 100 million barrels of SPR coming out due to legislative clauses that they've signed a legislative act of bipartisan acts from between 2017 and 2027. So you need to net that off as well. So we are already once you deduct that in the 200s and that really puts us very close to that IEA number. Not saying they can't go below that, of course they can, but again, operationally things are going to get more challenging. And again, I bring back energy security. Do we really want to defeat the SPR? By the way, we haven't even had a proper energy supply out yet. And the emphasis is on the word yet. We've got sanctions, we've got a price cap, we've got a number of things to break into and read a very briefly. Let's get through a little bit more. We know things are strained between the House of Sard and the House of Biden. How fractured is the US-SID relationship? And have we passed a point where I mean, just how wounded or fractured is that relationship as you view it right now? Of course, right now, the relationship is in particularly strong given the war of words we've seen, but particularly from, I would say, the White House, given how they have taken the OPEC last decision. Now, having said that, I have heard a lot of people talk about how this relationship is beyond repair. I don't believe that both sides have been through their ups and downs. The fair share of that in the past couple of years and even decades. The relationship between the two countries goes beyond oil. Defense is a very big part of it and just being a very important ally in the Middle East for the US. So there will be ups and downs for sure, but I do think the relationship will recover from where it is today. Does that mean no PEC legislation, the chances of batter pretty low, Amrita? We think the chances are pretty low, especially getting it done ahead of the midterm. And if it doesn't get done ahead of the midterm, then you're pretty much starting from scratch in January and it might lose momentum anyway. So again, there are a few options for the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4463,2022-10-19 05:43:39
16118," doesn't get down ahead of the midterm, then you're pretty much starting from scratch in January and it might lose momentum anyway. So again, there are a few options for the US, right? Like, yes, there is the possibility of no plan. There's also been talks about reducing arms sales, but that's kind of on the political side. On the oil side, it's really the focus on the SPR. And like I said, yes, there are rumors about a lot of big numbers, but I really think it is going to be a smaller number that ultimately gets released because of what the constraints are about running down the SPR continues. I'm Rita, we're still trying to understand what the price cap will be from Europe. Alexander Novak made it very clear to me that it would mean a reduction in production for Russia in the very near term on a price cap. Extrapulate for me and for the market this morning, your best estimate of impact of price cap and the flow of crude. Does it just go into bunkers? Does it just go in offshore? Where does that Russian oil go to when it's got new sanctions in deck and the price cap? In terms of the price cap, let's be very clear. If it's just the G7 price cap, it actually doesn't have an impact on our balances. Simply because the G7, which is the EU for instance, the US, they have already or are going to be banning imports of Russian oil anyways. The price cap only has a material impact on our balances. Should China, India, Turkey, the three biggest buyers of Russian oil agree, as of right now, there's no indication whatsoever that they will agree. So based on that, no change whatsoever to what we have been expecting. The EU embargo, of course, on the 5th of December, it's very important because around that time, the EU has to stop importing anywhere between one to one and a half million barrels per day of waterborne Russian oil. That oil will find its way into tankers and sail much longer. Rather than three to four days, we'll now have to ship anywhere between 30 to 50 days to find new homes and then ballast back. That is where it's going to get trickier, especially this is where it's tied to the price cap. That if shipers and say Greek ship owners, for instance, and others as well, but the Greece being the biggest one over here, decides no, it's too risky for us to ship Russian oil. You will lose some shipping. Him, even then, of course, you're going to tie up more oil. Given all these risks we've been discussing, really quickly here, we've got about 30 seconds left. What is your near-term view on where oil prices go? What level are you looking at? I think it's going to remain under pressure in the near-term because remember, we put the French stripes going on. So that's putting some downward pressure on crude and China still got lockdowns. But into December, still firmly believe that we are going to do headed well above $100. OK, above $100. Go, she's going to be a good check. We're going to have to end it there. Yeah, impressive stuff, as always. Both calls and you do it just in the nick of time. And Rita sent their founder and director of research rather at Energy Aspects. Now coming up, we're going to talk more UK with Prime Minister Liz Trusses due to face Parliament. As she seeks to rescue her failing premiership and get more on that, and September's imminent UK CPI reading. This is Bloomberg.ーム In the past two decades, China has built large infrastructure projects in almost every country in Africa. African governments themselves said we are tired of aid and charity. We want to do trade, we want to be treated like partners. The Chinese came along and said, great! We don't do aid in charity, we want to do business with you. Global gateway will mobilize 300 billion euros till 2027. Now the US and Europe are answering back with their own infrastructure initiatives to counter China. And whether in China, America, please把 aid to create an integrated social institution",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4464,2022-10-19 05:48:21
16119," 300 billion euros till 2027. Now the US and Europe are answering back with their own infrastructure initiatives to counter China. But African experts are skeptical. China has been that guy around the corner with, you know, a bouquet of flowers to Africa, the US, you know, Europe and the UK, of time and time again, say, be careful of the flowers you see out of the window. They have funds on them. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. Let's just be honest. We had sort of a shift in, are we in some sort of circulation fears? Moment, people were talking about that all day yesterday. It's a big day for the UK today. We have September CPI reading that's due at 7 a.m. London time and in battle prime minister Liz Truss is due in parliament where she's hoping to regain authority amid the fallout over her government's mini budget. You turn for more on this. Let's get to Bloomberg's Lizzie Burton, who's outside at Westminster. Lizzie, the prime minister, look, she needs surely to give the performance of her life at today's PMQs. Can she pull it off? Well, Danny, the question that MPs were asking penny-modant on Monday when she was sent to the prime minister at the dispatch box was, what is the point of Liz Truss? Now that she's got rid of her chancellor and most of her economic strategy has been obliterated, that's the question that they can ask to her face today. The attack line that the opposition Labour leader, Kierstarm, is likely to go on with, is austerity 2.2 because the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, has reportedly asked all government departments, bar health and defence, to shave 15% off their budgets because, of course, despite taking a wrecking ball to trust dynamics, he still has to find £40 billion worth of savings. He hasn't even committed to protecting pensions and pensioners, of course, such an important constituency for the party. He may also raid bank profits, which is important for our audience, of course. Absolutely, I mean, between a special taxation, let's say, on oil companies and then the banks, it's going to be a double-pronged attack. Of course, it's Sunak on steroids, was our guest the other day in terms of what we could get from this chancellor. The Bank of England, they've delayed the sales of bonds until the start of next month, but of course, they're not going to brutalise the long end of the market. The 30-year government bond where they had all the disruption in the yield curve. A surprise statement on QT? Well, let me translate what the Bank of England's getting at here, because not everyone's always been so happy with BOE comms in history. They're trying to say that they will fight, prioritise fighting inflation. They're not going to be the backstop for the government forever, but they're also going to keep a watchful eye on financial stability. It's undue-bailing, bailey putting a confident foot forward. And perhaps he deserves to, because you can also see that the LDI funds, which were at the heart of all this market turmoil after the mini-budget from Quasicuarting and Liz Trust, do seem to have fortified themselves. So the Bank saying that it will get on with QT, but it's just going to leave the long end for now, at least. Lizzie, thank you very much, Lizzie, and Ben, joining us from just outside the palace of Westminster.

16120," at the top of the eye, just under 10 minutes. John Steppick is with us. He is Bloomberg's UK team analyzing the data and the economics front. So here we go. Double digit inflation on the headline and the core. That's what we're expecting, John. What does it mean for consumers? Well, good morning. I mean, it's pretty good. For consumers, it's the straightforward thing. So unfortunately, I mean, so we're looking at inflation hitting 10%. And that's when CPI and over 12% on RPI, the kind of the olden days measure. And obviously with wages rising in the region of about 5 and a half percent or so, that means the real wages are going to continue to be squeezed. And that means the consumers are going to continue to feel the pain. And obviously, the political havoc in the last kind of like one-thousand so has made that much worse. Mortgage rates have jumped. The new chancellor has decided to roll back a number of the consumer support measures, including on energy prices from April next year. And so basically, individuals, kind of the person in the street, looking at a continued squeeze on their living standards. Which is going to be really hard to cope with. And there's no one, there's no one's coming to fail them out because as Lizzie was just in the bank at England, there's trying to emphasize that it's full concern on inflation. And chances are, we'll probably get a 1%-page point rise in the bank of England based rate when it meets in November. Right. OK, John, thank you very much. Of course, you over at the wealth team there in the UK, concentrating on how this affects the consumer important stuff. John's topic there from our Bloomberg UK team. Now, coming up, Netflix returns to growth as Hollywood breathes a sigh of relief that the worst might be over for the streaming giant. Does really kind of tell you what? We'll have more on it in a moment. This is Bloomberg. It is crucially important. And I think we've moved from this attitude, from its indulgence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s. And so it makes that a really exciting field, because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harnessed to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize. That makes you smart. If you can spit back a lot of facts. But if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what you bring, figures out why you're sleeping. The Netflix don't jump in extended trade. And that's an understatement was 14% higher.

16121," It's in Q3, season 4, stranger things. Halt at 2.4 million members. Beading expectations to say that these Bloomberg's Berlin-based tech reporter, Aggie Cantrell, is a Aggie, you're in danger now. A fight, Manette Flex notes. It's dangerous ground you're on. But a great set of numbers for Netflix is the worst behind them. When it comes to that subscriber growth, it does seem that the worst behind them. Those were two quarters that were very painful for Netflix going into the first half of this year. We had Q1 and Q2 with lower subscriber numbers. But then they seemed to have bumped that trend. But also this is also something that's worth pointing out that their subscribers are growing and they're forecasting even more subscribers, 4.5 million for Q4 around that crucial period over the Christmas period for new subscriber growth. But what's also interesting to see is that potentially this is something that they're moving away from focusing on in future earnings reports. They're going to be focusing more on revenue and less on subscriber growth now that they can prove to their investors that they are still growing. Something that I found very interesting in the report as well, though, is what the dollar strength means for their markets abroad. Like for instance, in Asia, in the Asia Pacific region, while they may have been able to increase their subscribers, the average revenue per subscriber is lower, which essentially means that people are worried about the squeeze on their income and are potentially opting for cheaper options of the Netflix package. Okay, Aguim, I'm going to give you a really hard task. You've got 30 seconds here. What are we expecting from Tesla later? Good luck. The three crucial things from Tesla are essentially the demand, there's a concern over demand, there's also a concern over deliveries. And also the other big question is whether or not Musk is going to sell any more of his Tesla stock going into the potential effort for him to buy Twitter. And that might close next week. Okay. Man. What a pro. That's certainly under pressure from its record high, isn't it? You did well, 30 seconds. Rock and roll, Aguim, on the tech beat in Berlin, Danny, we'll hand it over to the Bloomberg markets, Europe team. Wow, what a sunrise in London. Beautiful. Let's go. Okay.üyorum… I went back and looked at very few secretaries of state in the last 100 years, or maybe ever, have barely gone back into government. So why did you want to come back in the government for any issue when you've got eight grandchildren, you've got two daughters, you've got wonderful family. Why did you want to come back in and go through this terrible process we have in Washington of getting things through consensus and getting people to agree to what you want to do? Because I want those grandchildren to have a future. It's very simple. We're not in a good track right now. The world is not serious enough about reducing our emissions fast enough, David.

Most of the emissions that are going up nowadays into the atmosphere and are creating this increased level of energy that comes from the ocean, goes into the storms, the floods, the rain, all of it is explainable and it's all linked to the changes we are creating on the planet. So it's very simple. I wanted to come in because I think we have a real chance now to make something happen and I think Glasgow was a major step forward in the effort to do that.

Plus Wall Street continues its rally and made upbeat corporate results as European earnings kick it up a year. Welcome to Bloomberg Market's Euro-PiMana Edwits Life in London. Good morning. It seems like U.S. stocks are attempting to continue this bear market rally. We just got the CPI numbers. The year on year figure was expected to come in at 10%. We were expecting to go back over into double digits. We got a little higher than that. 10.1%. A slight surprise higher than expected on inflation and higher than the prior reading, which was 9.9%. There's a lot more uncertainty as to whether where we are on when we peak on UK inflation. A lot of people have been talking about October for a long time. Given that's when energy prices will experience some sort of re-rating. And then there's uncertainty after April next year. Your thoughts on what we're seeing here on inflation? This is a hot number. When you look across the board, we've beaten on the month of month, we've beaten on the year and year. And I think importantly, we're getting that the PPI is also beaten quite substantially. And we've only got the revisions through so far on the PPI, but all those higher as well. So pretty much across the board, this is a very, very hot number. And emphasizes that the fundamental problems of the UK have not gone away. Yes, Jeremy Hunt's appointment has restored credibility. The immediate panic has been resolved. But the fact is, this is a country with a really bad economic outlook, deeply negative real yields, made even worse today, and a current account deficit. And that will only be resolved by a much weaker currency or else yields need to go much higher and putting a much deeper recession. Okay, today we're getting a slightly weaker currency. So answer your call there, Mark. We are seeing a little bit of weakness coming through in the pound. It was fairly flat ahead of this number now down, just a tenth of a percent though, at 1.305. So the market may be taking a little time to establish what is happening there and what is the impact, the re-tree, into the Bank of England story. We'll get more on that shortly. Now we're just under an hour away from the cash share equities trading session for Europe. And so let's look at futures and where we are. Futures look fairly positive, nothing too substantial, but certainly positive. We were positive in Europe yesterday. The US was stronger than than here though. And so perhaps we play a little bit of catch up. And the US futures picture also looks pretty positive. Half a percent on Eminis. Now that features up 7.10s of a percent. And interesting to see.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4468,2022-10-19 06:05:18
16123," than here though and so perhaps we play a little bit of catch up. And the US futures picture also looks pretty positive. Half a percent on the Eminis, now that features up 7 cents of a percent. And interesting to see them that we do have the earnings story. So, so front and center and in focus. But broadly, things feel a little quieter, dangerous last words I know. What do you see on the GMM mark? Well, as I said to you, Anas, since I returned from holiday, it seemed like quite peaceful markets. And I don't know what you guys were all being so dramatic about over the last couple of weeks. But look into GMM today. I attempted, and it was my own folly, after months and months have been quite bearish Asian FX. And as you probably know, being probably the most bearish Yen person in the world that's fed into a broader, more bearish UNHFX, today I've tried to convince myself to get bullish. And certainly in the immediate term, it's not working across the board. We are seeing a little bit more weakness. We are seeing dollar strength. That wasn't there this morning. It is led by China negativity. Notice the UN is the top there in the weakness in the FX column. Also the top for losses in stocks. I think we're starting to trade this disappointment out of the party congress, that there wasn't something transformational. I don't know why people were betting on COVID-0 being lifted, but that was the bet that was there in the market. I think we're unwinding some of that. I'm also turning a bit more positive in Korean. That's the one that's going wrong. So I think my short term calls aren't working great today. Generally, otherwise, we are seeing yields drift a little bit higher. And I think it's interesting the two-year yields to go up in the US. And US futures are still strong. And I think that we're starting to trade the US narrative around the idea that the economy is still strong. Yes, they're going to have hikes. They can cope with what's priced. I think the pay will really come for stocks later in the year, or maybe even next year, when we realize that rates are going to have to go even higher than they're priced. Otherwise, in commodities, it's pretty much a mixed picture. OK, right, Mark. Let's talk about the markets in three minutes. And we'll pick up where you left off just there in terms of the stocks over in the United States. Yesterday, I saw an interesting piece, Bank of America, that's got a lot of play doing their usual survey of investors. And that returned a conclusion for them that this was a market that screams capitulation. Doesn't sound from what you just said as if you would agree with that analysis. It's actually interesting. I saw that the headlines we've got are the Bank of America report saying, complete negativity, cash levels high. One of the other parts in the report, if you went through the details, was actually the fact that we're not seeing major outflows from stocks. So yes, there has been a decline in kind of holdings there. There's upward ratio of kind of cash holdings. We're not seeing this major kind of outflows that you normally get when real capitulation. So even Bank of America themselves said, hey, it looks like we've got a bit of a short term capitulation. We can get a bear market rally. But they said they think the big low in this cycle comes in 2023. And I hate agreeing with people, but I'm 100% aligned with Bank of America here. I believe in a bear market relief rally over the next couple of months. I think we've got appropriate amount of pricing in the rates that front and front air. I think the real negativity comes next year when they realize that, hey, the US economy justifies even more rate heights than a price. The inflation problem is even more persistent. And that becomes even more negative for equities next year. And it's next year that earnings will get hurt when consumers stop spending. So I'm with Bank of America. Short term sure, a tactical capitulation. We can see a tactical rally. We've already seen one quite powerful this week's. Continue a bit more. But over the next nine months, we're going to see much lower US stocks again. OK, I just want to return to the subject so for the UK and the pound mark because as we've been talking, the pound has been weakening. And it says something. I'm taking some time to catch up on Pantyke because I was looking for on a hot inflation print, maybe the pound will go higher. Expectations that the Bank of England does hike more. But of course, that's not a story that we should maybe attach or a link we should attach to the pound. Said that that link between central bank policy and the currency has broken down in recent months, something we've talked about before. And so the market is selling the pound, seeming what to focus on, a weaker outlook picture, a growth picture from here. Yeah, well, it's just this. It's really difficult kind of trifecta. This idea that, hey, look, we've got this current account deficit and we've got deeply negative yields. How do we fund that current account deficit? Well, we have to offer attractive yields. So that means yields need to go much higher. But if yields go much higher in an economy and recession, that's just going to send it into a deep, deep depression. So maybe if we can't get yields higher, and that means the only out there for the stress is currency weaker. In reality, how does this play out? I think we go back and forth in waves of major currency weakness, waves of yields higher. But ultimately, it needs a correction lower in the fixed income UK assets. It does not feature destox. Remember, the FTSE gets a lot of its revenues globally as the sterling weekends. It can benefit the FTSE that's already weakened a long way. So I think there's an argument that's more.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4469,2022-10-19 06:10:10
16124," UK assets. It does not feature destox. Remember the FTSE gets a lot of its revenues globally as the sterling weekends, it can benefit the FTSE that's already weakened a long way. So I think there's an argument that's more bullish on FTSE, even as you can be very negative on guilt and pound over the next year. OK, I'm very briefly Mark, why are you seeing more opportunity in Asia FX right now? The core part of this story here is that commodities have pulled back a long way over the last two months. And I think particularly energy prices and many of the big economies here are major commodity importers, whether you take China, India, Korea, Japan, these are all massive commodity importers. So I think there's a real pessimistic story and it's valid. I just think that it's fully priced. A people may have not realized how much commodities come down, so we might get a bit of a relief partly, not a change in trend. OK, thanks for that. Thanks to Mark for thought so far.

The Biden administration plans to release 15 million barrels of oil from US emergency reserves. Officials tell us it may also consider significantly more this winter in an effort to ease high prices. President Biden will announce the plan later today. It comes amid rising costs at the pump after OPEC pluses decision to slash production. In the UK, Prime Minister Liz Truss faces a rebellion in her own party if she's forced to abandon the so-called triple lock on state pensions. That's the commitment that they're right in line with the highest of inflation, wages or 2.5%. The uncertainty comes as government departments are being told to find savings of up to 15% of their budgets, effectively a return to austerity. The federal reserve can't pause hikes if inflation is still rising, and if the benchmark rates hit 4.5%. That's according to Minneapolis-fed president Neil Cascari. He says, core inflation is the stickiest of all and it keeps climbing. The central bank keeps getting surprised on the upside. Investors currently see a peak of around 4.9% next year.

Welcome back to the market, Europe. We still have 45 more than 45 minutes to go until the start of cash equity trading. The future picture points a little bit higher. The focus seems to be increasingly turning to the earnings picture. Let's get back to the macro though. It's a big day for the UK today, the September CPI print coming in slightly hotter than expected and back in double digits, 10.1%. The Embattled Prime Minister Liz Trass is also due in Parliament today, where she is hoping to regain authority amid the fallout over her government's mini budget's U-turn. For more, we join by Ben Begzlizzi-Berdin, who is in Westminster once again. Lizzi, what's the reaction then? What's your reaction to the inflation figures? We've just been watching the pound sell off a little on the back of these. We're into double digit inflation in September. Credit where it's due, Bloomberg economics saw it, the consensus didn't quite, but it was fueled by few food price growth. So this is something that everybody has to pay for, but disproportionately poorer households have to pay more for it. It'll hurt them the most. Remember, though, this isn't the peak. The peak's expected to come in October, but it's likely to go down after that, of course, because of the help from the government in terms of people's energy bills. What it means for the Bank of England, it was a choice between a hundred basis points and 75 basis points at this meeting. Expectations had gone down because of quasi-quart ends replacement with Jeremy Hunt, perhaps. The fact that we're in double digits will tempt some members of the Monetary Policy Committee to go for a hundred. But the other thing that we've learned from the Bank of England, of course, is that they are going to get on with quantitative tightening after the Halloween budget. It's really a message from the Bank of England to show that it is focused on inflation fighting. It won't be the government's backstop forever, but it is there to protect financial stability if necessary. Lizzie, good morning. That's on the data side. We also have Prime Minister's questions today. The Prime Minister surely needs to give the performance of her life. Can she put it off? I hope you've got your popcorn, Mark. Prime Minister Liz Truss on Monday was absent from the Commons. She sent Penny Morden out to bat for her. And the question from MPs was, what is the point of Liz Truss? She's lost her chancellor and her economic strategy has been decimated. Today MPs can ask it to her face. The opposition leader, Kirsta, is likely to concentrate on what he dubs austerity 2.2, because, of course, the new chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, has had to ask government departments all of them bar defense and health to shave 15% off their budgets. That's because he's still got to plug a £40 billion hole in the public finances. He's not even committing to protecting pensions. And pensioners, of course, such an important constituency for the Tory party. He may also import it for our audience, raid bank profits. So it's an open goal for Kirsta, Labour, way ahead in the polls. Crucially, it's the Tory MPs who are going to be watching Liz Truss there, verdict crucial. And the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, due to address back benches at 5pm today, her performance could determine whether Liz Truss makes it to the end of today. Lizzie, thanks very much, Boobos. Lizzie Burden joining us there from Westminster. Let's get to our guest this morning, Patrick Armstrong. Can you really me well for CEO, joins us, Patrick, very good morning to you. Any appetite for guilt at this point? Given what we've been through over the last few weeks, we could see a flattaker of colleagues tell me as a result of QT actually starting, yes, one day late, but starting pretty much on its revised schedule, but only at the short end, the QT programme.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4471,2022-10-19 06:18:25
16126," See a flattaker of colleagues tell me as a result of QT actually starting, yes, one day late, but starting pretty much on its revised schedule, but only at the short term, the QT program, not touching the long end. Any impact on your appetite for guilt? I'm not attracted to guilt, I'm not short guilt anymore. I prefer corporate debt at the short end of the curve, basically, that you get a bit of a spread premium to it. The spread duration is not long. If we do go into a significant recession, which I expect, the pull towards par on these corporate bonds, much more attractive. So you can get six and seven percent on investment grade bonds that have about a two-year duration, and I think that's much more attractive than taking the term premium buying longer duration guilt. Okay, not. Putch, good morning. So you think corporate bonds are a better trade than guilt here, and a better trade, I presume, than equities, is that the case? I like corporate bonds. If I have to choose between a bank equity or the bond from a bank, I much prefer the bonds. I'm getting seven percent yields on some triple B plus banks in the United Kingdom. I pull credit swiss into there again. I don't think I'm short the equity and I'm long the bonds there. You're getting pretty good compensation without taking spread duration or term premium. Definitely prefer short duration corporate bonds right now. Okay, and sticking with the debt theme or sticking with the bond market theme, let me ask you about lessons learned from the UK story, because I noticed that you've been active on BTP. You say that you've got a small way, it's been profitable. What lessons do you think Italy should be taking from what we've seen? And maybe it's unfair for me to make that link, but a lot of people go from talking about the UK into Italy because of the size of the debt. Yeah, I think UK didn't learn lessons from Italy, unfortunately, with the term oil and governments and changing leaders all the time. Italy, basically, if you propose anything that's unfunded, the market's punishing that right now. So when interest rates were zero, populist policies, protectionist policies, all of those things worked reasonably well because there wasn't a significant cost. Italy's got 150% debt to GDP and 7% of their GDP every year now is just going to funding their interest rate costs. So any unfunded spending out of Italy will be punished just the way the UK has been. But, Putch, if my one worry on this at least for it makes complete sense, but I feel like we've had this narrative before. And a few years ago, it was like, this is the end game, for Italy, it's an unsustainable debt path. And then it didn't play out. I know that we've now seem to have a parent of bond vigilantes again. But what's the catalyst for that Italy story to really accelerate this time? Slowing growth, which we definitely have, a deep recession, and then that 7% interest cost as a percentage of GDP just rises naturally. Because probably the government's going to be forced to do some spending, the revenues are going to be lower, and interest costs are going to go higher. So all of those things are going to work in bond vigilantes favor. And unless the ECB does something drastic, and they're still inclined to begin quantitative tightening at some point, it's really hard to see how those vigilantes are going to be defended against. Okay, Patrick, stay with us. Lots more to talk about with Patrick Armstrong, Plurini-Well-CIO. We've got some viewer questions coming in as well, which is fantastic. IB Plus TV Go is the function to use if you want to get in touch with the team. We will put one or two of those two, Patrick. Coming up on the program, we will also get into a conversation about stocks. In fact, we'll do that with Patrick Shortley, Bank of America, their survey, saying that the market is showing signs of full capitulation. We talked about that earlier in the program. So we'll think about where that takes us next. This is great, bye.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4472,2022-10-19 06:22:48
16127," I've always been a person who's just been attracted to hair. I like to sit and think and theorize how I can manifest these visions that I have for braiding and how I can take something that may seem like it's a line drawing in my mind and apply that to someone's scalp. We are the only culture that has hair that grows out of our head the way that it does. Anyone from the African diaspora is born with this amazingly curly hair that can be shaped into a variety of different ways of expression. I want black people to love themselves for how they naturally appear and also to appreciate the cultural practice such as braiding that our ancestors have practiced for centuries. Welcome back to Bloomberg Markets at Europe. Still 40 minutes until the stars have cash equity trading for Europe and futures point slightly higher. Let's get back to Patrick Armstrong, who's still with us. We had a viewer write in about bank exposure because you were talking quite favorably about banks there in a particular context. The viewer says why do you want to take exposure to banks when property in the view of this viewer is about to crash. I think house prices are still very overvalued. I'm short, I'm short land securities, I'm short from Ovia which is residential in Germany. We've seen pension funds having to get rid of some of the property assets. There's four sellers when you get into special market environments, properties, illiquid and banks are very well capitalized. The tier one capital ratios are very good. I don't think there's much upside in the equities but we've seen nation-safe banks if they get into trouble and there's not off balance sheet liabilities the way they were pre-leam and those kind of things are all much better regulated. I think as a bond holder you're very safe. As an equity holder they look incredibly cheap, significantly below tangible book value. I don't think there's a catalyst to unlock the upside there until we do get into an expansion and you get an upward sloping yield curve. That's probably when I look at the equities. I think the bonds are safe and providing a very big cushion over gilt yields and treasury yields. Patrick, I love the uncle you provide because you're presenting a relatively negative outlook. As you point out there are opportunities still in the market and markets and economy don't always align perfectly. I'm curious in that context. Are you bullish or bearish crypto or ignored entirely? I'm bearish but I'm ignoring it entirely to be honest with you. It's not something I have any competitive advantage in. I do view it as I don't think Bitcoin is the answer to what crypto promises. I think there'll be something that's just like Bitcoin that is a mechanism of exchange or medium of exchange. So I think Bitcoin, the principles of it it makes sense but I just don't think it's going to be functional as a medium of exchange and I think something that is Bitcoin and is that will come along eventually in this place Bitcoin. Okay, those thoughts on crypto. Let's return to more volatile assets. We started on the pound to cutore into crypto which hasn't been very volatile back to Japanese assets. The Japanese 10 year yield rising above the upper end of the BOJ's tolerance band and this ties nicely into one of your theories at the moment is that the cat won't hold. You don't think they'll have to give up. You don't see how they can hold it, we're in an environment where things are breaking now. There's a lot of stresses in the financial system and capping interest rates at a quarter of a percent. When you're importing inflation while the yen is at a 40 year low every other central banks hiking by 75 basis points and 100 basis points each quarter the bank of Japan is going to have a very difficult time defending that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4473,2022-10-19 06:27:00
16128," Well, the ends of the 40-year low, every other central bank's hiking by 75 basis points and 100 basis points each quarter. The bank of Japan's going to have a very difficult time defending that because they're not deflationary anymore. Why is it not broken already, though? Because all those things you say sound like it's a surprise. It's lasted this long. Well, they own 50 percent of all Japanese bonds issued. I don't know what the breaking point is where they'll have to own them all. But it's not a liquid market that they can defend because people don't own the bank of Japan bonds and pension funds don't own them. It's basically the bank of Japan that owns them. And the consequence of defending it is a very weak yen. So eventually that week yen, they're going to be importing inflation and it's a carry I'm getting by shorting the yen and an asymmetric upside when they do break the peg on short the bonds. Patrick, I completely agree on the trade fundamentally and I think I've been super barrician all year. But one thing I worry about from a trade management perspective is if they suddenly remove your yield curve control next week's meeting, you know, you could see a really, really powerful rally in the yen. Not only is it suddenly getting the yield support, but you're going to suddenly get a repatriation of funds from Japanese holders around the world and you get a blow up with the carry trade. So from a risk-manum trade of holding the JGB versus the yen, you might get hurt really badly on the yen part in a very quick fashion. How do you, what's your response to that? So I've got a 5 percent short yen. I've got a 21 percent short on the 10-year bonds and you get the duration on the bonds as well. And sometimes duration whereas the currency is one for one. So all of those things mean I'm going to be a net winner if they do break the peg even though I am short yen. Patrick, thank you very much. Really great to have you with us to respond to some of the breaking news and to talk us through your thinking at this point, Patrick Armstrong, Plurini Wealth's CIO. Coming up on the program, a program cranking up the pressure, UK consumer inflation comes in hotter than expected ahead of the UK Prime Minister trying to reassert her authority in Parliament, it seems it was food prices sent inflation back into double digits. We'll get analysis shortly. This is Mag. What do you say to the cynics that say, look, it's all nice and fine, but a lot of it is greenwashing and you're not a good company, you're just a less toxic company than some of the other oil majors. Now the first thing to say is that, you know, I'm a big believer and we need to put ourselves in other persons' shoes in life in general. And so I understand that point of view and I get that people have that perspective. I don't agree with that obviously, but I understand where they're coming from. We have an enormous challenge as society which is to provide the world with reliable, affordable and clean energy. That's what society wants, that's what society needs. And I believe in my heart that a company like BP is actually one of the few companies in the world who can actually make that happen.

This is Bloomberg Technology. Welcome to Bloomberg Crypto. Welcome back to Bloomberg at markets in Europe. Half an hour to go until the start of cash equity trading here are your top stories. Inflation Nation, UK CPI returns to double digits as food prices soar. UK Prime Minister Liz Trass faces Prime Minister's questions with her premier ship in question. Netflix can chill. Shares in the streaming giant. Shoot up in late trading. Thanks to better new subscriber data, after nearly a year of disappointing results. Last Wall Street continues is Rally amid our beat corporate results as European earnings kick it up a year. Welcome back to the programme. Half an hour until the start of equity trading for this Wednesday morning then here in Europe. And the future picture does look pretty positive actually for European stocks, not by much, but a little bit higher. Certainly, cash futures seen up by half a percent or so. Yesterday we had strength in Europe, but more so in the United States. So looking to play a little bit of catch up, perhaps the focus as we said in our headlines. Now very much on the earnings story and managing to move higher with that in mind, thinking about maybe we've seen full capitulation as per that Bank of America data set or survey. And managing to make headway, four stocks and risk assets, despite the fact that we consolidate Treasury yields a little bit higher. Let's find out what's on marks at mind though this morning because he missed a lot of the excitement. Is that the right word mark around the UK story? Certainly volatility. And I know that you've been reflecting on the UK quite a bit recently. Yeah, I am a little bit jealous and I missed out on quite a bit of drama. I'm thankful that I'm not on a trading seat right now because I think I would have lost a lot of money in some of the volatility in recent weeks because it certainly was a very difficult environment to trade. The underlying fundamental story though remains very negative for the UK. I have no particular conviction where the next couple of weeks goes. I think some of that volatility is going to remain, but next year is going to be tough. So let's have a look. These are 2023 consensus forecasts for UK GDP. And this is going to the trend over the last year. So as we came into this year, we thought the UK would grow above 2% next year. This yellow line is the day that Liz Truss declared that she was going to run for Prime Minister. It was just before we had the two days before we were going to have the initial round of voting for the next leader. So that was July 10th. And you can see we're GDP forecast next year or 1% at that time. We have suddenly accelerated their decline during the leadership contest. And it was actually in mid August when it became clear that Suneak wasn't going to win. And it was going to be Liz Truss that we really collapsed again. This is the day that she finally actually officially got confirmed. And we've continued to slump with another slide again this week. I think this is very interesting. Given that Liz Truss is going to have to deal with this issue of her mandate was about the fact that she was going to lead UK if its problems via growth. It was going to be a very much a growth-centric model. That has been turned on its head. It hasn't worked out very well from there. There are downward risks to this forecast. I think it will go a lot lower over the coming months. I'm interested in how she will handle this in Parliament today. OK, let's stick with the UK story. That's the growth forecast, the growth expectation. Let's stick with the UK because we started this programme with UK consumer inflation, coming in hotter than expected. The September CPI number hits 10.1%. Of course, it comes ahead of Prime Minister Liz Truss appearing in Parliament later on to defend her premiership. Let us get analysis. Bloomberg's John Steppe joins us. John, you are putting together a daily newsletter for, owned at a more consumer audience, I think, for Bloomberg. So welcome to the Bloomberg family. Let me ask you, then, your thoughts on inflation right now. What does it mean for consumers? Double digit inflation, more than double digit, 10.1%.

16130," double digit inflation more than double digit 10.1% I mean also we're talking about how long this inflation in Pulse last Don't we because the CBR yesterday saying inflation is going to stay above 2% for a number of years and that has to increasingly feature in our thinking Yeah, absolutely. I mean thanks. Thanks for having me on Yeah, I mean, this is a really ugly set of inflation figures and I don't think everyone can deny that You know, it's beat expectations yet again Which is becoming something that we should actually expect And the problem is that you know wages are rising in the region of about 5 to 6% which by historic standards is quite high And but obviously in real terms it means that consumers standard 11 is falling because the wages are not keeping up And savings rates have also gone up but again, they're nowhere near keeping up with inflation And so basically we've got a real squeeze on our living standards Now we can't expect the government to come to aid because now we're back in you know at best austerity light mode And under Jeremy Hunt The aid was going to be extended to consumers in the terms of an energy price fees is going to be ditched in April And also the bank of England is going to be under even more pressure to show that it's tough on inflation now We've already seen that it's continuing with its plan to do quantitative tightening from November You know, it's likely that we'll now see a percentage point rate hike at the November meeting And also the bank also has to certainly extend its playing catch up with the markets I mean, it's only in November 2021 that the bank was expecting inflation to peak at 5% back in spring And obviously that's not going to happen now So essentially it's a really tough time for consumers John, good morning You make me sound like a relative optimist on the UK economy Given as you say that the UK is not going to be UK government's not going to come to the aid of people given that you've got a austerity light as you phrased The bank of England needs to reassert its credentials It's pretty bleak and tough for next year What can people do to shield themselves? Well, it's looking grim but I think the thing that you have to do is You're going to have to be much more active about managing your personal finances than you possibly have been I mean for some time we haven't You know, I'm not saying that it's being easy But with low inflation and low interest rates Anytime you went to renew your mortgage for example I think most people probably had a certain assumption that being able to get a 1.52% fixed With last you know forever really And also that if interest rates did start to tick up they would have time to react But I mean we've seen already I mean interest rates on a I just stand at mortgage have gone up from like 1.5% at the start of the year To over 6% and head them for 7% now And that's happened in a month or a week So you're just sort of showing you how quickly things can change So I think in the moment you need to look at where your savings are Because thankfully one silver line in the 7 rates savings rates have gone up so if you haven't changed where your cash is sitting for a while Look around shop around see what you can get It's not going to match inflation but it's going to be better than a kicking the teeth And mortgage wise you know you can have to take a action You know if you're coming up for remodeling then get on the market See what's out there You know you can lock in a rate up to 6 months before you read mortgages up In terms of if you're buying a house I mean the one The one good thing about that is everyone else is going to be feeling the same pain that you are So another sort of perhaps mild silver lining for first time buyers Or people are struggling to get on the ladder is the prices are probably going to have to fall So that might mean you end up with better buying power You know in the kind of near future John maybe I could just ask you a question about mortgage About mortgages in the UK which has struck me as interesting in recent conversations When we talk to American colleagues about how in the UK Typically you might fix a mortgage for two years, three years, five years but not much longer That's met by a lot of surprise on the other side of the Atlantic where typically the fix is for longer Is that something that that we should think about in the UK? I actually think that it wouldn't be a bad idea I mean one reason that our housing market is so volatile is because of the structure of the mortgage market if you get a lot of people on variable or short term fixed",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4476,2022-10-19 06:40:06
16131," be a bad idea. One reason housing market is so volatile is because of the structure of the mortgage market. If you get a lot of people on variable or short-term fixed rates, then clearly the impact of higher interest rates is going to feed through to house prices much more quickly than it does in other countries. Obviously in America, mortgage rates have short up, they're up to about 7 percent now, but the difference is those are 30-year fixes. And so what that does is that the people who are already owned houses are essentially safe, they're there, their cost of living is not going to shoot up with that. So it's bad news for the state agents and it's bad news for probably house prices themselves because it stops buyers from actually coming in because 7 percent is so high relative to 2 or 3 percent. But at the same time, it protects people who are already fixed. And I think it would be a good idea if we could perhaps move more to a market like that. Whether I know what that will ever happen is contingent or in people's preferences, but those do change all the time. John, thank you very much. Thanks for joining us.

Let us get Blaineberg Business Flash. Top corporate stories we're covering this morning. Here's Alice. Hi, Anna, the biggest US banks keep adding to their workforce as even as executives talk of scaling back. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley City, JP Morgan and Bank of America all reported increased Ted Count for the quarter of the six largest US banks, only Wells Fargo cut the size of its staff. Bank of America has outlined a series of next steps for thousands of employees returning to the office. The bank told staff in a new memo that it will depend on the job role. Some that require in-office work will be fully based in the office. Others will have flexibility to work from home for a limited number of days a month. For more plans for each business unit will be announced in the coming days. And what are Americans doing with the time they've got back from due to working from home? Well, according to new research by the New York Fed, the answer is sleep. US workers at home have reclaimed 16 million hours that they used to spend commuting to the office each day. A report from Stanford University says even as most people return to the office, about 15 percent still work entirely remotely and about 30 percent have a hybrid schedule. That's your Blaineberg business flash Anna. Alice, thank you very much. Alice Atkins here in London with a business flash. Coming up on the programme, Hollywood can breathe a sigh of relief. It seems streaming giant Netflix returns to growth and forecast even more subscribers over the coming quarter. We will break down the numbers for you. We'll check out the post market jump in the share price as well. Today, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard sits down for an exclusive interview with Bloomberg's Kathleen Hayes. Will he offer any hand of an ease in the coming months? Find out today on Bloomberg Television and Radio. In the past two decades, China has built large infrastructure projects in almost every country in Africa. African governments themselves said we are tired of aid and charity. We want to do trade. We want to be treated like partners. The Chinese came along and said great, we don't do aid and charity. We want to do business with you.

16132," Partners, the Chinese came along and said, great, we don't do aid in charity, we want to do business with you. Global Gateway will mobilize 300 billion euros till 2027. Now the US and Europe are answering back with their own infrastructure initiatives to counter China, but African experts are skeptical. China has been that guy around the corner with a bouquet of flowers to Africa, the US, Europe and the UK, of time and time again say, be careful of the flowers you see out of the window. Go on andiliarstvery on, push and push, We're starting to break markets where previously we've been very poor. So the United States is currently flying with Formula One with its new found popularity. And of course, how do that comes commercial revenues by attracting new partners and commercial partners into the sport? So it's a win-win scenario. Is there more that can be done on that front to grow the fan base? Absolutely. I think we're just scratching at the service and what we're seeing is more and more youngsters coming to sport, more and more young girls coming into following Formula One. And I think that's a really encouraging thing. And I think that once they come to look at it, the most important thing is to keep them engaged. So the racing's got to be good. The product has to be good. It has to stand up for itself. It has to be inclusive. It has to tick all of those boxes. That was the Red Bull Racing Team principal, Christian Horner speaking with Tom McKenzie at the F1 Team Ted Quarters. You can watch more of that interview on Powerplay as a new show where we speak with some of the most influential figures in the world of sports. We talk about the business of sport. That debut is right here on Bloomberg Television. And of course there is a link between that. He was talking about the popularity of F1 in the United States. Perhaps no small credit for that given to Netflix and the series it was running on the sport. Now Netflix shares jumped as much as 16% in extended trading after the streaming giant returned to growth. It follows two quarters of falling subscribers. Hit shows like season four of Stranger Things helped it to add 2.4 million members, beating expectations. Tech reporter for us. Aggy Cantrell is with us this morning. Good morning to you. So can we say the worst is over for Netflix or have they just put a couple of difficult quarters behind them at least? I think it's crucial to point out just how significant this subscriber growth this quarter is for the company. They've frequently been using this as an indicator of their business model being so strong. And the last two quarters that hasn't been the case. And so this is reassuring to investors. But what's interesting also to see is that Netflix themselves are saying that they're moving away from talking about the subscriber numbers and they want to focus more on revenue. And that means that essentially they're moving towards potentially a more traditional model when it comes to what the investors will be looking at. They're not so concerned about this rapid subscriber growth. They're more concerned about whether or not this company can turn a profit. Aggy, good morning. Are there any kind of major effects concerns for Netflix going forward with the strengthening dollar and how does that weigh on their earnings? So something that Netflix has been looking at for a long time is essentially what they can be doing to reach out to a broader audience outside of the US and Canada. And that means often offering local language content across the world. And they have seen that the subscriber gains across different regions. But what's important to note is that when people who are living in other regions are finding that their incomes are essentially being squeezed right now, that's going to have a knock on effect. I thought was interesting.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4478,2022-10-19 06:48:46
16133," who are living in other regions are finding that their incomes are essentially being squeezed right now, that's going to have a knock on effect. Something that I thought was interesting from these earnings that we saw yesterday is that while they've seen subscriber growth in Asia Pacific, the actual revenue per subscriber in that region has gone down, which essentially means that people are looking for the cheaper subscription options on Netflix, potentially because their own incomes are being squeezed. Aggie, thanks very much. Yeah, an interesting angle and one we will look for in other reports from the tech sector and indeed for other global US businesses. Thanks very much to Bloomberg Berlin-based tech reporter Aggie Cantrell. Let's get a Bloomberg first-wed news update. Alice has a briefing for us. Hi, Anna. The Biden administration plans to release 15 million barrels of oil from US emergency reserves. Officials tell us it may also consider significantly more this winter in an effort to ease high prices. President Biden will announce the plan later today. It comes amid rising costs at the pump after OPEC classes decision to slash production. The Bank of England will start its delayed bond sales early next month, but it will initially exclude the long-data debt at the heart of recent market turmoil. The announcement comes as essential bank is on the defensive. The recent mini budget forced it to start buying guilt again in an order to prevent a fire sell by pension funds. The Federal Reserve can't pause hikes if inflation is still rising, even if the benchmark rates hit 4.5%. That's according to Minneapolis Fed President Neil Kashkari. He says core services inflation is the stickiest of all and it keeps climbing. The central banks keep getting surprised on the upside, investors currently see a peak rate of around 4.9%.

Alice Atkins in London. Coming up on the program, we'll take a look at the important and I think we've moved from this attitude from its indulgence a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s and so it makes that a really exciting field because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harness to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts but if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom you've got to know when and how and why to use that information and that's what you bring figures out while you're sleeping. Welcome back to Bloomberg Market. It's set year up nine minutes until the start of cash-eck when he's trading.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4479,2022-10-19 06:52:51
16134," Welcome back to Bloomberg markets at Europe nine minutes until the start of cash equity trading futures pointing a little bit higher this morning. Let's get to some stock specifics. Tom McKenzie joins us and get a European market open. Tom, let us start there with Nestle. Yes, we've Nestle. Yeah, Kit Katmaker owner of course of Nespresso coming in with some pretty decent results and their forecast for the end of the year as well looking pretty solid as they pass on very very high prices or at least they pass on the costs and they have got to a point where they're able to pass on prices almost a two decade high for Nestle. They say they see continued strong demand as well across across the board generally apart from Nespresso a bit of a weak spot there, but it is all about the fact that despite this cost of living crisis not just in the UK globally. They are managing to whether this consumer storm at this point margins as well. They forecast margins to come in around 17% pretty solid then given all of those pressures so it's about passing on those costs whether they can continue to do that of course. Rule main in focus but so far decent results for Nestle. Tom, good morning. ASMR had some good results as well. Tell us the story there. Yeah, despite all the concerns about these US restrictions on chip sales to China, of course, and we know that ASMR have told they're the maker of these very sophisticated ultraviolet lithography machines. They've told their teams in the US to stop working with Chinese colleagues. Nonetheless, they say they see demand holding up. It was a beat in terms of their as well. And they say that in fact in terms of those restrictions when it comes to the shipment of those machines from the Netherlands to China so far their initial analysis is they see little impact. And so that's what they're looking forward as well. They see that demand containing or continuing to hold up. And as we wait for a fuller update on strategy at credit suites not a day seems to go by Tom when we don't have a story about who is circling over which assets at the Swiss lender. Yeah, latest party circling and is Mitsubishi UFJ and in terms of the assets that they're looking at is a portfolio of loans were told within the aviation space, the pension space. This is Mitsubishi UFJ looking to potentially expand their footprint in the United States were told very early in terms of these discussions. They haven't made a decision yet, but they are buying these potential assets from credit suites. We know of course, Credit Suites as you say leading up to that important restructuring announcement in a little over a week's time. They prefer of course to sell assets rather than raise money from their current investors. So this would seem to be making a move in that direction though again. They haven't confirmed hasn't been signed off, but certainly the interest is there at this point. Tom, thank you very much. Tom McKenzie, anchor of the European market open was thinking about the banking sector keeping our UK banks a lot of talking UK media about where release that the chance is going to go to try and fill fill the holes in his finances. And one of the ideas is of course around renewable energy companies whether they get hit by a windfall tax or whether some in the banking sector could be. And so that that that narrative doing the rounds once again marks for keeping on that more broadly sentiment what deteriorating a little bit does it seem in the last half hour. Yeah, I mean it started a couple of hours ago when we came in this morning the mood seemed relatively positive. Of course, US stocks had a positive day yesterday. Yeah, they gave back some gains towards the end of the day, but US futures were up again. That was feeding through to Asia. But when China and Hong Kong just traded negatively, it's kind of dragging everything down. Then we got the UK data. We're getting US yields higher again. It's a generally yields higher story again. It's the same old story all year. And I think this story does have legs longer term. I am in the camp though that overall over the next few weeks will see a general relief, but it will not be a straight line or not be easy because people know that the fundamental story remains very negative. So the fundamentals remain negative. It's interesting though, isn't it? Because in recent days when we've seen positivity and that seems to have been attributed to the earnings story, either realize earnings or expectations of a decent earning story, confidence in the US consumer. All of that is being pointed out when we ask what's driving stocks higher and all of that comes at a time when yields go higher as well, which previously might have been something that would have knocked confidence in risk assets. So what is that relationship looking like right now? So I think it's not just the earnings story. I think we got to remember that earnings I expect earnings to be a positive catalyst, but partially because we've downgraded forecast quite a bit. And I think they'll beat that low bar. So that'll be a marginal positive forecast, but nothing exciting. On the yield story, I think it's the fact that we've already priced in a big move in the short term. And I think therefore it's hard to get another catalyst of upward yields at the very front end. I think that'll be a story for next year. And then get on growth. I think we're priced.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4480,2022-10-19 06:57:36
16135," already priced in a big move in the short term. And I think therefore it's hard to get another catalyst of upward yields at the very front end. I think that'll be a story for next year. And again, on growth, I think we're priced quite a negative story and action, the short term might surprise a little bit positively. So this is kind of a picture where we've got a negative, fundamental story priced. It's valid, but it's hard to get another negative catalyst from here. I think that's next year's story. OK, Mark, thank you very much. Thanks to Mark for spending the past hour with us. The open is up next. The future's picture then does still point so positively, but perhaps not as much as it did previously. A Euro stocks 50 features up by 410s of 1% or so. US features up by 210s on E-minis. Nasdaq features up by half a percent as we get ready for the European session here in Europe in a few minutes time. Companies now, they're getting hundreds, maybe even thousands of applications. So software has come in to automate the process. You want to write your resume for robots, not for humans.

16136," year of disappointing results. Plus, Wall Street continues its rally amid upbeat corporate results as European earnings kick it up again. So, Tom, let's take a look at the future. For the moment, we're holding to some of the gains. The FTSE, of course, gained some two tenths of a percent similar gains for the DAX features, but we have to really look at what's happening in Treasuries, Dullar and then that inflation impacting Sterling. Yeah, absolutely. The sentiment has slightly turned. We came in this morning, was looking pretty bullish on the back of a very strong session. Another strong session states aside the earnings picture coming through. But now, when you take into account that its CPI print from UK and of course the expectations that the Bank of England may need to go 1% come November the third. The sentiment is starting to come off a little bit. Despite again, the fact that we do have some earnings coming through on the European side, they're looking pretty positive. The lights of Nestle, ASMR, for example, the story around Credit Suisse continues as well. FTSE 100, currently gaining three tenths of a percent. The Spanish Ibex up 12 points at 7,633. Just again now, of two tenths of a percent over in Spain. Let's switch it over and see how things are playing out cross-asset then. See if we can build on the gains of yesterday for Wall Street. Future's pointing to further upside of two tenths of a percent. Whether that will moderate, given what's happening in the Dullar and the bonds as well across the US curve, it's something to watch through the session. The pound at 1,12, that's down on the back of the news around CPI. We'll see how things play out on GILTS. We'll check those shortly. The 10-year currently stateside 4.06. That's a move higher in yields of close to six basis points. You're seeing a bit of a sell-off across the curve stateside. Brent currently trading at $90 per barrel. That's again a 4 tenths of a percent, despite confirmation that the Biden administration will be releasing more of those as to it reserves onto the markets. Let's check GILTS then on the back of this news. And you are seeing a sell-off across the curve yields up, price down, $362 on the two-year. That's a move higher by six basis points. The 10-year just above 4 percent now a move higher by close to eight basis points. The 30-year important, of course, for all of us 4.37 on the 30-year. That's a move higher by seven basis points. Again, CPI, a pretty turbulent week for Liz Truss. Now this is a Prime Minister who's election policy committee to go for that 100 basis point hike. The other thing, of course, that we've learned from the Bank of England is that they are going to crack on with quantitative tightening after the Halloween budget, just not at the long end of the curve. And it's a confident message from the Bank of England that to focus on at Prime Minister's questions with Liz Truss later today. Yeah, a couple of Tory MPs coming out publicly saying they would not vote for a change to that triple loss. The living squeeze to reduce that demand, that pressure versus, of course, having to acknowledge that maybe that energy support is going to be less potent than we'd thought. Where does that lead to B.O.E. as we look ahead to November the 3rd? Morning, Tom. I think that, in the market, surprising in about 96 basis points of a rate increase coming November, and I think the Bank of England would do well to take it. And I do think that they will take it because they've already been in home cash in the past few days. And Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has said that they won't hesitate to rate increases, to raise rates as needed. And within the inflation print that we got this morning, and we need to keep in mind that retail price inflation, which is the measure of inflation for pension funds, that is already not of 12%. So the B.O.E. doesn't really have time on its hands. It needs to raise rates sooner and the sooner the better because we are hard to create the cumulative increases for the entire year, for quarters, will be a... In the market that over the past few weeks has made it clear, it wants to go higher. It got a little spooked by the idea that zero total potential rises. So, the next question is, how do you think the current pension options on Netflix? Okay, BlueBugs, Bull and Bass, take reports at Aggie Cantrell on the beat of the Netflix, but some of the challenges as well for that company. Let's get back days into the earnings season. But some of the numbers have come through pretty strong, whether it's Nestle, A to the A, S, M, L, the U.S. banks Netflix as well. How does that leave your view on the earnings resilience as we face up to these recessionary risks? 53600 is when we think a recession is sort of baked in. Now, as you say, earning so far have proven indeed to underscore that story of resilience and specifically around the consumer when we think about luxury goods reporting, some of the consumer staples companies, as well as loan losses that we've seen coming out of the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4482,2022-10-19 07:22:18
16137," of resilience and specifically around the consumer when we think about luxury goods reporting at some of the consumer staples companies as well as loan losses that we've seen coming out of the banks. So I think that does support a short-term rally in markets from these very pessimistic levels where it's all been about the multiple that we want to pay for the earning stream. The earning stream probably proves to be a little bit more resilient, but I do think downgrades are still coming to 2023 earnings. It's resilient but on a declining trend. He's very good about, you know, asking about Epidae, I would have just asked you what showed you watch on that flicks. Mine is not, it's another problem. Are you a stranger thing's fan? I'm, you know, I watch like the Dragon Prince and Troll Hoagers, so that's the kind of level that we're at in the Lackua House right now. Is there a day or actually that consumer spending just get hits all of a sudden? We're also coming out of like what three years of COVID, so maybe if people have less savings or are still spending. Yeah, it really sounds like grace, you're looking at further pain across the equity markets and the squeeze on consumer. Some of the earlier games now just up to a tenth of a percent, futures news are still holding on today's of two tenths of a percent worth noting that banks here in the UK are taking a bit of a hit on the back of this front page story from the fund. We're going to back crypto currencies or you are a believer in crypto current. Welcome back to the open, everyone, 30 minutes into European trading den here are your top stories. Inflation in the UK, CPI returns to double digits as food prices soar, UK Prime Ministerless Trust faces PMQs with her Premorship in question. We also have Netflix shares, well, then streaming giants shoot up in late trading thanks to better new subscriber date after nearly a year of disappointing results. Plus European stocks rise for a fifth straight day but erase early gains as earnings get underway. So Tom, if you look at the markets, of course, are looking at the UK, but really a lot of focus on these earnings. Yeah, let's update that headline because they're not rising now. They're currently down about a tenth of a percent, a little over a tenth of a percent. So that rally that we had seen over the last few days, stunning to lose steam. Yes, as Francine was mentioning, earnings have come through pretty strong, but there is that continue concern about recession risks. And again, inflation, underscored by that print, we got out of the UK, CPI coming in at a four decade high, 10.1 percent. The Bank of England expected by many now to raise rates by as much as 1 percent by November the third. The taxes currently down about six points, the puts it 100 turning lower as well. Pressure on the banking sector on the back of reports from the financial times that the chancellor is looking considering a windfall tax on both banking and energy. We keep across that story for you. Let's switch it over, have a look at how the sectors are shaping up then. And the last time I looked at the future stateside, they were turning a little bit more negative as well, having been up about two tenths of a percent at the start of the European open. At the top of the list, technology still gaining six tenths of a percent ensured.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4483,2022-10-19 07:33:22
16138," a little bit more negative as well. Having been up about 2-10s of 8% at the start of the European Open. At the top of the list, technology is still gaining 6-10s of 8% insurance, also up 6-10s. But most of the sectors now turning red, led by real estate retail. So, it's wondering if Banks is in there somewhere. Banks still holding onto games up 5-10s to the point of what we're seeing in the UK space. Credit Suisse, we know considering a deal potentially with Mitsubishi UFJ around some of its portfolio of loans. Stateside, of course, the credits we story remains in focus as well. As they lead up to that restructuring plan, that all important restructuring plan and a little over a week's time. Now, the dollar inching higher this morning as investors wear per earnings prospects against rising rates. Meanwhile, the yen continues to tumble towards $150 as per dollar as traders watch out for any hint of subtle intervention. Now, the pound also lower after CPI came in hotter than expected. We're now joined by John Hardy, head of FX strategy at Sachsabang. John, we can speak for about three hours on sterling. So, that's exactly what we're going to do. But we do need also to talk a little bit about yen. What does sterling go from here? Are we back into inflation fighting conundrum? Or could we see a mess of things again? Well, Sterling, I think looks relatively stable here. I think the recent volatility and the response to it with the removal of the Chancellor, a new Chancellor on board, and the very strong fiscal responsibility message means we're unlikely to see the sort of scale of volatility we saw during the recent incidents. But I think the dynamics are still very negative sterling, the external deficits, and those drivers are not going any way time soon. So, if you can tell me that we're going to solve the energy situation for the UK and for Europe as well. And then I can say Sterling could stabilize versus the dollar. But I'm afraid the dollar is going to continue a bit higher here in the near term. So, cable could continue to settle a bit lower. But you're starting probably more on the stable side and maybe only slightly weaker the sterling versus the Euro as we do have this much stronger message on the move both to show up the budget deficit and the projections most importantly, but as well, a stronger message on bigger high-cost account from the Bank of England. So, John, that pound dollar dynamic is playing out. As you've described it's playing out in the session today. You're seeing dollar strength across the Bloomberg dollar index, two tenths of percent in the pound down around four tenths, one twelve. What is the next level that you're looking at for Sterling? Well, I mean, we blew such a big arrange widening, a big downsides bike to below 105. So, I'm not thinking we're going to go there any time soon. But looking towards 110 as a key technical level, we did trade a little bit below that. It's a psychological level as well. And then something like 108. Now, if we're going to start finding some resistance to this kind of a good move in the Q4, which I'm suspecting we might, then around them suspecting somewhere between 105 and 108 would be his own support for cable. But things can get hairy down there as well if the if a resentment is really deteriorating badly. So, that's basically saying, John, that traders hate the pound only slightly less than the used to maybe two weeks ago. What are you expecting BOE to do? Well, they have to deliver. I think Hunter Basis points is a fair projection for for the next rate hike. I think they would do better to go a bit to the upside, do 125 basis points, get the rate towards 3.5, indicating that they're more quickly going and getting on the path to 4 and then 5%. But certainly they need to avoid surprising on the downside, given what is unfolded. I think Bank of England does bear some responsibility for that as well. So, yeah, 100 basis points, that's a baseline. I think they would do well to go 125. But I'm not sure the government bail is on board with that. Wow, 125 potentially 1% is what you're looking at on November 3rd. I want to bring back a comeback to a point you made about the dollar, John, because I thought that was interesting. And I'd like to you kind of unpack the view. The fourth quarter you think is maybe when the dollar rally gets challenged. Just explain that for us. Well, I'm just thinking that we're, you know, we're priced to go 75 basis points at the next Fed meeting, next Fed meeting on November 2nd. And that's taking us, you know, within 100 basis points range and what the Fed sees is it's a terminal rate. I think we get to see enough data softening just enough to where we see the Fed slowing down on schedule. So in other words, to add to further dollar strength, I do see more dollar strength near term, but to add to further dollar strength.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4484,2022-10-19 07:38:09
16139," In other words, to add to further dollar strength, I do see more dollar strength near term, but to add to further dollar strength on top of that, you would need to see that the market projecting the Fed even higher. I just think we're starting to get there in terms of the pressure on markets and the Fed's just beginning to show signs of blinking or at least the market having sort of fully taken in where the Fed is going to take rates by let's call it mid 2023. So that's just my model, my base case for what happens here. I think the risk could be of course that spills into Q1. I'm next year, but sometime in this timeframe, fourth quarter Q1 next year, I think this dollar cycle will need to start peeking out. Don, we're seeing bets on, you know, dollar yen, maybe start to take read of us Japanese fund managers. How does that change the equation for BOJ? I'm not sure what changes the equation for the BOJ to be honest. They kept a remarkably consistent message through all of this. The message seems to be that they don't dislike yen weakness per se, but they dislike the so-called excessive moves and the volatility one way, whatever that means in terms of the moves. So we're all on alert. They have shown they are willing to intervene and they will at times. The last intervention and last at all of about two days in terms of keeping the dollar again rate below where it had been when it was 145 of the time. Of course, at that time, the US yields continued to pressure higher. I just think the situation is quite simple. Until they change, the dollar per yen pressure will be higher as long as these US long yields in particular, rain at 4% or higher still. And I think very near term, the US data is not going to provide much leeway for yields to fall. Ergo, the dollar in pressure remains the upside. Intervention with futile beyond a few days timeframe. I think the most interesting thing will be if the bank Japan is forced to blink before the industry cycle turns meaningfully. That's interesting, given the timeline we're on with the bank Japan's leadership needing to change out next year. Indeed, the legacy of Corrota, the head of the BOJ, 149 currently on the yen, John, so just flirting that with that level close to 150, of course, and potentially as we look, potentially to further intervention, as you say, from the bank of Japan, not there yet. The head of FX strategy at Saxo bank on the views of dollar, pound and yen. Coming up, EQT completes its acquisition of Hong Kong-based bearing private equity Asia. One of the biggest deals in this sector. We're going to speak to the EQT CEO, managing partner, Christian Sinding. That is next. It's been going on. I think it is crucial important and I think we've moved from this attitude from its indulgence a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s and so it makes it a really exciting field because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harnessed to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts but if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom you've got to know when and how and why to use that information and that's what you bring to use out while you're sleeping.

In the strong dollar, Apple fly the world's risks of instability. She didn't think that complete reunification must be realised. With unmatched reach in resources, From more than 120,000 people The moment news breaks, 24 hours a day, Bloomberg, your global business authority. We're starting to break markets, where previously we've been very poor. So, the United States is currently flying, with Formula One, with its new, newfound popularity. And so, of course, out of that comes commercial revenues by attracting new partners and commercial partners to, you know, into the sport. So, it's a win-win scenario. Is there more that can be done on that front to grow the fan base? Absolutely. I think we're just scratching at the service, and what we're seeing is more and more young, it's coming to sport, more and more young girls, coming into following Formula One. And I think that's a really encouraging thing. And I think that, you know, once they come to look at it, the most important thing is to keep them engaged. So, the racing's got to be good, the product has to be good, it has to stand up for itself, it has to be inclusive, it has to tick all of those boxes. Red Bull Racing Team Principal Christian Horner, they're speaking to me, of course, as part of a new show called Power Players. We speak with some of the most influential figures in the world of sport about their rise, the success of their sport, and what the future holds, Christian is, of course, a controversial leader, but this is a fascinating conversation. Anyone who's a fan of Formula One or drive to survive that the show on Netflix should absolutely tune in. Let's go from Formula One then to private equity, and the firm EQT, completing his acquisition of Hong Kong-based engineering private equity Asia. That's as a Swedish investment firm looks to capture the region's bright prospects. The deal worth $6.7 billion makes it the biggest takeover of a PE firm by another in the sector. Jim Hussner has Christian Sinding, CEO and managing partner at EQT. Christian, what is the rationale behind this deal and how does it position you for growth in Asia? Well, great to be on the show again. Nice to see you both. This is a really interesting deal for us. We're creating one of the global leaders in private equity. We're solely focused on what we call active ownership strategies. So all the strategies where it can be an active owner and really add true value to companies and properties as well. And we've become truly diversified, you know, where we're one of the leaders in Europe, where we're growing significantly in the US and with the BPA transaction, we become number one or number two in Asia. And with that global scale, we can become a smarter investor and return even better to our clients. Christian, you're just a little bit stressed. I'm about becoming so big in a time where there's macro and did you political environment is so uncertain? That's a really good question. I think it's actually the opposite. You know, now we're we're diversification across asset classes. We have diversification across geographies. We're becoming more insightful investor with our insights from Asia. And if you look at what's happening geopolitically in the world, right now, of course, Europe is in an uncertain place. We might be in a recession. The US has rising interest rates quickly. Might be going into recession next year, while Asia is still actually performing relatively well. So as a global firm, we're actually becoming more balanced. So I think the timing is excellent from that point of view. Christian, when do you see investment and exit activity picking up? You know, right now it's hard for buyers and sellers to meet. The bid asks for M&A is a little bit complicated. But transactions are being done in worth the matter of investing in secularism.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4486,2022-10-19 07:46:56
16141," You know, right now it's hard for buyers and sellers to meet the pit-ask spreads for M&A is a little bit complicated But transactions are being done in you know worth thematic investor investing in secular trends in society So the kinds of transactions that are happening are like our take private of Bill Trust in the US and the kind of two to three billion dollar range stable business software company And this was a failed SPAC actually that we then took off the stock exchange that are going to build in the private markets over the next three to five years So those kinds of deals are being done the larger transactions like our investment in Galderma, which was a ten billion dollar deal a few years ago The capital markets just aren't there for that kind of deal the credit markets aren't ready There's not enough equity to to be able to you know collect for that kind of transaction But these smaller mid-sized deals which you can build throughout on acquisitions and organic investments They're still going to happen And it's hard to say when the when the you know when the market will really come back, but I think I think you know inflation and Interest needs to stabilize and buyers and sellers need to find each other in a better way than today But Christian, what does the tighter financing markets actually mean for private equity in general and some of your funds if you see liquidity in the public markets drying up Does it trend does it actually make it worse for private? It does actually because you know when we're making an investment Typically we're having probably 40% of the investment being done in equity and about 60% being done with you know with credit with debt Most of the time does coming either from banks or from the public markets But to an increasing degree it's also coming out from the private credit players and just at this moment the first two sources are Basically not available in private equity We have some availability and infrastructure and real estate, but but basically not at all So right now the active you know the active investors are the private credit players That have a kind of a similar mindset and a similar time frame As we do in private equity, but those sources are probably maxed out around two billion So the largest deals we'll see in this market are maybe three maybe four billion Christian, where are the pain points across the portfolio of companies that you you own or invest in when they face up to the this higher inflation Reasonry what what is the kind of crunch point and how much Fat is there to trim of some of these companies? Mm-hmm Yeah, well we're it's like you said we're a cinematic investor we're investing in in health care and in essential infrastructure In you know the energy transition In technology so in a lot of those sectors there they're later. It's you know much later stage So our portfolio overall is actually still growing double digit on the top line and the bottom line But we see pockets of weakness. We see pockets of wage inflation. We see pockets where you know value chains are challenged We see pockets of lower demand. So it's it's really spread out and not systematic yet So I I can't tell you that we're You know, we're you know, we're looking at a trouble portfolio and not at all our portfolio is very healthy But but our mentality is that we're preparing for the worst and hoping for the best Christian, what does the worst look like like a protracted long deep ugly recession world-wide and if you see that where do you see it first? Yeah, I think you're you know, you start to see it in in more industrial companies or you know, cyclical companies like the chemical companies or some of the building products manufacturers those kinds of areas And and you're starting to see that in some you know some cases in Europe and some countries But as of yet, you know companies are still generally delivering pretty good profits Um, employment is high which of course supports the overall economy for the time being so um, you know, we're not it's not systematic yet that we're in a recession But if if it really gets ugly, of course, then um, you know, with the energy challenges in Europe and we go into a deep recession Um, and that becomes a global recession like we had in 2008 and then of course all companies over time become become affected The good thing about private equity is that we know we're not under pressure to sell anything So when time turns bad then we work our companies on cash flows. We work them on Innovation driving our D building them throughout on acquisitions and extending the ownership Christian, thanks so much for all of your thoughts actually come back soon Christian sending there the chief executive officer managing partner at EQT now coming up a little bit later this morning We'll also be speaking to the next lady chief executive",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4487,2022-10-19 07:50:59

Today, St. Louis Fent Residence James Bullards sits down for an exclusive interview with Bloomberg's Kathleen Hayes. Will he offer any hand of an ease in the coming months? Find out today on Bloomberg Television and Radio. When you think space you probably think, one space agency that travels under the radar is ESA, which is surprising considering what the European Space Agency has achieved, and how vital it is to the global space industry. We've collaborated with pretty much everybody who is involved in space exploration. But ESA wants to be a leading force in furthering humanity's mission into space. Come underground for your coffee. If we want to have a successful human missions to Mars, we are going to have to learn to live and work off-world in a different way. The place where we are going to learn to do that is on the move. Can ESA help humanity take its next giant leap? We will never break. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. Let's just be honest. We've had sort of a shift in our way in some sort of circulation fears. We're talking about that all day yesterday. Welcome back to the Open 52 minutes into your European trading day. Stocks in Europe are lower by about a tenth of a percent. Futures in the US still are on to gains of just over a quarter to four tenths of a percent. And as that futures two tenths of the S&P E-minis, Neil Kashkari saying you could see rates above four and a half percent if core inflation doesn't come down. Let's return to our top story this hour. UK consumer inflation coming in hotter than expected with September CPI hitting 10.1 percent. It comes ahead of a battle prime minister Liz Truss appearing in parliament later. Let's bring in Bloomberg's John Steppek then for more on this. The question of inflation, John, back in double digits. What is the read across? More paying for consumers then. Yeah, I mean, you can't really put a positive spin on this. I mean, we should be getting used to inflation coming in higher than expected by now because it does this almost every month. But yeah, we're back at 40 years highs. If you look at retail price index, that's now going up at 12.6 percent a year, which is the highest since March, 1981.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4488,2022-10-19 07:55:04
16143," So we're back at 40 years highs. If you look at the retail price index, that's now going up at 12.6% a year, which is the highest since March 1881. So this is a really unpleasant number, and it's really going to pop consumers. Wages are rising by about 5% to 6% a year at the moment, but that's half the rate of inflation. So the standard 11 is going down. We've just had the chance to have replaced with a new chancellor who's sort of pursuing that. A kind of austerity like kind of package at the moment. So all of the help that people were expecting with their energy, but those after April was going to be gone. And now this just really keeps pressure on the bank at England to keep raising interest rates. It seems very likely now that we'll get at least a 1% point rise in November. And that's going to keep pushing up. You know, you can have mortgage costs. I mean, in a way, the bank is just playing catch up with the market now. John, great to have you here today, because also this is a huge new vertical for Bloomberg, right? You're launching a new website or certainly a vertical looking at wealth. So what we're trying to figure out is cost of living crisis. If there is anything that people can do to shield themselves. Yeah, thanks for having me on, Francine. So I can talk about my newsletter, but yes, though, they kind of mean that I have some minor several linings from interest rates going up in the, for example, for those of you who've really suffered over the last decade, I'll start and see interest rates go up in the savings. So if you haven't shifted your savings account for a long time, and it is worth looking around just now. Now, you're not going to get anything near inflation, but you can go from below 1% to as much as 5% in some accounts now. So it's worth looking if you've got cash. But I think the overall takeaway is that you have to now be much more active about managing your personal finances than perhaps you've been used to over the past decade or so. I mean, when interest rates were low, and really not going to move in much, you could assume, for example, that perhaps when you went to read mortgage, you might have got a lulled into a false sense of confidence that rates were always going to be low. And perhaps even the rates were going to go up, they would go up slowly. But we seem to be frankly terrifying rise at speed and mortgage rates from knocking around 2.5%. Just three months ago. So John, you know, John, just very briefly, if you're looking to remorage at this point, do you wait post OBR, post B O E? What would your advice be? Just briefly, for someone looking at that prospect? Well, I think everyone's circumstances are personal, but what you need to look at is what kind of pain you could take. So you just kind of assume that what means if it's going to break the bank, if rates go up any further, then you need to be acting now. So you know, it's kind of an ideal world, yes, you would possibly wait, but you don't know what's going to happen. And I think the fact that the bank is putting this pressure on the government by saying it's going to continue doing quantitative tightening in November, kind of shows you the bank's mentality as we need to sort out inflation. So basically, if you're in a hurry, and it's going to ruin your life, if your mortgage costs go up any more, you need to take action. All right, John. Thanks so much, John.

Well good morning everyone and welcome to Bloomberg's early edition. I'm Francine Lackoy here in London. Here's what's coming up on today's program. UK inflation comes in a hot to CPI returns to double digits as food prices soar, the Prime Minister has trust, faces PMQs today with her premiership in the balance. Getting success shares in Netflix jump and extended trading thanks to better subscriber data after nearly a year of disappointing results. Plus, risk reversal European stocks drop after jumping at the open inflation fears, better sentiments. So first thing is first check on the markets and we did see a bit of a rally. I had actually a couple of traders and messaging me. Thank you Anthony. I know you're a loyal watcher and every morning you say this rally will it hold will it not hold. Where this time you were right. I think at European stocks they're down two tenths of a percent with I guess that sign of confidence that the Bank of England gave yesterday they're ready for QT. It will start a couple of days before that November 3rd meeting. The market was thinking right. Well it means that they think they can pull it off. Now we go back to inflation fighting BOE so there may be not expecting the market chaos that we lost that we signed last couple of days but it does not mean that the road and path ahead is easy. After thing 1272 yen a lot going on or at least a lot of speculation certainly from fund managers betting actually that dollar yen will move putting pressure on the BOJ and then the US 10 year yield 406.

So let's also see whether we have a map of Europe to see if there are any differences for example between the DAX unchanged the UK down two tenths of a percent.

I think we are seeing a reversal certainly compared to how we opened up an hour ago because of inflation fears but nothing too ugly.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4490,2022-10-19 08:03:57
16145," 10 to 8 percent. So it's a bit of a wait and see situation. I think we are seeing a reversal certainly compared to how we opened up an hour ago because of inflation fears, but nothing too ugly on the markets just yet. Now let's keep it on the UK. Inflation jumped more than expected to a 40-year high of 10.1 percent. It comes as a battle prime minister. This trust is due in Parliament, where she's hoping to regain authority. I mean, the fallout over her government's mini budget U-turn. Let's bring in Bloomberg's Lizzie Burton. So Lizzie, the inflation print and the B-O-E. It means that the B-O-E because of the Q-T announced me yesterday is now ready to go back to flattened inflation, I guess, with everything it has. Exactly. Andrew Bailey put in a confident foot forward with this statement that Q-T is going to start after the Halloween budget. They're not at the long end of the curve because of course that's where the market turmoil happened in response to quasi-quarteng's mini budget. But we are back in double-digit inflation in September. I've just seen the Foreign Secretary James Clevverly in Westminster. He has said that this figure is concerning. But for the Bank of England and its November meeting, the debate was between 75 basis points and 100 basis points. This might tempt some members of the Monetary Policy Committee to go for 100, but really markets have paired back their bets of a really big hike since quasi-quarteng was replaced with Jeremy Hunt as chancellor. The FT is reporting that the UK Chancellor also extending the windfall tax, raiding the profits of bank and energy companies. So this is significant because it could also turn businesses against them, I guess. Indeed, and it's not, it's actually on top of the rising corporation tax, remember, that was the second big U-turn that Liz Truss had to make. But these are the, as he put it, eye-wateringly difficult decisions that the Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is going to have to make to fill that £40 billion whole in the public finances. And at the other end of the spectrum, we've heard that he's asked all government departments bar health and defence to shave 15% off their budgets. He hasn't promised to protect pensions, even though we've seen this inflation figure really squeezing vulnerable households that the Chancellor said they would protect and pension as a crucial constituency for the conservative party. So when we get to Prime Minister's questions today, you can expect the opposition leader, Kirsta Amar, to really focus on what he's dubbed austerity 2.0. And if the Prime Minister can't fill those questions well, you might not make it to the end of the day. The Chancellor is going to address Tory back ventures at the 1922 committee at 5pm later. Lizzie, thank you so much. Lizzie Brudden, they're joining us, of course, from Wetzman's to say the number of beds everywhere I look to, on to how long the Prime Minister survives is not a great benchmark of how long she stays in power. We're now joined by Jeremy Stretch, head of G10 FX, FX Tragi, at CIBC. Jeremy, I was going to ask you whether you took beds. I mean, we're kind of joking about it, but this is serious in terms of economic news because the the U-turn is incredible. I mean, we went from, you know, tax cuts, we're funding, we're fine, to austerity. So this is not even a U-turn. This is a U-turn plus sum. Oh, absolutely. I mean, I've put out several notes over the course of the last couple of weeks, headlined Anarchy in the UK. And it feels rather like that because we have seen this sort of completely anarchic relationship between politics and economics and the fiscal backdrop and the divergence between monetary and fiscal policy over the course of the last few weeks. And if you're an international investor sitting outside the UK looking in, then the UK doesn't look at particularly attractive place to invest. And so, and surprisingly, investors have been sitting on the side loans or at least questioning us to whether the valuations in terms of standing assets are appropriate. So, Jeremy, this is not only about politics, right? This is just the fundamentals of this country and what the Bank of England will have to do to get inflation over control. Absolutely. I mean, we had after that, to mini budget on the 23rd of September, fiscal and monetary policy actually in conflict. And that was really one of the concerns that the market had. Now, at least we're seeing fiscal and monetary policy getting back into the same page or the same construct in terms of the policy backdrop. So, we're not seeing the sort of fiscal expansion that was really creating some of those problems in the Bank of England. But clearly the Bank has difficulties ahead.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4491,2022-10-19 08:08:20
16146," Page are the same construct in terms of the policy backdrop. So we're not seeing the sort of fiscal expansion that was really creating some of those problems in the Bank of England. But clearly the bank has difficulties ahead. And I think they will be forced to just policy by the most in that life cycle of the NPC. But we're looking for a 75 basis point to hide from the NPC at the next meeting. Jeremy, and I know this is something that maybe is counterintuitive. A lot of people are not thinking about it that way. But if inflation needs to be under control, or does the Bank of England really have to put this country into a deep recession, even if it could be shortly, to make sure that inflation goes back. I mean, how much demand do they need to destroy? Well, of course, this is exactly the same debate that we're seeing in the US. And I think we are going to see demand destruction in the UK, because clearly the average consumer being materially impacted by higher prices. Already we've got the impact of mortgage rates and those substantial number of people are going to be mortgage refinancing at much higher levels over the course of the next 15 to 18 months. So I think we are going to see a fairly substantial downturn. We're looking for probably a one-to-one of the quarter percent contraction in GDP next year. I think that's baked in. But I think the Bank of England isn't going to need to go quite as far as the market is pricing, because I think the degree of demand destruction already that is going to be in place will reduce a substantial degree of those inflation repressures. So what's your cons derling from now until the end of the year and then 2023? So for the end of the year, I think Sterling comes under a renewed bout of pressure and uncertainties. We see this political maelstrom play out. So I think we may well see another dip back towards the sort of one-ten threshold. I don't think that's the... What happens after that? Well, I think we then find a little bit of a flaw. I think the parity calls I think have moved away because I think the normalization of fiscal policy I think reduces the parity threat, which was clearly writ large after the mini-fiscal event on the 23rd of September. I think towards the end of this year, though we start to find a little bit of stability. And I think we can see Sterling coming back a little bit against the dollar through the course of next year. But I think we also see Sterling potentially coming under a little pressure against the euro. And I think that might be the better way to play it over the course of the next few months. All right, Jeremy Doug, anywhere because we also have a great chart for you looking at the US markets on edge over the US housing market after a measure of US homebuilder sentiment. Yesterday, slumped for a 10th straight month. Our markets report to Valerie Taitel is here to take us through it. Valerie, I came in and you said, look at this chart, Fram. So what is it telling you? Thanks, Francine. OK, so I have a chart on the exact data you mentioned yesterday. The homebuilder sentiment index versus US unemployment. Now, the homebuilder sentiment index, as you mentioned, came in lower and a 10th straight month. But it's also posting the steepest decline on record, the fastest decline on record. So this is concerning because we know that housing tends to lead the US economy. And I've mapped this versus the US unemployment data. So if we were to look, let's say, at 2008, 2006, where we saw a huge deterioration in US housing and unemployment rose, people are jumping to conclusions again. We're seeing a very large drop in this sentiment. Does that mean, with the lag, of course, that we'll see unemployment rising? Now, yes, this chart might be concerning, but the one bright spot I can point to you, Francine, which is in my next chart, is that some people will say that the US is less exposed to housing. And they point to things like the fact that residential construction spending now, versus in 2006, is a bit lower. And we know that housing, the housing market, generally, is a bit less leveraged. So that's the argument that poses maybe the US economy can weather a housing downturn. We've heard from Bank of America, and those results, for instance, that the US consumer is still strong. So maybe things like that, compounded with the fact that we're a little less exposed to housing going forward, means that the US economy could weather the storm. Valerie, thanks so much. Valerie, a title there. Now, you can see Valerie's charts, of course, on all terminal analysis via GTV Go and the Bloomberg terminal. You have some great little numbers that you can type on your own, I think, make them your own. Steel Valerie's charts, I highly recommend that. We're back with Jeremy Stretch, head of G10 FX Pratchy at CIBC. Jeremy, you also don't need a PhD in economics to understand that maybe everything's a bit skewed because of COVID. So we're seeing consumer spending holding strong until what needs to happen for that to completely fall off the cliff. Well, you're absolutely right, we're seeing consumer spending holding up, but I think some of those narratives in relation to the housing market and the impact that we're going to see on higher prices in terms of discretionary spending, I think I'll go to come through and come through quite quickly. I was particularly interested by that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4492,2022-10-19 08:12:57
16147," I think some of those narratives in relation to the housing market and the impact that we're going to see on higher prices in terms of discretionary spending. I think I'll go to come through and come through quite quickly. I was particularly interested by that chart just being shown there about the home builders index and the flow through into unemployment. I think one of the big things in terms of the US dynamic is looking at that substantial fall that we saw in Job vacancies over the course of the last month or so. That's again a little bit of a siren call to suggest that the labour market is showing some signs of fragility. If we see that reflected in terms of the beige book when that's released tonight as well, then I think that's consistent with a moderation activity. I think that will start to stem some of the more extreme assumptions in terms of Fed rates are going. I think that will play into the narrative of the dollar story starting to lose a little bit of momentum as we go into 2023. I don't believe that. The dollar, it just feels like there's everything supporting it unless the rest of the world picks up. Well in a sense I think that's true. In a sense what we've seen of course is the dollar has been the only story in town through the course of the last 12 months or so. It has been the growth story, it has been the interest rate story, it has been the safe haven flow. So I think if you start to take away some of that momentum in terms of the macro story, we take away some of that dynamic in terms of Fed tightening expectations. Then I think you end up with the situation where the market is already relatively long of dollars and you start to question whether you should add or extend some of those flows. I think also if you start to see some of this moderation or we can see this moderation in terms of gas prices continue. Of course that's a big if. But if we are going to see this moderation in terms of European gas prices persist, then that takes away some of that negative narrative for the Eurozone equation as well. Talk about big if what happens in Japan, I mean the story there is absolutely incredible. Does it force does yen force actually go to do something? Well it's interesting, I mean just as I was leaving the office I was just looking at the 10 year JGB's and it appeared to be the case that your curve control wasn't quite operating in the way that it was intended or as we would have expected. Now clearly we're getting more, we've been heading in extra way towards this big line in the sand at 150. The question is is that going to be the threshold that's going to prompt the MOF back into the market. But the ultimate bottom line is that if you're talking about solar or unilateral intervention without dealing with the fundamental reasonable rationales to why the yen is cheapening up, i.e. the BOJR in the completely opposite spectrum to every other global central bank, it is very much the case that throwing money against the dolly and cross is going to be a relatively sort of almost throwing money into the air because you're not going to get anything other than the natural gas. Anything other than a short term reaction to the question is are the Japanese going to allow that your curve control threshold to moderate and perhaps even without necessarily adjusting it formally. We're just allowing those those rates just to edge up a little bit and that might be one of the precursors to seeing something of a top in terms of dolly and. I was suggested it's maybe the more exciting country right now. Well, it's well, I mean we've been waiting we've been waiting for a consistent period of Japanese inflation for the last 30 years. Now the BOJ have achieved it. Corrota's achieving his aim towards the end of his tenure, but you have to question us to how how that's come around and whether it is actually a beneficial story for a for Japan PLC.

Now coming up Netflix returns to growth as Hollywood breathes a sigh of relief that the worst may be over for the streaming giants. More on that in a moment, this is Bloomberg. I've always been a person who's just been attracted to hair. I like to sit and think and theorize how I can manifest these visions that I have for braiding and how I can take.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4493,2022-10-19 08:16:59
16148," Who's just been attracted to hair, I like to sit and think and theorize how I can manifest these visions that I have for braiding and how I can take something that may seem like it's a line drawing in my mind and apply that to someone's scalp. We are the only culture that has hair that grows out of our head the way that it does. Anyone from the African diaspora is born with this amazingly curly hair that can be shaped into a variety of different ways of expression. I want black people to love themselves for how they naturally appear and also to appreciate the cultural practice is such as braiding that our ancestors have practiced for centuries. That's what we are looking at. The subscribers are growing again after two quarters where it was seen as this was a driving figure for the successes of the company in the last couple of years and now we saw a drop in the first half of this year. That seems to have been done away with but what's interesting to hear from Netflix is that they are also saying that they're not going to be focusing so much on subscriber growth but rather the top line is going to be about the revenue going forward. This is also incorporated into the fact that they're bringing in an advert advertising based model as well that will be priced cheaper than the non-advertised version of Netflix and essentially that's going to be incorporated into their revenue as well as the cost of subscriptions and also partnerships going forward. So it's potentially going into a more mature form of media product than purely based on subscription growth. So, what about this dollar dilemma? How is that impacting revenue? Yes, so essentially Netflix as a global company and a company that is keen to get subscribers all around the world is obviously concerned about the pressure on incomes across the world especially with a strong dollar and what that means for other economies. And so now we're also seeing that especially seeing as this platform has engaged with a huge amount of investment in local language content in places like a career or where I'm sitting in Germany and they're keen to get subscribers from other parts of the world. Essentially what we're seeing now is that they would need to make sure that those subscribers are able to continue paying for these subscription models even when the cost of living is potentially squeezed.

Drilling down in the numbers and preparing you as only Bloomberg can weekdays on Bloomberg. Economic finance politics. This is Bloomberg's surveillance early edition and front scene like we're here in London. Now let's return to our top story this morning UK consumer inflation coming in hotter than expected September CPI hitting 10.1%. It comes ahead of the embattled Prime Minister. Let's trust appearing in parliament later. Let's bring in Bloomberg's John Steppe. You're here because you're also launching a new global newsletter focusing on wealth. So how do you save me money if I subscribe? Which by the way I have in the UK inflation back in double digit. What does that mean for consumers like you and me? It's really unpleasant. I've seen. I mean, I'm glad to use you subscribe. Thank you very much. But yeah, so this is you know, inflation is at a 40 year high back at a 40 year high. You know, it's puts more pressure in the bank of England to raise interest rates. And at this stage whether it's three quarters of, you know, a percentage point or a full percentage point, plan doesn't matter. Interest rates are going up anyway. And in the meantime, the government's not going to help us out as much as it was hoping to help us out because we've got Jeremy Hunt and a new kind of austerity like type approach to the budget. So really, I think the important thing for consumers and investors to understand is that the world has changed. This is, you know, the new normal. We can't expect to sit in wait and hope.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4495,2022-10-19 08:25:48
16150," that the world has changed. This is the new normal. We can't expect to sit and wait and hope that the year of ultra low interest rates and low inflation comes back because it's not going to come back, certainly not anytime soon. It doesn't mean that inflation is going to be in double digits, you know, for the next 10 years, but it is going to be much more volatile, and that means that you need to take a much more active approach to managing your personal finances. But so, John, is there anything that people can actually do to shield themselves apart from spending less? I mean, obviously spending less is one option, but if you're looking for something that's a bit less kind of depressing, I mean, there are a few who can imagine a silver line in here at the moment. Within interest rates going up, the savings rates have going up as well, so you can get better rates on your cash. It's not going to keep up with inflation by any means, but for example, you can get saving rates of upwards of 4%, something's 5%. Now, so if you haven't moved the cash in your bank account recently, do shop around and take a look. Another kind of silver line in which is something that people coming up to the time and might want to take a look at is the new year's rates. The new year's have been basically a favour with pensioners, you know, since the pension reforms that are allowing everyone to draw down the retirement ports. And that's because low interest rates meant that a new tier rates were extremely low. Now, they have started to pick up again. It doesn't necessarily mean that they were the right thing for you, but it's certainly something to start considering again if you are coming up for retirement or even end retirement and want to look at your options for getting an income over the longer term. And I mean, other than that, there's also, you know, your mortgage is probably the other kind of big thing. And I think that's the thing that's going to be scary. A lot of people at the moment and that's understandable. It is scary, you know, like interest rates have shot up on mortgages in a very short space of time. I know. We were looking at like more than 6%. It is pretty scary. We'll get more on that. For the moment, I think a lot of the mortgages are fixed rates, but then I think it's middle next year where some of those start trailing off. Arjan Stepet will have plenty more, of course. On the UK, we'll also talk crypto next to this. It's Bloomberg. It is crucially important. And I think we've moved from this attitude, from its indulgence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s. And so it makes it a really exciting field because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harness to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize that makes you smart. If you can spit back a lot of facts, but if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information.

Streaming success shares in Netflix jumped at pre-market thanks to better subscriber date after nearly a year of disappointing results. Plus, risk reversal, European stocks are mixed after jumping at the open inflation for the last few years. Better sentiment. Welcome to Bloomberg's surveillance. I'm from St. Lacquay here in London. We need to look at pound. We had a good conversation with Jeremy Stretch on the fact that after the May and after the chaos that we saw in the in-sterling, but in gilts over the last couple of days, we're going back to fundamentals. And fundamentals don't look that good if you're the B.O.E. right now. We have that 10.1 percent inflation. Double digit, still at a 40-year high. But it was even higher than expected. That means that the market may be currently pricing in, stirling, well, a bit lower as back of England increases rates by maybe a bit more than they were pricing in yesterday. We also had New Yesterday of that QT. The main question there is how much QT translates into interest rate rises. Now, it's been a tough year for crypto with prices crashing in questions over its environmental credentials persisting. The industry is also facing increased scrutiny from regulators for its high energy consumption at a time when many countries are struggling to keep the lights on. We're joined by Adam Beck, the Chief Executive Officer and co-founder of BlockStream. Adam, thank you so much for joining us because BlockStream actually also added so much in the equation. You can't walk in the street without people coming up to you and asking you questions about how it all started and where cryptocurrencies are going from here. Let's maybe start in El Salvador. What did El Salvador teach you about the usage of crypto going forward? Well, I think interesting story with El Salvador is encouraging foreign direct investment so that they see a new rising sector and offer offshore incorporations for crypto exchanges and things like that. I think it has been a success story for them has increased tourism and they've adapted it as a second legal tender as well. There have also been questions, question marks and concerns about what it means longer term. Do you think the, I don't know if El Salvador is kind of a template of what others also just as small countries can do and whether that would be a positive or a negative? Yeah, I mean, I think it's a positive. You can see sort of similar things historically with Dubai offering free trade zones for international companies to operate in the Middle East and Singapore areas that are kind of phasing out natural resources or coming up in the world. Because it only work in countries where they don't have a strong belief in some of the fear currencies. Well, it certainly brings it to the fore of their mind more readily because they're relying on international remunses with high fees. They have unstable inflationary local currencies but of course in the West we're experiencing inflation for the first time as well. So I think that's opening more people's eyes. I mean, when you look at inflation and some of the market chaos that we saw in the UK and also in other parts.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4497,2022-10-19 08:34:09
16152," You know, experiencing inflation for the first time as well. So I think that's opening more people's eyes. I mean, when you look at inflation and some of the market chaos that we saw in the UK, it also, you know, other parts of markets worldwide, is there really a case that some of the cryptocurrencies are more stable going forward? Does it change the equation? Does it make it more mainstream? Well, I think it means that people are looking to preserve spending power because they're thinking that their savings will be going back at double digits per year, they're just standing still, and it's very difficult to figure out where to put it. Stocks, bonds, everything looks uncertain. So while Bitcoin is still in the early phases of adoption, so has some volatility, at least has a growth story. And I know one of the things that you're talking about is lightning and liquid, which is basically something that is meant to make Bitcoin payments faster, cheaper. How far along are we in that infrastructure? Yeah, lightning, which is for retail and micro-payments, is really undergoing very rapid adoption, sort of double-digit, percentage growth, month-to-month, and a lot of development activity. And that drives to use cases you see in El Salvador, kind of more payment focused. But do you think that looks at rate significantly? If you're looking at cheaper payments, faster payments, then does it start rivaling some of the big credit cards out there? Yeah, I mean, I think the payments use cases more seen in emerging markets and in the West, you more see Bitcoin as a savings technology or inflation hedge. You're here for a digital assets conference. What's it we'd like? Well, I mean, the markets, you know, Bitcoin and the wider market is in some disarray, but the financial institutions actually seem to be steadily planning for the future and adding support for Bitcoin-related products, so offering the ability to buy Bitcoin with your brokerage account or with your savings account, I kind of think. Are a lot of the conversations on sustainability and electricity usage going forward? I think there's some misunderstandings about that. For example, you know, the power that's generated is usually built to peak capacity. So typically, at least 50% of power is unused. And we do some mining in Canada in Montreal, and that province has all hydropower about 50% unused. And actually, you know, it's difficult to buy power because it's a government corporation. But there's enough unused power in that province to power the entire Bitcoin network. So there's actually a lot of surplus-green power in the world. That's all hydra. And is that even true? I mean, we're looking at, you know, record prices for energy. We're talking every day about the cost of living crisis. So does that change because of some of these inflationary pressures that we're seeing and the scarcity of energy? Well, I think the problem is that it's difficult to transport energy over long distances, right? So Canada has a very low population density, there's 65 hydrodams in that region. There are other countries with such kind of imbalances of populations of power generation. So Bitcoin sort of seeks out the low cost environmentally friendly power, basically. You've also joined forces, I think, with Jack Dorsey in Texas? Yeah. So we started a solar and battery-powered Bitcoin farm. And so it's under construction at the moment. And the point there is that Bitcoin is a sort of buyer of last resort which makes power generation projects more profitable earlier in the cycle. So it makes it easier for projects to get project financing. It's a build green power and ultimately sell that onto residential and industrial use. So it's the solar install was done by Tesla and it's using the Tesla Megapax. And so this is entirely solar. And do you see this being replicated in other states? Yeah, so I mean, I thought this to you, rather than having people debate about policy to just build a project, open the finances so people can see the economics of it and then replicate it much larger. Okay, Adam, great to meet you. So you'll have to come back and we'll talk a bit more about this. Adam back there, it's your executive officer and co-founder of Blockstream joining us.

Now Nestle Sayers are surging as the world's biggest food and coffee maker pushes through the largest price increase in decades to try and shield the hate from inflation. The group prices are up to 9.5 percent while volumes fell over the quarter. Let's talk and look at some of the brands underpinning its success. We live in a world of artisan caffeine. Nestcafe remains a huge money spinner for Nestle. There's also the boutique offering of Nespresso coffee pods. It's one of Nestle's high margin products, but volumes declined and European sales have dropped after a strong 2021. Now, better news for Nestle's dog food brand Purina, which is helping to drive growth. That food has done phenomenally well these past few years partly due to a rocketing pet ownership during the pandemic. I am, of course, very tied to both pet food and also coffee. We're delighted to be joined now by the Nestle Chief Executive Officer, East March Schneider, for an exclusive conversation. So Mark, thank you so much for joining us. I mean, it is pretty incredible that you've passed on the biggest price rise in decades. Are you worried that people will buy less? That people will not be able to afford your products, especially in Europe. Well, seeing, good morning, and thanks for having me. Good to be back on the show. And look, this is a situation that no one wished for. And what we're trying to do here is protect our margins from some of the same pressures that every family feels.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4499,2022-10-19 08:42:51
16154," Situation that no one wished for and what we're trying to do here is protect our margins from some of the same pressures that every family feels. So we are seeing that huge upward pressure coming from energy, some of the agricultural commodities and also transportation costs. And we're not even passing everything on because as we saw with our half year numbers, our crores margin has also been reducing over the last year and a half. So in the sense we are struggling to catch up and understandably these numbers get all the headline but they're only partially recovering some of the additional cost pressures that we're seeing. But Mark, we're seeing different government support in terms of different countries in Europe. So are there countries where you worry more about consumer backlash because of increasing prices just because inflation is too high for them and their wages aren't following? So far we've seen only very limited trading down. I think the big unknown especially for Western Europe for the fall and winter is energy insecurity and how hard that is going to be hitting households that disposable income after energy cost. And that's the one where we are watching very closely and seeing how the fall and winter will play out. I mean, when do you find out whether consumers are switching to white labels? If you look at the trajectory again of consumer spending, of the cost of living prices, of energy prices, of the winter months, where do you think or when do you think peak consumer angst is? Well, when it comes to white labels, do keep in mind we're not only offering premium brands. We have brands across a number of price points. And so when there's trading down, it doesn't mean we lose that consumer. We may be able to have a compelling offering at a different price point. We're also promoting more in terms of value pack and larger pack sizes. With the white label, you've seen a bit of a recovery because most of these private label brands have been suffering a lot during COVID times. Some of the supply chains weren't holding up as well as with the brand of goods manufacturers. So some of the recovery there was already ongoing. We now need to wash over the winter exactly how the situation unfolds. So Mark, when you look at all the products that you offer all the categories, which category do you think is more resilient to price hikes? I think in general, those large key categories we have, like coffee and pet gear, tend to be very resilient. We know that from past crisis and also from other markets around the world. So clearly, there's a lot of elegance here to these brands and to these products. And I think that boats well under the circumstances. To protect your margins, there are other things that you could do and increase, for example, making some of the packaging smaller, the size is smaller, but the same price point. Has that been done? Will it be done? Well, a key part for us was to actually look internally and see where we can find efficiencies so that not all the pressures here that we saw on the cross margin arrive at the bottom line. And so a lot of internal cost savings have happened over the last year and a half and that we also have undergone a very aggressive program, which we call cut the tail to push the head. So this is low rotation SKUs being phased out in favor of high rotation, more successful core SKUs. That helps to improve supply chain efficiency and the other thing is it really improves visibility of those core offerings, so it helps sales down the line. So your volume measure, which is basically real internal growth, actually contracted in the fourth quarter, but on the nine months, it was rising. What does that tell you about price pressures? Well, I think it's important that we're living at a very volatile time and that we don't interpret the volume development only in response to pricing, because we're also lapping very, very strong quarters from last year due to a very strong COVID demand. People were still spending a lot of time at home in quarter last year. And so that's where it makes it so hard to read. Some of it is simply the high level of comparables. Some of it may be the earlier response to some of the pricing. Some of it is supply chain constraints. And some of it is what I mentioned earlier, and that is our voluntary phasing out of certain SKUs as we're trying to seek efficiencies to offset inflation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4500,2022-10-19 08:47:13
16155," pressures continuing. So this is not over yet and some of this will kind of go into 23. When exactly it's going to peak, I think a lot of that has to do, especially in Western Europe with the energy situation because that's a big driver of inflation and also of course has a big impact on our cost position and our manufacturing distribution cost. So that's the big unknown, but some inflation would certainly continue into 23, even just because of the full year effects of the rises that we have seen in 22 so far. Mark, are you planning to position Seattle's best coffee? Is it going to be high premium with other brands? So to us, this is a very exciting brand that we got to know through our Starbucks Global Coffee Alliance that we struck in 2018. It is positioned less premium compared to the original Starbucks brand. It's more of a mainstream mid-range brand. Very trusted in particular in the United States, building of course on Seattle's reputation as being one of the core places to get a good coffee in the United States. And so we came to like this brand a lot and it helped to also cover the gap price point wise that we had before. So very excited now to get complete ownership of this brand and to continue to develop it going forward. I'll be talking about coffee, Mark, getting a good cup of coffee. What happens with no espresso? Can you increase prices of an espresso capsule? Is there a limit to how much people will pay for those capsules? So of course being faced with the levels of inflation we're seeing, we also had to adjust prices there. The good news is that the basic interest in the brand and portioned coffee or capsule coffee continues to be unabated and very strong. What you're seeing when it comes to a crow-froid compression is mainly due to the very, very high quarters that we're lapping from last year. That was unavoidable because as can imagine, people working from home, consuming coffee from home, portioned coffee was to go to solution and now as they move back to the office, we're seeing some of that ease. The fundamental underlying demand is still very strong and very bullish on this brand. Yeah. Mark, I was actually looking at my shopping basket, right, in a grocery store. And I was trying to think what I was going to cut. So do you have a crystal ball and you know, if things get worse, if people need to save, let's say, 10% of their spending and you look at a shopping basket, which one of your products would they buy less of or change to a cheaper brand? Everyone of course would love to have a crystal ball and again, the situation right now is pretty volatile and very, very hard to read because you're having the economic uncertainty, you're having some of the inflation that happened already. Plus then you have these very, very uneven and volatile year-over-year comparisons due to the pandemic. My personal guess is, it's not so much about cutting one thing or another. It is mainly about, you know, some will be trading down, so more of the trading down that we started to see. And that's why it's so important that we offer brands at different price points. The other obvious one in food is if you need to make and smite, eating out less is a quick way to do that because the value proposition between a meal and home and a meal out of home is vastly different. And of course, out of home is also hit by the labor constraints and some of the rising labor costs. Mark, thank you so much as subscriptions to cooking recipe websites increase. Mark, you know, they're too executive of Nestle, of course, on these results. Now coming up the UK Prime Minister prepares to face parliament with consumer inflation hitting a four-year high. We'll have plenty more of that shortly. This is Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4501,2022-10-19 08:55:56

16157," Apple's the laying its next major iPad software update, iPadOS 16 by about a month from September to October. Apple made the decision for a number of reasons, including a still buggy, stage manager multitasking interface, and in order to link the launch closer to the more similar Mac OS Ventura. Still, it's an unusual move. Since shifting the launches to the fall in 2011, Apple has released its new iPhone and iPad software updates simultaneously each year around September. By staggering the releases, users may find some issues around compatibility with cross-device features like retracting and editing messages in iMessage, the new shared iCloud Photo Library, and the new feature for transferring FaceTime calls between iPhones and iPads. It will also make it a bit harder for developers to launch apps that run on both the iPad and iPhone that require new APIs and features found across iPadOS 16 and iOS 16. Regardless, it was still of course the right move. Stage manager and iPadOS 16 is still quite buggy, I don't find it particularly intuitive, and it's not compatible with most iPads and many third party apps on the app store. The feature clearly needs some more polish, and complaints from consumers about stage manager will now no longer probably overshadow the earlier launch of the iPhone 14.

European equity markets kind of losing momentum as we go through today's session of strong dollar and higher rates in focus. Yeah, and they were the focus to an Asia overnight where we definitely didn't see that much momentum coming through after two days of rallying here in the United States. It was a mostly down day for Asian equities. You did have some outperformance coming from Japan, but with losses in China and Hong Kong, the MSTI Asia Pacific index is a whole down about eight tenths of one percent.

16158, the drag led by technology the Hengstang tech index down about four percentage points for like the Ali Baba 10 cent JD dot com all of those big weights on the Asian session again comes back to that higher rate story that Anna was just talking about and on the subject of higher rates we are seeing upward pressure on bond yields globally and Japan is not immune to that. Take a look at the 10 year JGB yield if you have your Bloomberg terminal up it'll show you that a 0.257 percent what is that above the 25 basis point cap that the bank of Japan would like to see on that 10 year JGB yield puts corona and go in a very difficult spot as we continue to see the Japanese yen weakening against the US dollar it is weaker once again this morning 149.44 is where we trade where you're pushing near 150 on dollar yen quite a puzzle for Japanese policy makers but of course that's not again exclusive story Matt pretty much everything is weaker against the US dollar. Yeah we do have the dollar still fascinating to see the yen getting back close to that record weakness we have S&P futures down although only marginally and it does look like it's the UK inflation numbers that pushed us down we had been up on futures throughout the night and we finished up in the cash trade yesterday more than 1 percent to about 3720 on the S&P 500 so much better than the 3630 500 levels that we've been seeing over the past few weeks. The US 10 year yield is coming back up as investors let go of that debt it's both a tailwind and a headwind for stocks obviously investors feel comfortable enough to let go of the perceived safety of government debt on the other hand as these yields rise they become a bigger competitor to stocks for returns. The Bloomberg dollar index is Kaley mentioned gaining 1343 is a level here and we have the dollar up against most major currencies today so dollar strength often a problem for stocks that could hold back a little bit of a rally and NIMX crude I just wanted to point out right now we're trading at just 83 dollars and 4 cents for West Texas intermediate and we've seen lows around 60 dollars highs at 125 so as we talk about the SPR story today keep in mind that we're still at a relatively low end of the range that we've seen for oil over the past year so and what do you see in terms of European stocks? Yeah well this is the picture for European stocks then Matt is pretty red pretty red across the board the Kekera on fairly flat but elsewhere we're seeing selling of European stocks in the main I should mention the Dutch market actually up by 4 cents of 1% tech stocks to the fall there broadly speaking an interesting data point just dropping on the Bloomberg the euro area September inflation number coming in at 9.9% this is a revision down from 10% that's the number we previously had in mind this is the final reading so at the end of the year we have a lot of the numbers to come down the fact that we're the right side then of that 10% double digit mark not so in the UK more on that in a moment this is what we're seeing on a couple of UK assets and this is the yield curve we've got here for you on gilts to the two year yields here the 30 year yield and you can see they're moving in opposite directions and that yes there's inflation number here but there's also the fact that we've heard from the Bank of England and what they plan to do with quantitative tightening it is going to be selling at the long end only at the short end and so in anticipation of that short end supply you see some selling going on there and those yields pushing higher so that's what we're seeing that flattening of the yield curve reflecting expectations around QT in the UK the other UK story is though as Matt mentioned what's going on in inflation will get more on this from Lizzie burden surely but really interesting to see the way the dollar gains the pound sales off as if the market is not really thinking about links between that inflation print and hiking central banks in the pound they're instead thinking about what that means in terms of weakness in the UK economy here's the German two year yield because we saw an incredibly weak we saw a weak auction when it came to the seven year part of the German debt curve but i put this in here because we're seeing actually more movement at the two year we are seeing some selling and some yields going higher that seems to be the broad story across what we're seeing in in the European debt markets today and Lloyd's in focus this is the banking group down by 4.3% today as we see the Chancellor in the UK getting ready to try and find all of that missing money essentially fill the holes in his fiscal his fiscal plans is he going to turn to energy companies is he going to turn to banks to try and increase taxation there there's already a surcharge on the banking sector above and beyond what is normal on corporation tax these are the six on куп equality companies,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4504,2022-10-19 09:09:43
16159," plans, is he going to turn to energy companies? Is he going to turn to banks to try and increase taxation there? There's already a surcharge on the banking sector above and beyond what is normal on corporation tax. That is something that those in the city are going to be pushing back against, but it is for the moment that fear weighing on banking stocks. Now let's stick with themes around the UK and go to Westminster as UK inflation returns to double digits, jump back over that 10% mark then for more, we're joined by Bluebeaks, Lizzie Burden who has the focus on that inflation print for us, your thoughts Lizzie? This is driven by food price growth, Anna, we're back to where we were in July, a 40 year high and significant that we're in double digits. I'm sure that there are members of the Monetary Policy Committee at the Bank of England who will be tempted by this to vote for a hundred basis points perhaps, but I have to say since quasi-quarting was replaced as chancellor with Jeremy Hunt, markets have paired back their expectations from that hundred basis points and now it's back to a debate between 75 and 100. We've also learned, as you say, from the Bank of England that they are going to get on with quantitative tightening after the Halloween budget, but they're not going to do it at the long end yet, which for me is a statement from the BLE to say we're re-prioritising this fight against inflation. We're not forever going to be a backstop for the government, but we have got a firm eye on financial stability, hence the compromise, because of course it's at the long end where you saw that market turmoil after the mini budget, but this really is a confident statement from the Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey. You have to wonder how many people are going to actually dress up as quasi-quarting's mini budget this Halloween. Lizzie, the financial times is reporting that the new chancellor could raid bank and energy company profits. What does that mean for the competitiveness of the UK? When you factor in that the third one of the other U-turns that Liz Truss has had to do is that she's actually going to raise cooperation tax and you throw in employment taxes as well, UK finances warning that London could be less competitive than other financial centres like Frankfurt and New York, and this at a time when Liz Truss has raised the stakes and said that her premiership is going to be all about growth, growth, growth. So it's a very difficult challenge to meet, but of course Jeremy Hunt really needs to plug this 40 billion pound hole in the public finances. At the other end of the spectrum we're hearing that he's asked all government departments bar health and defence to shade 15% off their budgets. He's not even guaranteeing that he'll protect pensions when pensions are such an impension as such an important constituency for the Tory party. So Liz Truss facing Prime Minister's questions later today she'll have to hope that she can give the performance of her life because Hunt is meeting back bench Tory MPs at 5pm today if she can't pull it off could be curtains for Truss today. All right well we'll look forward to your reporting throughout the day. Bloomberg's Lizzy Berlin from Westminster thank you so much. Meanwhile here in the US Minneapolis, Fed President Neil Kashkari says the Fed can't pause hikes if inflation is still rising. If we don't see progress in underlying inflation or cornflation I don't see why I would advocate stopping at 4.5 or 4.75 or something like that. So essentially 4.5% doesn't necessarily mean they're done and later today we'll get another take we'll hear from St. Louis Fed President Jim Bollard who will be speaking with Bloomberg at 3.30pm New York time 8.30pm in London. Anna. Now Netflix shares are up after the streaming giants stemmed its subscriber losses in the third quarter. Hit shows like season 4 of Stranger Things helped it to add 2.4 million members beating expectations. Reed Hastings chairman and co-CEO of Netflix spoke yesterday. Well thank god we're done with shrinking quarters. So that's a big feeling of we're back to the positivity. We still got FX so that's a huge hit you know as we've explained so that's not going to go away. But other than that all the stars are lining up very well for us. Reed Hastings there let's get the latest then on this business Aggie Cantrell joins us up a Lin-based tech reporter. Aggie is the worst over then for Netflix can we say that after they've turned this corner. So essentially when you're looking at the subscriber numbers for",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4505,2022-10-19 09:13:26
16160," Maggie, is the worst over the internet place? Can we say that after they've turned this corner? So essentially when you're looking at the subscriber numbers for this quarter, that has massively beat estimates. That's incredibly important for Netflix, especially seeing as that subscriber growth has been such a metric that they have stopped you for so long. It's been crucial for them to indicate their growth and for the last two quarters that has been very bad for the company. So going forward, they're also projecting further subscriber growth over the holiday period, over the fourth quarter this year. And that's going to be, that is an important figure for them. But it's also interesting to point out that the company themselves have been saying now that they're moving away from talking about subscriber growth as of a key focus. They're going to be looking more at revenue as a whole. This is also incorporated into the fact that the company is now looking at bringing in an ad-based option for people who want to pay a lower amount, but will also have ads per hour on the platform. And so they're now looking at focusing on top-line revenue more than they are on subscriber growth. OK, Agu, so they'd like us to look at the top line. But what about the bottom line when it comes to profitability, especially considering the stronger dollar? What kind of dilemma does that pose for Netflix? So they have flags the fact that sales and profits will be impacted by the stronger dollar. And it's important to note that essentially Netflix sees itself as a very global business. It's got local language content in a huge amount of the countries in which it operates. And that in order to get subscribers not only in the US, but overseas as well, they also are concerned about the price pressures on consumers, especially in the time when incomes are being squeezed. And when inflation is essentially requiring people to look at their pocketbooks and see where they can save money. And so in order to go forward and gain more subscribers and gain more revenue going forward, they need to make sure that they're able to offer something at a price point that people can afford. Aggie, thanks very much, Brimberg. Aggie Cantrell with the latest on that particular tech story over to Wall Street, to Wall Street banks, the biggest US banks keep adding to their work force apparently. Even as executives talk of scaling back, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citi, JP Morgan, and Bank of America, almost all of them, is net all reported increased hate counts for the quarter of the six largest US banks, only Wells Fargo cut the size of its staff. Brimberg's Charlie Wells joins us now for more Charlie. Good morning again. I mean, we know about the tightness of the labor market broadly in the United States. We thought the things weren't going to look a little different, perhaps, given the rhetoric we've heard from banking executives. Well, this is really striking because it, for some deals, seems that some of these banks had been an incredibly slow spring, an incredibly slow summer. And the fear was that the guillotine was going to fall in the autumn. But the numbers just aren't showing that. It seems like the guillotine may be going in a different direction. So at five of the six largest banks actually had count was up on the quarter and it was up on the year. If you zero in on Goldman, actually compared to last year, there had counts up 14% from last quarter. It was up 4.5%. Now that's 2,000 jobs. This is despite the fact that, of course, Goldman has brought back those goals, those annual performance reviews to take low performers out of the firm. That doesn't seem to have started yet. That hasn't seemed to trickle through just quite yet. In terms of rates, in terms of FX, the traders have really made a huge difference in revenue this quarter, saved the quarter in a lot of instances. Yeah, Matt, that's a good point. So the traders have sort of saved the deal makers here. And they've actually given trading desks their best third quarter ever when you look at rates and when you look at currencies. If you look at the five largest banks on Wall Street, their fixed income trading teams brought in revenue that was up 22% so that beat expectations. If you look at Bank of America, they had no trading lost days. And that is pretty striking, especially when you compare that, of course, to investment banking fees across Wall Street, those were down over 50%. Now this takes us back to that question that we were talking about before about jobs. When do we start to see some of these teams that have literal tumble weeds blowing across their floors start to see some headcount reductions? All right, Bloomberg's Charlie Wells. I can see that image. Thank you so much. Now let's get back to the US equity markets and take a look at some stocks moving in three market trading. I want to come to the US.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4506,2022-10-19 09:18:04
16161," All right, Bloomberg's Charlie Wells. I can see that image. Thank you so much. Now let's get back to the US equity markets and take a look at some stocks moving in pre-market trading. One of them being United Airlines. It reported after the bell yesterday and it's more about the guidance. It's guidance for profitability in the fourth quarter earnings per share. That nearly double what analysts expected. They expect EPS to between $2.25. So that is giving a nice lift to the shares that really underscores the demand still there in the aviation space United up about 6.2% before the bell. Now of course, we also just ran through Netflix's numbers with Aggie. I would note though that it's not just translating into Netflix's shares, which yes, are higher in pre-market trading this morning. But the more positive you on subscriber additions is lifting other streaming related companies as well. Roku up 3% in Disney up about 2.5%. It is a very different story for one stock though, and that would be Olaplex. They make hair care products like those fancy shampoos. It cut its outlook for the full year, citing a slowdown in sales momentum and you are definitely seeing a big impact on the shares in pre-market trading down and whopping 42.5% before the bell ended. Wow, that is a sizable move. Coming up on the program then, Ekeli, we will get to what's happening in equity markets more broadly. Bayart, a man, he joins us, head of European equity strategy at Sissy. What do we brace for over the winter? And the White House is open to releasing more crude from US emergency reserves. More on how that could affect the midterm elections ahead, the politics of oil, of course. This is Blaine Bay. All right. Materials samples brought back from objects in space can shed light on billions of years of our solar system's history, including details about the origin of life here on Earth. But picking up rocks from the surface of an asteroid or planetary satellite isn't as easy as it sounds. It requires voyages of millions of miles to bodies that have never been seen up close. Probes need to land on surfaces with weak gravitational poles where the surface terrain is completely unknown, gather samples, and then make the long trip back. And while behemoths like NASA and SpaceX grab headlines, it's a relatively young space agency. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, better known as Jaxa, that is taking the giant leap necessary to bring the mysteries of space back down to Earth.

We tend to believe that all consumers are equal there now. Welcome back to Bloomberg Surveillance. Early edition, I'm Matt Miller with Kaley Lines in New York and Edwards with us out of London. We are taking a look at the front end of the curve right now and the spread between historic terminal rates and the two-year yield. Historically, it's pretty big. It's been diminished of late, but right now, if you take what the market is predicting as the peak rate of almost 5 percent and the two-year yield, it looks like we have a long way.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4507,2022-10-19 09:22:44
16162," of late, but right now if you take what the market is predicting as the peak rate of almost 5% and the two-year yield, it looks like we have a long way to go. Another 50-basis point higher, maybe we could eclipse 5%. Joining us now is Venron Bloomberg, markets live team leader to tell us about his theory that we could see a pretty big return on the two-year treasuries. Venron, that's absolutely right. We've got two-year treasuries, we've had miserable years so far and it looks like that's going to continue because as you said, in a 5% to terminal rate, two-year yields will climb to about 545 by my calculations and that's what the history shows. That is predicted on a 5% terminal rate. Now, the terminal rate has been a moving target in this cycle as we have seen. The event started with the terminal rate of 2.1% at the start of the year if we remember. Now, that's pushed up to 4.6% and the market's surprising 5.5%. And if inflation continues to pose the Fed to keep going, i.e., if the terminal rate is pushed out to say 5.5%, 6%, then skies the limit on the two-year yield really, I mean, we could go to much higher than 5%, we had more, more be a say on Bloomberg TV the other day that interest rates may go to 9%. We'll be guided if it happens. They will be chaos in the markets. Yeah, nine. That was a staggering call from him. Then, thinking about the UK guilt market, then, it's been quite a journey in recent weeks, of course, up and then down again in terms of those long-end yields. Now, it seems that the guilt curve is pricing in what the Bank of England says is going to do. Is that what's driving things? We've had the inflation print today, but, of course, the Bank of England has set out their QT plan and it doesn't involve the long-end. Absolutely, and I think that the markets are moving much more to what the B.O.E. is going to do going forward. And the B.O.E. is terminal rate as priced in by the markets. It's much higher than even the Fed's. And the markets are looking at 5.30 and probably 5.54 for the B.O.E. And we are at the B.O.E. is at 2.25 now. So there's a long way for the B.O.E. to go. And it's a similar story for the front deals. We have had a miserable year for front-end deal deals and they're going to face yet more losses. And as you mentioned, the QT is going to be focused on the front end, which means even more supply for the front end to confront. And that will push yields much higher. So we are looking at, you know, a much more volatility, realize volatility on the front end. Then, thanks so much. Thanks for joining us, Ben Ram from the Bloomberg Market's Live team.

Bloomberg markets to close weekdays on Bloomberg. This is Bloomberg's surveillance early edition. I'm Kayleigh Lines with Matt Miller in New York and Anna Edwards in London. Now keeping you up to date with news from around the world, here's the first word. Ukraine's military claims 13 drones made in Iran were shot down in the Mika Lai of region overnight. It happened as officials have reported more attacks against the country's infrastructure. The Biden administration is pressing Congress for new authorities to speed up production and transfer of weapons for Ukraine. Hong Kong chief executive John Lee has unveiled a plan to woo back foreign talent and ease housing woes. It's an attempt to revive the city status as an international finance hub. Lee announced he would cut property duties for non permanent residents and relax piece of rules. Years of tough COVID-19 policies and political turmoil have triggered a brain drain in the city. And Mitsubishi UFG financial group has said to be evaluating an acquisition of some loan portfolios from Credit Suisse to expand its US business. Japan's biggest lender is also vetting bundles of the Swiss banks global loans in various sectors. Credit Suisse is racing to race funds with just over a week to go until the unveiling of a critical turn around. And of course, Anna that plan could potentially include thousands of job cuts and a significant re-chaping of the business. Yeah, we wait for a fuller picture of that re-shaping of the Credit Suisse business. Not a day seems to go past when we don't have a story about somebody circling for something at Credit Suisse. When we come back, we'll talk to Baylta Manthy, head of equities at CISI will get a take on European stocks. This is Blueback.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4509,2022-10-19 09:31:23
16164," andczęqu Crunchy I think talent becomes the single biggest differentiator of a successful entity versus the most successful entity. So you've got to do everything possible to hire, train, retain, put your arms around the table. So you've got to do everything possible to hire, train, retain, put your arms around the table. I mean, you really got to focus on your talent. In the past, it's always been given money. I show them that they have an upward mobility and can make even more money. And that's the only reason people come to earth. I think post-pandemic, we're seeing more and more people say, I have to worry about me as a person, I have to worry about my family. I want to worry about my well-being, my mental health. So we've got to start encompassing people as holistic humans as opposed to the tool of the train, which means that we have to engage with their head, heart, and hands. Not just head and hands, the heart has been engaged. So we have to be sure more empathy, show that we care that their citizens and the community, their members and family, and all of those have to come into consideration as we help an executive or an employee, be an employee and be a person to the community and the family. The stakes are higher. This is Bloomberg's Abelence Early Edition. Here's what you need to know. 40-year-high UK inflation returns to double digits intensifying pressure on the government and the Central Bank to act. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Trust faces Prime Minister's questions with her premiership in question. The return of Netflix shares in the streaming giant Surge as subscriber growth signals the worst may be over after a string of disappointing results. And Wall Street continues to add, headcount, the biggest US banks are expanding their workforces, even as executives talk of cutbacks. I'm Anna Edwards in London with Matt Miller in Kaley Lines in New York and Matt. European equity markets finding it hard to continue the enthusiasm we've seen at the last couple of days today, although the focus has been on a recovering or at least resilient profitability story from global corporates but also a strong dollar. Yes, and the concern, of course, in Europe has really been the inflation picture. That also dragged US futures down for about an hour but we're back up in depositive territory. Take a look right now at S&P futures up just two tenths of 1%. But after a pretty strong close yesterday, we were up 1.2% to 37.20 on the S&P 500 yesterday after a couple days of very strong rallies. So we could see further gains in just about four hours when the US equity market opens. Investors are willing to let go of the perceived safety of government debt. Although that does mean that the 10-year yield climbs well over 4% in fact. You can still find 4% yields across the curve. And we just heard Ven Ram saying he thinks the two years is going to go to five. That could be a headwind for equities as then bonds provide a pretty serious competition in terms of returns. Bloomberg US dollar index gains today of about 3.10s of 1%. 1343.50 the level we can see it gaining against most major currencies. And Kaylee was just showing us that the yen is now trading at almost 150 per US dollar. So real weakness there. And then 9x crude right now up about 1.2% 80%",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4510,2022-10-19 09:34:51
16165," Yen is now trading at almost 150 per US dollar. So real weakness there. And then NIMEX crude right now, up about 1.2%, 83, 80 is the level. So relatively low in the range that we've seen over the past year, between about $65 and $125. And yet we're talking about releasing more oil from the strategic petroleum reserves. We'll hear about that a little bit later on in the program. Kelly, what do you see in terms of pre-market movers? Well, we got to talk about some of these earnings, Matt, including from Netflix after the bell yesterday. Maybe the worst is indeed over it. The very least, there are no longer losing subscribers after two quarters of that. They added 2.4 million subscribers in the third quarter. Plus they expect to add another 4.5 million more in the current period. So yes, you have some dollar headwinds that play there. But overall, investors seem pretty positive on the picture for Netflix now. If the stock is up 12.8% before the bell. Also a big move for United Airlines after its own report and forecast for the current period. It thinks profit in the fourth quarter is going to come in more than double what analysts had anticipated. So that stock up 6.2% pretty strong picture in the airline space right now. Intuitive surgical also beating on the top and bottom line. It's up about 10% before the bell. But plunging to the downside is all a flex. They make shampoo and other hair care products. Seeing slowing sales growth momentum, though, cutting their full-year forecast has a result. And that's down to whopping 42% or so before the bell. So those are big moves. Not such big moves now. Overall, when it comes to European stocks, half an hour ago, we looked and we were negative across European equity markets. We started out in positive territory. So we've been fluctuating. Now we're pretty flat really across the European stock 600. Entirely flat, let's say. We have some strength to the technology sector. Certainly that's lifting the Dutch markets and weakness in the banking sector in the UK. So some divergent moves across different geographies. Here's a bit of the UK story, though, in the shape of the guilt curve and the difference moves. We're seeing a different end of it. We've got the two-year yield at 3.6, the 30-year at 4.17, moving in opposite directions. We heard from the Bank of England, they are planning to redo or get back to that quantitative tightening path that they focus back on inflation. And it is going to be pretty much on the schedule that we thought. But they're not going to be putting some of those long end bonds back into the market. They won't do QT at the long end for the time being. Because of the volatility we've seen at the long end of the curve and so the market adjusts accordingly. This is the German two-year yield. I put this in here because on the GNN function, this one stood out as being the more outsized or unusual move in terms of what we're seeing on sovereign debt markets this morning. But it was the seven-year where we saw record low levels of demand actually in Germany. Although I should say those records only go back to the middle of 2020, but still, weak demand coming through for that issue as concern about on a European context more broadly, not just in the UK, then, whether we're going to see indigestion in bond markets, Kayleigh, if we see governments issuing, of course, to shore up the consumer and also seeing the ECB slowly, slowly pivoting towards QT. OK, so a lot of questions remaining in the UK bond market for sure. Anna, let's talk about how that translates to the equity market. Vietamant, the head of European equity strategy at city is joining us now. Vieta, you have 10.1% inflation in the UK. Major questions around the feed of the bond market, the feed of the new government, fiscal policy in general. Why do you favor it here? Very good question. Indeed, inflation came a little bit about the market expectations in line with city economies forecast to be fair. And what it means is that the Bank of England will continue to hike. So we expect 75 basis points hike at the next meeting in the beginning of November. And further hikes going down the line up to around 4.25 terminal rate. But of course, perhaps it sounds counterintuitive that despite all the chaos that has been happening in the UK bond market recently, actually we continue to favor the UK market. But what you have to remember is that the UK, and I'm talking FTSE 100 here, is really not a play at all on the UK economy. Actually, there is almost no relationship between the direction of the EPS for FTSE 100 and the direction of the GDP for the UK economy. It's the most international market. 70% revenues comes from abroad. Plus, so the most obvious transmission mechanism and the most important transmission.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4511,2022-10-19 09:39:50
16166," international market, 70% revenues come from abroad. Plus, the most obvious transmission mechanism, and the most important transmission mechanism, is really the weakness in the pounds, which is helping these big multinationals. So we continue to... Yes. So this UK is our favourite value market, continues to be. OK, I wanted to ask you about that, BRT. Yeah, you have to go down to the smaller cap, so you get a reading on the UK economy. But thinking about the strength of the dollar, and what impact that has on your universe. We obviously heard from Netflix overnight, and that plays into this theme that the strength of the dollar does hurt some of the big multinationals in the United States, when they bring those foreign currencies back into dollars. And you've talked about how it helps some of the big UK multinationals. Does it help other European businesses, Eurozone businesses, or are other factors just bigger than the assistance they would be getting from the strong dollar? Well, and dollar strength in the risk of and shrinking economy is not good for anyone, right? So just about the US equity market can... can weather it a little bit better. But when... So, as I said, the UK has the biggest share of multinationals and revenue coming from abroad. But actually, for the Eurozone, it's around 40, 45 percent down from the 70 percent for FUZI-100. So you also have companies that do benefit from the weakness in the Euro, and that's something that our city equity research analysis are highlighting a lot, and it is at the core of their things for relative bullishness on some stocks. Beato, we talk so much about monetary policy that it almost makes you sick. And we don't hear as much about fiscal policy. Do you expect that we're going to see some big moves, especially big European-shared debt? So that's a very fair point, and of course, everybody is betting on this scale of stimulus that could help to limit the downside, because I don't think anybody at that point doubt that the Eurozone economy or UK economy is going into recession, or it's already in the recession, right? But what worries our economies is the reaction function of the market to the big fiscal stimulus out of the UK and the U.T. and the government had to do on it. And of course, what it does now limits, it takes the floor from the downside, that means worse contraction in GDP and probably a bit higher innovation in the UK. And some European governments might take notice from the reaction of the market to the stimulus out of the UK. So perhaps we'll get a little bit less out of Germany than previously anticipated, and it remains to be seen what other European governments are going to come out with. It's not yet finalized, but I'm sure they are taking notice of the experience of the UK. Yeah, being in the UK is like living in a financial petri dish. It feels at the moment, pay out there. Let me ask you what's going on with gas prices, and whether this could be something that actually turns into a relative to weak expectations, a positive figure of P and corporates, because gas prices, yes, they're really elevated, still over 100 euros per megawatt hour, but they're way down from those highs around 350. Of course, a lot will depend on the weather. Yeah, well, that would be a very welcome fact if the gas prices continued to come down, right? But we worry that, you know, we haven't got into the winter yet. There are lots of uncertainties and our commodity strategies think that there is going to be a huge volatility in the gas price, and also in the energy prices. So I worry we are not out of the woods yet, but definitely that would be very welcome by the market. And of course, would limit the upside to inflation and perhaps the reaction function of the central banks in terms of hiking, right? Yeah, even if longer term gas strategies are still in question. Bialda, thank you very much for joining us. Bialda, Manti, joining us there from Cici. Coming up on the program, we will talk cars, Tesla reports after the bell today.

16167," We will talk cars, Tesla reports after the bell today. More on what to expect from the auto makers results next, this is Big Back. The deal was the brainchild of Apollo CEO Mark Rowan. In January, Apollo closed its $11 billion all stock merger with a theme holding. It had already owned 35% of the insurer. Here's what Apollo gets out of the deal. Assets under management. Apollo expects them to double to about a trillion dollars by 2026. Much of that projected growth will come from the merger. And those assets are especially attractive to Apollo. Insurance companies typically go after much more modest returns than buyout investors. That will give Apollo more options for investing the cash. A theme is a steady provider of fee income. It is grown into one of the nation's biggest holders of fixed annuities. Those retirement savings products favored by risk adverse customers. The merger will also allow Apollo to simplify its governance. It gave up its dual class share structure and adopted a one share one vote plan. The hope is that will eventually lead to Apollo's inclusion in the S&P 500. No one covers the world like Bloomberg.

Bloomberg, your global business authority. This is Bloomberg's surveillance early edition on Matt Miller, R.K.L.I.N.S. in New York and Anna Edwards in London. Now, luxury car maker Rolls Royce has completed the first step towards fulfilling its promise to sell only electric vehicles by 2030. The CEO, Trusson Muller-Ottvess spoke about the company's EV transformation yesterday on Bloomberg. It's a prophecy fulfilled. Our four electric cars, once charging, is fixed and is available. And I think now we are here fulfilling his prophecy and we are very excited. And our clients are, I mean, it's the very first time that you can acquire the superluxury segment and electric cars. So it's the very first. And for that reason, we are also immensely proud that we are the first. Obviously, it's a true Rolls Royce and an electric Rolls Royce second. And that was very important for our clients. Are you going to put batteries in the colon and next? What's next for Rolls Royce in terms of electrification? Yeah, I mean, I can't talk today about, let's say, obviously all the next steps, but one promise is clear by end of 2030, Matt, we will be fully electrified. So every future Rolls Royce we're going to bring into the market, every new one is a fully electrified Rolls Royce. So we are seizing a building combustion engine cars and a beginning of 2030. Trusson, let's talk about the profitability that is going to be with you when you make this full move to electrification. You make a lot of money off building traditional ice engine cars. Your margins have been phenomenal. Are you going to be able to make?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4513,2022-10-19 09:47:33
16168," You make a lot of money off building traditional ice engine cars. Your margins have been phenomenal. Are you going to be able to match those margins when you go all electric? Yes, definitely, because that was always on my mind. When we have the plan to go electric, that is not a plan that was born a year ago or whatever. We basically came into it when we experimented for the very first time over ten years ago with a prototype of an electric fentom. And the client feedback was always fabulous. It fits to the brand great. But obviously we also knew that one day we go completely electric and for that reason contribution margins per car are untouched. They are as strong as they have used to be also in the past. For that reason, no worries. Rose Royce will stay a profitable, very profitable company. That was the CEO of Rolls Royce Motor Cars, Torsten Moulier, Autos speaking to me and Guy Johnson. Joining us now is Craig Trudeau, Bloomberg's global autos editor. So Craig, we got the first electric Rolls Royce, the specter on the kind of on the fentom platform. What does this mean for the industry? I think it's going to be really interesting to see how this one is received. I mean, obviously we're still a ways off actually from deliveries. We're about a year out from this actually going to customers. But you know, this is, I'll be very interested to see the weight, the sort of specs of this one, because it is quite a bow. 659 pounds. That's the spec Matt, I should know better than to wonder what the specs are because I should have just shared that. But you know, this is an absolute boat. It is a car that is going to be quite an investment. I do think it was interesting what we heard from the company in terms of their expectations for the returns on this. And it'll be interesting to see if they're able to actually execute. They sort of talk a big thing about expectations being the same for these as their combustion cars. I do think that the early iterations are likely going to be extremely costly. And you're going to have to, you know, naturally try some new things to make such a fundamental change. And what are you selling? And what are risks, right? I mean, to disappoint a Rolls Royce customer would be a giant problem for the brand. Indeed, that car is heavier than the Colonyne, which is their gigantic SUV. Much lighter cars coming out of Tesla, of course, tried and true over the last 10 years. We're going to get earnings after the bell. What do you expect, Craig? So I think the big question is just going to be about demand. I think, you know, just three months ago, we were in the same position where Elon Musk and the CFO, Zachary Kirkorn, were being asked about this. And whether the macro situation was, you know, dragging a little bit. I think they sort of, you know, got a little bit, you know, exhausted with that question because they've sort of, you know, answered any questions about that quarter after quarter or going back years now. But then they sort of delivered a bit of a dud just in the last few weeks in terms of their third quarter numbers. And production significantly exceeded deliveries last quarter. And so I think, you know, they're going to be in a similar, you know, seat three months later, having to really address that head on. And I think, you know, this sort of excuse that they're trying to move away from this end of quarter rush and, you know, kind of smooth deliveries out. I don't know that the street necessarily took that and stride. Yeah, we've heard that haven't we? The stock then, here today, Craig down 35% or so. And one of the things that has weighed is the link between this company and Twitter and what Elon Musk wants to do with Twitter. Are we looking to get anything further on that today? I think that's also a topic that may come up. I was surprised that it didn't really factor a whole lot in last quarter's earnings call. But I do think that, you know, the big sort of concerns and overhangs there are twofold. It's, you know, how much of a distraction is this going to be for you, Elon? And two, are you going to have to sell more shares? He's obviously sold quite a bit of his stake already. He's still by far the largest shareholder. But there is a concern that if he has to do some more selling, is that also, you know, going to drag on the stock? Yeah, absolutely. And also, if you have your chief executive officer making decisions.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4514,2022-10-19 09:52:26

Nutri-Genomics and Precision Nutrition is one of those rare scientific fields that overlaps with the Instagram friendly wellness industry. There is a lot of interest in this idea of personalized nutrition and especially how accessible it is to the public. You can go on Google and type personalized nutrition or diet and genes and you will find dozens of different companies that offer this nutrition precision tests. One of those companies is Routine. Routine claims that their personalized tests stemming from sciences like Nutri-Genomics make their supplements different. But even with the claims from routine as well as dozens of other personalized nutrition companies, the science still has a long way to go. Hey, so you've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. They have been in and seen it. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloomberg. Lots of Bloomberg. Lots of Bloomberg. Lots of Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? It means they have a Bloomberg. I think the market that over the past few weeks has made it clear it wants to go higher. It got a little spooked by the idea that geocolatal potential rises. This is Bloomberg's surveillance early edition. I'm Matt Miller in New York with Anna Edwards out in London. Let's take a look now. What's ahead today on the data docket, US MBA mortgage applications, building permits, housing starts, all coming as well as the Fed beige book. We're going to hear more from the Fed presidents as well, including a Bloomberg interview with Jim Bullard. You don't want to miss. As we were talking about before, Tesla reports after the bell, interesting to see the demand there, Craig was just telling us. And President Biden is expected to announce a plan to release 15 million barrels more of oil from the US emergency reserves. He may consider significantly more this winter. Tesla has been under attack on gasoline prices as midterm elections near and the question is, will depleting our emergency reserves do anything about that? Yeah, let's get...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4515,2022-10-19 09:56:15
16170," This is as midterm elections near and the question is, will depleting our emergency energy reserves do anything about that? Yeah, let's get some analysis on this. Then Paul Wallace, Bloomberg Energy and Commodities Editor is with us. And Paul, is it a market relevant or political relevance, do you think that we're seeing this release announced by the US administration? And perhaps more significant, the flagging that more could come. Hi, Anna. I think after OPEC pluses' decision earlier this month to cut oil production, that markets and traders did expect the Biden administration to release these 50 million barrels of oil that it's mentioned. And this is the final tranche of that massive 180 million barrel sell down that Biden announced last year. So in and of itself, it's not too important. But I think that because of what OPEC plus did, this probably just did a little bit to ensure that the White House would sell down this final tranche rather than holding off or perhaps waiting until next year. We talked yesterday on radio with Scott Levine from Bloomberg Intelligence. He's a senior energy analyst for us here. He said, you know, it's not really the oil supply that's the problem in terms of US pump prices. It's refining capacity. Is there anything the administration can do to boost that? That sunny is a massive problem on you. If you look at the spreads between crude oil and diesel and gasoline, they're absolutely huge. And refiners are making huge big, big margins at the moment. In the short term, there is little the US can do. I mean, it can't increase capacity because that takes years. That takes years and years. It can import more products, but the global market itself is very tight. I mean, if you look at product spreads in Asia and Europe, they're also extremely high too. So I think this tightness in the diesel and the gasoline markets is going to persist. There's simply no obvious solution to getting out of this. If anything, it might tighten further when we see the EU ban sea-borne imports of diesel and gasoline from Russia early next year. Is there anything that is this in any way an answer to OPEX cuts? From Biden, yes. I think this is possible they would have held off on this final tranche of SPR releases until later in the year or even next year if OPEX had held steady rather than cutting production. But I think there is a real concern at the White House within the White House and within the US administration that crude prices are going to go up even further. Okay, Paul, thanks so much for joining us. Paul Wallace with the latest on the oil markets. Still to come on Bloomberg TV, we'll get the White House take on oil reserves. We will speak to Armors Holkstein, who is a special presidential coordinator for global infrastructure and energy security. We'll see this is Bloomberg. So you build a successful company but you may not.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4516,2022-10-19 10:00:40
16171," So you build a successful company, but you might not want to run it for the next 10, 15, 20 years, or do you? And if you didn't, would you want to go into government, if the president called you to serve our country? Would you go into government, or would you start another company? I love what I do, and I feel like I have this luxury with 23 me that it keeps evolving. You know, we started out just as a, you know, started out a consumer company. We're thick in research. We got into drug discovery in 2015, and now we're getting to the delivery of care. So I've been really lucky with 23 me that it's been endlessly interesting. And I'm surrounded by incredibly talented, brilliant individuals where I learn from them. And what I always advise people to do is like, you should keep, you should take jobs where you're learning. And if you stop learning in the job, then you should quit. And like, frankly, when people leave 23 me, like, I say, if you're not learning anymore, you should move on. So I'm 100% committed to 23 me. That said, my other passion is other direct to consumer, like I want to build out a true consumer empowered healthcare world. Like one that is outside of the existing system. And I do, there's no greater force than government. Every Friday with 30 minutes dedicated to fixed income, I'm Jonathan Farrow. This is Bluberg-Royote. What you're going to see dominate over the next couple of months is volatility. There's still work to be done. I think before we can say this, fair markets over. High global interest rates, lower equity prices and a stronger dollar, we think will continue into year end. I think people understand that if you're a longer term investor, eventually the tide will turn. There's so much fear out there and it's been priced in. So I think we get this little bounce. This is Bluberg's surveillance with Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow and Lisa Abrahmowitz. Good morning, everyone. Jonathan Farrow, Lisa Bramson, Tom Keane, I'm Radio, I'm Television, an interesting week, a new last week of economic data. And yes, the equity markets will get to that here in a moment. John Farrow is off today at a symposium, Kaley Lines, which is a good and beautiful thing. Future's up 19 down, futures up 98. I don't know where to start. I got to go big picture, 60,000 feet lease at 10.1% inflation is not 9.9% inflation. You're talking about the United Kingdom coming in high yet again, another CPI print. And to me, this is what stands out. Inflation reads keep coming in hotter than expected, which is the reason why Fed officials and other central bankers are getting worried. You can hear it in the rhetoric and markets are pricing in much better. And markets are pricing. We see on the Bloomberg screen today that inflation adjustment here. I don't know where to start. I'll start with a 10 year real yield. Is John doing the 10 is the real yield on Friday? The real yield is on Friday. John Farrow is not. He's not here. He's not so bad. I'm so bad at home. We'll talk about his sabbaticals. Yeah, he's giving a paper. He's either a class goer at Enbarrel giving a paper. I'm meditation. Yeah, no, it's not. It's on something more than that. 1.64% on the 10 year real yield breaking out. Yeah, and if you look at the absolute nominal yield, it's the highest level going back to 2008 at least in the United States. So we're looking right now at people wondering where that neutral rate will be and how much has to be reset in markets given that we have a more expensive funding cost for a longer period of time. And on Wednesday, Kayla, I'm going to bring this in after talking to Emily Wilkins in Nevada yesterday, the midterms dawn. And it just is about inflation. There's another way to. We have less than three weeks to go and the economy is number one. And what is the most present, perhaps, to the American people other than gas prices, which is why we see the US administration making its next move the next tranche on the tapping of the strategic petroleum reserve.

And there's only so much that the Biden administration can do to control the price of the pump. Yeah, but it's your point, Tom. At what point is it an emergency? How do they justify this from a pricing standpoint? I don't have this. How empty is the salt mine? How empty are we emptying? The lowest going back to the early 1980s. That's going to take a look at that, yeah. Okay, over to the equity market. It's not the Queens gamut. It's Netflix's gamut. They get a big pop here. I see all the other financial media surging in that. Come on. The thing is crater, right? Yeah, we have to keep in mind the levels it's coming off of. But a double digit move in pre-market trading is nothing to sneeze at. And really the story is just that they are no longer losing subscribers. That's really it. Is it the worst is over? Perhaps, but again, it's not the kind of growth we were seeing from Netflix in years past. You talked about who's watching Netflix anymore. All the kids are watching Jeffrey Dahmer, which is actually the challenge. It's a huge notch. I feature that was screening yesterday. Yeah, and honestly, I mean, this is what they're all talking about. And I think to myself, really, you guys are, it's spooky to show about a serial killer and someone who eats people. I mean, go figure it, but that seems to be using the numbers right now. Sweetie's, sweetie's, Paul folks, Paul sweetie with us 9 a.m. I'm Bloomberg at radius, truly expert at this. And he really thinks the road ahead for the streamers is difficult. Equity markets, three days in a row. Up we go. I walked in it was red and green. And you know, to start the data check, Lisa, futures up 18 to our futures up 85 is another good day. Yeah, and how much is this on the heels of earnings that are better than expected? Of course, the expectations are beaten down completely. I'm looking at a dollar of strength across the board and the yen. I'm really focused on the yen breaking out to new post 1990 highs as people wonder whether the bank of Japan is going to intervene. And you also heard overnight, they continue to reiterate their confirmation. They're going to keep the yield curve control. Even as yields climb above that upward. Well, does that in the data, Kaylee? Very quickly, a Julian Emmanuel. I'm going to mention this a lot, folks, into earnings season every day at ISI out with an incredibly sharp memo. And he says, look, we're at a recession area average PE right now. Yeah, he points out that earnings are down about 5.3% with the companies we've seen reporting those far. It's about 50 of them or so in the S and P 500. But what's also notable is that you aren't necessarily seeing the huge downsides surprises. The average surprising, according to Julian Emmanuel, 0.8% and 1.1% respectively when it comes to earnings and sales. We'll go deeper on the data in a moment again. Futures up 18. The VIX won't move 30.78. To me, that's critical. The 10-year yield out to new highs, 4.06% two year, 4.47%. I need a brief. All right. Well, let's talk about Fezby because I know everyone's just dying. More of it. Minneapolis Fed President Neil Cushcarry speaking again. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, he's speaking twice. Chicago Fed President Charlie Evans, the beige book comes out at 2 p.m. Tom will be scouring through the beige book. Minneapolis Fed President Neil Cushcarry yesterday saying that if a core inflation does not stop accelerating, there's no reason for the Fed to stop hiking rates beyond 5.5 to 5.75%. Again, this goes to the scope for a higher yield going forward. Bullard stuck twice and Cushcarry talked yesterday and again today. Correct. What are these? These guys are like assistants. They're like senior economists at a Wall Street firm. Well, get out there. If you don't talk, you say it's a weird thing for yourself. You know, the more the more than Denver. Well, we're also getting a slew of earnings, which arguably may be more important than some of the Fed speak. I'm just suggesting, although maybe not proctor and gamble earlier this morning. That I actually most interested in just because it's a read on the consumer. Tesla and IBM after the bell and Netflix shares is to point to what we're seeing after the earnings 13.8% gain before the market. Also, you know, this morning United Airlines, I know that you're speaking later this morning to the CEO, that popping as well. More than 7% because people are still flying and people still have, you know, budgets to do. So even though they're really expensive and 115 PM, Kayleigh, this is to your point, President Biden is delivering remarks, an additional action to strengthen any energy security and lower costs. That's the way that he described it. Will he announce a release of the strategic petroleum reserve? But from where? I'm looking at diesel prices. We're focused on gasoline. diesel continues to surge. And if you look at the stockpiles, they're at some of the lowest levels that we've seen in a very long time going into winter time to me.

16173," We look at the stockpiles. There are some of the lowest levels that we've seen in a very long time going into winter time. To me, this is one of the most concerning issues because this affects everything that we do and everything that we buy. To me, it's all politics and it's around in the first Tuesday of November. Joining us now, this is important as Lisa mentioned and I guess we could go all year in, but we're not gonna do that. Kamakcha, Travetti joins us head of Global Foreign Exchange, illustrates emerging markets at Goldman Sachs. Kamakcha, I really wanna talk about my conversation and I am with the gentleman from Boost School, the former head of the Bank of India, but we're not gonna do that today. We're gonna talk about the Goldman Sachs dollar call. How do you determine when enough is enough on strong dollar? Look, I think we are still some way away from that. I think what are we learning? We're learning even over the last few weeks is that the U.S. economy still looks somewhat overheated, the unemployment rate is at a, historic low inflation, core inflation is at a historic high levels. And at the same time, you're seeing already some other central banks in the world starting to slow down the pace of their hikes. You've seen that with the RBA, we're probably gonna learn from the Bank of Japan next week that they're still maintaining yield curve control and you're seeing struggles on the UK side and it'll be an important question whether the Bank of England can deliver hikes that beat market expectations. So, FX is a relative game. The dollar remains first amongst equals in this and the FED looks the most unconstrained amongst global central banks. Let's talk about an absolute game, not just a relative game and when you talk about rates, increasingly the conversation is around, where we'll end up, post this disruption that we've seen inflationary-wise. How much do you see the likelihood of 0% interest rates? Post whatever this is, once we've worked through this cycle or we'll never see those again in our lifetime and are we going back to a more Steve Rashido-like 2% Fed funds rate as sort of the base case? Look, I think that it may be some time before we get back to low rates. I mean, I think the baseline, I think for many people and for us is going to be higher rates for longer, even under the most optimistic inflation projections, inflation comes down only very slowly. So, yes, at some point, some of these underlying pressures will fade. I think there are some encouraging indications, even in the CPI reports, whether it's good prices, some parts of the commodity complex have often compared to earlier in the summer. And over time, some of those other parts of CPI will fade as well. So, I think you will see inflation come down and rates come down as well, but I think it's going to be a pretty slow process. Welcome, Aksha. Finally, let's talk about where rates have stayed down and that would be in Japan. We have dollar yet now 149.45. We are very, very close to 150. What's the breaking point for Corota and his team if we're talking not just intervention, but potentially abandonment of yield curve control while we get there? We don't expect it, immediately. I mean, they have a meeting next week. We think yield curve control will be maintained. And I think that it's not the level of the currency, first say, even when you take into account their last intervention, what's already become apparent is that the beta of the dollar yen cross to the real rate differential has come down. They will, that's what they wanted to achieve. So, this is not about levels. It is about the speed of the move. We think dollar yen can move to 150 maybe even beyond that if these policy patterns just remain in place. Come on, actually quickly here. I've got to go to your PhD work at Oxford and India. We've just had another breakout of India to 84, 83 to the dollar. That seems a crisis. Is it a crisis or is it idiosyncratic urgency in India? It is not a crisis. I think what is happening here is India. Actually, the Rupi has been one of the better performing currencies across most of Asia versus the dollar. You had significant reserves being used to get that outcome. I think what you're seeing is that...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4519,2022-10-19 10:14:13
16174," currencies across most of Asia versus the dollar. You know, you had significant reserves being used to get that outcome. I think what you're seeing is a recognition that you don't want to keep using reserves. You don't want to draw a line in the sand when there is a broad dollar move. And yeah, we are having a broad dollar move and they're letting the currency to move alongside that. Great first brief for the morning. Thank you so much. Kamakcha Travedi with Goldman Sachs. As well, Lisa, I need an auction update. I didn't hear it in a brief. Any auctions today? No, that's why I didn't do an update. But this is going to be something that people are looking at. Is that enough for you? I told you about the base book. Why are you excited about the base book? I just, I have such honor for the late Richie Amarone of Bloomberg who did an improved base book. It was vastly superior. I get very little out of it. I don't know. Fugus, she's killing me. Fugus up 17. Downfugus up 81. The VIX 30.79. Kaley Lines is where this John Farrow is not.

Ukraine's military claims 13 drones made in Iran were shot down in the southern Mikhaili of region overnight. Now it happened as officials reported more attacks against the country's infrastructure. President Biden's administration is pressing Congress for new authorities to speed up production and transfer of weapons for Ukraine. Hong Kong chief executive John Lee has unveiled a plan to woo back foreign talent and ease housing woes. It's an attempt to revive the city's status as an international finance hub. Lee announced that he would cut property duties for non-permanent residents and relax visa rules. Years of tough COVID-19 policies and political turmoil triggered a brain drain in the city. An inflation is keeping travelers closer to home in the US. New data from Deloitte shows about 31% of American surveyed plan to travel between Thanksgiving and mid-January down from 42% in 2021. Financial concerns are the number one reason, the number of households that expect the economy to weaken next year, that also rose. Kakao Co CEO, Juan Nam Kong has resigned after a nationwide service outage that caused chaos in South Korea. Speaking at a news conference, now I'm going to apologize for the disruption to the country's top messaging and social media service, saying it will take a long time to recover people's trust.

When the price of anything goes up, the consequences reach far beyond what you'd expect, but perhaps most of all, when it comes to food. In 2010, surging food prices help spark the Arab Spring. Lives were lost, regimes fell, and the consequences are still with us. Once again, food prices are rising and fast. Energy costs, broken supply chains, and surging demand were just some of the factors that have driven food prices to their first record high since the Arab Spring.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4520,2022-10-19 10:18:39
16175,"izing and fast. Energy costs, broken supply chains, and surging demand were just some of the factors that have driven food prices to their first record high since the Arab Spring. And that's all before a war between two of the world's biggest food producers. Ukraine is called the Bread Basket of Europe, and taken with Russia the two account for about a quarter of global wheat trade. It's produced more than half of the world's sunflower seeds in oil, nearly 20% of the barley. Now throw in rising energy prices and processing, transporting, even refrigerating food gets more expensive. Plus, fertilizer production is extremely energy intensive. Less fertilizer means lower crop yield, and prices rise even more. The pandemic revealed how complicated and fragile global trade systems are. Global agriculture, perhaps even more so. Unlike metals, for example, food goes bad. And crops take months to grow and are vulnerable to unpredictabilities like the weather. Rising food prices will be felt everywhere, but the poorest countries in the world will be hit the hardest. And as all these factors compound, the real fear is that record high will lead to record high and ultimately to a global food crisis with vast consequence. Power, policy, politics, from the White House to the Hill. Bloomberg covers the leaders in legislation. That was really a tectonic shift for this White House. The theory of this bill, as I understand it, is there will be a multiplier effect. How to Democrats mobilize specifically younger voters. Bringing you the political news you need to know. The president has made it very clear that this is a significant focus. For the intersection of Wall Street and Washington, nobody covers politics like Bloomberg. Breaking out of traditional roles to become chief future officer like Maryott's Lenea Berg. One of the most important things is looking around the corner. Adrian Mitchell from Macy's. We have to let go of the traditional legacy department store. And Lucas Eremella at Mondelays. We tend to believe that all consumers are equal. They are not. Look for chief future officer on Bloomberg. We are all confused. What we need for the currency and the volatility to go away.

It seems as though this has been not only a difficult time for Liz Trust, but a make it a break at moment. And that comes in about 40 minutes. And Blummer's Lizzy Birdon is perhaps playing music out there in Westminster. And beyond Lizzy Birdon joining us now in London, Lizzy Helm, Port another PMQ's coming up in about 40 minutes time. Couldn't have put it better myself, Lisa. It is a make or break moment. Apparently Liz.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4521,2022-10-19 10:22:35
16176," and Lizzie Helmport and the PMQs coming up in about 40 minutes time. Couldn't have put it better myself, Lisa. It is a make or break moment. Apparently, Liz Truss has had extra prep this week because, of course, rhetorical flourish is not usually her strong suit. But this week, the care star, I'm a position label, it is likely to focus on austerity 2.0 as he does it because he needs to save another 40 billion pounds to plug the whole in the public finances. He said that he wants all government departments bar health and defense to shave 15% off their budgets. He's not even guaranteeing to protect pensions and pensions across a huge constituency, important constituency for the party. But at the other end, we're hearing that he might want to raid bankers, profits, energy companies, profits. So that could potentially make the UK less competitive when Truss wants grace, grace, grace. K the lines with this this morning, Kaley, what is I find interesting? This is not a Brexit analogy. All the analogies are back in 1976. Right. This is a very difficult moment for reasons aside from just politics. There's a huge economic question here, Lizzy, because, of course, you still have the energy cost burden, the cost of living crisis. That is evidenced by the fact that you 10.1% inflation in the UK and the data. We saw come out just this morning. How does that put additional pressure on the fiscal side with Truss? It's not just that though, with the Bank of England. Well, I was speaking to the Foreign Secretary James Clevverly earlier. He was floating around in Westminster. He did say that inflation, this figure is concerning because, yes, we are into double digits, which makes it even more worrying that Jeremy Hunt is not guaranteeing that he'll protect pensions. In terms of pressure on the Bank of England, it was already a debate between 75 and 100 basis points. But investors had paired back their bets from 100 when Quartang was replaced with Hunt. And this is only a slight beat on economic expectations. So perhaps it doesn't really move the dial. But the other interesting thing is that the Bank of England has said it's going to go ahead with quantitative tightening the day after the Halloween budget, except at the long end of the curve. So the B.O.E. really showing that it wants to fight inflation. It won't be beholden to the government, but it will keep an eye on financial stability. Confident foot forward from Andrew Bayley. So Lizzie, is it safe to say that the B.O.E. has been able to reclaim credibility? I think that Andrew Bayley is getting more plaudits for his handling of this. Then perhaps he was when he forgot how much he earned. Or he was making controversial comments about whether people should ask for pay rises in a cost of living crisis. He's won the game of chicken with Quartang, and this seems to be a pretty smart compromise on QT. Where are we right now when it comes to where they're going to go? Are they going to have to raise quite as much? And if they don't, can they curb inflation that today came in at the hottest pace going back decades? How do the people expected? I think it depends partly on how the labour market reacts. That's one of the reasons why you've seen this rise past the double-digit mark. There will be members of the committee who want to go for the 100 basis point hike just to front-load and clamp down on inflation expectations. But don't forget, given that Jeremy Hunt is taking away a lot of the sugar rush that Truss had wanted to offer to the British population, the recession risks are heightened. So we're back to this very difficult struggle of not wanting to add to that by hiking too aggressively. Lizzie Burton, thank you so much, greatly appreciate outside Parliament today in a perfect autumnal October day. In London, I want to go back to earnings. It's earnings season. We sort of been doing the Econobabble, maybe too much proctoring gamble today with a dividend growth of 5 percent in light world that doesn't get it done anymore. Right. Well, people are looking for it that much more because they're not getting it on the risk-adjusted return given where rates are. Just to give you a sense of what perhaps we can expect. Nestle's chief executive officer. Just put out the biggest increases in price going back decades. And just now price products. And now what you're hearing is a CEO saying there's more to come. So this is a real tension here. There has not been a pushback.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4522,2022-10-19 10:27:15
16177," Now, price products and now what you're hearing is a CEO saying there's more to come. So this is a real tension here. There has not been a pushback significantly against at least the world's biggest food company when they raise prices. When do consumers say no, Mos, we don't have that. What do you see, you're Kayleigh? Well, I just question what that means for the Federal Reserve because isn't what the Fed wants to see the demand destruction kicking in? The company's not being able to execute that kind of pricing power and pass on higher input costs. They want to see consumers pushing back against that. And if we're not seeing it yet, isn't that problematic? What don't you get? I just, I don't get the idea that monetary policy can manage the demand-shores choices of different cohorts, different deciles of the American public. I mean, there's a huge part of the world. There's a lot of them. Right. And there must be. But there's a lot, not. Right. And this is something you were talking about people sipping champagne and buying luxury goods. And this is sort of the other end of the spectrum. And then if you have food makers that, sure, they're able to pass along price increases that are bigger than they've seen in decades. But where is the marginal dollar not? I mean, if they're going to raise a price of my vintage well-aballs, some instant condition or 1993, 24-ounce, I'm still going to buy it. Do you still need to code high wax? No, I don't. That's still a thing. No, I don't. Yeah, for a while. You were the one that introduced me to it. Is that expensive? Yeah, it's going up. Too much. And it's going up. Yeah, even 10 went up. It was just terrible. It's time now for the Bloomberg Crypto Report. We do this on Wednesdays with Kaylee Lines, of course, the star of all having to do with what's the nuance of crypto that you learned yesterday? Honestly, I think what's interesting in crypto right now is it's arguably the least volatile of any asset class, which is the exact opposite of what we've gotten used to. But as we have monetary policy, oiling stocks, oiling bonds, crypto has stayed pretty static. It's almost interesting because of how uninteresting it's become. Are there more losses to come from? It's a good question. We have. scandals or non scandals? Well, that's always a big question mark when it comes to this space. But we've been in this range in and around 20,000 for months now. And nothing really seems to be a catalyst for a material breakout either way. I got a huge response from my interview. I think it was in Washington with the health of CFT. Yeah, watch that one. It's a good one. Well, you five people watched it, but what a battle. There's a huge regulatory question mark and definitely a turf war between Gary Gensler and the CFT. That covers crypto till the end of the year. Stay tuned. Bloomberg surveillance. Good evening. jest.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4524,2022-10-19 10:33:30

A piece of an asteroid is a piece of the earliest beginnings of a solar system. The picking up rocks from the surface of an asteroid or planetary satellite isn't as easy as it sounds. It requires voyages of millions of miles to bodies that have never been seen up close.

It's still the turmoil we see, 10.1 percent inflation per the UK. But with an equity lift here, our futures up seven right now, they'd give them back a little bit in the last 10 minutes. So the yield story, Lisa, help me here, two year yield, 4.48 percent. I'm still not used to it. Especially because the 10 year yield also rising. Again, this is not just a front end rising, long end declining. You're seeing it now 4.07 percent, the highest level going back to 2008. John Farrell on sabbatical. I'm unsure if it's Glasgow or Edinburgh, but he's at a symposium on the history of the Dow Jones industrial average. And he's giving a paper on the footsee in the Dow. He's only saying this because John's not here. It's just really, I think it's great. It's like a 42 page paper. Did you think about that last night? No, it's like that. No, he got a couple of kids at NYU Stern to write it for him as well. We're going to dig us right now as we can do with Kayleigh Lines and Lisa Abramowitz. And talk about the dog of the day, which is some Santa Barbara, California. Olaplex down to gazillion dollars today. And as we have proctor and gamble coming out today, we thought we'd go to anybody shampoo that's so expensive. Sephora doesn't even sell it. Kayleigh, tell us about down 45%. Yeah. Olaplex. I mean, it's brutal, but to your point, Tom, this is not cheap products. It's high end pair bonding. Girl stuff. Girl stuff. Yeah, exactly. This is the stuff I splurged on before my wedding. Oh, you use it. I have used this. The thing is though, it was just girl stuff by definition, a splurge. This is not drugstore shampoo. And what's interesting is they're seeing their sales slowing down. The analyst research this morning is pointing to reduce spending power on the part of the American consumer. If you're feeling crunched on the pocketbook, why would you spend $80 for a very small bottle of shampoo? But here's the other thing here. I mean, I think that there's a question. I'm not really spreading it. I was spreading it. I was spreading it. Yeah. There's no way you use it. I was spreading it. No, you don't. And you certainly don't use it on your hair. I'm looking right at olaplex shares down about 45%. It'll be market trading. To me, the takeaway is if you miss, given how low expectations are, you get pummeled. And to me, that's the upside, which is not that significant, unless you're saying Netflix. And the downside is really significant. And to me, this speaks to where people are, at least in sentiment. And to bring you this back to mind.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4524,2022-10-19 10:36:12
16179," Not that significant, unless you're saying Netflix. And the downside is really significant. And to me, this speaks to where people are, at least in sentiment. To bring you this back to my world, to me, it's like they're basically running it. They're doing it, hoping for a sellout to a larger company like Proctor and Gamble. And I would say that's all changed with the new risk-free rate. The world's changed. I would agree. Yeah. You can't just hope for a better future. The hope has been eliminated with rates now that are above 3% headed above 4%. And so how do we then reshape an entire world? This speaks to what you're talking about, Tom. When you talk about zombie companies, how many of those start to come out of the woodwork, both in the public and private side, as you start to reset, and not over the short term, Tom. But over the longer term, because people are talking about where that final risk-free rate will be. Number three, jump starts repair, deep within the hairspray. And I'm working. It's usually used number 3, 4, and 5 together. It's a system. You have a machine here. And when you use this stuff. Oh, wouldn't that be nice? No, but I think Lisa's point is an interesting one about kind of the longer term changes here. And frankly, just how long it is going to be that we're talking about borrowing costs being this high. If you listen to Neil Cash Car yesterday, he's saying there's no guarantee we paused at 4.5%. If you're still seeing an acceleration in underlying inflation, we probably aren't going to be able to do that. So it's a question of, as the market has adjusted to what it thinks, ultimately, the terminal rate will be the data could quickly lead us to think something else. What happened to Cash Car? How is he just sort of the most extreme? All right, the most extreme. Well, nobody, he was the most extreme on the Dovish. Now he's the most extreme on the hawkish, saying, the sky's the limit in terms of how high we raise rates. Where's the compass? I'm glad you bring this up. What we're going to do, folks, now is really address the path here that we have not only the economic data today, but also the path to get to September 21, which is, excuse me, November 2, which is not all that far away, at the IMF meetings in Washington, the one name that kept coming up was Brainerd, Valbrainer. John Lipsky was at Wesleyan way ahead of Valbrainer, remembers the first time he met her and that she was absolutely unique. And I think of the names that you mentioned, Lisa, you do a great job of this every day. Makeo is a high ground. And interviewing him, I really wonder if the only voice that matters right now is the vice chairman. I wonder if that's the case in her voice. Has been decidedly a little bit more dovished and say Neil Kashgari and yet wait, the numbers are showing, they keep coming in hotter than expected. And Kili, to your point, these consumer companies able to pass along price increases, Olaplex and their $80 shampoo not withstanding, it signifies this has more to go. Let's do this right now. Lindsey Pigs, we've got some technical challenges and the chief economist, the Steeple, joins us this morning. Lindsey, as we vamp to get you set up for us, we ended up talking about the Fed and the importance of Lyle Brainard, explained to our audience worldwide the importance of a gentle lady from Wesleyan. Well, I think she does hold a specifically important role in terms of tempering expectation. While we have heard opinions drive significantly higher to the more hawkish side, she does seem to offer us up to the market. She says the Fed is looking at inflation, there's still more to be done, but there's also a need to, at some point, pause and assess earlier policy decisions. And that's quite a stark contrast to what we hear specifically from Neil Cash-Cariot of Minneapolis saying there's essentially no ceiling to where rates could potentially go. As inflation continues to push higher, which sends a more volatile message, a scarier message to the marketplace. Well, maybe that's by intention, right? Maybe that's because he's looking at the stock market and saying the more that you see some sort of sell-off continue and the more you see yields climb, the more they will achieve their goal more quickly. So this could be some messaging. I do wonder though, if you take a look at his message, he's saying if cornflation continues to accelerate, then perhaps they're not going to stop at 4.75%. What are the chances in your view that cornflation will not peak by the end of this year? Oh, I certainly don't think his message is unjustified, particularly against the backdrop of the latest core CPI number now pushing back to a cycle peak, a new cycle peak at 6.6%. And I think this underscores the idea that...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4525,2022-10-19 10:40:38
16180," at 6.6 percent. And I think this underscores the idea that the risk to inflation is still to the upside. So the notion that inflation will just nicely and calmly materially decline to the Fed's 2% target over the coming 12 to 18 months, allowing the Fed then to not only reach that terminal rate near term, but begin to cut rates potentially by the end of next year. I think this highlights the overly optimistic sentiment baked into the Fed's forecast. And to cash carries, to cash carries point, if inflation continues to rise or even remain elevated at these new levels, the Fed is going to have to take a markedly more aggressive pace or pathway to get inflation under control. So when we talk about have we seen peak levels of inflation, that matters less than the question of will inflation remain elevated beyond the timeline that the Fed is anticipating in order to get to a more reasonable terminal level. And cash carries says, well, maybe not. And I kind of agree with them because inflation has shown such a persistent, such a stickiness in the numbers, particularly in the service numbers. Yeah, I think it is too early to say we're on the downside from here. And even on the good side, and this is something that has been honestly keeping me up at night, the diesel prices, diesel gas, given that prices have remained so elevated, storage levels are so low, and that this is pivotal for everything that we transport, for everything that we do, particularly with heating homes. How concerned are you about an inflationary impulse heading into year end from diesel prices that continue to climb despite some of the SPR releases of gasoline, despite some of the other issues done to drive down costs in other places? Oh, I'm absolutely concerned. And you're right, a lot of the headlines seem to be misguided by the slight decline that we've seen in terms of gasoline prices for the average consumer. And certainly from a headline perspective, that's what the average American focuses on, what they're feeling their car up with at the pump. But to your point, when we go to the grocery store and we buy goods and we're purchasing surfaces across the economy, one of the biggest input costs is those transportation costs. And in diesel costs rise, as labor costs rise, as parts of material costs rise, all of these factors are going in to a higher level of profit that is being forced to do businesses. Well, Lindsay, to that point, we are seeing these companies passing on those higher input costs, exercising pricing power, just raising prices for the consumer. And we're seeing with companies like Nestle that their consumers are tolerating that. How problematic is the retention of profit for corporations for the Federal Reserve? Well, keep in mind, the consumers yes are tolerating it, but that doesn't mean that it's not often paid or causing a change in behavior. Already, we've seen a precipitous nominal decline in terms of consumer activity flowing from about 8% last year to just about 2% this year. So some consumers are nominally reducing the amount of goods and services in their basket. For other consumers, they're reducing the quality or the price point of the goods and services that they're purchasing. So maybe they're not purchasing panting or the oliplex shampoo and they're getting Walgreens branch. Oh, she went there. And for other consumers, this means that there may be foregoing purchases for one or two months in order to buy a larger ticket purchase in month three or four. But regardless of the form that it's taking, consumers are changing their behaviors, which should be a red flag for businesses that continue to try and to pass on 100% of the cost increases to the consumer.

Keeping you up today with news from around the world with the first word I'm Lisa Mateo the European Union is said to be set to propose sanctioning three Iranian generals and one business for providing military support to Russia and its war against Ukraine and their involvement in providing Moscow with drones the targeted business is responsible for the Iranian drones that have been supplied to Russia the generals involved in Iran's cooperation with the Kremlin. So we're food prices drove UK inflation back into double digits in September intensifying pressure on the government and central bank to act the consumer price index it rose 10.1% last month from 9.9% the month before that's according to the office for national statistics now that matched a 40 year high reached in July.

About 80% and 90% of all the world's goods are transported at some point. But there's a significant unseen cost to the modern era of global commerce. About 3% of all the world's is fuel to emissions. I'm from shipping. 3% may not sound like a lot but that's roughly comparable to the entire CO2 output of Germany. Since reducing trade isn't a likely option. What about a technological improvement?

It had already owned 35% of the insurer. Here's what Apollo gets out of the deal. Assets under management. Apollo expects that to double to about a trillion dollars by 2026. Much of that projected growth will come from the merger. And those assets are especially attractive to Apollo. Insurance companies tip of the go after much more modest returns than buyout investors. That will give Apollo more options for investing the cash. Athene is a steady provider of fee income. It is grown into one of the nation's biggest holders of fixed annuities. Those retirement savings products favored by risk adverse customers. The merger will also allow Apollo to simplify its governance. It gave up its dual-class share structure and adopted a one share one vote plan. The hope is that will eventually lead to Apollo's inclusion in the S&P 500. The core service is inflation, which is the stickiest of all. Keeps climbing. And we keep getting surprised on the upside. We don't see progress in underlying inflation or chord inflation. I don't see why I would advocate stopping at 4.5 or 4.75 or something like that. Neil Keshkari, the Minneapolis Fed, one of my favorite people. Always interesting is Lisa mentioned earlier. Entertainment as well. For those of you on radio, it looked like he was given a Fed discussion in a wedding reception. I mean, it's fun. If you want. The bride is beautiful, but here's a good talk at inflation. Very quickly, Lisa, what is the Keshkari distinction right now? Well, the Keshkari distinction is that he is very concerned about the fact that we have overwhelmed expectations time and again, the CPI print. And it's also, I believe that he uses Irish Spring. He phoned in and said, he said, you know, I'm going to say away from inflation and head for the 4.99. We're going to keep going on this. This is more than ever. We're going to keep going on the Fed speak as well. Bollard of St. Louis with our Kathleen Hayes. Really looking forward to that at 3.30 this afternoon. That's actually a very important discussion along the X-axis is we have a Bollard-like regime change at this moment. On the markets, we had green in the screen really quite nice back to red and green in the screen. There's some volatility out there where the VIX actually elevated back to 31 level, 10-year yield 4.07 per cent. We're butted up against new highs in the 10-year yield 4.49 per cent. In the two-year, I'm looking at some curve. We're about flatness now. 43 basis points of inversion. But headline for me, Lisa, is the real yield 1.65 per cent breaking through the 161 level. My average pre-great financial crisis is about 2.05. You know, I keep having your voice in my head and it's a little disturbing. It's about inflation stupid. It's about inflation. And we're coming in. It's about three weeks until this election. And it's about inflation and it's about the economy. And that's it. That's front and center, which is a reason why you're getting all sorts of things. So we want to reset and get a sense of what this election is going to look like. We have three weeks. Muhammad Yunus has been tracking this all from Gallup. He is the editor in chief there. Muhammad, what are you looking for in terms of turnout and terms of excitement around?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4528,2022-10-19 10:53:24
16183," It'll look like we have three weeks. Mohammed Yunus has been tracking this all from Gallup. He is the editor in chief there. Mohammed, what are you looking for in terms of turnout and terms of excitement around an election where we really have seen the odds shift pretty dramatically whipsaw over the past few weeks. The number one issue voters have in mind when they vote, we know this from generations is the economy. We also see that in our data. 40% of Americans now mention the economy or some sort of reference to inflation as the number one problem, most important problem, facing the country. So that is gonna be front and center more than anything. In terms of turnout, we've certainly seen higher than average turnout last week. We're actually in the field checking that now, but it wasn't as high as we saw, with the fervor we saw two years ago. The social issues are certainly gonna be critical in some of these contests, but overwhelmingly, the economy is gonna be central on people's minds as they go to vote. I've got Mohammed 159 million, which is a ginormous number for the 2020 election. I don't have the midterm statistic of 2018. What do you people see on the turnout of America for this election? It's still too early to tell. You don't know. Interesting. We don't know, and I don't think anybody really knows for a series of reasons. We certainly ask Americans, are you more excited to vote this time than in previous elections? That metric is tracking higher than average, but certainly not as high as we saw two years ago. It's about 10 points lower than that. We're actually asking that again this month, but as we get closer to the election, there are a lot of factors that play into making this one really hard to guess turnout. First of all, people's voting habits have changed. Second of all, people's attitudes about voter laws have changed. People want to really open the doors to make it easier for people to vote. Most Americans support voter ID, for example, to have people vote, but they also support a series of other measures that make it easier for people to vote. So in addition to excitement to vote, there are also structural changes to the way we vote in America that are gonna continue to roll out for these next several elections. Well, Mohammed, when we talk about excitement to vote, there were a number of social issues that the thought was would be a galvanizing force in these elections. One of them being abortion rights. Is that taking shape? Does it have as much fire power as initially thought several months ago when Roe v Wade was overturned? We certainly have seen an uptick in people saying that it's important for them as a voter to vote for someone who shares their view on abortion. Now it's about 52% of Americans hold that view, and that is a relative high compared to before. However, it's only really about a 10 or 11 point jump from before the Roe v Wade overturned decision was leaked out. So it hasn't exploded, but it certainly has risen in terms of being an important issue. One of the things we were talking about at the break is everybody voting is thinking about inflation because we're all impacted by it. Not everybody voting is voting somewhere where abortion is really on the ballot. Mom, but I want to go to the heritage of Gallup back to the 1930s. You guys basically invented the industry, and you have a monitor and a body of knowledge about say that evening when LBGA stepped aside. What do presidents do the evening or the day after a midterm election? Well, most incumbents usually don't do great in a midterm election. It's always an uphill battle, no matter who the president is. So President Biden is not facing an easy route. However, these social issues and some of these other factors may play a role in really helping the Democrats, not Ferris poorly. The other thing we're not talking about, which is more important than any of this, is the jurisdictions and how districts are managed throughout the United States. And what seats are really at stake between Republicans and Democrats and Democrats really facing a huge challenge just in terms of the seats that are up for grabs. Mohamed, thank you so much. Mohamed, you're in this definitive, is that it?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4529,2022-10-19 10:57:39

Mohammed Yunus, definitive is editor-in-chief at Gallup Heroes. We moved the election. Of course, David Weston leading our coverage here of a most interesting Tuesday evening. Alan Ruskin publishing moments ago at Deutsche Bank. He and I have done FX for years. Lisa, it's a short note, but that means it's always interesting on the nature of the money coming into America. And Ruskin says this time is different. The inflows into America, the nature of them are more balanced. They're not tactical races to short-term paper. And he says that speaks to a dollar renaissance to a more resilient dollar. This idea that it's not just positioning, right? It's not because people are moving into derivatives to hedge some sort of bet. This is people making a longer term bet that the dollar is going to be the place to hide out because the U.S. economy is going to weather the storm better than others. Although we still wonder at what point is something else break? We are getting proctor and gamble resorts. For example, we've seen from company after the pandemic. I've got that now. Yeah, they are seeing fiscal year earnings per share at the low end of guidance because of the dollar and 4X impacts. So this exactly speaks to that point. So at what point does it become a problem for the United States in a way that we can't ignore? This goes back to revenue, folks, is being about unit and price. Proctor and gamble organic sales will be substantially lower for the remainder of the fiscal year as price increases slow. That's a wild headline. Yep. And that dollar impact is going to be showing up in a lot more results, I reckon. You saw it with Netflix after the bell yesterday as well. I don't know if I'll have to see. Proctor and gamble that. We'll dig into that and give you more in a bit. Futures, they go red. Negative one. Stay with us from New York. This is Bloomberg. What are the moon shots at Amazon that are capturing most of your time and attention? Well, you know, we have a unique way that we go get big new investments. And I'm not sure it's right or wrong. It just happens to be our way. And we ask ourselves when we're considering something for questions. We ask if it's successful, can we be big and move the needle in Amazon? Is it being well served today? Do we have a differentiated approach? And do we have confidence there? And if not, can we acquire quickly? If we like the answer to those questions, we'll go pursue it with a single threaded team that isn't distracted by the rest of the business. When it comes to the stock, it has fallen significantly. Do you think investors are missing something or has tech just been overvalued? I have never tried to predict what stocks would do. Anytime I've tried to a little bit, I've been wrong. I do really believe that in the short term, the stock market tends to be a voting machine and the long term it tends to be a weighing machine. We have a concept we talk about a lot of Amazon inputs and outputs. You know, in the ultimate output for a company is share price. You know, in that other big outputs are free cash flow or profit or revenue. You can't really manage the outputs. You have to manage at the input level. And that's where we spend all our time. And so if you do the right things for the business long term, things tend to work out. I think we've had very good returns for investors. And I expect that to be true again.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4530,2022-10-19 11:02:39

We're going to see dominate over the next couple of months is volatility. There's still work to be done. I think before we can say this bear market's over. High of global interest rates, lower equity prices and a stronger dollar, we think will continue into year end. I think people understand that if you're a longer term investor, eventually the tide will turn. There's so much fear out there and it's been priced in, so I think we get this little bounty. This is Bloomberg's surveillance with Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow and Lisa Abramowitz. Good morning, everyone. Jonathan Farrow, Lisa Bramowitz and Tom Keane on radio on television, November's second back ends, and worldwide what back ends is double digit inflation. KTV lines in for John Farrow is giving a paper over in Scotland, thrilled about that and congratulations, John, on that. But Lisa, we got to go. I'm going to start out with, I'm sorry, UK 10.1 percent inflation matters in Washington. The highest matching the highest levels going back to 40 years. Again, yet another country coming out with higher than expected inflation, higher than expected hits to consumer balance sheets. And this really ratchets up the pressure on central bank or saying, great, you guys have definitely raised rates. You got to do more. And what's so important to me, surveillance correction in Washington, I was with the Netherlands Central Bank had great guy. And I said, well, you know, it's 11 percent inflation and Netherlands, and he stopped me in the middle of the interview and said, no, it's 17 percent. Like losing perspective on double digit. What does that mean? Don't fall off the edge there. It's okay. I'm trying to. Maybe I need something special for my hair. But I do think that we are looking at a scenario right now that has not been seen in years. And I keep going back to what Steve Rachute has said yesterday from Zuhuho, I thought that was actually somewhat stunning. And we heard the same kind of tone from Jerome Schneider of Pimco, which is where we end up is probably closer to 2 percent than 0 percent. We're not going to go back to that 0 percent range. And if that's the case, how much are markets fooling themselves, pretending we're going to end up back where we started at a time when that does not seem likely given the protracted nature of some of this. In this moment with Yen breaking out 14960, we're going to focus on really important headlines from Proctor and Gamble. We go to Cincinnati and I'm sorry, Kaley lines. These are jaw dropping consumer product headlines about the consumer. And I'm looking at 40 headlines, Kaley, save me here. The bottom line is they're saying the inflation, organic revenue lift, it's over. Well, the idea being that to this point, they have just raised their prices to combat the higher input costs they're facing. Now they're navigating their ability to continue doing that at a time when the American consumer spending power is deteriorating. And you see that show up in the results, but also showing up in the results to your point about the Yen, Tom, and basically any G10 currency or any currency you're looking at is the strength of the dollar hits them on the top line when you have sales overseas. There was a lot less when you bring them back home. And I think we're going to see that dollar headwind really reverberating. I actually noticed a luxury item today, usually it's a 2, 3% haircut in their modeling 6% for one of the luxury companies. And of course, PNG is a multinational there.

I mean, I'm sorry, Lisa, these headlines are really germane from Proctor and Gamble consumers, willingness and ability to pay ever more for staples. That's going to end. Well, it's coming to an end, maybe right? We're seeing the shares pop by more than 2% in pre-market trading. People still spending. They beat with respect to where their sales came in. People are willing to spend, but they are bringing less home and expect that to end. There is a feeling now it's still okay. What about in six months? We're going to say, I want to do this. I want to go to London. Lizzy burden is not with us right now. We've got Emily Roland coming up, but these images are historic of a United Kingdom back to the the bleager middle 70s chancellor hunt sitting behind the prime minister. For those of you on radio, Ms. Truss has leaned over the desk. I've witnessed this personally a couple times, Lisa, and it's absolutely original for Americans. Okay, so she's coming out and she's saying that she is sorry for mistakes in economic plans saying that it's right to make changes to the economic approach. This comes after she basically saw her entire agenda reversed and absolutely abnegated and it comes as her popularity rating is below 10% time. Yeah. How do you really speak to a time when you have Kaley had a popularity that's that low? And Kaley now they had a labor starmer, Sir Cure Starmer speaking as well. You wonder what their response is going to be because we don't know when the general election is, which I still don't get. Yeah, UK, Paul. I wish John was here to explain the UK political beast, but to Lisa's point, it is a question of credibility of the government. We have seen you turn upon you turn in terms of some of these policies, but not all the way yet. They still have tens of billions pounds worth of budget gap that they need to plug. So it is a question now. Do they tax excess profits for banks and energy companies? I mean, there is still a lot of unironed out questions here not to mention the fate of the prime minister herself. We're going to monitor this Lizzie burden outside parliament as well. Let me do the data check here quickly. Fishes of five downfhearts is of 14 to VIX 30.99 goes nowhere in this big equity lift.

We're also getting the beige book at 2 p.m. Today, those earnings really are going to be front and focus. We did just get proctor and gamble. They're being received well. There is this feeling of relief, but again, how much visibility do we have into the future? We heard after the bell yesterday, Netflix doing much better than expected up more than 13% in pre-market United air as well. We get Tesla and IBM among others after the bell. 115 p.m. This may be the most important point of the day. President Biden speaking at 115 p.m. about what to do about energy prices. Some people would argue that the immediate concern for gasoline has gone off diesel, front and center. He is pledged to potentially release more from the strategic petroleum reserve. How much work can he do at this point? What's the trigger? What's the policy? What's the process we're going to be suit within this hot state later today? Let's dive into it. Emily Rowland with us now with a very sharp note with the John Hancock investment management shop in Boston. Emily, thank you so much for joining. I love your note where you look at the quality of quality, whether it's in bonds or inequities, the nature of quality into the end of the year and next year. Do I need to buy quality or can I take more risk? It's all about quality right now, John. And remarkably, there's been a big dislocation in the macroeconomic backdrop. Clearly, we're in a decelerating environment right now. And the market leadership to us just doesn't make a ton of sense. The S&P 500, of course, down in bear market territory, quality down more high yield bonds outperforming the aggregate bondadets. This is not the type of market leadership you see heading into a global recession. So, we think that there's a nice opportunity here. Did you see how she confused me with young Farah? Well, you guys look very similar. John uses all the Plex as well. So, I can see the confusion. Emily, save us please. There's an issue when you talk about leadership. When you talk about leadership, what does that mean to you in terms of what the market is getting wrong, especially since the earnings are pretty good? Maybe the signal...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4532,2022-10-19 11:10:58
16187," about leadership. When you talk about leadership, what does that mean to you in terms of what the market is getting wrong, especially since the earnings are pretty good, maybe the signal is being sent that is correct that perhaps the markets have overreacted to recession risks. Maybe I mean, right, let's think about it this way. At least you made this point earlier, Q3 was fine. You know, you think about the economy, the leading indicators were still doing all right, you know, really just the end of the quarter where we started seeing some significant deterioration and the data. So we look at, you know, everything we've heard about the consumer in the third quarter, still willing to absorb higher prices, Netflix seeing more subscribers, Nestle saying that they're still able to pass along higher prices to consumers, but we're starting to see cracks in that story develop, whether it's something anecdotal by which I mean on Twitter, which suggests that, you know, potentially vacation rental properties are starting to see really significant declines and occupancy. rates more traditional data like retail sales coming in flat, you know, forward guidance from them, some of these consumer staples companies indicating that consumers are starting to protest higher prices, given the elevated cost of capital, given the persistent elevation of commodity prices. So I think the consumer, as we all know, is the the workhorse of the US economy, and I think we've got to watch the deterioration there. Emily to that point, if we are seeing the consumer pushback if we're seeing the demand deterioration, arguably that's exactly what the Federal Reserve wants to see. So is something that's bad for corporate earnings, but possibly a positive when it comes to the tightness needed of monetary policy. What does that mean for the equity market is a bad thing than a good thing, or is it just a bad thing if it's earnings driven. I know right it's good news bad news bad news good news it's tough to kind of parse that out right now, but certainly, you know, the Fed is probably, you know, happy with the fact that, you know, the equity market is showing a little bit of, you know, challenge here this year financial conditions are tightening, but the problem is how far is the Fed going to go their gloves are off in the fight against inflation, and I think the Fed's going to be able to get inflationary pressures to some side. But at what cost, you know, what is going to happen here they're going to be dealing with a much bigger problem next year.

Would you call up call up Colgate Pomolov and tell him I need the iris spring charcoal shampoo like Pharaoh uses. So listen, you guys this is the worst year in history for bonds. You have to go all the way back to you know, even going back to 1928. It has been absolutely brutal, but we don't think about bonds the same way we think about stocks. What do we all start to say when we're looking at stock bear markets, you know, we want to start chipping away our favorite stocks are starting to cheat. We don't ever talk about bond bear markets that used to be like little koala bears right and now we've seen this grisly bear of a bond market and nobody's really slipping the script to talk about the fact that you're getting 5% on the aggregate bond and it's been able to say that over 10 years now.

I think post pandemic, we're seeing more and more people say, I have to worry about me as a person, I have to worry about my family. I wonder what my well being, my mental health. So we've got to start encompassing people as holistic humans as opposed to the tool of the train, which means that we have to engage with their head, heart and hands, not just head and hands.

On the world of politics, to the world of business that balance of power with David Weston, you use analysis inside, from and about politics, power players, weekdays. This is Bloomberg. Power, policy, politics, from the White House to the Hill. Bloomberg covers the leaders in legislation. That was really a tectonic shift for this White House. The theory of this bill as I understand it is there'll be a multiplier effect. How did Democrats mobilize specifically younger voters? Bringing you the political news you need to know. The president has made it very clear that this is a significant focus. For the intersection of Wall Street and Washington, nobody covers politics like Bloomberg. We will never break.

There is a difference. There is a difference. It's breaking through and you're seeing it throughout the entire curve. Where is the finish line when you've got likes of Neil Cushkari saying, we're not done yet and we could be quite far. Quite serious, actually, is a moment in British history. Let us wait in here with members of the House of Commons. Remember the Green Lather? Is the House of Commons? Here is the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom quickly. Of course, chaos in the markets and wrecked the economy. Mr Speaker, we do face very difficult economic times. I have been honest about the mistakes I have made. But what I don't apologise for is the fact that we have helped households through this winter, through the energy price guarantee, the fact that we've reversed the national insurance rise, and the fact that we are taking action to get our railways running, rather than being disrupted by the militant trade unions she supports. Don't buy room. Questions from the floor there as the Prime Minister speaks. And of course, the Leader of Labour, Sir Keir Starmer there, is well, at least as we go to Lizzie Birdon, ITV NewsHazard. It's all over Twitter right now. The gentleman from Labour. Apparently it's going on a book. It's a book that is being written about LizTrust's time in office. It's being written right now. Sir Keir says, apparently it's going to be out by Christmas. Is that the release date or the title? Well, and then there's Sir Starmer pointing out that LizTrust made one promise about not spending, not having spending cuts for public spending, and that it just took a week for that to go away. He said, what's the point of Prime Minister who's promises? Don't even last a week. I can say fairly, this has been a brutal session. Lizzie Birdon has been tracking it over in Westminster in London. What are you looking for here? Given the lack of credibility, given how much pushback Lizzie, do we get a sense that there is nothing that LizTrust can say to really make or break her tenure that it's already over?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4536,2022-10-19 11:25:29
16190," In the lack of credibility, given how much pushback Lizzie, do we get a sense that there is nothing that Liz Truss can say to really make or break her tenure that it's already over? I mean Lisa, she's been giving her the best performance she could possibly give. She was coming out fighting. I've heard that she's had extra rehearsals this week. The message that she wanted to deliver was that she's sorry, she's made mistakes, she's getting on with the job and delivering. But really, as you say, the damage has been done to people whose mortgages have already gone up and many of her own appease will have already made up their minds about her. We're hearing that lots of them have already put in letters to ask for her to go. And remember former Minister Michael Gove, he said it's when, not if she should go. And he wants a pay poll conclave to stick all the MPs in a room and send a per white flame when they're decided. I'm sure Lizzie you'll be there to see the white smoke come out of the chimney. Lizzie, let me cut to the chase. What is the timing of people like Gove counting up letters? Is this about Thursday, Friday? Is it about end of November? Is it about making it as secure talks about to Christmas? It's all a gray area because Liz Truss is meant to be shielded for a year from a confidence vote. Ray and Brady reportedly has had the usual threshold outside a year of letters already. And he needs to meet with the board of the 1922 committee of backbentures to decide whether they want to raise the threshold to half of all Tory MPs from 15%. These decisions will happen perhaps this week. Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, is going to see and address the MPs of the 1922 committee later today. So it's all happening in hours and days really. It depends how she does in this performance as well. And let me just say as well, it doesn't just matter about Starmer's questions. It's also how aggressive her own MPs are towards her and you're hearing them questioning her now. Well, and Lizzie among the many things she has said in her answers is that she is committed to the triple lock on state pension payments, essentially making sure that the state pension is in line with inflation, which we learned is 10.1% in the UK. Is Mr Hunt going to be on board with that or is she speaking out of turn here? Well, who's in charge? It's not clear. Is it Jeremy Hunt or is it Liz Truss? The reason why this is even up for debate is because Jeremy Hunt needs to save, well, find 40 billion pounds of savings to plug the fiscal whole. But everything's on the table except for defense and health. All the government departments have been asked to shave 15% off their budgets. So it's how they meant to achieve growth, growth, growth when they're under such pressure. She says it's efficiency savings. We all know what that U from is and means in politics. Lizzie, an unfair question to wrap up here and I think it speaks to global Wall Street. Is the pension crisis in the United Kingdom all clear? The LDI crisis, can we say we've moved beyond that? I'm never going to say that it's all clear because we don't know what market turmoil lies ahead that could bring us back to that situation. But the Bank of England does seem to be confident that these LDI firms have fortified themselves in the time when the BOE made that emergency intervention. Lizzie, thank you so much. Lizzie Bird and outside parliament this morning. This was sterling 1236, fractionally down. I'm not going to say a big deal. Lisa, I'm looking at the 30-year bond as Governor Bailey looks at it from that 5.04% level down to an OK 4.19 but on a chart basis, really not breaking through to a new lower yield. Right, although the fact that there hasn't been more disruption perhaps is a victory considering that they pulled back their emergency plan to try to support some of the disruption that was caused by the LDI market, by the pensions. At the same time, they did push back by one day just that they didn't compete with the budget, the quantitative tightening. They are going to go forward with this. Will that be viewed as a positive or as a mistake? And honestly, I'm not sure I've seen both angles represented in some of the commentary overnight. Well, they're going forward with it, but they're not touching the long end, right? They're not moving the 30-year. So is that a kind of compromise?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4536,2022-10-19 11:28:07
16191," with the angles represented is some of the commentary overnight. Well, they're going forward with it, but they're not touching the long end, right? They're not moving the front edge. So is that a kind of compromise for Andrew Bailey? Is he trying to tread carefully here, but still ultimately retain that credibility by going forward with QT? I just don't understand QT. It's a completely original thing and I read about it. And to me, it's every, as Bremer would say, it's every bank for themselves. And they're literally making it up as they go step by step. I think $9 trillion dollars is the Federal Reserve is trying to do. And at what point does it create disruptions that perhaps people are not expecting to see? And this goes to the liquidity of markets that we've seen a lot of disruption to. Seven basis points out on the 10-year yield on treasuries here, the 10-year yield touching four point.

Yeah, he's using all the plaques. I do think though that this is the reason why you're seeing the dollar continue to strengthen. Right? Because people do see that rates are going up and they see the proctor and the gambles of the world that are coming out and are still beating estimates, even with the inflationary pressures, even with the strong dollar, put every excuse in the world. They're still beating. We do economics. We do finance investments. To be the most important economic data of the morning is proctor in gamble earnings.

Markets on the move for global Wall Street and you see it in the 10 year real yield out eight basis points 1.67 percent. Again, my study is 2.05 percent pre-grade financial crisis and we are migrating there as we do with the 10 year yield 4.09 percent. We had a 450 on the two year yield moments ago. These are interesting markets. Green on the screen has become a little bit red, negative 18 on futures today. What we are going to do in the equity brief this morning is going to move from a show like on Netflix, a cut above a story about a bankrupt salon and then we are going to move on to proctoring gamble and then finally staggered of the story stock of the morning here to straighten my hair at least in the framerate. That was quite an intro. I did look up what Colgate-Pomolos instead of the Irish Spring I was doing and they are actually up or down I should say only 13 percent this year versus all the Plex which is down by 66 percent. We got there. Netflix shares popping ahead of the open up 12.4 percent here after reporting better than expected earnings mostly also that they're not down in the dumps they're not about to go bankrupt. That basically was the bar they set for themselves that the user growth is not exactly shrinking anymore and that this is great but they definitely are seeing something that isn't as positive as it used to be. I'm an amateur on this two tiers a lot of people buy the lower tier so to their average money they take in from a given person come down. Okay this is a good point they're low on prices yes it's good because they basically are saying well everybody and their children are using the same account right so how do we get more people to actually pay and so if they lower prices does that mean that their profits eventually go down and getting a repricing and sort of the disinflationary push of this. The other ones I'm looking at proctoring gamble they came out with earnings this morning we've been talking about it since and it is stunning simply because you see inflation come in you see the the effects impact the idea that the dollar is strong and their earnings from overseas are lower and the pricing pressure is even greater for international customers still beating still managing to come out and increase sales more than expected. What does that say about the consumers resilience for now even as they lower their full year guidance and all of Plex we've been talking about all morning because the lines is 3 4 and 5 with some bonding mask to make herself every guy has a fever on except Terry vice when uses is evidently Tom will too soon and really the issue here is some of the darlings that grew up at a time of free money at what point do you see a massive deflation that has a broader reach than just idiosyncratic potholes throughout the market.

16193," Straight and currency strategy, something acquiring. We have a raft of questions to go two hours with Dr. Weiss. And Terry, I have got to talk this morning about what we see from Proctor and Gamble, which is the effect of inflation. Corporations adjust, but there's a point where inflation hits a consumer and hits corporate America. It's off your remit, but is that where we are? Yeah, look, I'm a bit surprised by the fact that a company selling consumer products with a very large materials cost base can do well in this environment. But then I also think, look, maybe the consumer is just not buying the salon shampoo, the high margin product, and maybe going a little bit downstream here, trying to get the lower price point product at the time when they're squeezed by their real wages coming down and higher mortgage payments on their home and all of this. So I'd rather look at this from a macro basis. Let's look at what the whole consumer product sector does. Not just one company. That'll give us a better sense of where operating margins are in the economy when they come. Are we in a global recession? And I say that after seeing it land a GDP at a near 3% statistic, I mean, the United States is not participating in a global recession, right? And then technically China isn't as well because it presumably is still growing, at least at the margin. The emerging markets are still growing. No, I think the recession we're seeing now is for the most part, a European recession is no surprise to there. They are feeling the brunt of the energy crisis. Well, are we going to see a global recession? I think that the U.S. will join this recessionary crowd in the early part of 2023. I think it's just a matter of time that we start to see consumer spending come down in the other advanced economies that have not seen the recession yet like Canada as well. There's a theory that we're pricing in almost peak rates that we're pricing in peak Fed hawkishness. We've heard this before, so it's dangerous to say this. But that sort of seems to be a feeling right now in markets. How have we fully priced in the ramifications of that? What point does that factor into the dollar and create weakness when higher rates cause lower growth? So we will not see weakness in the dollar until the other economies start to do either as well or better than the U.S. in terms of their economic activity performance. Perhaps it doesn't have that much to do with rates after all because in the final analysis, rates just follow growth. If you're doing very well, you're likely to have inflation. The central bank is likely to tighten. So let's go back to growth when we analyze effects and who's going to do well from that perspective. The U.S. to its credit is still doing well. Now it may go into a recession next year. We believe it will. That's, but even if it does, it'll be a late recession. It may not be as strong as a recession. We see in other advanced economies. And I think in that context, the U.S. dollar can continue to do okay. I keep going back to this. Do you see 2% rates for the foreseeable future once we get past this era of 4.5 to 5% rates and then coming down? Never again to that 0% pound? I don't see 2% rates coming back anytime soon. And I think what we're speaking of now is not the drivers of inflation in the short term, like energy prices, for example, or what the tightness in the labor market has much to do with the structural trends in the U.S. economy. And the structural trends in the global economy, climate change, demographics are all, for example, and decalobalization. Let's put that one into the hopper too. Those are the big three mega trends that are likely to be inflationary over the long term. Do you see rates ending up? Well, they're going to be in the real range, the positive real range, which means that if inflation is running at 3% or 4%, it's very possible that nominal yields, nominal policy rates end up slightly above that and stay there for quite a while. So is essentially what you're saying, a 2% inflation target is no longer realistic for this post-coded world? Yeah, that's probably what I'm saying. I think that, I think, well, let's put it this way. The central banks have not subsumed into their thinking the long term structural issues that are going to cause inflation to stay high. Once they do, then they may become more tight, right? They may stop at 3-4% next year. But it seems to me that after that, after a period of waiting, if you ask me what is the likely remove on the part of the Fed to go down from there or to go up from there, it's probably to go up from there. Why? Well, again, because these structural trends are creating inflation. And I think with that, when the central banks realize that these are permanent and not semi-permanent or temporary, they're going to be realizing that there's going to be much more difficult to get to that 2% target. And therefore, they may have to raise rates. Now, whether we get to 2% or not, it's going to be the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4539,2022-10-19 11:41:33
16194," and my permanent or temporary, they're going to be realizing that there's going to be much more difficult to get to that 2 percent target, and therefore they may have to raise rates. Now, whether we get to 2 percent or not, it's going to depend on how much they raise those rates by. But I think there's going to be a rethink beyond the recession that has to do with the structural trends and not the cyclical trends. If barister years ago, you're on the high ground on Pacific Rim analysis, now you do it for the greatest Australian bank. Give us the level of optimism you have on the Pacific Rim if China can extract itself from this COVID anti-science. Well, if China can extract itself and begin to grow again, it's generally positive for the Pacific Rim. It's also positive for the Pacific Rim to some extent if the Western economies continue to de-associate themselves, disassociate themselves from China commercially. I think some economies in the Pacific Rim can do very well by way of capturing a lot of the economic activity that are otherwise good at China and the investment that are otherwise good at China. In an environment where China we're integrated with the global economy. It's still from Steve Roach of Morgan Stanley Legend. Is this a labor arbitrage where in this COVID opportunity, Vietnam picks up marginal manufacturing? Absolutely. And Latin America does too. And Mexico certainly does. In North America, perhaps Africa does too. Ultimately, it's not just Vietnam. It's a lot of countries that can benefit. I look at this and then it comes to the question of dollar supremacy. The Corb 101 or Colb 101, rather, is you can't have an EM up unless you have dollar weakness. Do you need a precursor to emerging markets? Yes, used to be dollar weakness. It used to be that case. A lot more in the year when I was following emerging markets and doing solely that. A lot of emerging markets had a lot of dollar debt on their books, both sovereign corporate. But I think the emerging markets at some extent have learned from previous crises. They have de-dollarized their capital markets. They have relying much more on local financing. They're supported by local financial institutions like pension funds. And therefore, the strength in the dollar is not catastrophic. And we're seeing it, in fact, with the, with how well, you know, some of the majors in Latin America are doing. We just told your people you came with an entourage of five people. Have them as a family, folks. And he said to Terry Weissman, he's got to stay around until yen prints 150. What happens when yen prints 150? Well, maybe you start to see some inflation in Japan, which is what they want to see. I don't think they'll necessarily see the disaster. The issue is how quickly it gets there. And whether on the way there, it causes some disruptions. Oh, but come on, Terry. This was the talk of IMLF, off the mic. If we get a 150 yen, they intervene. They've capitulate here. And they pop. We're open in at 129 or 127, whatever. Yeah. How destabilizing is that yen strength that's theorized? No, I don't think it's that's destabilizing it. Okay. Yeah, it's it's it's a look. Corporate corporate margins in Japan need to go up. They need to pay their workers a little bit more. I think by way of a way of a way of a weaker yen, they're achieving some of that. We haven't seen any any financial stresses so far on that are directly caused by the weakness in the end we've seen the end has in fact been the the weakest of the currencies this year. We still haven't seen any stresses. So I wouldn't worry with that. Terry Weissman, thank you so much for being with us. Terry Weissman of McQuarrie. And really Tom, what he was saying there was so important about this idea of where the real rate ends up and this idea that we could end up with nominal rates above 2% for a long time fed funds rates because of where inflation is something that has not been priced into markets and really counter axiom of this discussion about how it's too indebted and we can't handle that. And then basically saying it's what we're going to have to handle. I look at this Kayleigh is a return to what Terry Weissman and I grew up with and somehow we survive but with that you clear markets and the zombie companies we make jokes about it but I'm sorry all of these nonprofit entities have to live in a new world.

16196," that we haven't had to deal with. Bloomberg Wall Street Week live Friday with Replays All Weekend on Bloomberg Television and Radio. When you think of cutting edge technology at sea, you might be thinking of stuff like this. But there's an incoming revolution on the high seas that isn't quite as sexy, but could be significantly more impactful. Conceeing shipping is the key component of global trade. About 80% of all the world's goods are transported at sea at some point. But there's a significant unseen cost to the modern era of global commerce. About 3% of all the world's is your true mission from shipping. 3% may not sound like a lot, but that's roughly comparable to the entire CO2 output of Germany. Since reducing trade isn't a likely option, what about a technological improvement? To help reduce the emissions from these well-stocked maritime behemoths. Big picture, we still have growth that's going to be slowing. Over the next 3 to 6 months, we still have a lot of monetary policy tightening. Right ahead of us. So I think the way to think about this is a bear market rally. It's short, it's sharp. It still matters, but the big picture hasn't changed. There's still work to be done. I think before we can say this bear market's over. Ender Sheet's Brown University with Morgan Stanley there, just always brilliant. I really was quite pressed for it yesterday. I'm Mike Wilson, about a little bit. Let's cover that quickly here. Mike Wilson with a little bit of a turn, right? Yes, sure. He was there. Well, in the near term and then more bearish the law terms. So this is a whole idea of a fair market rally and where we're headed at a time when people basically are like, I guess earnings aren't so bad. And then they get slammed with bull. Maybe they are coming up later this morning, a piercing conversation with one of the brightest lights at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. And I must, Hockstein will join us here, the special presidential coordinator for global infrastructure and energy and security looking forward to that again this morning. Right now we do better than Mr. Hockstein with Will Kennedy, senior executive editor for energy and commodities at Bloomberg in New York with his world famous team. Let's start with Havier Bloss on the strategic political reserve and it's wrapped around the politics and all that. Havier suggests to me in a typical Blossy in message, I don't understand that we're selling oil now into the market to make the price go down except both Republicans and Democrats have us buying oil back actually pretty soon. Is it that confusing? It is confusing and I think that there are mixed signals here. They are selling some oil now. They're saying they might release a lot more battles over the winter to keep prices subdued and then they were mandated sales for years to come. So there's a lot of plans to sell the oil and then they're saying that we'll buy it back at a price range around $70. So it is confusing about what's going on. What's clear is, as you say, the SPR has become extremely political and the administration is very willing to use it in a way that previous administrations haven't been. And we've been talking about this and John's been talking about this extensively about how vulnerable this makes us heading into the winter months and I'm not looking at gasoline. I'm looking at diesel and I'm focusing on how low those barrels really are and this question of what the administration could do about that because that goes into everything. That's trucker expenses, etc. So what's the proposal there? How much is that on their radar? So the SPR in some senses is a little bit of a red hemming because it's crude oil but the tightness in the market is not crude oil right now as you say, so it's absolutely diesel, stocks are at the lowest we've seen in decades and that's just as people are getting ready to fire up the central heating in the northeast US where they use heating oil diesel to heat their homes. So it's a critical situation and there is a very small...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4543,2022-10-19 11:55:33
16197," to fire up the central heating in the Northeast US where they use heating oil diesel to heat their homes. So it's a critical situation and there is a very small reserve but there's no strategic reserve for diesel like there is in crude. So that's why export restrictions actually remain on the table and there is a active debate in the administration about whether they should limit the export of diesel to Europe which has been buying a lot of US products. So what does that do politically? Well politically it's you know... Is it being for Liz Truss? Well no that's a serious question. It is a serious question. Because Europe is being helped by US energy exports on a huge scale. That's LNG, that's diesel. And if the administration decides to restrict those exports for political reasons at home that will drive up prices in Europe where diesel is already also very very short and we've had a refinery strike in France which has constrained supplies of diesel. So this diesel tightness is a problem on both sides of the Atlantic so acting here will be a problem for the administrations by partners in Europe. Okay so tightness of supply driving oil prices up and will you mention how there is a plan in theory to buy oil back and shore up those reserves once again which are at multi-decade lows. If the administration says it's going to buy between $67 and $72 there's a barrel on WTI we're already down 33% from the highs and yet we are still nowhere near that level and when you have OPEC reducing supply, constraining supply more. Is it realistic to think we're going to get there anytime soon? Well predicting oil prices impossible and I would just say that we're a few years away from negative oil prices so we just don't know but I think it's certainly true that there's a real tug of war going on here and you know they're setting a flaw with that buyback range. OPEC has signaled the desire to defend prices at sort of a $90 range so what's fascinating about this I say again is it's extremely political you've got people using policy both on the consumer side here on the US and the producer side and it's become a real tug of war. Well and we know that the administration have been pushing for OPEC to do something else which they did not do so again speaks to the political difficulty at the same time they've also asked producers back home to pump more oil and yet it isn't so much the pumping of the oil it's the refining capacity you need to be able to turn it into product how do you what policy solutions are there to solve that problem. Now that is a huge problem and we're not going to be building any refining anytime soon but there's the reason refining capacity is so tight is again goes back to the situation in Europe the global system used Russia's over capacity and refining. Russia has a big refining system and they exported a lot of diesel Europe is moving to a place where it won't buy that diesel anymore as of early next year and that's all putting pressure on the system and people always focus on crude oil but it's really on the refining system the supply of products which a lot of the stresses are showing up right now. So what could this administration do we're going to be speaking with almost Haxstein coming up as time was saying what can they actually do other than just make broad proclamations to try to make them look like they're doing something three weeks before the election. Well I think we need to press him on export restrictions now someone did say yesterday that they're not going to do that before the midterm elections but if things get very tight over the winter it seems that that clearly is on the table. I have a blast it gets all they have lines with this wonderful book The World for Sale but the fact is Stewart Wallace Justin Caragony you invented the world class hydrocarbons team here and what's great is he just saw the movie rights which I thought was great and I just heard the Colin Firth a schedule to play you in the movie which is I think really looks good. I want to ask you within your team of 40-50 people is the United States energy independent? No. Why do you say no after all the political garbage I hear out of? I mean because this is a this is a global energy system the US imports oil from around the world exports profit be exports oil to exports products it is a global system and I think you'll never be in a place where you're insulated from that where you can have a truly independent policy I just I just don't think that's realistic in the shale industry one of the key questions for energy going forward is what is the future of the US Shale industry clear",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4543,2022-10-19 11:58:13
16198," independent policy. I just don't think that's realistic. In the shale industry, one of the key questions for energy going forward is what is the future of the US shale industry? Clearly the rise of shale has been the most enormous energy story in the last decade or slightly more. But people are starting to worry that it's slowing down. The administration revised down its estimates for US oil production in the last week or so. And some people are saying that production might peak within the next two years. Now that's a bold call we'll see. But I think as we look forward on oil, on energy, on US energy independence, the future of shale is really going to be a critical question. Well Kennedy, thank you so much and thank you for the once a week, twice a week, ever here from London to give us wisdom. I'm sorry Lisa, this is a huge deal. This energy independence thing, it's incredibly emotional in Washington. A lot of people have been talking about peak shale just simply because they cannot invest and get the same kinds of returns at the same prices. And that's what you're seeing with the lack of a lot of the same kinds of production for some of these wells. We'll Kennedy wear this to give me the right questions for Almus Hockstein, a special presidential coordinator for global infrastructure and energy. Sir, these oils are for President Biden. You will join us here in a bit. Futures at negative 17. Good morning. So you built a successful company, but you may not want to run it for the next 10, 15, 20 years, or do you? And if you didn't, would you want to go into government if the president called you to serve our country? Would you go into government or would you start another company? I love what I do. And I feel like I have this luxury with 23 me that it keeps evolving. You know, we started out just as a start out of consumer company. We're thick in research. We got into drug discovery in 2015 and now we're getting to the delivery of care. So I've been really lucky with 23 me that it's been endlessly interesting. And I'm surrounded by incredibly talented, brilliant individuals where I learn from them. And what I always advise people to do is like you should keep, you should take jobs where you're learning. And if you stop learning in the job, then you should quit. And like frankly, when people leave 23 me, like I say if you're not learning anymore, you should move on. So I'm 100% committed to 23 me. That said, my other passion is other direct to consumer. Like I want to build out a true consumer empowered healthcare world. Like one that is outside of the existing system. And I do there's no greater force than government. The markets are preparing to close, but the day is not over yet. It's talked about that is now up about 45% a lot of volatility. You need the power of the Bloomberg terminal to get you market moving data before anyone else. There's numbers much higher than expected. All greater today to overweight.

16199," Bloomberg markets the close weekdays on Bloomberg. On the world of politics to the world of business. Balance of power with David Weston, Views and Melisys, Insight, From and About, Politics Power Players. Weekdays, this is Bloomberg. Why do the biggest names in business choose Bloomberg? I have to do great questions. That's a great question. Great question. And best question I get all night. Bloomberg, top experts, great questions. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. Because Trussonomics is being dismantled, MPs behind the scenes are asking, what's the point of having her at the top? In the strong dollar, amplify the world's risks of instability. She didn't think that complete reunification must be realized. With unmatched reach in resources, from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. A lot of factors are putting us back into a more traditional 1970s, 80s and early 90s mindset. Think picture, we still have growth that's going to be slowing. We do think that we are going to see peak rates. We do think that we are going to see peak inflation. We still have a small chance of a soft landing. I don't think we get it. When you tighten financial conditions, this aggressively, this abruptly, things are going to break. This is Bloomberg's surveillance with Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow, and Lisa Abramowitz. Welcome back. Good morning, socks flipping and flopping as they balance some of the better than expected earnings with rates sending a clear message in place and higher for longer. Tom Keane, Lisa Abramowitz. And Kayleigh Lines here, John Farrow off, he is not playing footsie with the Dow. Tom, he is off on a well earned vacation. As we try to parse through the noise, rates higher 10-year yields. This is catching my notice. 10-year yields in the U.S. The highest level is going back to 2008. It's deceptive here on a Wednesday. It's supposed to be quiet. And there's not that much economic data. All the talk to me is right where you are, Lisa, which is in the yield space. And I go to the real yield as we heard from Terry Weissman earlier. It's important. 1.66% is not a negative 1% of ages ago. Inflation keeps surprising to the upside. And to me, this is the big takeaway for the past couple of weeks. Not just in the U.S. and the United Kingdom around the world. And Tom, we're looking at this. And you're saying, where are we going to end up? We are not going to end up back at zero. And that has to be a complete reset for companies. Not necessarily in this quarter, but in quarter-stika. Okay, so this morning across global Wall Street, they're going to have their first meeting to do their year end review. Their first look in 2023. Good luck with that. Good luck with that. Exactly. I'm sorry. I mean, I give up. Well, where's the visibility? And Kayleigh, that really speaks to some of the earnings that we're getting with Proctor and Gamble, really front and center. We've been talking about it all morning, but it highlights the fact that consumer facing companies dealing with all the industrial headwinds still doing okay for now. For now is the operative phrase there because they also lowered their full-year guidance because they're looking ahead and saying, yes, we've been able to exercise this pricing power, raise prices for the consumer, pass on those higher input costs. The consumer is starting to change behavior a little bit at the margin, even if it's just buying the cheaper alternatives. So it's a question of how long that pricing power is going to be able to get these companies through. And if we're actually going to start seeing that material margin pressure that you've had the likes of Mike Wilson, Morgan Stanley, warning is coming. We just aren't necessarily seeing it showing up yet in the third quarter of the year. You know, Tom, you were talking about writing your Wall Street review for 2023 that Tom Keenwan is going to be really interesting. I look forward to that next week, but I am wondering whether companies can write that either, right? I mean, to that point, what visibility they have at a time of such a long time, you know, is that they're going to be able to quickly change in wins. Now, I'm going to go folks with all the blur of earnings that we see and of course, our Bloomberg focus on bank earnings. What we saw from Procter and Gamble today is a huge, huge deal to the late great Jack Welch in his focus on pricing power. This is the first nuance that you nailed the microeconomics of this K-Leo earlier between unit dynamics and price dynamics. Something's changed. And what's changing right now is the Fed and the Fed speak. It's not necessarily represent the mainstream. He's not necessarily Leile Brainerd. However, coming out K-Leo and saying, 4.5, 4.75% may not be anywhere close to the peak, moving closer to Bill Dudley. Right. The Fed is now one of the most hawkish members of the Federal Reserve.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4546,2022-10-19 12:09:07
16200," 4.5, 4.75% may not be anywhere close to the peak, moving closer to Bill Dudley. Right. He is now one of the most hawkish members of the Federal Reserve rather than the most of us, essentially saying if you're still seeing that acceleration and core inflation, we're not going to be able to stop at 4.5%. And that's why I thought what Terry Weisman told us in the last hour was so interesting. He's saying even if they pause at 4% for some time, he thinks it's more likely that they go higher than that after the fact, rather than cutting, because we are just in a different inflationary environment now in which a lot of this is going to be more structural. He thinks 2% is no longer a target for the world we live in. Right now, Tom, looking at just what the markets are showing us, it's just we were positive, and they flipped negative pretty sharply heading into this hour. And part of this to me has to do with some of the gloom that we're hearing about what could potentially come down the pike. And this feeling of what rates do, what higher rates do, we're seeing it down a half percent right now. The rates are leading the story today, but foreign exchange follows behind, and I'm sorry, I'm on intervention watch, 149.67, there's a persistency, there's almost an inertial force to Japanese weakness. You know, you follow it all day, no, to keep your eye on at least what you do. Sure, and there's a persistency of the Euro weakness, which continues versus the dollar, and this comes as Italian 10-year yields, continues to search some of the nearest highs. How much does this put pressure on what we're seeing with the ECB? It's really important, though, to understand the 60-40. And I think that we keep going back to that, right? Where is the ballast? Well, that didn't work out. It's been the worst year going back decades, but what will work as the ballast on Whitty Bajugana joins us now? She's had a multi-assist strategy at Columbia Threadnidol, and on Whitty, what will be the ballast going forward if we don't get some stability in rates in the near term? Thanks for having me, Lisa. Yeah, I think 60-40 has been a bus this year, for sure. But I think a lot of the conversation around these days has been about Fedwatching, and you all nailed it when you talked about real yields. So, real yields stability is going to be the ballast, but I keep coming back to what does stabilize real yields. And for that, we keep going back to inflation data, and we just haven't seen any signs of peak in that. There are hints, there are forwardly looking metrics, if you look at inflation expectations, as measured in the bond market, those have come down quite sharply, but they're not at levels where one can say we can declare victory now. What's so important here is the heritage of Columbia Threadnidol, Columbia Threadnidol in England, in England, in your roll-up of BMO, and the idea of the Ted Trussk at your leader is from Scotter Stevens. It's the Boston Heritage of Mutual Funds. Lisa mentions the debacle of 6040. Do you invest now assuming 6040 stability forward, or do you have to invest with a different calculation? I think I'll break that down to two parts. So, if I look at all my strategic forecasts for the medium term, they are better than I've ever seen in 10 years. Ten years ago, when we were looking at what fixed income might return for us, we were looking at zero yields on the safer bonds, and two or three percent on the riskier part of the 10 year. Now, we're looking at 10 year at 4 percent, and you don't even have to take a whole lot of risks to go up to short duration IG and get 5-6 percent in a very safe sort of risk-free equity bond portfolio. And similarly, I don't think equities are cheap. Equities are probably fairly valued, given the amount of uncertainty we have. But again, if you look at the medium term projections, they're looking much better. What is so critical here is everybody's been blown up in this unique pandemic-induced bear market. Are we going on to something new or to revisit the giant et pioneer Phil Carey and a way to invest that we knew decades ago? I think we won't know whether we are going to something new until after the fact. So, these structural changes. Was that cash garbage? Carry on, please.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4546,2022-10-19 12:11:34
16201," until after the fact. So these structural changes. Sounds like a... Was that Keshe Gary? Carry on, please. So we do... I think it's a very important question, Tom. We do grapple with, is this a new structural regime for inflation? Exactly. To your question, does inflation stay around 3, 4 percent? And we don't know that. So you could have theories that de-globalization and what not is going to keep inflation high forever. But for the moment, I haven't seen enough evidence that there's been any sort of break in the way things function. Yes, we're going through a painful period in the markets. I'm living it every day. But I think if we have a medium-term perspective, then you stay with... stay the course, stay the strategic allocation that you have in mind, and do not panic when that 60-40 is already down 25 percent. Okay, so you're looking out over the medium-term in the more near-term, though. I'm wondering how you're viewing political risk, because we've seen what happened in the UK, what is still ongoing in the UK, frankly. The questions Liz Trust has been getting as Prime Minister in Parliament this morning. And we're just three weeks out from the midterms here in the US. I mean, is it time to be thinking more about domestic political risk rather than broader global monetary policy and geopolitics as we've been talking about for this entire year thus far? Absolutely, Kayleigh. That's an excellent question. So no one's been talking about the political risk here in the US. You saw how the LDI market, the bond market reacted in UK when the market did not like the fiscal plan that came out of that administration. Here, I think all the data that I'm looking at, although pinion polls I'm looking at right now is saying that we're likely to have a divided government for the next two years. So I think the market can live with that. But if we see sweep in one direction, and at that point, this point, it means sweep in the democratic direction, what sort of fiscal policies come through, and how does the market react to that, is a key risk at this point. And, Wadi, thank you so much for being with us. And Wadi, Bahu Guna, thank you so much of Columbia Threadneedall. And to that political question, one thing that we can keep hearing, Kayleigh, exactly to the UK risk point in some of the upcoming debates, has been reducing the deficit. We heard that from Senator Warner just yesterday. Well, he basically admitted that the size of the fiscal stimulus was a bit too large in hindsight, that the US did too much. And to one Wadi's point, it becomes a question of, is it a bad thing to see the status quo in that it would mean potentially more spending that in theory, if you had a divided government, it wouldn't be able to make its way through. And Tom, you've been out front, the 3 percent, the Adam Posen type, where are we going to allow inflation to stay? And it might not be within even the realm of control, right? What if there are some of these stickier kinds of aspects to the regime that were in that lasts longer than perhaps we can tolerate, say, 5 percent, right? In Washington, nobody talked about the sign camera. Everybody talked about it off camera. And there's some form of hoped glide path, which has not occurred in the last 90 days, of a lesser inflation, maybe with kinks or pauses along the way to what? And what's important is, I'm not even sure right now the what is 3 percent the Posen statistic, or Blanchard's frame 4 percent years ago, maybe it's 5 percent just to get there. And it's the political question of how much pushback this Federal Reserve gets, as it continues to raise rates. And we have the crimping, particularly in the lower death styles to use your phrase you've been talking about. Essentially, coming up, we have a further conversation, particularly about where we are with the dollar of a silly as a river cove of UBS. This is Bloomberg. Keeping you up to date with news from around the world with the first word, I'm Lisa Mateo. The European Union is set to be set to propose sanctioning three Iranian generals and one business for providing military support to Russia and its work against Ukraine and their involvement in providing Moscow with drones. The targeted business is responsible for the Iranian drones that have been supplied to Russia, the generals involved in Iran's cooperation with the Kremlin.

16202," Shanghai will build an isolation facility that can house thousands of people near the city. Now it's another sign that China is unlikely to shift away from its COVID-0 policy anytime soon. The facility will be constructed east of Shanghai's business district in an area covering about 35 acres and will have more than 3,200 beds when completed. Nesley CEO Mark Schneider says inflationary pressures will continue into 2023. An exclusive interview with Bloomberg, Schneider spoke about the company's effort to protect margins with price increases and the impact of energy costs in Europe. What we're clearly seeing is some of the inflationary pressures continuing so this is not over yet and some of this will kind of go into 2023. When exactly it's going to peak I think a lot of it has to do especially in Western Europe with the energy situation because that's a big driver of inflation. Schneider remains bullish about the brand as demand is strong and sales are surging and it's a coffee crossover Starbucks has entered into an agreement to sell the Seattle's best coffee brand to Nesley. Starbucks says the move will allow the company to focus on elevating the coffee experience through its own brand and helps strengthen the global coffee alliance which it established with Nesley in 2018. Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quick Take. I'm Lisa Mateo. This is Bloomberg. When the price of anything goes up the consequences reach far beyond what you'd expect but perhaps most of all when it comes to food. In 2010 surging food prices helped spark the Arab Spring. Lives were lost, regimes fell and the consequences are still with us. Once again food prices are rising and fast. Energy costs, broken supply chains and surging demand were just some of the factors that have driven food prices to their first record high since the Arab Spring and that's all before a war between two of the world's biggest food producers. Ukraine is called the Bread Basket of Europe and taken with Russia the two account for about a quarter of global wheat trade. They produce more than half of the world's sunflower seeds in oil nearly 20% of the barley. Now throw in rising energy prices and processing, transporting, even refrigerating food gets more expensive. Plus fertilizer production is extremely energy intensive. Less fertilizer means lower crop yield and prices rise even more. The pandemic revealed how complicated and fragile global trade systems are. Global agriculture perhaps even more so. Unlike metals for example food goes bad and crops take months to grow and are vulnerable to unpredictabilities like the weather. Rising food prices will be felt everywhere but the poorest countries in the world will be hit the hardest. And as all these factors compound the real fear is that record high will lead to record high and ultimately to a global food crisis with vast consequences.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4548,2022-10-19 12:19:16
16203," Lots of bloombirds. I've seen the bloomberg. What does it mean? It means they have a bloomberg. We will never break. We will never break. We will never break. Power, policy, politics, from the White House to the Hill. Bloomberg covers the leaders in legislation. That was really a tectonic shift for this White House. The theory of this bill, as I understand it, is there will be a multiplier effect. How did Democrats mobilize specifically younger voters? Bringing you the political news you need to know. The president has made it very clear that this is a significant focus. For the intersection of Wall Street and Washington, nobody covers politics like bloomberg. I think we still have a small chance of a soft landing. I don't think we get it. But that's what the market is going to start pricing in first as a soft or softish landing. That's going to drive this route. The head of macro strategy at Academy Security is a soft landing to bait. A lot of people saying softish, maybe not a super hard landing. It is an issue. We're seeing that in terms of what we're pricing in. We heard over night city group coming out and saying stocks have priced in a recession possibly more than other assets. But it isn't overdone yet. We are seeing a bit of softening. Tom, you were talking about this. We started with some gains. Although we've retraced some of the more extreme losses down about 4. Tents of a percent yields. I just keep going back to 10 year yields. To me, this may be one of the key stories breaking out hit 4.1%. Going back to 2008, some of the highs and really fed by some of the discussions about where we end up with inflation once we're done with this post pandemic search. Sure. Let's do some hands for radio. It's really nice to see on radio folks. The fact that a 10 year yield is coming up, but inflation dynamic, which means a larger real yield. We see that with 1.66% on the real yield. That is a change as we go into this Wednesday. One of the great points today was away from FX, but not. And that was proctoring gamble of Cincinnati with a set of headlines that are perhaps the new reality from multinationals in America. From UBS, their foreign exchange and macro strategist, Vasilie Serebarkov joins us right now. Vasilie, I don't want to do like euro. What's a euro going to do with sterling? I want to know when you advise proctoring gamble in Cincinnati, what the dollar strength means for their operation. They make clear there are FX headwinds. Absolutely. I think he's starting to see it more and more in US corporate earnings. And in fact, you know, the earnings season that we're entering is, oh, have entered this is probably going to show. To show more of that. You know, I think that corporates and investors in general should be prepared for this strong dollar environment to persisting for a bit longer. The dollar is certainly expensive, but it doesn't mean it's necessarily overvalued. And to your previous point, if you kind of account about for real rates and they also account for the global growth downturn, you know, the dollar strength is quite easy to justify. Vasilie, I was talking with the guy named Axel Weber, a nodding acquaintance with your UBS and of course a former head of the German Bundesbank. He made very clear to me. It's not so much the rates of change now, but the level. If the dollar just sustains at this level, what is the ramification for other nations? Well, the ramifications is that, you know, it's it's once again our currency, but your problem, right? Because in the sense, a lot of policymakers around the world, world would probably prefer a stronger domestic currency at the moment in order to find inflation. But they're not getting it, they're getting a weaker currency and only the U.S. is getting.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4549,2022-10-19 12:24:01
16204," the world would probably prefer a stronger domestic currency at the moment in order to fight inflation, but they're not getting it, they're getting a weaker currency, and only the U.S. is getting some perhaps benefit from a stronger dollar in terms of fighting inflation. The issue is that we're not detecting a lot of serious concern about dollar valuations. This is not like the pre-plaza years where there was a strong sense that the dollar was divorced from fundamentals that we needed to do something about it. Generally, U.S. policymakers have said markets are functioning well. If you look at rate differentials, if you look at terms of trade, if you look at growth, all of these things combined can justify the current levels of the dollar. Really, I don't think anything is going to change that sort of from the policy making front or sort of the G20 coming together and changing the dollar policy. I think what could change it and will change it ultimately is the peak in U.S. inflation like global growth rebound, but that of course remains some way away. Where is Europe in terms of strength or weakness? We see ongoing Euro-Weakness today, and how much of this stems from the Italian yield? I'm not sure, but you are seeing ongoing weakening in some of the peripheral rates given the inflation, given the economic outlook. How do you view the necessity for Europe to have some sort of recovery before dollar strength gets diminished? It's a very essential part of it. I will offer a little bit of a glimmer of hope for the Euro at least. If you look at European gas prices, for example, they're multi-month lows. So at least some of the energy sector pressures appear to be abating. That's why I think that you're seeing the Euro kind of trading around this 97, 98 level and not going to 95 or below. As I think many market participants were perhaps anticipating. So we have a little bit of a sense of hope and stability, but it's really hard to see that you are doing anything significant or rebound significantly until you get through the winter, until you get a sense that we can pull through this without energy rationing. And then of course, the things that you mentioned such as Italian spreads and so on, I think it's just the side effects of a weaker economy where those kind of market metrics tend to play more into the psyche whenever the overall growth backdrop is weak. So I think there's some hope for the Euro in terms of stabilization at the lows just from the gas prices, but we're still not at the rebound stage for sure. Well, you talk about the prospects of weaker growth and that's something facing China as well. Perhaps on an outright recession, but certainly not the kind of growth China has become used to. And as we've been talking, Vasilie, the offshore you want now at another record low against the US dollar 727 is roughly where we trade at the moment. Can China do anything to stem that weakness? Change the record policy. And as you just said on the show, it doesn't look to be likely very soon. I mean, to be fair, China has been in a very weak economic phase since the second quarter of this year. So this does not necessarily new. I think it's sort of more of the same. Obviously, we're seeing weakening attractiveness of yuan from the interest rate perspective, from the capital flows perspective, from the growth perspective. So in terms of recommendations, we've been solidly bullish US dollars against the Taiwan dollar. That hasn't changed. We think there's more upside. And to some extent, also, if you look at this dollar rally from a maybe one to two-year perspective, the Chinese currency has lagged a little bit in terms of weakness versus say the year and the year. So there's still a little bit of a catch up going on as far as the Chinese currency. Yeah, but I think, you know, unless we're seeing a change in the zero-covid policy, it's really hard to change the view on the yuan. Vasilie, Siribercoff, UBS, thank you so much for being with us. And Tom, I keep going back and thinking about your conversations with the IMF, the back office conversations, not necessarily those that are on screen, people talking about where inflation could end up and how it could be sustained in part because there isn't anything that really breaks the mode that we're really in right now. Well, yeah, and again, I go back to the media loves y-axis analysis, change, surge, plunge, braided, whatever.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4550,2022-10-19 12:28:37
16205," Well, yeah, yeah, and again, I go back to the media loves y-axis analysis, change, surge, plunge, cratered, whatever. The adults are on the x-axis, worried about time, and what we've learned this year is transitory, remember transitory, we're going to do it. Okay, you know, when I'm transitory anymore, we're out somewhere with a complete unknown into next year. There's guesses, but that's just what they are. Well, and this goes to the Muhammad Allarian point. What point, just some of these federal officials have to give me a cul-pa or say we got it wrong or say something isn't working, and we understand that we made a mistake in the parameters that we've been looking at right now, futures. Our lower, you can see the S&P down 19, 37, 13, you can see the 10-year yield heading toward 4.1 percent, the real yield, as Tom keeps mentioning, surging. Just to do that for you, Tom, 1.66 percent. Surging. So really a reminder, isn't it, just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see some pressure on the U.N., we did see some pressure on the futures. That is now being reversed. Today's CFOs are reshaping the C-suite, positioning companies to meet the next generation of challenges, breaking out of traditional roles to become chief future officer, like Mary-Auth's Lenealberg. One of the most important things is looking around the corner. Adrian Mitchell from Macy's. We have to let go of the traditional legacy department store. And Lucas Iramela at Mondalees. We tend to believe that all consumers are equal, they are not. Look for chief future officer on Bloomberg. The deal was the brainchild of Apollo CEO Mark Rowan. In January, Apollo closed its $11 billion all stock merger with a theme holding. It had already owned 35 percent of the insurer. Here's what Apollo gets out of the deal. Assets under management. Apollo expects that to double to about a trillion dollars by 2026. Much of that projected growth will come from the merger. And those assets are especially attractive to Apollo. Insurance companies tip of the go after much more modest returns than buyout investors. That will give Apollo more options for investing the cash. A theme is a steady provider of fee income. It has grown into one of the nation's biggest holders of fixed annuities. Those retirement savings products favored by risk adverse customers. The merger will also allow Apollo to simplify its governance. He gave up its dual-class share structure and adopted a one share one vote plan. The hope is that will eventually lead to Apollo's inclusion in the S&P 500. For more information and insights, we think that's the next circular shift. From business's most influential and instrumental. It's mocking it out of the bullfrog. It's a challenging dynamic. This is a level of uncertainty that we have had to deal with.

16206," Certainly that we haven't had to deal with. Bloomberg Wall Street Week live Friday with replays all weekend on Bloomberg Television and Radio. Just moments away from the housing starts Wednesday, which I assume is what we're going to be calling it. We are seeing S&P lower now by nearly six tenths of a percent. Michael McKee, Bloomberg Economics and Policy Correspondent with us here to break down the numbers as we get that mic. Well, we're getting them right now, Lisa. And it looks like a beat on expectation. Not a little bit less on expectations. Put it that way. But down from last month, an 8.1 percent decline on a month over a month basis in housing starts 1,439,000. That's the annual rate at which they're built out. Building permits, we're looking for here. Building permits come in at 1,564. And that is lower than that's better than expectations. That's because they revised it here. 1,542 was last month. So it's still better than last month. So it does show that builders have some, shall we say, business left to do? I was going to say some confidence these days. But we saw the home builders index yesterday fall to the lowest basically since the 2008 financial crisis brought on by housing. And so it doesn't look like they have a lot of confidence, but they do have a lot of backlogs and they are putting housing starts, they're pulling permits. And I guess they will probably put some of those houses into the ground. So just want to give you a sense. I don't know if you can attribute it to this data, but you're looking at two year yield break out. Now, the newest highs since going back to 2007, 4.52%. You could see the dollar gaining. You could see the opposite effect. And this is basically what's good for stocks is good for bonds. What's bad for stocks is bad for bonds. You're seeing losses deep in the S&P lower. And Tom, this really speaks to what you've been talking about, which is basically how much are people looking at housing? The resilience there, not necessarily giving pause, 7 tens of a percent decline right now on the S&P. It's there. And you see it in North of the border in Canada, once again, a more persistent inflation as well. Michael McKee on a global basis, 10.1% United Kingdom, 6.x%, Canada, this is a theme, this new persistency of inflation. Is it a theme that drifts away in courting to the guesstimates or do we go into the end of the year and into next year farther distant, further distant, I should say, from transitory? Well, that's a big debate right now. Yes. A lot of people suggesting that there are forces out there that will bring inflation down, that we can only see them on the horizon, but they are going to start affecting the overall level of inflation. Others are saying, well, you know, the problem here is no longer the transitory stuff which may go down. That's the cyclical aspect to a chrysalow of FHN financial this morning saying cyclical inflation is the hardest thing to get rid of because the only way to get rid of it is to end the cycle. So the only way to get rid of it would be to have a recession. And that that is concerning to him. The one thing we can say about housing other than the construction part which maybe due to backlogs and there is a very large backlogs supply out there is that housing is the one area that has responded to the Fed mortgage applications down 4.5%. They are down 58% since the Fed started raising rates and by some measures we have 7% 30 year mortgages now. Well, we talk about kind of the need to get inflation down. Obviously that is what the Federal Reserve would like to see. They probably aren't seeing it to the degree that they want to yet. And we keep seeing these continued upside surprises and we have had conversations over the last several hours that inflation isn't realistically going to get back down to 2%. We could just be looking at something structurally higher. And does the Fed decide to make that call that either they have to go way farther to get down to 2% or they are just not going to try any more to get to 2% that they are going to target something else? Well, the idea of changing the target is something that people are beginning to talk about but that is months and months if not years away.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4552,2022-10-19 12:37:24
16207," that they're going to target something else. Well, the idea of changing the target is something that people are beginning to talk about, but that's months and months if not years away. That would be a major decision, and probably would wait until their five-year review comes up in about two and a half years or so. But the idea that they don't get down to 2%, they accept that that's a possibility. The idea that they have to make a decision of whether to keep going and raising rates, that's going to be a meeting-by-meeting decision because we're going to have to see what the data show each time and they'll have to figure it out. There's no more for guidance here. Good day, Michael McKee with us today. Always a Fed speaker. Michael McKee running all of our economic coverage is, well, he is director of White House National Economic Council, which means he is mumbed during the political season, and we are knee-deep in the political season now to the midterms. Brian Dees joins us from the White House this morning. Brian, to me, the singular note, which does wrap around your remit, is the gentle lady from Hawaii is exited the Democratic Party. And Ms. Gebard was really something about the cowardly wokeness of the elitist Democratic Party. Your boss is the most middle-class representative boss of his generation, Joe Biden, Breith Scranton. What's going to be the reset on Democratic Party economic policy for the middle class coming out of this election? Well, look, I think you're seeing it in real time, as you said, Joe Biden ran for presidents based on an economic theory that we needed to build. This economy and this economic recovery, as he says in very practical terms, from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down. And you're seeing that in practice, if you look just, for example, at what's happening in American manufacturing across this country, nearly 700,000 manufacturing jobs created, and you're seeing company after company make investments that they're making a bet, a long-term bet to make capital investments in America. Today, just today, we're going to announce almost $3 billion in grants to battery manufacturers. I was in Cleveland last week. You're seeing this explosion of interest in making the United States the place where we build and innovate, and that's going to pay benefits for the long term. You were just in Cleveland to see Cleveland Yankees admit it. Brian, I want to go. I want to go to the topic of the moment, which is the strategic political reserve. We all get the politics of it, and that you took Hydrocarbon 101 at Middlebury years ago. Can you explain to me what the democratic politics is of refilling the strategic petroleum reserve down the road? Yeah, you got it. I do have to clarify that I'm a Red Sox fan. It's important. It's important to me to get that right. Very important. So look, the president's going to announce two things today. The first is additional 15 million barrels for December out of the SPR. That makes good on the commitment that he made several months ago to release 180 million barrels and provide that stability to the market. He's making good on that commitment with the 15 million barrel release today. But second, he's announcing a plan and a policy to refill the strategic petroleum reserve when the price of oil falls to about $70 a barrel. That makes sense for two reasons. One, protecting taxpayers. We sold oil out of the SPR at a higher price at around $90 to $100 a barrel, repurchasing at $70 a barrel. It means we can actually strengthen the asset. We can get more oil back into that national reserve. And second, it provides some certainty to the industry. Because we will have the authority to both purchase when the price comes down to 70 and also enter into contracts to purchase at around $70 in the future. But one thing that's very difficult is that we're not talking about the president and what releasing more from the strategic petroleum reserve will actually do to bring down prices not only of gasoline but diesel, of the refined goods that we need, how much are you thinking about additional measures to try to shore up both the stores of diesel as well as lower prices? Are you talking about banning exports, for example, to Europe? Well, first, let's look at where we are. We have since the beginning of the summer seen gas prices come down about 30%. They're about a down about $1.15 a gallon at the pump. We see natural gas prices come off from a high of almost $9 to under $6 in trading today.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4553,2022-10-19 12:41:50
16208," 15 cents a gallon at the pump. We've seen natural gas prices come off from a high of almost $9 to under $6 in trading today. So we've seen a real reduction in energy prices, and that's consistent with and driven by the policies that this administration and that the president have directed. At the same time, we continue to be very focused on making more progress, seeing that price come down further. And the announcements today, I think, are going to help on that front. We're also addressing places where we have, but, but okay, that has come down. It hasn't come back that much, but diesel has not come down. And that affects the price of everything. And perhaps people don't see it and breathe at the way they view gasoline prices. But this is affecting very much the heating costs as well as the shipping costs and has raised questions about banning exports at a time when Europe is flat on its back as well. What's your view? Absolutely. We're very concerned about inventory levels or refined product, diesel in particular, particularly across the east coast of the United States. And we are operating right now at unacceptably low inventory levels, inventory levels for diesel that, for example, are 50, 60 percent lower than their five-year historical average. So this is a conversation that we have had with the industry consistently. And we've been very clear. We need to see more progress in building those inventories. The federal government has some tools in that respect. We have a Northeast home heating oil reserve, which is diesel. And we have looked very carefully at being prepared to deploy as in when necessary in that context. But ultimately, what we need to see is the industry build those inventory levels so that we don't put ourselves in a situation. To your question about exports, the president has been very clear and what can need to be clear. At this moment, when we have uncertainty and uncertainty for American consumers, we have to keep all options on the table. That's what we're doing. Right, right, right. Real quickly, what's going to be the trigger point to understand whether it is time to look at exports? Well, look, I'm not going to explicitly make a decision before the president or articulate a decision before the president has made it. But the president is going to continue to do what he has done over the course of the last several months, which is assess the market, understand where we are, and understand the tools that we have and the impact that they'll have. Today, he's announcing a release from the Sprow, but also importantly, this repurchased plan, which is something that industry analysts and others have been calling for for some time. We think that this will make some difference. We're going to keep at it, keep a close eye on these things with an understanding that we have these tools on the table and we'll deploy them when it's in America's interest. Brian D's director of the White House National Economic Council. Thank you, Tom. All options on the table, potentially even including banning exports as we head into winter with very low stores.

Right now we're seeing crude very far away from the price that they're talking about. Still seeing about $89 barrel. If you look at WTI, $84 barrel. Excuse me.

What are the moonshots at Amazon that are capturing most of your time and attention? Well, you know, we have a unique way that we look at big new investments. And I'm not sure it's right or wrong. It just happens to be our way. And we ask ourselves when we're considering something for questions. We ask if it's successful, can it be big and move the needle in Amazon? Is it being well served today? Do we have a differentiated approach? And do we have confidence there? And if not, can we acquire quickly? If we like the answer to those questions, we'll go pursue it with a single-threaded team that isn't distracted by the rest of the business. When it comes to the stock, it has fallen significantly. Do you think investors are missing something or has tech just been overvalued? I have never tried to predict what the stock's going to do. In any time I've tried to a little bit, I've been wrong. I do really believe that in the short term, the stock market tends to be a voting machine and the long term it tends to be a waiting machine. We have a concept we talk about a lot of Amazon inputs and outputs. You know, and the ultimate output for a company is share price. You know, and then other big outputs are free cash flow or profit or revenue. You can't really manage the outputs. You have to manage at the input level, and that's where we spend all our time. And so if you do the right things for the business long term, things tend to work out. I think we've had very good returns for investors, and I expect that to be true again.

Air Force Academy and actual pilot running an airline, the chief executive officer with United, the pilot Scott Kirby joins us this morning. Scott, I got 18 questions from viewers that have everything to do with the United Lounge, this, that and the other thing. I want to talk about the ratio of business class to economy fairs. I follow one United Fair and it's $6 for every dollar of economy. I've never seen it. Where is business class in three years? So thanks for the intro. By the way, that's a unique one and I like it. But business travel, business class is demand is really, really strong. It's really really strong in economy, but it's even stronger in the premium cabinet. United has more premium seats than in the other airline in the country. One, one whole business demand has mostly come all the way back to Europe at least. It's even stronger than it is. It's harder to do calls with someone in Europe. But the other trend, I think, that's huge is there's more premium leisure demand. And really that is enabled by hybrid work. Hybrid work makes every weekend a potential holiday weekend. And there's people that are going to Europe and they'll work for one or two weeks in Europe. And they work during the day, they go out late at night with the French and Spanish. By the way, I think possibly going out with the French and Spanish by state on East Coast time. And I think it's a permanent step level increase in demand. Both weekend travel, but also for premium to me to the volatility, the signal nature of your total return of stock is a new persistency of cash flow from business class enough to give you a more persistent cash flow on your financial statement. Well, look, I think we'll still have volatility will still be impacted by the economy or short term in the fuel prices. So it won't eliminate cyclicality. But what it does is more important, which I think it raises the level. So the lowest period of revenue will be higher than it was before and the highest period will be even higher. It doesn't take out the cyclicality, but it does raise the bar across the board. It's just a new permanently higher level of demand. But to that point, Scott, we've spent the better part of the last three hours talking about whether or not we're seeing a softening in demand, which is what policymakers are trying to engineer to bring inflation down inflation, which in some sectors of the economy means people are just spending less in certain areas. It does not seem that it has hit air travel yet. Do you expect that the demand deterioration is going to come and will that ultimately mean you don't have the pricing power to keep fairs high?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4556,2022-10-19 12:54:16
16211," seem that it has hit air travel yet. Do you expect that the demand deterioration is going to come? And will that ultimately mean you don't have the pricing power to keep fair-sci? Well, I think the slowing economy and or a recession are going to be a headwind. I mean, already are a headwind demand. But there's three trends in aviation that I think are more, they're currently more than fully all-setting. I think we'll take you one. We're still in the COVID recovery phase. Japan just opened last week. No matter what you think business travel is in a ultimately get-to, it is going to go almost certainly going higher from here. So we're still in COVID recovery, unlike most industries. The second one is this hybrid work making every weekend a holiday trend. Like September was the third highest razz in the history of the United States. That is an off-peak month. What happened during September, and we saw it even earlier, we're seeing it. And October, by the way, is going to be better than September. So it's going to move to fourth place. Is people are now able to work remotely for one or two days. So they can, instead of being tethered to their desk at the office, they can leave Wednesday or Thursday, go somewhere, yeah, remotely for one or two days. They're taking extra trips. That's a trend that's not appreciated by the market. It's unique to aviation. It's offsetting those economic headwinds. It's a tailwind that's offsetting. Yeah, Scott, we call that doing a John Farrow in the North-Sovagal. So why don't you continue, Kayleigh, with Mr. Kennedy? Well, that's on the demand side, Scott. But there also is the fact that you are still constrained on the supply side. Capacity is still more limited. And in part of that has to do with the labor equation. Can you just give us your best estimate as to whether or not you're ultimately going to be able to expand capacity again? Or is this a structural labor issue in the air economy, which is going to stick around? So first of your airline investor, it would have been the third and made perhaps most important trend that while there's a really strong demand environment, supply is going to be constrained for years to come by artificial factors. Now, it's a less of a constraint for United. We're at the high end. We're at the top of the funnel, top of the pyramid for people wanting to be paid. But there's not enough pilots in the industry. That's not the only constraint. Boeing and Airbus are way behind. And the supply change are way behind on their ability to use their airplanes. Air traffic control, saturation. There's airports in Europe and other places that are full. These are like four or five-year problems. If you start fixing today, multi-year problems. Scott, when you're in New York next time, landing at Newark and hopefully landing at JFK with that battle, I want to talk about the landing gates and all that. But Mirish Langenstein, who's our ACE Airport reporter, says, if you don't ask Scott about Boeing 737, 8 over to a 7, and they're going to add 12 more seats, and they're going to take this wing and add it on. Scott, this is not confidence building with the redo of the Boeing MAX. I mean, it's not confident building. Do you have confidence that you guys in the FAA can get together to get that plane up in the air? Yeah, well, I think you're talking about the MAX 10 and high-marry. Good to hear from you virtually. But here's what I think about the MAX 10. First for United, if somehow the Air MAX 107 don't get certified into the current standards, our plan is we're going to convert some of those MAX 10s into MAX 8s and 9s, and our large airplane we're going to order more Airbus 8221s, and that's going to be our large airplane. And Boeing will compensate us for that. So for United, it's not really a big deal financially, but it's the right safety outcome. This is the most important point. Having, it's just a different length of airplane. It's the same airplane and a different length. And you'd never want to make two different cockpits or procedures for the exact same airplane. That detracts from safety. So I think because it's the right safety outcome, we will get to the right answer where the MAX 7 and 10 will get certified like the MAX 8 and the MAX 9. I think the more important point is a bigger one for the country, for the United States of America. Boeing is our largest high tech exports, manufacturing jobs, high paying jobs. And the question is about, are airlines around the world going to buy MAX 10s? Or are they going to buy Airbus 8341s? And the real question is, is the right safety answer, are these planes going to get produced in Seattle? Are they going to get built in Europe and Asia? OK, China. I want both Boeing and Airbus to do well for healthy competition, but the right answer is the MAX 10s. We are out of time. We need to see you when you're in New York next time.

It's just been there forever, hasn't it? Yeah, it's something we'll continue to follow as with the earning story more broadly, especially the impact of the stronger dollar that we're hearing company after company warning about. There's more on deck. Futures and negative 22 doubt futures and negative 139. The VIX elevated. We're looking at yields. You need to watch for higher yields. This is Bloomberg. Material samples brought back from objects in space can shed light on billions of years of our solar system's history, including details about the origin of life here on Earth. A piece of an asteroid is a piece of the earliest beginnings of a solar system. But picking up rocks from the surface of an asteroid or planetary satellite isn't as easy as it sounds. It requires voyages of millions of miles to bodies that have never been seen up close. Probes need to land on surfaces with weak gravitational poles where the surface terrain is completely unknown, gather samples, and then make the long trip back. And while the hemates like NASA and SpaceX grab headlines, it's a relatively young space agency. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, better known as Jaxa, that is taking the giant leap necessary to bring the mysteries of space back down to Earth.

The countdown to the open starts right now.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4558,2022-10-19 13:02:44
16213," Starts right now. Everything you need to get set for the start of U.S. training. This is Bloomberg, the Open with Jonathan Pera. We begin with the big issue, torn between earnings resilience and inflation concerns. Resilience has been the key word. There are some positive news on earnings. They're actually pretty resilient. Earning so far have proven indeed to underscore that story of resilience. The bar is low. Companies have a lot of levers to pull and use in order to engineer better earnings. Company earnings do not yet reflect the wide and macroeconomic expectations. You can have a weaker economic environment and actually a solid earnings environment. I do think downgrade the still coming to 2023 earnings inflation was supposed to be moderating. Now it looks like we're going into extra earnings. Wage pressures are pushing into prices now. This is presenting a real challenge for not only the Fed, but the broader economy. It's a game of chicken going on right now. The Fed on one side versus earnings on the other. Joining us now is so pleased to say Morgan Stanley, Lisa Charlotte and Black Rock's Tony Despirito, Lisa starting with you. Yes, earnings are coming better than expected, but is it good enough? Well, the question is good enough for what? I think the fundamental issue is if this is a market that has extraordinary impatience and just wants to quote unquote, be done with it already. And I think that the frustrating piece of this is that Q3 earnings are not allowing us to see that capitulation, that rebasing and resetting of 2023 earnings expectations yet. There's still a huge tailwind of the power of nominals or pricing power and inflation in the results we're getting. And so the commentary about resilience, I think, is going to ultimately prove to be a head-sake, but it's not yet a clearing event that sets up for a durable, viable bottom in this market. Which really raises an issue, Tony, of whether these earnings are really relevant given the lack of visibility and given that we might not have seen the weakness yet, but it will still come. So I do think third quarter earnings, unfortunately, are a lagging indicator, not a leading indicator. The Fed just started raising rates this March. And that first increase was 25 basis points. That was seven months ago. And we all know it takes time for Fed rate increases to impact the real economy and earnings. It doesn't even start for six months. And then the peak impact is really 18 months down the road. And of course, the Fed has done a lot in a short period of time, right? 300 basis points since the beginning here. So I don't think we've felt the full impact yet. And so I do think in the near term, that means bumpiness in the market. And there's still some good news there. I think the good news is there are things that, as acid allocators and portfolio managers, we can be doing to build more resiliency in our portfolios. And then as I look longer term, I do think valuations are certainly much more attractive today than they were at the beginning of the year. And that does spell better things for long term returns. So I do think it's important to stay invested, but to prepare for more volatility in the near term. And Lisa, do you agree? I mean, Bewarelli's Art Hogan sees Q3 results as a potential catalyst for equity saying quote, what is important to remember is that second quarter earnings came in much better than feared. Spurking a solid July rally, there is a credible possibility that history may repeat itself, this go around. Perhaps, and even your colleague, Mike Wilson, may agree with that, but do you agree with Tony that this actually could be part of a longer term gaining cycle. So it's okay if there's some volatility on the downside after that. Absolutely. I mean, I think we're going to be on this roller coaster to know where, where periodically we're going to get these bear market rallies where, as I said, this is a very impatient market. Investors seemingly have no tolerance for pain. And so any side that the wind may begin to blow their way.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4559,2022-10-19 13:07:31
16214," market, investors seemingly have no tolerance for pain. And so any sign, you know, that the wind may begin to blow their way, you know, gets a two or three day rally going. But, you know, I completely agree with Tony that we have not seen the real impact of tighter financial conditions and tighter monetary policy on either the slowing in the economy and or corporate earnings. So that is still in front of us. We still need to rebase numbers. And unfortunately, it doesn't look like Q3 is going to be that, you know, capitulative, you know, event that pushes those 2023 and 2024 numbers down to where they probably ultimately will go. So what do you do with this, Lisa? I mean, you basically sell the rally now and prepare for whatever downturn comes after we start to get more of a sense of that bleed through of higher rates. No, not at all. So we also agree with Tony that this is a time to be fully invested. But it's a time to be fully invested in an asset allocation that acknowledges the environment that we're in. And that environment is this very sideways change of leadership, you know, end of a cycle beginning of a new cycle, you know, type positioning, which means you've got to be ultra diversified. You've got to, you know, really take advantage of where the bond market is right now. The leaves at the bond market is much further along in discounting this Fed cycle than the stock market. We like investment grade, particularly, you know, in the shorter to intermediate duration. And within stocks, we are looking for value. We are getting opportunities to be active stock pickers. And we're seeing it, you know, in in various sectors, in various geographies, especially with the dollar and in multi-nationals are very interesting to us right now. We're seeing it by factors exposure. So we're not growth or value. Yeah, so we're, you know, to pick our spots. But there are opportunities in this market. We're just going to have to be patient. Talking about some of the consumer facing international's multi-nationals, there have been a string of beats, had a lot of third quarter results in the past 24 hours, including some of those multi-nationals like Proctor and Campbell. We also have gotten Netflix and Nestle for more. Let's bring in Bloomberg's Taylor Briggs Taylor. Yeah, Lisa, I mean, for the most part, it has been a little bit better than expected. Some of this could just be the lowered again, expectations coming into this. But when you think about the numbers are still looking at about 2% growth on earnings on a year over your basis. And of course, relative to expectations for both the sales and the earnings, it is coming a little bit ahead. And you also highlight 9% sales growth on a year over your basis. Highlighting some of that price, um, pressure. Of course, some of these companies are able to pass on through to the consumer. I want to caution, it is very early days. There's still a long ways to go in this season. But so far, here's how we're thinking about things by sector. You mentioned Netflix, a huge blow out yesterday. Communications has actually been a little bit of a laggard in terms of where we are versus, um, estimates, expectations. But down at the bottom, you can see some of the big sort of outperformers have been discretionary. It's been industrial. So then of course, it's been some of the utilities as well that are doing okay as long as bond yields stable out here. I think at the beginning, Lisa, I mentioned where we are relative to expectations because all of this is sort of the positioning coming into the earnings season. We are now looking at 19 straight weeks of earnings revisions lower. So, if you said a bar low enough, you're bound to beat it, I suppose. Taylor Riggs, thank you so much. Lisa, Charlotte and Tony, to Spirito, still with us. Tony, what's your take in terms of what the signal is to get from earnings, especially given the fact that you've got the likes of Goldman Sack saying we haven't priced in recession. There's further downside to go. A lot of people seem to agree and yet we're not seeing it now. We're going to possibly see it at another time. Yeah, so I think the thing to do as investors is to both be positioned for resiliency as well as try to be offensive in unique ways. So for example, you know, I think of a barbell strategy between sicklecality and stability. And I think you can add value there on both.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4560,2022-10-19 13:11:50
16215," But just as Department prosecutors believe there is sufficient evidence to charge Trump, the path to an actual indictment is a little bit less clear, timing politics. And Lisa, this is not necessarily new, but it seems as though maybe they have a bit more evidence in this direction around the mishandling of those classified records. Again, there's a possible charge of obstruction of justice against Donald Trump. And it's not likely anything will happen, I guess, ahead of those November 8 midterm elections. But one former member of the FBI does think that this could happen by the end of the year. Happy, thank you so much. Coming up, UK inflation, hitting double digits yet again. People are struggling, it is difficult. Maybe that's why we put in place the energy price guarantee. We've delivered the energy price guarantee. We've helped people this winter, and I will continue to do that. That conversation is still ahead. 17 minutes to the opening bell with futures lower. And we do have 6.10% decline, 307.09. This is Bloomberg. Imagine simply climbing a cable into space. The concept is known as the space elevator. But only could it significantly change how we leave planet Earth. But it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space. And there are scientists who think we could have already built it. We have the material, we have the technology, we have the lasers, we have the climbers, we have all of it. If a private entity wants to build it or a government, they can build it. It'll change society. We have no clue how colonizing in the space, how really spreading in the space, really change our society over the next 50 to 200 years. It'll be completely different. What are the biggest names in business? Top experts, great questions. I have been honest about the mistakes I've made. But what I don't apologise for is the fact that we have helped households through this winter, through the energy price guarantee, the fact that we reverse the national insurance ride and the fact that we are taking action to get our railways running. Brutal PMQs where she was accused, Liz Truss, of not being able to keep her word for more than a week and not really being the true leader of the United Kingdom. And we have a new UK inflation hitting a 40 year high again, adding more pressure on policy makers to act even as markets remain on edge with all the political back and forth. This coming, as investors look for an FX intervention over in Japan, as the Yenahit's a 32-year low against the dollar, team coverage starting right now, let's start with Lucy Burden. In Westminster, can we just get a sense of how controversial those PMQs were and where that leaves Liz Truss' Prime Minister ship? Well, I was speaking to a Tory MP after this session of Prime Minister's questions and he said at least she turned up, which shows just how low the bar was for this performance. The big surprise was that she said she's committed to the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4561,2022-10-19 13:18:58
16216," Minister's questions and he said at least she turned up, which shows just how low the bar was for this performance. The big surprise was that she said she's committed to the triple lock on pensions, which guarantees that pensions will rise with the highest of earnings inflation or 2.5%. It was a big surprise. It surprised the newspaper editors who'd been briefed that they were going to drop this commitment or at least that it was under threat. It makes a full of newspaper editors when she needs them on side. It makes a full of the ministers who were briefing it and it makes her chancellors job even harder because he's going to have to plug that £40 billion whole in the public finances somehow else. It raises the question of whether she'll raise benefits in line with inflation because Chowna has said that he's going to protect the most vulnerable and as you say we've now got back to double digit inflation so there is huge pressure on him to help them out. It really smacks of incompetence, very, very weird decision. And meanwhile people are looking up for the Bank of England to make a bold move to try to counteract some of the inflation on the other side, possibly creating more disruption. Meanwhile over in Japan, yet more potential policy turmoil, the speculation of this has been running for a long time. However, we are reaching levels that become unsustainable certainly for policymakers, certainly the speed at which the end has been weakening. And I mean, Sasawa here for more, what do you think is the threshold for some sort of intervention as we see the end bump up or down I should say against $150 with a dollar really strengthening? Well, Lisa, you just hit the nail on the head. It's all about the speed of the move. That's all the matters, right? I mean, you can continue on with the old curve control in Japan. You can even change from the 10 years to the 5 years of target or even move the band a little bit wider. But at the end of the day, it's all about the fact that Japan has plenty of reserves and they're willing to defend their currency as far as it will go. Well, we'll see about the speed and we'll see how it goes. What I'm most focused on is the broader Asian region because what you're seeing is that the reserve's globally are down 8% year to date. A lot of it due to the dollar strength relative to the development market peers. But I mean, my goodness, you're seeing reserves get pummeled and in places like Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, they're already engaging in all forms of intervention, operation, twist. You hear people on the tape each and every day. So it's not just relegated to Japan or the UK. It's expanding to the whole of the EM as well. All right, Damian Sassar, Lizzie Burden to both of you. Thank you so much. Still with us, Tony Desperado and Lisa Shalett and Tony at what point does the rest of the world's problems become the US problems? Yeah, so I mean, the rest of the world problems have been mostly caused by the strength and the dollar. And so I don't think it works that way. Usually it works the other way. US has problems become the world problems. And so I'm not super concerned, but I'm watchful. And watchful of market dislocations like what we saw in the UK. And certainly when you think about what could cause a Fed pivot, these are things that are on the list. Lisa, we were talking about multinational as being a potential opportunity. Where is that versus a potential liability given some of the foreign sales at a time of dollar strength? Yeah, look, I mean, I think this is one of the conundrums at the minute, which is, you know, for US companies right now, you know, the strength and the dollar has gone from, you know, a non-factor to a negative factor. For the US economy as a whole, however, the very strong dollar has actually, believe you're not, kept a lid on inflation given the percentage of our economy and our consumption that we import. And so one of the interesting dynamics here is whether or not the US dollar at some point in 2023, when that potential Fed cause or pivot comes, you know, does that weakening dollar then actually become a liability for the Fed? Because it's very destabilizing vis-a-vis declining inflation. So these are really complex cross-currence. We're seeing extremes in this cycle in terms of US dollar strength, not versus emerging markets, which we very often see. Emerging markets actually on the whole have been resilient and have held up, but we're seeing these devastating discontinuities.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4562,2022-10-19 13:23:48
16217," and see emerging markets actually on the whole have been resilient and have held up. But we're seeing these devastating discontinuities, but you know, with our key trading partners, like the UK, like Europe, and like Japan, Lisa, please destabilizing. How focused on the US are you in terms of your investment portfolio? I mean, are you basically completely overweight, hiding out in the US, or are you starting to dabble in some of those emerging markets or even the United Kingdom? We absolutely are doubting. We think that there are some very, very good value opportunities. We're leading with the app right now in terms of our interests, but we're again, as I noted, we're scrambling through and searching through the wreckage for those multinationals in Japan, in Europe, in the UK, we're going to make hay on a global competitive basis with their currencies where they are. Tony, final word on this point? Yes, I run a large cap US value fund, but as part of that, we look at multinationals and other geographies because they're competitors to the US companies we're looking at. Right now, I've got about 20% of the portfolio in non-US companies. They're all multinationals. A lot of companies in energy or pharmaceuticals, what we're finding is a headquartered discount, so very similar business models. I'll take energy, for example. The US integrated versus the European integrated. There's a huge multiple gap there with the European integrated being almost half the multiple of the US, but you look at the business mix, incredibly similar. So that's a better deal, and so that's when we'll stray outside the US to get that better deal. Energy is an example. Also pharmaceuticals. That's the other place where we're seeing opportunities outside of the US. This is Charlotte, Tony Desperado. Thank you so much, fascinating about international, multinational companies outside of the US. Coming up the morning calls and later in Besco's Kevin Holt, looking for earnings estimates to keep coming down. He and a lot of others will be joining us around the opening bell right now. That softness hanging in there around six cents of a decline. Sixth, seventh percent, thirty-seven, eleven. This is Bloomberg. A lot of the satellites have propulsion systems. They can kind of move to get out of the way of each other or change their orbit a little bit. It's a service that you guys offer to help these companies know how to maneuver their machines. Yeah, we offer a collision avoidance service. It's a subscription service. We'll send you an alert up to seven days in advance if your satellite is going to come dangerously close to a piece of debris or another satellite. Companies have been doing that for decades moving satellites around, but it's sort of like a harder problem now. The risk of a collision is a lot higher now. Just because we've installed so much more hardware into space. You have a big collision that creates a cloud of debris and now all the other satellites are flying through this whizzing mess of debris. As we add all of the new satellites into space, the risks of a collision, the likelihood of the collisions going up. The number of satellites is going to be the same.

There's more activity in the fusion world than ever and not just in government research labs. There's also an emerging private fusion industry that's attracted billions of dollars in capital in recent years. Governments and private investors alike realize that we've got to find a solution that's going to allow us to get to net zero targets. This is one of the hardest but most rewarding problems that humanity could work on. Ultimately, we all want the same thing. We want someone to put electricity on the grid from a fusion power station as quickly as possible. Frankly, the scale of the challenge 3000 gigawatts of fossil fuel to replace. There's not many things they can do that. In fact, there may only be fusion that can really do that. And while many in the scientific community predict fusion power will take decades, some in the private fusion space, believe we'll get there in just a few years as soon as the 2030s.

And right now people are starting to get adjusted to inflation that keeps beating to the upside, keeps pressure there. 10-year yields hitting at one point. And currently the highest level is going back to 2008 near 4.1%. The Euro weekening, 97-85 versus the dollar crude. Just edging up, but really right now the story is very much in the yield space with two-year yields hitting the highest. Going back to 2007. Joining us now with a look at the stocks moving at the opening bell. Abigail, do a little Abby. Well Lisa, we are looking at our first down day in a few days and not surprisingly as you were just talking about rising yields, pressuring stocks overall. But especially big tech, take a look at Apple right now down 1.2% valuation. More of a concern when yields rise that repricing of risk. JP Morgan Chase banks also not really getting a bit even though yields are higher that's been the story of the year. Probably because the yield curves are coming in just a little bit, but JP Morgan Chase well off of its 1% lows. Plus that stock's been up a lot in recent days off of that good quarter and maybe it's going to flip right now. Spirit airlines up 2.2% on the news that the shareholder shareholders have backed a $3.8 billion purchase by JetBlue. Of course we're spending this back and forth between JetBlue and Frontier. But right now it does appear that shareholders are approving this deal with JetBlue and they expect this deal to close no later than the first half of 2024. That's a ways off. So let's see what else happens in this story. And then finally Netflix heading to its best day since January of this year on a monster quarter. Growth is returning and they're looking at a forecast of 4.5 million subscribers for the fourth quarter. And that is really helping the stock out in a big way on the daily side. Actually growth not shrinking Abby. Thank you so much. Let's stick with Netflix CEO Reed Hastings applauding his company's return to growth. Take a listen. Well, thank God we're done with shrinking quarters. So that's the big feeling of we're back to the positivity. We still got effects. So that's a huge hit, you know, as we've explained. So that's not going to go away. But other than that, all the stars are lighting up very well for us. Reed Hastings taking it religious Bloomberg said, Ludlow, joining us now for more Ed. Yeah, 2.41 million subscribers in the quarter double what they had forecast 4.5 million new net subscribers come in the current fourth quarter. The street likes the story. They like the visibility on the growth trajectory. They like the idea that an ad supported tier comes this November. They like the idea that password sharing will be charged as of next year. They're ahead wind still, though. They spoke about the stronger dollar, right? That's going to mean a $1 billion hit to revenue and an $800 million hit to profit. Even so, the street still bullish because they believe that an ad supported tier will increase subscribers by meaningful volume. This is a company that's having strength globally, right? Korea was a strong point in terms of local language content, which helped to drive growth. There are also stronger markets like Latin America and other parts of Asia. Interestingly, despite the guidance for the fourth quarter, they are going to suspend forecasting quarterly subscribers. This is a company where executives have been banging their head on the armchair saying, please stop getting so obsessed about subscriber growth. Look at our traditional financial metrics in the quarter, a beat on the top and bottom line. But again, take into account that stronger dollar. We knew this earnings season it would have a factor and it has done so for Netflix. Although, thank you so much. United Airlines latest to clock and earnings beat during the ranks of Proctor and Gamble and Netflix as we were just talking about. And, Nestle, Bloomberg's Taylor Riggs is back with us for more. We were just speaking with Scott Kirby of United. What's the latest? You know, wild Lisa, 4.30 yesterday after the closing bell, we get comments from United Airlines saying that the COVID recovery trend will really overcome any recessionary fears. And for me, that is the statement. And then, of course, when they come out and they say that the fourth quarter adjusted operating margins will also exceed 2019. So that really shows the pricing power amid some of the capacity declines and the strength of United Airlines. Let's talk about some of the inflationary pressures with some of the other big earnings, of course, that we're getting. Also, this morning, Proctor and Gamble, one of them, like Netflix, highlighting the strength of that dollar, you know that the pressure that that puts on overseas revenue in a different currency. And when you translate onto a dollar-based balance sheet, then the pressure that that causes, Adobe facing a similar story of 4% currency had one there, but otherwise sales looking about $19 billion for the full year. Intuitive surgical is an interesting one. Also raising that full year growth to 17 to 18%.

Intuitive surgical and interesting one, also raising that full year growth to 17 to 18% previous estimates had been around 15% and a lot of analysts are seeing some strength within hospitals still spending on some of these Abbott, of course, is just a declineer as well looking at some decline in revenue profit after those baby formula shortages, but overall Lisa it has been a relatively good season here so far. And the bar had been pretty low and people initially were pretty happy with it, although we'll see whether yields continue to erode that. Taylor, thanks. Thank you so much. Dollars getting started to cut into third quarter results as we've been talking about PNG, Netflix, Adobe, all warning of the side effects. Let's bring in more with Kaley lines. Kaley. Well, Lisa Taylor was just talking about PNG where you're definitely seeing this showing up. They're saying their full year profit is going to be at the lower end of the forecast. They talked about a number of different headwinds, one of them being for an exchange that's stronger dollar. Ultimately, for an exchange having a negative 6% impact in sales for the fiscal first quarter. You also have, of course, the pricing issue. They're facing higher input costs, but what that means is they are passing those higher costs on pricing up 9% in the quarter. So overall that led to organic revenue growth of about 7 percentage points. That is, of course, the inflation issue coming through to get back to the dollar though. PNG, not the only one warning about this as you said. We heard it from Netflix too. Ed mentioned it. That's part of the reason the sales forecast came up short, but the list is much longer than that. Basically, every multinational company is going to face this in some shape or form because as the Taylor said, all the money you wake overseas and weaker currencies is worth a lot less. We have to translate it back into dollars at the other end. And that is likely why we have seen companies with high international sales exposure underperforming those with low international exposure. And as for what those companies are, a lot of them are technology companies. If you look at the international revenue exposure as a percentage of revenue for sectors in the S&P 500, it is 52% for technology. Of course, we are going to get a lot of those big tech names reporting results next week. So watch out for that dollar keyword and you have materials and communication as well as staples and financial trees. Of course, we have already been hearing from. Taylor, lines, thank you so much. Right now joining us, Investco's Kevin Holt who sees further downside in stocks as an opportunity writing quote, stocks are likely to see continued valuation compression and earnings estimates will need to come down. We see the S&P 500 becoming more compelling around 3,000 to 3,400 and cyclical equities further discount economic concerns. We will look to build exposures. Kevin joins us now and honestly, Kevin, it's amazing to see how people talk about bearish cases, how far they go down as a sign of optimism. How far away are we from that right now as we get 3700 on the heels of earnings that have been better than expected? Yeah, so it's, I mean, I would say one thing, earnings have been better than expected so far, but we've had a lot of financial stocks where interest rates have gone up, so they've been a beneficiaries of that. I think as we get further into the earnings reporting season, you're going to see more stress. You can see from PNG results, which you guys just talked about. There's a lot of going to be a lot of pressure on the consumer and is that consumers 2 thirds of the US economy. So is that pressure build that's going to become difficult? But I think we're all looking for inflation to peak. And when inflation peak, even though earnings may continue to go down, I think that's a signal that we can look to and say, okay, now it's time we can really get back and balled. And we're not there yet. So probably Q1, Q2 of next year is my estimation of hopefully when things will bottom out on inflation basis. Kevin, we were just speaking with Lisa Shalad in Tony DeSpirito and they were talking about liking multinational companies outside the US who could actually have the reverse kind of effect of some of the multinational in the US that are seeing the dollar as a headwind and having it actually be a tailwind. Do you have a similar kind of perspective as you try to invest in something preparing ahead for perhaps a better opportunity to buy? Yeah, so we don't, I mean, I, you know, having a five-year time horizon, which is a little bit longer than probably most investors, we don't really, we look at currency probably is more transient with a lot of the geopolitical issues we have going on right now. I think that the dollars artificially strong could these geopolitical issues continue on indefinitely possibly, but I think that's unlikely. So we view the dollars being, you know, extremely high, being a transient issue and we're not really letting that affect our investment decisions. With a five-year time horizon, Kevin, how do you game out where we're going with the benchmark rate and the value?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4566,2022-10-19 13:41:08
16221," being a transient issue and we're not really letting that affect our investment decisions. With a five-year time horizon, Kevin, how do you game out where we're going with the benchmark rate and the valuation prospect longer term for really where these valuations ought to be on the equity side? Yeah, so we are using history and it is difficult when we have it, you know, most of us have not been through an off-interest rate cycle. So I think you have to look at the normal multiple historically, 15, 16 times, and that's kind of where my 3,300 to 3,400 come out in terms of earnings are coming down from probably about 250 expectations for 23 to that 210 to probably 220 level for next year. So that makes me think that we'll kind of bottom out around there. With that said, I think a lot of the inflation issues in terms of oil, I don't think oil is going to get better and all it gets going to work. I think food as soon as we can rectify some of the situations or hopefully the Ukraine Russia situation resolves itself, you know, that situation or resolve itself wages probably a little more difficult, you know, that's probably a one to two-year time horizon and the same with rents. But as we kind of approach, I think we still go back to a positive backdrop. I'd be very constructive on a 3 to 5-year basis right now. It's just the next 6 to 9 months and I think I'll trick you. We're going to continue the conversation coming up. And Vesco's Kevin Holt will be sticking with us. Coming up, we've got the Biden administration planning. Another SPR release. President's going to announce two things today. The first is additional 15 million barrels for December out of the SPR. Second, he's announcing on the plan and a policy to refill the strategic petroleum reserve when the price of oil falls to about $70 a barrel. Sation still ahead with President Biden's energy adviser, Amos Hockstein. That's coming up. This is Bloomberg. Welcome to the Board at this part, That's how the North Americaminutets actually thinks. тур off the lines. The theory of this bill, I understand it, is there would be a multiplier effect. How to Democrats mobilize specifically younger voters, bringing you the political news you need to know. The president has made it very clear that this is a significant focus for the intersection of Wall Street and Washington. Nobody covers politics like Bloomberg. What do Formula One cars and your local supermarket have in common? Well, strange as it sounds, they might both be using the same technology. A lot of innovation has trickled down from the world of high tech engines, and it hasn't just found a new life in road cars. F1 cars have long been thought of as the peak of cool, and technology in them is also helping to pull down our produce aisles. Engineers from Williams are using their knowledge from nine constructors' championships, working with company Aerofoil, to help reduce the energy consumption of supermarkets. The device they're building is based on the design of an F1 car's rear wing. It attaches to fridges to keep more cool air in the unit. They estimate it can reduce supermarket energy consumption by 25%. One innovation from F1 is also helping hybrids reduce their carbon footprint. That's curves, or the kinetic energy recovery system. In common parlance, it's known as regenerative braking, and works by storing energy of the car, decelerating in a battery for later use. If that's not enough, F1 is now looking at hers, or a thermal energy recovery system, looking to harness the heat produced from braking and the engine exhaust. That could allow cars to generate the same power using 30% less fuel. So, while F1 may have a reputation as a gas fuzzler, some of its innovations in the name of speed are helping in the everyday fight against climate change.

And Lisa Abram was in for Jonathan Farrow. For viewers worldwide, we're now joined by Amos Hockstein, special presidential coordinator for energy security. From Washington, DC, Amos. Thank you so much for being with us. I want to start with what President Biden has talked a lot about, which is the release of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in additional one as prices climb a bit, but are still just $3.85 relative to the $5 a barrel that we saw earlier in $5 a gallon that we saw earlier in the summer. Why do an SPR release now, given the fact that prices have come down as much as they have? Well, first good morning, and it's pleasure to be with you again as well. Look, the President has been committed over the last many months to take every action to keep oil prices down and translate that into keeping gasoline prices down. So we're doing two things today. One is the release of $15 million, which as you know, when we announce it today, these barrels will come on the market in December when there may be other events happening in oil markets and as a result of whatever Vladimir Putin has in mind, once the oil markets are affected by the EU ban. So we're taking steps today to make sure that the U.S. market is supplied. Second is to tell American oil companies and gas companies that they should immediately take their profits and then start increasing their investment back in America and to increase production, increase capEx, increase production. And to do that, we're giving them the certainty that we are going to be purchasing back the oil into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve once prices, if they've prices come down towards $70. So the combination of these two announcements today should allow for prices to come down now, hold them from increasing in case something happens and incentivize American companies to increase capEx, investment and production. AMOS, this is focusing on the crude product, not the distal it. And I know that you guys don't control distal it. So this isn't going to be something in your remit. But we have heard, we were just talking to Brian Deese, about the potential to restrict export of certain distal it. In particular, diesel, as those prices do not come down to historical lows, how much do you think that that could be a benefit to the U.S. to reduce or even ban some of those exports to some of our allies? Well, that's not what we're discussing at the moment. That's not what we're announcing today. That's a hypothetical conversation that I never take anything off the table, but it's not what we are announcing today or anytime in the very near future. So I would put that aside and focus on where we are, which is trying to bring down the price. There is no doubt we are concerned about on the diesel side, on inventories. We hope that American companies favor and ship their products to different parts of the United States to make sure that we have what we need. But at the same time, we're looking right now to increase that production and to invest back in the United States, because I think the most urgent thing is to make sure that as we've already seen gasoline prices coming down in the United States, that we continue to see that happening even faster. And again, we can't just have the SPR, we need American companies to increase production and to invest so that we have across the value chain, we have enough to ensure the American economy continues to be strong and to fight against the inflation concerns that people have.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4568,2022-10-19 13:49:33
16223," Across the value chain, we have enough to ensure the American economy continues to be strong and to fight against the inflation concerns that people have. That's a long term. On the short term, what we do have the SPR, that has been the tool, and it's been a tool that this administration has used. You talk about buying barrels back at the $67.72 range at a time when crude right now is $84. We have a long way to go before we get there and we have inventories at the lowest levels going back to the early 1980s. How concerned are you about a lack of firepower in the one immediate tool that we have if things do get difficult going into this winter? So look, I think that we can do multiple things at the same time. We, I think the point that you're making that we're nowhere near $70 is exactly why it's time for American companies to increase production. That's not the long term. That's actually the short term. These are short cycles. Investment is already increasing. We won't like it to increase more. But the fact that we're at $84, I'm not saying that we're trying to bring the price to $70. I'm saying that if it goes to $70, they know that we are going to come in the United States government is going to come into the market as a buyer. And that creates a little bit more of certainty for companies as they weigh the risk of increasing investment. So we are mitigating that risk. When it comes to the distillate and to diesel supply, look, we are very concerned. We would like to see and to ensure the President has been very clear, we want to make sure that the US is protected. And that means to make sure that we have the ability to use the SPR as a tool, which the President has used with enormous effect of, you know, if you look at the banks and everybody else, what they're saying about it's been enormously effective. Yeah. We want to continue to use that. As we go into the winter, we want to make sure that there's diesel and heating oil and gasoline that is available in case there are storms. That is something that we're already paying attention to. And I think American companies should be paying attention to that too and doing their share. 20 seconds, Ann. How did you come up with $67, $72? It's a very specific amount for the floor. Well, I think that we've been having conversations with, I talked to my colleagues and I talked to the CEOs and the leadership of most of the energy companies in the United States to understand what would serve as an incentive, what would make them feel comfortable about increasing production, increasing investments. And I think this price reflects something that's good for the American consumer and incentivizes American companies. I'm Ms. Hockstein, Special President, Executive Friend Energy Security. Thank you so much for being with us. Let's stick with energy and still with us, we do have investors, Kevin Holt. He has been looking to add back to an energy exposure on any underperformance. Kevin, back with us now, is this on a structural bet or is this on a temporary breach that you're expecting to really escalate heading into the winter? So, I mean, so this is completely 100 percent structural. I mean, we've spent a lot of time and a lot of a lot of investors, the oil industry lost a lot of money for a long time. If you look at Exxon, for example, it's still underperform the market the last 10 years by 50 percent. So, this is an industry that was very undisciplined. So, getting them to earn what we call a cost to capital. To earn cost to capital, to earn the right of investor dollars, you need $75 oil. So, that's kind of our mid-cycle pricing and that's kind of what we look at. It's taken as many years to get the industry to not just be growth oriented and be focused on returns and cash flow. So, I think that's what you have, you know, could you go to 65 temporarily? Yes, but for investors, you know, oil demand grows 1 percent. So, you don't need companies growing five. We're in a very difficult period with Russia, but you can't just turn supply on and off very easily. It's just very expensive and very difficult. But Kevin, what we just heard there from Amaz Hawks' team was pretty telling that basically, he's talked with all of these oil executives or that the administration has and they've come up with this range of $67, $72 as the floor that would incentivize them to invest. How much does that really contribute to your bullish thesis at a time when we're pretty far away from that still to the upside? Yeah, I would say first of all, our reserves are at 40-year low levels. So, the SPR is in very dangerous territory. So, I commend the administration for putting together a plan to refill it because we need to because of something catastrophic. Where to happen here, that would be very problematic for us. So, I think first of all, you kind of look",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4569,2022-10-19 13:54:00
16224, together a plan to refill it because we need to because of something catastrophic where to happen here that would be very problematic for us. So I think first of all you kind of look to you look to that issue but on the CAPX front again we kind of need that $75 oil. I think one thing that people forget too is OPEC generally Saudi and OPEC countries they don't have an income tax system like the United States so you know in example Saudi pays about 85% of their social programs are paid by oil and they have an $80 break even so a lot of things actually us around that $75 to $80 level and that's kind of you know structurally I'm a little worried short term with the recession but longer term I'm very constructive.

Pepsi's number fever campaign in the Philippines has probably gone down in history as one of the biggest marketing disasters in history. Mainly because of a human error that led Pepsi to print more winning caps than they planned. The resulting chaos caused riots, civil unrest and even deaths. Reporting this story took over a year and it resulted in me flying to Manila in the Philippines to meet unlucky winners and to find out exactly what happened back then in the 1990s. My name is Jeff Mesh. I'm a journalist based in Los Angeles. I wrote the story.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4571,2022-10-19 14:02:14
16226," My name is Jeff Mace, I'm a journalist based in Los Angeles. I wrote the story for Bloomberg Business Week about Pepsi's Number Fever campaign. The Philippines is a really interesting country. It's made up of thousands of islands. And it's also a country that's very heavily influenced by America. American culture is everywhere you look in the Philippines. They're obsessed with Frank Sinatra music, for example. They love all things America and that extends to their love for soft drinks. Pepsi Cola, Coca Cola. In the 1990s it was everywhere. Pepsi and Coca Cola were embroiled in what is now known as the Cola Wars. It was a fierce battle for market dominance. Number Fever was already a really popular promotion. It had been rolled out in America to great success. And so Pepsi decided to roll it out internationally, particularly in Asia. They thought it was the answer to their problems. They thought it could finally help them beat their biggest competitor. In the name of one, I won! Look for the winning number in size size for a 7-day Alphan TV, and you can be a millionaire. A million pesos or $68,000 doesn't sound like a lot now. But in 1992 that was a phenomenal amount of money. You've got to remember that in the Philippines at the time the average monthly income was about $100. So a million pesos was wealth beyond anyone's wildest imaginations. Number Fever caught fire in the Philippines. Kids were saving up their pocket money to buy a bottle of Pepsi. Parents were squirreling away. All of the bottle caps in bags. You would walk down the street and people were going through trash trying to find discarded bottle caps. It was a national phenomenon. Pepsi boasted that half the population of the Philippines was playing it. Number Fever boosted Pepsi sales every month from $10 million to $14 million. It had a huge impact on Pepsi's bottom line. Number Fever quickly became number hysteria. Mades were being jailed for stealing their employer's winning bottle caps. There was even some murders over winning bottle caps. People were fighting in the streets over these caps. There were signs that there were going to be problems with number Fever very early. Pepsi had rolled out the competition in Chile and a garbled fax had caused some kind of problem with the winning number. They'd announced the wrong one in Chile causing riots. There were signs that there could be big problems ahead if they didn't keep their eye on the ball. So in 1992 Pepsi decided to extend the campaign in the Philippines and they announced that the competition would go on for a few more weeks. One night on the television news they announced the latest winning number. Three, four, nine. The problem was three, four, nine had already been allocated as a non-winning number in earlier campaigns. So there were literally hundreds of thousands of bottle caps with three, four, nine just floating around the Philippines. Hundreds of thousands of people all across the Philippines, thousands of islands were finding winning bottle caps. Three, four, nine, three, four, nine. Some people had ten lucky, three, four, nine bottle caps. People were dancing in the streets, celebrating. They thought their problems were over. They were millionaires. It's still not certain exactly how many winners there were of lucky, three, four, nine bottle caps. But we know that Pepsi printed over 600,000 of them. Pepsi realized very early that there was a problem. Hundreds of people started arriving at their bottling plants with their lucky bottle caps. They realized something was seriously wrong. Pepsi tried to solve the problem by offering a small...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4572,2022-10-19 14:06:41
16227," People started arriving at their bottling plants with their lucky bottle caps. They realised something was seriously wrong. Pepsi tried to solve the problem by offering a small token donation to anyone that brought a lucky bottle cap to their bottling plant. But it wasn't enough. People didn't want just a handful of pesos. People wanted their million pesos prize. Within a year, violent protests and riots outside Pepsi factories would leave dozens injured and five people dead. At one Pepsi factory in the Philippines, a grenade was thrown through the window. It killed three Pepsi employees. Anacita Rosario was a schoolteacher living near Manila in the Philippines. She was one of the tragic victims of this whole thing. She was walking to a nearby store to buy some rice one day when a Molotov cocktail was thrown at a Pepsi truck in a violent protest. It bounced under the truck and exploded. It killed her and an innocent bystander who was just a child and injured many others. When I was in the Philippines, I tracked down Anacita's daughter Cindy and her husband Raul. It was clear to me that they were still very upset by the whole thing. A family had been ripped apart by this competition. Raul told me that he'd never remarried. He'd told me that he'd gone to meet Pepsi executives after his wife was killed. And he was angry. He said to them, this wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you, if it wasn't for number fever. The biggest revelation from my reporting was rumors that Pepsi was somehow involved in bombing their own trucks. I found a newspaper report with a headline that said Pepsi goons bombed their own trucks. And when I visited the MBI, the police department in the Philippines, they presented with documents and interviews with people who claimed that Pepsi had paid them to cause riots and to cause trouble outside their plants. In order to destabilize the situation and to frame the owners of the coalitions that were fighting them to try and curry favor. I just thought that was so shocking and of course Pepsi denied it. But helpers are that a company would be accused of bombing their own trucks. The contest had sparked so much anger in the Philippines because it landed at just this really weird time in the Philippines' history. It was during a crazy election that was racked with allegations of fraud. The Philippines was in a kind of love-hate relationship with America. They loved obviously the American aid and finances that was pouring into the country. But at the same time they yearned for independence. They wanted to be their own country. Vicente Del Fiero was a local preacher living in Manila. And he hated the number fever campaign. Del Fiero thought Pepsi's number fever campaign was just one of the many ways that America was asserting its dominance over a third world country. He hated seeing his fellow countrymen get ripped off in his eyes by this huge multinational American company. He wanted justice. Del Fiero rounded up over 800 winners of 349 bottle caps. And he got them all together to sue Pepsi for over $400 million to be divided between those holders of lucky bottle caps. Del Fiero took money from some of the people who could afford it. They paid him 500 pesos to help with legal fees. But for people who couldn't afford the money he would just represent them.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4573,2022-10-19 14:11:08
16228," and the pro bono. I learned, okay. He used to build that place here. I'm Pepsi. And for these people, I'm actually the food. So, he had mounted that on that campaign, even the war, even the war. He flew to America and he hired two consumer lawyers here in America to take on Pepsi. He had a meeting at Pepsi's headquarters to try and resolve the problem. But he said he wanted to take it all the way to the highest courts in America. When those cases were heard in America, those courts decided that this was a problem that should be heard in the Philippines, not in America. Back in the Philippines, Delphiero continued his case in the Filipino courts. At one stage, there were arrest warrant's handed out for nine Pepsi-Cola executives, which he saw as a big victory. We don't know if those arrest warrant were ever upheld, but it made newspaper headlines across the country. Pepsi did not take kindly to Delphiero's campaign. They tried everything to shut him down. They sued him for libel. My father had to attend three times a month for a brunch, one for the fight. And another heating for the brunch, one for 13, also three times a month. Also, there was a time my father's was hospital. To do heart failure, still he had to attend the two brunch heating of otherwise. For not attending the judge, will issue water to the next month's father. My father passed away January 13th, when they then after staying for almost one year in the hospital, he died of complications to the high payment. After the death of my father, I was inspired to do the website. Pepsi could be remembered for what they did to the consumer in the Philippines and to my father. When I reached out to Pepsi for comment for this story, they claimed that they didn't have access to anyone who was working at Pepsi that was around in those days. They also said that during COVID-19, they didn't have access to their documents about this. But they were very careful to say that they were sorry for everything that happened. And we do know that Pepsi did try everything to try and make this right. The Pepsi number fever disaster cost the company millions. We know that they paid up to $10 million in those good world payments. But the financial effect could be much greater. After the disaster, we know that Pepsi sales dipped. They were overtaken by Coca-Cola again. Pepsi's number fever disaster changed the legacy of that soft drink in the Philippines forever. Some people of certain age won't touch it. For many people, Pepsi is a taboo word. A lot of the people that I spoke to were still quite traumatized by their experience, by that experience of winning a million pesos, losing it, and then returning to their normal life in poverty in Manila. Hi. Do you want to talk to someone who remember that our bread? When the news of the bombing came out, it was a massive story in Germany. We are following some breaking news coming to us out of Dortmund in Germany. It was covered by all the media outlets.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4574,2022-10-19 14:15:33
16229," Barming came out. It was a massive story in Germany. We are following some breaking news coming to us out of Dortmund in Germany. It was covered by all the media outlets. Three roadside explosions triggered at the same time last night as the coach left its hotel in the south of Dortmund. Public figures commented on it. We should not let them affect our life wherever it was. The media echo went far beyond Dortmund. I think it was front page news in every single big paper around Europe. Everyone thought of a terrorist attack and people were scared that throughout the city and Dortmund there was more attacks to be happening. I'm announced to investigators just after the bomb went off and the players of the team were shell shocked. The person who had mastered my attack was actually sitting in the hotel eating steak and sweet potatoes. My name is Thomas Rogers. I'm the journalist who wrote the article, The Get Rich Quick Scheme, that nearly killed a German soccer team. Dortmund is a mid-sized city in the western part of Germany in a state called North Rhine Westphalia. It's a former industrial city that's kind of fallen on hard times in the last few decades. It was severely bombed in the war so the center of the city is quite stark. Some of the few high points include its soccer team. My name is Aykening. I'm a reporter with Bloomberg News and I'm a great fan of Borussia Dortmund. Dortmund fans are super loyal. On all match days the entire city is in black and yellow. It's like a religion. I think more than most German cities, soccer does play a very large role in the identity of Dortmund. In October of 2000 the BBB became the first team in the Bundesliga to actually go public. Salaries for soccer players in the Bundesliga have gone up very dramatically with such high prices. By going public they would be able to compete better with big teams like Bayern Munich. Unfortunately that didn't go too well. Dortmund bought too many expensive players, high wages, and the club almost went bust in 2005. The price of their shares, it has sometimes gone up but mostly gone down since they made that decision. On April 11th, 2017 the team was staying in a hotel on the outskirts of Dortmund. Match days are always special in Dortmund. Everyone is looking forward to it. The team always meets in the same hotel ahead of matches. They stayed in this hotel in order to have a kind of neutral space before game so that they could concentrate and be isolated from distractions. Everyone was optimistic to go far and maybe into the finals. I was in the office and getting ready for match day. I was going to meet with a friend a fellow Dortmund supporter in the pub. Es always, the fans are very excited about matches. On that day we were heading to play in the quarter final against A.S. Monaco at Signal Idunas Stadium which is in the center of Dortmund. Shortly before 7pm the players of the team boarded their official team bus. When the bus took off the parking lot of the hotel and turned on the street there were three detonations, three bombs that exploded and hit the bus off Dortmund. Three explosions occurred close to the Borussia Dortmund team bus. The B team bus had just left the hotel. The explosions destroyed two windows in the rear part of the bus. People screamed, people jumped to the ground. The fellow Dortmund fan I was supposed to watch the match with. He called me and said, turn on the TV there was an attack of the Dortmund bus and I thought he was like, there was impossible. Some of the players screamed at the driver to keep driving as fast as possible because they were worried that people might storm the bus.

16230," There's a screened at the driver to keep driving as fast as possible because they were worried that people might storm the bus. German investigators say the explosive devices used in the attack on the Berusha Dortmund bus contained metal pins and the one had pierced a seat headrest. Unbeknownst to the team members, the actual mastermind behind the attack was as they were disembarking the bus, who was actually eating steak and sweet potatoes at the hotel. They had just left. Authorities are attempting to verify a letter left at the scene, claiming Jihadists were behind the attack. Because there had been a series of attacks by Islamic terrorists in Germany and Europe, there was a widespread suspicion in the media that this was another Islamic terror attack. Three letters were found at the site of the bombing that took credit for the attack on behalf of Islamic State. There were however reasons to doubt this particular narrative. Would actually be a surprise if ISIS were actually part of this attack. Possibly could be employed by other groups like the Far Right wing to try and shift the blame. The letters had some strange qualities. They were written in a strange German that used big, sophisticated words, but had basic grammar mistakes as if someone was native German speaker but pretending to be a foreign person. Federal investigators have detained one man, suspected of links to Islamist terrorism, one of two suspects whose apartments were raided this morning. Shortly after the bombing, a man in Austria named Rudolf, who was a big BBB fan, he noticed that something strange was going on on the stock market related to the team's shares. He emailed the lawyers of BBB who then forwarded that email onto investigators. The email stated that someone had bought 60,000 BBB put options, a wager that the value of the shares of the team would fall below a certain amount at a certain date. I would someone buy that ahead of a match and then three bombs go off. Something is right here. For the person to make money off of that, it required the stock to go down quite a bit in a fairly short period of time and it wouldn't just be the team losing a match, it would require something much bigger than that. There was another big red flag about this purchase, which is the fact that it had actually been made. Number one on the day of the bombing, but also from an IP address that had been traced to the actual hotel where the bombing had taken place. When three explosions targeted the bus, carrying the Borussia Dortmund footballers on April 11th, written notes left at the scene claimed the attack was the work of ISIL. The truth, as is now alleged, is remarkable. On April 21st, the police arrested a man in a southern German city called Tubingen. It was on his way to work and his name was Sergei Bina-Gord. He seemed like an unlikely suspect because he had no known connections to the Islamic terror world. He didn't seem like a far-right extremist. He didn't seem like a left-wing extremist either. He seemed to be a completely unremarkable young man. A 28-year-old German Russian man named only a Sergei W stayed in the same hotel as the players on the night before the bombing. He specifically requested an upper room overlooking the bushes where the explosive devices were hidden. The media dissected why he would do that, what was his past. He had been inspired by the 2015 terror attack in Paris. He noticed that in the aftermath of the attack the stocks of French companies went down and he believed that if an attack took place that was directed at a specific company, that the decrease in stock price for that company would be even more dramatic. It never occurred to anyone that someone would do that out of greed. We now know that the suspect bought three different derivatives on the Borussia Dortmund shares, with all these derivatives he bet on falling shares. The suspect bought the majority of these financial products on the 11th of April, the day of the attack.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4576,2022-10-19 14:24:17
16231," With all these derivatives he bet on falling shares. The suspect bought the majority of these financial products on the 11th of April, the day of the attack. If the plot had been complete successful and the stock had reached a value of zero, Inner Gold would have made up to 570,000 euros or the equivalent of about $608,000. Ultimately the plan completely backfired. The attacker, Saga Yvenigot, didn't make any money in fact, he lost money. In court he would be extremely quiet. He usually kept his hands clasped together. One of the lawyers actually commented that he had never seen a defendant act so calmly. The Inner Gold had served some time in the German military. From that information and from online research he was able to figure out how to assemble remote, detonated bombs that would do what he hoped to do. There were a few days of extremely emotional testimony including the soccer players who described, doubting whether or not they could ever play another game again. It brought everything back up and it didn't quite help them to kind of process what was going on. Throughout it all he sat there completely silent. The big mystery that was swirling around the trial was the question of why he may have simply done it because he wanted to impress a woman. Rebecca is a young woman who has a very troubled home life. She ultimately sees her relationship with Inner Gold as an opportunity to leave that troubled home. The Inner Gold is a Russian immigrant to Germany. He speaks with an accent. He has anxiety in large groups of Germans. She begins to resent the fact that he has these fears and feels a little bit trapped. Rebecca attempts to dump him on multiple occasions and T threatens to commit suicide if she leaves him. The Inner Gold apparently told Rebecca that she would soon be seeing a surprise. After being dumped via text message he apparently began planning for this attack in earnest. The Inner Gold was charged with 28 counts of attempted murder which carried a maximum sentence in Germany of life in prison. He claimed that he had nothing to do with the attack but as time went on he admitted that he had actually been the person who had built the explosives and had set them up. But he claimed that he didn't want to actually kill anybody. Ultimately the Inner Gold didn't receive the harshest possible sentence. He was given 14 years in prison but it's still a considerable amount in jail in Germany. The threats of an asteroid hitting Earth is very real. If it's big enough it's also very final. A blinding flash of light streaking across the sky. About a hundred tons of space rock falls on Earth every day. Most of it is so small it burns up in our atmosphere or lands unnoticed away from major populations. No human in the past thousand years is known to have been killed by a meteorite.

16232," noticed away from major populations. No human in the past thousand years is known to have been killed by a meteorite. And according to NASA, no large object is likely to strike the earth any time in the next several hundred years. However, one thing is certain, we haven't found them all. There are thousands out there and we don't know where they are. There are a lot of asteroids in our solar system. They number in the billions. Scientists all over the world are working toward detecting and deflecting the most catastrophic of natural disasters. The races aren't to find as many of these objects as we can. Yes, the way of calculating whether or not an asteroid is potentially dangerous or not. I mean, I think it's something worth investing in. It's our existence that's safe, right? Amy, let's get this one out of the way. It's probably the question you get asked the most. But how scared should we be? Asteroids and comets are a natural hazard that's out there like a lot of other natural hazards. These are very, very infrequent events, these collision events where an object actually impacts the earth. The most important thing that we need to know about asteroids is when the next impact is going to happen and how bad it will be. What we know is that an object that's about say a kilometer across is capable of causing very, very wide devastation across the planet, really, truly global devastation. The object that wiped out the dinosaurs was somewhere in the neighborhood of five to ten kilometers across, so even bigger than that. At a kilometer, it's still going to be very bad and will have global effects. For objects that are capable of causing what I would call sort of regional damage, kind of a large major metropolitan area, a city in its surrounding environments, sort of around a hundred-ish meters. And it depends on the details of the composition and so forth. By the 1980s, NASA was cataloging near-earth objects. In 1994, Stargazers watched as comet Schumäke-Levy 9 hit Jupiter. The resulting zone of chaos was estimated to be as large as the Earth, and the event became a turning point in the search for asteroids and comets in our solar system. In 1998, Congress tasked NASA with finding 90% of asteroids and comets, one kilometer wide, or larger. Soon after, Hollywood blockbusters Armageddon and Deep Impact brought attention and fear to the masses. The great news is that the vast majority of more than 90% of all the really large one kilometer near-earth objects have been found. The challenge now is working down to these smaller sizes that are still quite capable of causing a lot of damage, but they're just harder to spot because they're fainter. They're smaller. Can you give us a sense of how many are out there in our solar system? We know that there are a lot of asteroids in our solar system. They number in the billions. Most of them, however, are between Mars and Jupiter in what we call the main asteroid belt. This is a region of space where most of the asteroids in the inner part of our solar system live, and they stay there for many billions of years. There is another population, though, that kind of leaks inward and gets into the region somewhat close to the Earth. And we call these near-earth objects. We think that there are millions and millions of near-earth objects that are out there in the total population. As of today, we know of sort of around 20, 25,000, something like that. When we first spot an object, we really know very little about it. We just see something moving across the sky. So all you get is just sort of a handful of snapshots, just enough to be able to tell that this isn't an asteroid that we've already seen before. And then once we can calculate the distance to it, we can now start to make predictions about its true size. Is it large or is it small? So we have a lot of information that we have to get pretty quickly to really understand what's going on. Finding asteroids is just one piece of the puzzle. Planetary scientists are extremely skilled in determining the orbits and speeds of asteroids based on relatively small amounts of data. NASA runs simulations of the trajectory.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4578,2022-10-19 14:32:59
16233," Antists are extremely skilled in determining the orbits and speeds of asteroids, based on relatively small amounts of data. NASA runs simulations of the trajectories asteroids could take, which is useful, but time consuming. A team of scientists in the Netherlands have found a way that could buy us more time. Our methods is fairly quick. So you can very quickly get an assessment of whether or not the objects is danger or not. If you look at the classical way of determining the danger of an asteroid, it may take days of computing time on very big machines to determine this hazardousness. The current problem is that there's just too many asteroids out there to spend a huge amount of computational power on all of them. So the neural network allows us to focus on what really could go and pose a hazard to Earth. A neural network is a computing system that mimics the way the human brain operates to find underlying relationships in a set of data. By training the network in this way, you train it in recognizing those objects that are most likely to hit the planet. And once it's trained, you can apply this network to all the unknown asteroids. And then you can make a selection and saying, hey, this is these are the ones which appear to be having orbits similar to the ones which we know are hitting the planet. That doesn't mean that they do, but it does, it only means that they look very similar to the ones we know they do. What else did you find? Should we be particularly concerned about anything? One thing that we did find is that our neural network was able to go and identify a handful of asteroids which weren't considered potentially hazardous. That when we went into the greater than forward in time, they came quite close to Earth. You find a handful which were not detected before or not considered being dangerous before. And we think they are potentially dangerous. It's very hard to simulate kind of going forward in time and asteroid that's going to hit Earth because what the Earth is really small. And what space is really big. And then you have to have very exact parameters to shoot an asteroid that goes and hits exactly Earth. And then Simon had the ingenious idea of not even trying to do that and just launching the asteroids from our surface and integrating backwards in time. It's very hard to make it hit. So you need a lot of calculations which all end up in nothing. And the idea was then like, well, let's not do that. This is basically what NASA is doing. NASA is taking an asteroid, making multiple copies of them, shooting them all forwards in time, calculating their orbits, and then see what fraction sort of gets close to Earth. Not even hitting Earth but getting close to Earth. And then they call it a potential impactor. So you calculate the solar system forward in time for let's say a thousand years. And then you launch asteroids from the surface as if they if you go forward in time would fall on the surface. You calculate them backwards due today. And then you get your orbital parameters of today's asteroid which you know will land on the planet. And those you can use as known impactors and compare this all the other asteroids in the solar system. Consimulations and AI can those things fill in the gaps where perhaps telescopes and other imaging tools can't. Absolutely. Since the observations get more complex. The physics gets more complex. And if the physics gets more complex, the mathematics becomes more complex. And at some point you can't solve your problems analytically anymore. And then this is where the computer comes in. Now we have this trained neural network. We have a way of calculating in a fraction of a seconds whether or not an asteroid is potentially dangerous or not. And therefore deserves more attention or more time to spend on for for really finding out if it is dangerous. When it comes to hunting asteroids, time is critical. What we can do about a potentially hazardous object depends a great deal on what we know about it and how much time we have before the encounter. We really like to find them when they're decades away. Because the more time you have, the more options you have. And the less energy it takes to move an object aside. It also means we might not have to resort to launching a nuclear warhead at an asteroid. Until recently, pretty much are only choice. That's an option of last resorting.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4579,2022-10-19 14:37:19
16234," It also means we might not have to resort to launching a nuclear warhead at an asteroid until recently pretty much our only choice. That's an option of last resort in my opinion, yes. We have lots of options available. You can simply bump into the object and just nudge it out of the way. That's one possibility. That's kind of in a way the simplest thing to think about, just nudge it off. It's a massive object, a spacecraft one. It's kind of like bowling if you have a long time or a long stretch of runway in the lane. Just a very small twist on the bowling ball will make a big change in where it ultimately ends up. Another option would be something where you take a very big, big, massive spacecraft and you park it next to the object and you use the force of gravity as a towing rig. That takes longer though. And you need to be able to send a pretty massive spacecraft and obviously depends a lot on how big the asteroid is. Other options start to get more and more complicated and they range from painting one side of the object of white color and painting the other side dark and letting the pressure of light sort of perturb its orbit. In a departure from the lab and computer simulations, NASA has real plans to rehearse kinetic impact deflection. In 2021, the agency will launch DART, the double asteroid redirection test mission, which will intercept a 160 meter asteroid in 2022. Better to practice now before we have to deal with an actual threat. In the meantime, discovering asteroids is our best bet. Thousands of scientists and amateur astronomers around the world make up an informal network that surveyed the heavens. But that may not be enough. NASA wants more resources to map our solar system and better technology. We need to ramp up our network of sensors and also we need to just continue to strengthen our network of international observers so that we can get follow-up because we find these objects when they're distributed all over the night sky. Once we get more observations, we get better data, we can make better predictions. If you look at the big impactors we have had in the last, let's say, 20 years or maybe 30 years or 50 years, most of them we haven't seen coming. So the real danger I think comes from the objects we don't know about and not from the objects we do know about. This particular natural disaster, like a lot of natural disasters, and climate change is a problem with the global commons. So the thing that we risk collectively is that it sort of then becomes nobody's model and nobody takes our ownership over it. Asteroids are all over the sky. They just truly cross boundaries and borders with a second's notice. They're kind of imagining the future. Maybe he wants a small satellite around the Earth that are always going and looking out for it. I mean, I think it's something worth investing in. It's our existence at stake, right? The pandemic has affected everyone in different ways. Some passed the time by baking. Homemade sourdough bread. Do I need to say more? Some chose to binge watch Netflix. It's your game. Or maybe you started a garden oasis in your backyard. Next, I'm going to put my glasses in. But for millions of others, I'm going to be posting stocks that will... Boom!

I see a stock going up and I buy it and I just watch it until it stops going up and then I sell it. I haven't gained over $3 million. I want some free money. I don't think you can overstate the online communities of social media influence on financial markets. A large group of inexperienced investors who discuss their plans on social media platform Reddit have shaken up the stock market in a big way. The stock that everybody's talking about right now is GameStop. Video game retailing GameStop has set to continue their head spinning ascent today. The revolutionaries on Reddit are spanking Wall Street's ass. The more these stocks go up, the more the big guys are getting creamed and losing billions of dollars. This is in a wealthy person's game anymore. Anyone can play it. I took up a little bit of a new hobby and I'm interested in day trading. As an investor nowadays, you don't have to look a specific way. You don't have to wear specific clothes. You don't have to be doing it from a trading floor on Wall Street in like a high-rise building in downtown Manhattan. The narrative of what's driving the markets is no longer being held in secret offices in New York and Boston of privileged people talking to other privileged people. It's right out in the open. It's on Twitter. It's on Reddit. From brokerage apps to discord channels and subreddits to TikTok vincluentzers. One of the last holdouts in the world of disruption, finance is next in line. Investing should be as you pick with us as shopping online. That's Vlad Tenif, the CEO of Robinhood, the online brokerage app. Talking about how he wants his app to disrupt the world of stock trading like Amazon disrupted the world of home shopping. And I think that speaks to exactly the mission that a platform like Robinhood has, which is to democratize investing. Robinhood was started in 2013 by Vlad Tenif and by Jubat, in where else Silicon Valley. As an alternative to the big brokerages, but with one big difference. As they were building the social network around finances for people, they realized that there was a gap in the market and that free trading could become something that they could bring to the market. They could disrupt the industry. While no fee trading is industry standard today, it was unheard of when it was first introduced. The online brokerage industry was really innovative when they came on the scene 10, 15 years ago. But they kind of stopped innovating where you haven't seen those commissions come down beyond five or six or seven dollars. Robinhood, think that by offering zero commission, that they're going to push people onto this platform. And on top of no fee trading, the customers Robinhood was courting, have been long overlooked in the world of finance. So the typical customer of a Charles Schwab, for example, is putting a lot more money in that brokerage account than the typical customer at Robinhood. Even today, with all of its popularity, the median account size is about $240. There's fiddellities in the Schwabs and the e-trades of the world. They look down their nose if those kind of accounts are. I don't want a thousand dollar account, they're just a headache. I want a hundred thousand dollar account. And this is key here, right? Because the thing about Robinhood that's different than every other single brokerage platform is how easy it is to use. The design of the Robinhood app really has in mind a user who might be coming at this absolutely cold. The fonts are very well-sized, the shapes, the colors. All of that is something that the founders of Robinhood paid really close attention to. And by creating an interface that catered to a newer investor, they were able to gather a pretty healthy group of customers. And by 2019, they had about 10 million customers. Those 10 million customers were a huge success story for Robinhood. But no one could have predicted its explosion.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4581,2022-10-19 14:45:58
16236," Million customers. Those 10 million customers were a huge success story for Robinhood, but no one could have predicted its explosion after the arrival of COVID-19. Remain indoors to the greatest extent and 100% of the non essential workforce must stay home. What we saw when the pandemic hit was the growth of Robinhood users, absolutely turbocharged. And oddly, you saw this surge in interest in stock trading. Then they saw the absolute surge in 2020 in customer growth. And now by many accounts, they have more than 20 million customers, which is pretty extraordinary. So the next step for them is to figure out how to monetize those users and how even with their small account sizes to get them to grow with the company and as it releases more products, come along with them. Robinhood would become one of the COVID economies' breakout successes. Robinhood traders, as they're called, became the shorthand explanation for the frenzy of often speculative retail investing after the pandemic lockdowns. Kids wake up in the morning, they go on Robinhood. They're, you know, in the shower, they check Robinhood. Kids are learning how the stock market works at 18, while they're at school, you know, checking their phones in between classes, because notifications pop up telling them what their stocks are doing that day. With these new tools, millennials and Gen Z are investing in the market and ways their parents could have never even dreamt of. That is sort of key when we talk about the divide between older and younger generations, is that the younger generation was exposed to so much more information and tools at their disposal to do what they want in the market. The older generations, you never had the technology or the cost structure that you could play the markets like you can today. So you were stuck with giving your money to a professional investor, paying them a fee to do it. When I speak to young kids, they tell me, I'm making mistakes, I'm losing money, I'm not a perfect investor, but I'm 18 and by the time I'm 30, which will be, you know, 10 years from now, I'm going to have interacted with them markets for a decade. And so it's a learning experience more so than anything else. And you can look at it and you can say, wow, that's, you know, that's risk taking that's dumb. But, you know, if you could possibly shave 10, 20 years off your working life versus adding five years, I don't think you can fault people for that. But Robinhood is only part of the puzzle. Sure, you can trade on it, but without research, information and data, you're just blindly throwing darts at different stocks and hoping to strike it rich. Wall Street forever has always run on what we now call narratives for memes. You know, people telling rumors to each other, they've been around for a hundred years. On Wall Street, information is its own currency. Historically, either you had it or you did it. And the people who had it had a huge advantage. In the past, those narratives and memes didn't have a network effect. It would be one person telling another person over the phone. In fact, when I broke into this business in the 80s, a lot of people used to complain that they weren't on the call list to get those ideas. Social media changed all of that. Fast forward to 2021. That's being done on the internet now. And that's being done on Discord and Twitter and Stocktwist and Reddit. And the impact is very similar, but orders and orders have been at the twonth large. As social media has played a bigger part in our lives, it's also played a bigger and kind of known, conservatives, quote,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4582,2022-10-19 14:50:23
16237," Impact is very similar, but orders and orders affect the two larger. As social media has played a bigger partner lives, it's also played a bigger and kind of more important role in how people find investing ideas online and on these platforms. How do those ideas spread on TikTok? Yes, that TikTok. Soon may the women come to bring a sugar and tea and rum. People aren't just going to it for C-Shanty videos. The personal finance hashtag on TikTok has garnered 3.5 billion views from its 1 billion monthly active users. By comparison, videos found under the cooking and health tips hashtag have 2.6 and 2.1 billion views respectively. The trajectory of Robinhood and TikTok were literally on par. What happened in the stock market this week? So the word of the week is expectations. Absolutely essential that you just understand the risks of shorting. And Kayla Kilbrot and Kyla Scanlon are two of those financial influencer TikTokers, also known as Finn Fluensers. I think people still care about fashion, they care about culture, but it's also like there's this big behemoth thing called the stock market that we really don't know a whole lot about and it's gay kept behind the industry. And so people like want to unpack that. And so my audience is a lot of them are younger investors who are looking to hone their skills. Tech in right up. Kyla and Kayla are two of the more, let's say, professional TikTok influencers. The Tesla are Bitcoin biotech risk cluster. I've been trading since high school and it was a really interesting way for me to fill out my decision making framework since I think about thinking. And I think that the more that we can have people thinking about finance, the better that we're going to progress as a society. I think it's a huge gap in our educational system. If you're going to buy an option for stock, you think it's going to go up. It's a call. So think about like this. I made the options video where I was like options are just like shopping. Rumor has it that this pal is about to go up in price. So if I come in tomorrow, can I still buy it at the press? And a ton of women just like attacked that video and we're like, you explain things so much better than my boyfriend or my professor or like, I could sit and listen to you all day. And I was like, this is what I was looking for. But TikTok's algorithm does not reward common measured videos about responsible investing. It rewards this. Watch this video for 30 seconds and you'll be rich for the rest of your life. I try not to say the A word, the ALGO word because TikTok listens to us. Algorithm does impact how you feel. You do notice which videos do better versus which videos do worse. How do you catch some of the tension in less than 60 seconds? And how do you make it something that they're like, I need this in my life? Nearly impossible to do that in 60 seconds. But the people who perfect it are the people that you're going to watch and get to stick around. And where people are sticking around, read it. And it's nearly countless subreddits about finance. And by far the biggest one of those is Wall Street Bets. There's a lot of social media platforms out there, but Reddit is like the social media platform for finance. Places like Wall Street Bets is where it all goes down. Started in January 2012, it wasn't long before Wall Street Bets adopted a 4chan-like etiquette, leading to their tagline, like 4chan found a Bloomberg terminal. We had all these unexplained stockings and we would be grasping for why stock XYZ jumped 20% in a day. And you would look at Wall Street Bets and you would see people there talking about buying options in that stock and it sort of squared the circle so to speak and started making sense. And it was at that point that it was like, wow, we have to start paying attention to this. Some people on the platform really spend tons of time and others are just looking for entertainment and to have a little bit of fun effectively gambling or looking for an outlet trying to make a little bit of money. And on top of all of that, there were stimulus checks. Now clearly, this money is going to people who need to use that to eat, to live, but there are a lot of people who use this money to invest in the stock market. And it's not just stock tips.

They post what is called gain and loss porn, screen grabbing, staggering hits and misses on stocks for the entire community to see. I am back to lose everything. And while some of the people on Wall Street bets are novice investors, the community contains multitudes. In one respect, what it did show us among these network groups is they are very sophisticated. They're not a bunch of ignorant people talking to other ignorant people. And this is where the pieces of the puzzle all come together to reach havoc on Wall Street for a solid week in early 2021. It's pretty clear that the combination of more people having retail brokerage accounts and trading apps and more people being stuck at home looking for some kind of entertainment and some kind of community online came together in this very singular way. What came together is GameStop. Let's go back to the beginnings of what happened with GameStop a couple of years ago. On the boards like Reddit and Stocktwist, a lot of people were talking about GameStop as being attractive value. Some of them are even, you know, Wall Street alums who left the industry and now still have access to tools that they can use to improve their financial well-being and make very good decisions. And I think Warring Kitty is a perfect example of that. GameStop is one of the most compelling asymmetric opportunities in the market today. Really, I don't understand how you can disagree with that. At the same time that this crowd was talking it up, the hedge fund institutional crowd didn't like the stock at all. And it had the largest short interest of any stock in the New York Stock Exchange going into late 2020. Short selling is a bet that a stock price will fall and it's a fairly simple concept. An investor borrows a stock and then sells it. The investor is betting on buying the stock back later for a lower price before returning it to the original owner pocketing the price difference. What a short seller would tell you is that they almost act as a policeman in financial markets or they're at least looking for companies that aren't what they say. And that can range anywhere from an outright fraud that some short sellers try to expose to just a company that's not worth as much as investors think it is. The problem is if the stock price rises, the short seller has to come up with the money to buy the stock back. And the more it rises, the more it costs. And that's what's called a short squeeze. And the hedge fund Melvin Capital was on the wrong end of that squeeze. Melvin Capital lost over 50% of its money in the month of January alone just from being caught in the short squeeze of the stock. This is where the disruption comes in. One of the most wild stories you're ever going to see, GameStop shares absolutely going nuts. In less than a year, the company's stock has jumped from less than $3 a share to almost $350. Cheers everybody! Roaring Kitty has turned $50,000 or so investment into some $14 million. Whoa! Investors all over social media use the free trading app Robinhood to wreak havoc on Wall Street. They're actually piling on into some of these stocks to really hurt the professional short sellers. And they all used Reddit, Twitter, TikTok and Discord to tell one another to keep buying and quote, hold the line and not sell GameStop. People are getting cheerleaded for jumping in, buying at the highs, they're saying keep going. And it was working too, until. Thursday morning, the trading app Robinhood sent out this tweet. In light of current market volatility, we are restricting transactions, including GameStop. People were really angry. Robinhood was supposed to allow the regular people to play the same game, these big boys are playing. But instead, we were all taken for schmucks and they screwed us. Shares of GameStop are jumping again now that retail investors are being allowed to buy shares of the stock. But what we learned is that when people organize online, they have the ability to disrupt the market. And it's.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4584,2022-10-19 14:58:59
16239," But what we learned is that when people organize online, they have the ability to disrupt the market. And it was a big sign that ivory rolls in the institution, art is powerful, and it's maybe the institution's left them to be. I don't know if pumping out GameStop was the best use of billions of dollars, but I think that as a signal to society, it was pretty interesting and powerful. The GameStop saga was so impactful that both Vlad Teniv and Roryn Kittie were called in to testify before Congress to clarify each of their roles in the saga. One thing that's emerged from the congressional hearings is that they're interested in how retail brokerages make money and whether they're keeping the best interest of their customers in mind. But it's pretty fuzzy as far as what they would actually do as a result. While the frenzy around GameStop eventually subsided, it didn't take long for retail investors to find other areas to invest their money. Take a look at Bitcoin going bananas over the weekend. Bitcoin forms a brand new all-time high. It was after GameStop started to drop that we saw Bitcoin really go up to over 60,000. How much further does this rally have to run? It's compelling to say that money shifted from one venue to the other. While correlation doesn't equal causation, there's a chart out there showing an inverse correlation on mean stocks going down and cryptocurrencies going up. There's definitely an aspect where people are making money on stocks and then moving, you know, they're agnostic, they're not hedge funds, they can invest wherever they want. It's a classic sort of momentum trade. They're going to wherever the winners are and they're willing to jump on and, you know, ride it. So whether it's mean stocks like GameStop, mean coins like Dogecoin are entirely new ways to invest in art like NFTs, the new kind of retail investor is making its presence known. Over the next 10, maybe 15 years, you're going to continue to see whether by choice or by force, that baton go from older generations to younger generations. I don't think any single app is going to be the thing that disrupts. I think people are the disruptors. How people get ideas about what to invest in has become increasingly entwined with social media. And as social media companies govern more and more of our lives, the fact that now they're tied in more intimately to people's wallets is something that we might want to understand better. Usually what disruption I think means is technology comes in whether it's blogs, the newspapers, or online, retailing to brick and mortar. They come in and they're in the same business, but they just do it in such a gigantic cost savings that it causes everybody to switch. Well, that's the risk that happens here is that it's so much cheaper to just manage your own money. We're not there yet, but costs and conveniences are moving in that direction. So I'd say Wall Street, you haven't been disrupted yet, but you could be in the coming years and that the final chapter on this story hasn't been written. Meet Bloomberg's own David Nicholson. Now, his happy place is out in the field, on the open road. But like the rest of the world lately, he's been working from home a lot more than he's used to. COVID-19 has prompted a massive urban exodus.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4585,2022-10-19 15:03:15
16240," lot more than he's used to. COVID-19 has prompted a massive urban exodus as professionals of every ilk yearn for more space to live and work. As a result, rural areas have exploded and their poised to experience a resurgence as more and more families pack up and leave the big city to try out life in the berms. But there's one problem with that. Not all internet speeds are created equal. Anyone who might need to upload or download large files for a living may not want to pack up and move to that cabin in the woods just yet. Now, David's house isn't a cabin, but it is in the woods. And inexplicably, his internet is workable. My internet is okay. I pay a lot for it. It's around $140 a month. The download speed's great, and the upload speed is terrible, which is really bad for my work because I have to upload these massive files. But I'm definitely one of the more lucky ones in this community. Just a few miles down the road, my buddy has awful internet. Usually under two down and under point two up. So it's often unusable. Some days it's around one, and other times it'll drop down to about point two, point three. I just want to be able to have internet at my house without having to go outside the normal ways of acquiring internet. It's really frustrating. We're literally miles, a few miles away from downtown. And it just cuts off. This is a problem, and the solutions are not there yet. Because getting high speed internet and rural areas on mass is something our providers may simply not be ready for. If your internet service doesn't have fast download and upload speeds, then you don't have high speed harmony. You have. Ah! Americans on average pay about $70 a month for internet at home. But in rural areas, it could cost a lot more for a lot less service. So the pricing for a fixed wireless provider here can be something between $80 and $150 for about 25 megabits per second. However, gigabit service, which is a thousand megabits per second and symmetrical, is running it about $119 a month through 130 a month. That's John Paul. He co-owns Spiral Fiber, an internet service provider here in Nevada County, California. And for the past 10 years, he's been trying to bring an affordable fiber optic network to town. It all started when he applied to be part of the pilot program for Google's fiber service. Across the country, Civic Boosters have been going to extremes, chanting. Singing. Singing. And marching, trying to get the search engine giant to look at their town. The internet these days is crucial to be in the world, to be a part of the world, and to be connected to your community. Google ultimately went with Kansas City, Missouri, which left Paul on a mission to get funding to lay out fiber optic networks for gigabit service. Over the next several years, he would attend conferences and pitch venture capitalists and apply for grants to make his vision come to life. One of the biggest roadblocks to building infrastructure for the internet here in the United States are the existing large providers. They have their landstaked out. They would prefer that nobody come in and compete against them. In 2013, we applied for a grant. We went down and met with the commissioners at the California Public Utilities Commission. It was an arduous process to get funded, but we finally did against all odds. We got a $16 million grant, and then we went out to seek venture capital. Then in March of 2020, the pandemic hit the world. Everybody got locked down, and everybody came home, and everybody started using the internet. And I remember seeing on one of the local fixed wireless providers websites, they've said, hey, we know you're all staying home, but please don't use too much video, and please don't use too much bandwidth. And I thought, that doesn't work. The US connectivity gap is far greater compared to countries that are considered as peers economically. Some developing nations actually have better internet than rural America. Like in Kenya, which has a state-of-the-art, fiber-optic network fed in from their coastline.

16241," Some developing nations actually have better internet than rural America. Like in Kenya, which has a state-of-the-art, fiber-optic network fed in from their coastline. The American connectivity gap does largely affect rural areas that are either outside of service coverage, or simply prohibitively expensive. This is Rebecca. She and her family moved to Nevada County just a couple miles down the road from David. They took for granted that high-speed internet would just exist in the area, and it's not something they even bothered to check on before buying their house. Turns out, all they got was dial-up. We wanted to move where we had a little more space, room for the kids to run around, you know, just be out in the mountains a little bit more. Having come from a bigger city area where Wi-Fi is pretty readily available, we hadn't really considered that in our purchasing of the house, whether that would be an option or not. When school started and now that we are remote learning with our children and we're doing everything from home, we didn't have the option to do that at our house. So every day when school would start, we'd have to pack the kids up and we'd go to my in-law's home. They have a little cabin up in this area that does have Wi-Fi already. Rebecca's situation is the norm in rural America. According to data from the Federal Communications Commission, just 4% of urban Americans lack access to broadband internet. That's compared to almost 40% of people who live in rural areas. While that was the case, there were also racial and socio-economic divides in terms of who had that access. In addition to that geographic difference, low-income African American students, Latino students, and first generation of college students were more likely than others to have only one device at home that shared among multiple siblings and or lack access to that actual connection. For most American towns, there's also a lack of competition, forcing internet prices up, and large providers like AT&T and Comcast aren't incentivized to expand service to these rural communities. This is how Xfinity makes life simple, easy, awesome. So in our area, we have a small imprint of Comcast, but they're not going to go out to the more rural areas. It's just not cost-effective for them to do it as a large company. In order to lay fiber cable, you're actually physically digging trenches into the ground. And for internet service providers, they're primarily focused on maximizing their profits. And so the fewer customers you have in any square mile and the more fiber you have to lay, that's just kind of harder to pencil out from a purely economic standpoint. AT&T released a statement on the matter, expressing the need and desire for government assistance to fund fiber optic expansion to areas deemed unprofitable. Comcast released a similar statement encouraging more public-private collaboration on this effort. Federal agencies do offer grants to help communities build broadband networks, but many have argued that there's not enough flexibility on how to use these funds. The COVID-19 relief package passed by Congress in March and signed by President Donald Trump awarded $43.3 million to 51 projects on the East Coast alone. But it also stipulated that these projects needed to be up and running by December 30th. For contractors who plan projects months and years in advance, it's a scramble to rearrange their schedules to meet that deadline. So what we've been asking the federal government to consider is at least as long as the projects are getting started, knowing the projects are being put into place to expand both remote learning, working from home and opportunities like that that are truly driven from COVID. We're moving as fast as we can regardless, but hopefully they'll give us some more time. Talking to John Paul, it's clear that he believes broadband is something that can transform a community and should be considered a public good. One of the first communities to come on in the United States with full on gigabit service was Chattanooga, Tennessee. Now they're a bigger city, but they're a city that was economically in a downturn. In the last 15 years, the city of Chattanooga has turned around in an amazing way. It's a nexus for young people to move to, it's a place where technology happens. It's not just about logging on to Zoom, you know, to connect with your colleagues who might be in New York City.

There's just some really basic business functions and mechanics that I think people in big cities really take for granted and that are just going to be a much bigger challenge for small business owners and rural areas. One, two, one, two. One, two. One, two. One, two. Three, seven, eight, ten, ten, ten, ten. Historically the marginalized people you call them as untouchables or thalits. They have been kept away from the center of the knowledge. Once you are born into a caste, it is very difficult for you to grow beyond that. You are stuck in that identity. Education is the best way of liberating them. So that's how I chose to work in education sector. The kind of education that we are giving to the marginalized people is going to change not just the fear of these communities in Telangana, but it is going to be the source of inspiration, the source of hope for all the marginalized in this country. Greatest flight in India is the system of caste. For generations of Indians, the social code known as the caste system has defined how people earn a living and whom they marry. Although outlawed seven decades ago, caste remain a significant factor in deciding everything, from family ties and cultural traditions to educational and economic opportunities. Dalits, people who are on the lowest rung of the caste system, constitute almost one-fifth of India's population of 1.3 billion. Not able to afford the high tuition of private schools, many are forced to attend government-funded institutions, which in the past have suffered from poor infrastructure, lower education standards, and high student-to-teacher ratios. But Dr. Praveen Kumar is trying to change that. I am currently working as head of the Langanna Social Welfare Residential Schools. So totally, above 400 schools I manage, these are all residential schools for the students who are historically marginalized but talented and then poor. Of them, 60% are girls and then 40% are boys, because girls are more marginalized among the marginalized. They voices are always suppressed. My approach to improve the conditions in the schools has been put your eyes and ears on the ground always. Stock to the parents, stock to the teachers, stock to the students, stay in the schools and then understand their problems, their challenges, both in classrooms and then the corridors and the dorms. Then go to the dining halls and see what kind of food they are eating and then go to their homes and then walk and have food.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4588,2022-10-19 15:16:32

One of the important changes that I brought in after I took over was to complete the transformation of mother tongue to English medium because English medium as I said English is the language of emancipation and language that connects you to the whole body of knowledge in the world. So, we had to train a lot of teachers. I am trying to do English and also, okay, I am trying to do English. I was going to do English, can I do it? Hey, how are you? I seem to find time here. I am having good food. I find the way to know. Identity is extremely important. There is a scientific evidence to prove that your sense of identity is extremely crucial to your growth as a successful human being in your life. If you accept an identity which is very humiliating, which reminds you of a very painful past, I think that identity will not help you to grow. Not that I am not saying that you should forget your past, I am not saying that, but that should not be the bubble in which you must live always. Sweros is an alternative identity. S stands for state, W stands for welfare, Aero, SW and then Aero is Swero. So the idea is your dreams have to be skybound. So that is what we are trying to achieve by changing the identities. Like you know, I am a Swero and I aim to be a doctor. I am a Swero. I aim to be a top-notch engineer. I am a Swero. I aim to be a top bureaucrat of this country. I am a Swero. I want to be a very good actor or a musician in this world. So these are the positive images that are associated with the identity. Just to give an example to you. See in 2012, in our institution we used to produce about 6 doctors per year. But because of our, you know, this self-eliberating ideology of Sweroism, we have this year we have produced about 189 doctors. This is phenomenal for any purists of the poor people. You know how difficult it is to get into a medical college in this country. So but today because of this ideology, the students have been able to achieve this. Pujita has been a form labourer. A parents, the angels are agriculture labourers. And then this girl used to sell vegetables. But thanks to the residential education institutions, she came to the Gowlitha De Campos. And then she toiled very hard for one year despite many problems. And today I am so happy to share with you that she has joined one of the prestigious medical colleges in the state of Telangana, Utsmanum Medical College. And then in future she hopes to be a gynecologist. So this is the journey our children are hoping for. Similarly the Mount Everest Expression. Mount Everest Expression, we are very fortunate enough to place the youngest ever female in the history of this world on the peak of Mount Everest. How did this happen? It's all because of an ideology that helps you to liberate yourself. We have a lot of extra-curricular activities and most of them got institutionalised now. So for example music. Similarly the games, we have so many coaching academy, boxing academy, Brazilian academy, we have a handball academy.

We have a goal, we have introduced a goal for also, goal is generally played by so-called rich people, but today even poorest of the poor people also are being trained in goal in our schools. So our intention has been to give all 360 degrees type of opportunities to the students, so that we are interested in whatever activity they can go and then do it. Break the barriers, break the fence at least mentally, because the poor people have been programmed to be victims, programmed to be subjugated, programmed to be on the margins, always programmed to feel inferior, we wanted to change all that. There are certain games which are exclusive to rich people, there are certain languages which are exclusive to middle class and upper middle class in this country, to put it in one word. The sole aim of introducing all these co-curricular activities is to break the stereotypes which are closely involved on this people. Their stereotypes talk to Kumar knows all too well. Born a Dalit, his grandparents were labourers and access to the village well was restricted. Dr Kumar credits his parents belief in the power of education with helping him realise his aspirations. He went on to join the Indian Police Service, attended Harvard University and then began pursuing educational reforms back home. I attribute whatever I am today to my mother primarily. They educated me in the village, although there were no good schools. So then I stayed in social welfare hostel, which are managed by government for the poorest of the poor kids. I passed with reasonably good grades, then I went to university and then I faced a worst form of discrimination in the universities. In those days I am talking about the bathrooms and toilets were exclusive to mental health and social health. I used to fight discrimination on one hand and then again try to excel in academics day and day out. That's how I came to education because I deeply believe that education is the only important weapon that can really place the poorest of the poor people from a very victimhood orbit to prosper. I think being future, this is going to be a game changer for the marginalized in this game. If you look at a thermal image of a city and then compare that to a map of vegetation, you'll find that where there's greenery the temperature is lower. That's because things like asphalt, concrete and shingled roofs absorb more heat from the sun than trees. This is the urban heat island effect and it accounts for higher temperatures in cities often by several degrees compared with their surroundings. It's becoming a huge risk to human health as growing urban populations exacerbate the heating effects of climate change. The waves kill more people than any other extreme weather event.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4590,2022-10-19 15:24:47
16245," to human health as growing urban populations exacerbate the heating effects of climate change. Heat waves kill more people than any other extreme weather event, more than tornadoes, hurricanes and even floods. That's why Urban Heat Island mitigation strategies are being studied in Singapore by a group of researchers. The government back project called Cooling Singapore is now in the process of combining everything they've learnt to create a digital tool that can help cities all over the world, starting with Singapore. In Singapore, close to the equator, temperatures regularly rise above 32 degrees Celsius or 90 degrees Fahrenheit, and the city structures only make it worse. And that is also the case for Singapore, which is basically a concrete jungle, more urbanized, more developed city. And even in Singapore, what you have is a situation whereby there's a temperature difference of 7 degrees Celsius between the more urbanized and the more rural areas. The government has taken drastic steps to keep temperatures down. This is Gardens by the Bay, an award-winning park, and inside this greenhouse is a pleasant 24 degrees. That's because the dome, along with two dozen nearby towers full of thousands of people, is chilled by what's probably the world's largest underground district cooling system. It uses a large central plant that cools water and then pipes it into banks, residential towers, an exhibition centre, shopping malls and the city's iconic Marina Bay Sands hotel and casino complex. So, one of the biggest perks of using this system for the buildings is that they can save 40% in terms of electricity usage compared to your traditional air conditioners. And with Singapore relying on natural gas for most of its power, this new system means emission savings equivalent to removing 10,000 cars from the city's roads. That has big implications for the rest of the world. If things stay as they are, more than a third of the world's electricity could end up being used to cool buildings and vehicles by 2050. As the world gets hotter, gets warmer, there is a greater need for air conditioning and as well as refrigerators, for instance. And the more people are buying these household appliances, the more energy usage they use and they release heat more and that then exacerbates climate change. It's a vicious circle. And so since 2017, researchers at Cooling Singapore have been identifying design solutions that reduce our need for so much cool air in the first place. One thing many cities have in common and that's the importance of vegetation. That's a very important measure to mitigate the earthen heat because of the shading effect of course and the psychological effects of the vegetation and also because of the possible evaporative cooling effect of the vegetation. Vegetation can be of course on the ground floor in form of trees and shrubs and you can walk under them. This is the so called canopy layer that the vegetation forms above us. But vegetation can also go up the facades of buildings and it can go to the roof of the buildings. Luckily Singapore has been striving for the garden city feel for quite some time. It was a vision initially introduced by them Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yu in 1967 to make life more pleasant for people and today Singapore is one of the world's greenest cities in terms of urban vegetation. Camping Admiralty, a community centre that contains health facilities and social spaces now provides more green space than the plot of land it was originally built on. It's topped by a roof scape of staggered terraces covered in local plants which functions as a community park and a village green in the centre that contains farm plots for residents to tend to. Cop знаю wiggle Korea long pickering was designed as a hotel in a garden.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4591,2022-10-19 15:29:20
16246," and a village green in the centre that contains farm plots for residents to tend to. Park Royal on Pickering was designed as a hotel in a garden that doubled the green growing potential of its site. There's now 15,000 meters of sky gardens, reflecting pools, waterfalls, plantar terraces and green walls and the government has big plans as well. Singapore actually has a plan to plan 1 million trees and add more green spaces over the next 10 years. It is actually a mix of one thing to reduce the urban hit island effect but on the other hand is also to get the people to be more connected to nature. But it's not enough. The city state has still been warming twice as quickly as the world average over the past six decades. That's why Coolling Singapore has developed a catalogue of other potential heat mitigation measures. When you try to mitigate your hit island effect in a city or in any building in a village as well, the first place to start is by shading off the windows. You have to keep areas clear so that the wind can move through it. Water of a certain depth can act as a very good thermal buffer. If you have to construct heavy buildings such as high rises, at least you can make the surface the facade less heavy and you can protect it from direct sun penetration. You have to make sure that no combustion engines will be in the city in the middle and the medium to long term range. So ideally the electricity production is outside of the city and you bring just the clean electricity into the city. You can at least minimize the use of energy in the city and you can start to slowly convert the roofs, the facades of the city into production areas for renewable energy. In Singapore unfortunately this is a limited option but in the long run it could produce up to 20-25% of the energy of the electricity needed in Singapore if all the roofs and the areas in the buildings on the buildings on the facades would be used to do that. With so many different ideas, cooling Singapore is also designing a virtual model of the city to test them out. It's called a digital urban climate twin or duct. That will calculate how each element of the city's design will impact the urban heat island effect. That means we model not only the geometry of the buildings digitally but also we model the transportation, the insulation, the temperature, the radiation coming from the sun, the weather, the local weather, the local climate, the even very, very microclimate of the city. The water, the movement of people in the city, we can invent scenarios, we can design scenarios, test them before we actually build them and if they test very well and we are sure that they will function then we can start to build them and put them into reality. Singapore will be using this new tool to figure out which actions it should take next and the model can be applied to any city whether it needs to keep heat out or keep heat in which will ultimately save energy, slow climate change and improve our quality of life. So this is something that Singapore will be able to export maybe even together with its city development systems that it already has. Singapore is one of the very few cities in the world that really combine this scientific approach with a very well-established urban redesign and design approach towards agencies and the combination of its agencies. It has achieved a lot in the past. If it keeps following the scientific path and the combination with the other knowledge in the city already we think that it will be...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4592,2022-10-19 15:33:29
16247," If it keeps following the scientific path and the combination with the other knowledge in the city already, we think that it will be a very comfortable and very livable city in the future, even more than today. Times are tough, jobs are scarce, it's risky to be outside and around others. So I guess I'll just hunker down and binge social media until this all blows over. Wait, don't these people make money? How do these people make money? Streamers, YouTubers, Twitch stars, how do they make money? Is it a lot? Is it a lot of work? I know, I gotta ask somebody in the biz and I got just the guy, Austin John plays. This is your full-time job now, right? As of November of last year, yes. This was always just kind of like a side thing. Like any money that I made from doing my videos and whatever else, I never touched that because I didn't really think of that as being like real money. And then it started coming in more and more. And then it was like, I hit my first day that I broke a grand. And I was like, this is actually gonna be money. How did the YouTube channel come to be? When the game Pokemon Sun and Moon came out for the 3DS, there was like things that I learned about the game. And then I wanted to just share that information with people. And at the time, I didn't have any way to capture screen or anything. So I found like generic footage and I kind of put it all together with so much editing. And that video got six views. And then two days later, I made another one. And that one got 12 views. And then I just started pumping out more and more content. And people were like, this guy knows what he's talking about. It really just started building on top of itself. And then it was like, my channel really focuses on tips and tricks. So I play a straight 18 hours. And I'll finish the game or get to about the 40 hour mark. And then I'll make my first video. While I'm going through, I have a giant no pad and just scribbles everywhere. And I make these notes of like the things that stumped me. So I know the things that may stump other people. What do you need to think about if you're building your YouTube channel? One, you need to do something that you're passionate about. Not that you like. Not that you think you're gonna make money on something you're passionate about. The other thing is something that other people are passionate about. It holds a special place to them. And third is, it needs to be something that people are gonna seek out information on. In order to enter into the marketplace, you either need to be better than everyone else. You either need to be faster than everyone else. Or you need to be more accessible than everyone else. And you can't be more accessible because it's already on the platform granted. If you understand how the algorithm works, which is very similar to Google Analytics, then yeah, you can have a little bit of a head start. But if you're not doing it faster, and if you're not doing it better than everyone else, then why should in one watch your channel? So my income as a YouTuber kind of breaks down to three different ways. One, which is the bulk of it, which is ad revenue. Whenever you go and you watch a video, and then there's an ad and then you wait five seconds and hit the bottom right corner. And then you...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4593,2022-10-19 15:37:52
16248," One, which is the bulk of it, which is ad revenue. Whenever you go and you watch a video, and then there's an ad, and then you wait five seconds, and you hit the bottom right corner, and then you go on to the next video, or a non-skippable ad, or the video starts to meet you, you get the little banner ad at the bottom, or if you scroll down from the video, the first thing that shows there is an ad. Those are the four different types of ads that can appear on every single YouTube video. And all of them pay a certain amount. It varies on lots of things, like the country of the person who posted, the country of the person who watches it, the time of year, where you are in the quarter, if there's anything going on with a reduction in ad revenue. Like great example, COVID-19, companies weren't as spending as much on advertising. So because of that, CPM went down. CPM stands for a click per thousand, and using the Roman numeral for a thousand. And that means that for every 1000 views, you get a certain amount of money. Now, on low ads, when I first started off, my CPM was 30 cents. So every thousand views, I made 30 cents. But then once I signed with an MCN, and I started making more quality content, and more engaging content, some of my better videos, and certain times of the year, I can see CPMs as high as 12 to $14. And there's a big fluctuation between, you know, if I post a video, when there's no ads being spent like January and February, that's a reason a lot of your favorite YouTubers, and also TV shows, don't post new videos in that time of year, because ad rates are down. Why are they going to make content then? Instead, you're recording and you're bulking up for when ad revenue is higher. The second way that a YouTuber makes income is support, crowdfunding, things like that. When I first started off, Patreon was really the only option, but then they started rolling out supporters and members for YouTube channels. So whenever I have a live stream, you can click a button, and then you could become a member, and then you get special icons next to your name, I believe they're called badges, or on any video, you can hit the join button, and that helps support the channel. And then the third aspect of that would be merch. And for me, my merch has been somewhat basic. In fact, I'm wearing one of my t-shirts from last year right now. You have to endure the times that your first video gets six views, that you post it on Reddit, and they say, shut up, and then an auto mod bands you. You have to go through that, because until you go through that, and you discover why you're doing it, you're not doing it for other people, you're doing it for yourself. If you're not loving what you do, then it's not worth it. Huh, so make a channel about something that I'm passionate about. Oh, sweet. I guess I can make the channel about that. Now, how do I grow an audience? How do I get popular? It's all about diversification. You have to have a massive Twitter following. You have to have a massive Instagram following. You have to have a massive YouTube following. Of course, you have to be on Twitch, which is the key platform, but basically, anyway, you can get in front of your audience, you can engage with your audience, and it is going to drive those clicks, which ultimately drives the advertiser revenue that you get back from all of these platforms. It's me and Dan playing video games and talking in a funny manner over them. They're not just people who are good at games. They're actually people who are good at online engagement, online entertainment first and foremost. You have to write to remain stylish. Anything you wear can and will be used against you in the quarter fashion. The streamer is either very, very talented at the game. The best player in the game is generally going to draw crowd because people like watching people who are very good. On the other hand, they're either very, very good or funny, charismatic, whatever it is on that side. Oh, no.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4594,2022-10-19 15:42:31
16249," But on the other hand, they're either very, very good or funny, charismatic, whatever it is on that side. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. You know, it becomes more of a show where they talk about other things outside of the gaming world and gaming becomes really just a backdrop and an excuse to engage with other audiences. There were those weird like Ronald McDonald, like straight to VHS movies, you remember those? I'm personal. I'm chatty. I would kind of, you know, when boring things were happening in the game, I would ram along about, you know, movies I'd watched or books I'd read or conversations I'd had and stuff like that. So I think being personable was a big part of that. It's not just getting on and playing games, it's getting on and being an entertainer. You are putting on a show. All right. Now, let me go ahead and grab the samurai sword that every gym has. Okay. He's dead. To have a larger audience and to have that audience, I think, stay with you. You have to bring something extra. You have to find your niche. You have to find what works and what connects with the audience and what makes them laugh and what makes them keep coming back. And you got to make it a little more exciting. All right. Throwing a hanging bishop, have everybody in suspense for a moment. I think the real most important thing is to just get used to being on camera. Like in any sort of performance thing is get used to talking on camera. You know, my first few videos were terrible. But because I sat down and did it for six to eight hours a day, I just got used to talking and I got over that uncomfortable hump. If you go into Twitch purely with the expectation that you're going to make money, make a job out of it, have all this growth and it's going to be great, you're probably going to burn out prior to getting to that point because there's very little payoff for a long time, right? Multiple years generally before you really start to see a payoff. And so, you know, those first few times you're streaming, nobody is there. One person shows up every 30 minutes says hi, maybe, and leaves, right? Like, it's very discouraging, I think, for a lot of people. And so you have to be there just loving it. You have to love talking to yourself when nobody is around. You have to love just the game that you're playing, all of that stuff because it takes a while and I think a majority of people burn out prior to getting to the like profitable point of it. And there you have it. My very own YouTube, Twitch, Discord and streaming channels all ready to go live. It's a veritable social media ecosystem just on the verge of thriving. So don't forget to smash like and subscribe and visit my Patreon for perks. Also, go to my merch page. And one last thing, stay cool, my friends. This is live stream shopping. One of the hottest trends in China. Every night, tens of millions of people watch live shows hosted by influencers like the China and by the products they recommend.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4595,2022-10-19 15:47:14
16250," booster own cells and influence. So if you think about China's life streaming, you have to know the king and queen of the influences. The queen of life streaming, VIA, she is actually having the biggest viewership and the biggest sales volume for a long time, on top of her platform. She can sell everything from Gucci sunglasses, lipstick, homes and cars. One time she offered her followers to go on a Tesla ride with her. And she even, for once, so they rocky launch in her life streaming room for 40 million yuan. The king is Li Jiaqi, more widely known as lipstick spreader. He used to be a cosmetic sales before he turned into a life streaming commerce. And he knows a lot about the cosmetics. So he's the one that will actually put the lipsticks on himself when he's on the show. Top live streamers like VIA and Li Jiaqi have become celebrities in China and earn millions of dollars a year. Although not everyone can be as popular, mid-ranking live streamers like Tiffany still earn a good income through sales commissions. If I say that from the income方面, the main income of the live stream is much higher than the normal ones. But the main work of the live streamers is very much related to the health of the body. Every day, you need to be in a critical condition and then you have to work for 5-6 hours. This is very tiring. And if you work for 5-6 hours, your brain is not stopped. And your mouth is not stopped. And your hands are not stopped. Your eyes are not stopped either. Like we did, we didn't just do single-legged live streamers. And then there will be some product-related work. And then there will be some other things that are not actually life-saving. I think the real intention of the fans is not to say that the whole thing may be a big thing that you will be able to do. And every day, you can't forget the content of the content. The fans may not forget the understanding of you. The trust you can get. If you don't have a full-time job, you can get a full-time job. If you don't have a full-time job, you can get a full-time job. A lot of successful live streamers are generally very good at communication. They're very good at articulating very simply what a product does, what a product doesn't do. In order for them to sell, they need to be trustworthy and appear trustworthy. And they need to show in some ways that they're authentic, right? So for VIA and Li Chasi, they're able to articulate that quite a bit through their body language, through what they say. For example, Li Chasi will always know something, say things, bad things about certain products. Because to him, there's this honest opinion and sometimes people want to hear that. And so they seem very credible. They seem very trustworthy. And don't forget, they're also very entertaining and very interesting. If you're familiar with Li Chasi, if you want a Guinness record for the most lipstick applications, the models in 30 seconds. So if you're able to create a lot of bars, we've got interesting things that you do. People who may not want to buy lipsticks but also streaming just to watch what he does. And then from there, you might get hope to just read a new central manager to the company. Live streamers also use sales techniques such as limited time or supply. These sense of scarcity can often encourage viewers to buy. The platform in itself creates and enhances some of these things. But you see it live. Something because social proof has taken over, meaning that, hey, other people are interested, other people are joining in, other people want the same product. And they add it in the chat, and they ask questions and say, oh, I want this too. What happens then? It makes the whole product even more scarce. But it's not just influencers, local farmers, luxury brands, even mutual funds have also started their own live stream shows. Working with very top tier live streamers can be risky. It's not necessary that the benefits will end up with a brand. So we see company executives opening their own shows. And we see like PNG have their own sales room which runs shows every day as well. We also have like local governors in like small towns to sell their agricultural products. So the live streaming is definitely transformed the way product owners can think about how to reach their consumers and enables a lot of players to actually sell.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4597,2022-10-19 15:56:53

16252," So the live streaming is definitely transformed the way product owners can think about how to reach their consumers and enables a lot of players to actually sell. And live stream shopping is going global. Merchants in Southeast Asia have embraced this trend. And in the West, Amazon has upgraded its live streaming function and interactive features like chat rooms. Companies, including Google and Facebook, are also developing and investing in technologies to integrate video and e-commerce. In the past, it has actually started to flow and the future development space and potential are all huge. Next, we will be more and more united and unbalanced. It will become a more daily conversation. It will be a very different conversation. If you look at the numbers alone, their numbers alone, the number of the people, you know that they can sell. And you know that they can generate revenue. Are they able to sustain it over a long period of time? It depends on how you know very they are at changing some of the things that they do. But you can't expect consumers one day turn into virtual shopping for good. There will be the nature of us that crave to go into the store to touch the goods and actually wear it and see how it looks like and walk around that with our friends. And those things wouldn't be replaceable with live streaming. Imagine that the oceans are actually the largest battery. We store a huge amount of energy in the oceans. The wave of motion can be very deep. It can extend down several hundred meters. It gets to the near shore from about 50 meters. The whole water column is moving backwards and forwards. As we search for ways to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, some are looking to a largely untapped potential source of renewable energy. In theory, waves off the coast of the United States alone could generate over two trillion kilowatt hours of electricity a year, enough to power more than half of the country. Waves intensify and subside not just quickly as the wind and that means that it can produce a smoother power generation curve. One of the potential advantages of wave energy is that it could act as a complementary source of power compared to other renewables on the grid if it were to be scaled up to commercial scale. For decades, engineers have been trying to convert wave energy into electricity. But a host of technological and financial challenges have complicated their efforts. In the years from around 2006 to 2015, there were a state of bankruptcies in the sector. And this was largely because of a lack of kind of continuous proven projects out at sea with reliable electricity generation. Since then, companies have been trying to develop the technologies that are steady at pace and with a smaller cash burn. But the same questions remain. Can companies develop devices and technologies that actually work? Is wave energy just a novelty or something that can become a major renewable energy source? The sea is a very challenging environment within which to operate the power projects.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4598,2022-10-19 15:59:33
16253," The sea is a very challenging environment within which to operate a power project. So sea water is corrosive and conditions are very rough, so this means that power projects don't have a very long lifetime and it increases operating and maintenance costs. Partly because of that, many early wave energy projects hit rough waters, such as the Pellarmus wave energy converter in Portugal and the Ila Limpit project in Scotland. But that hasn't stopped others from trying. Companies are focused on testing projects out at sea, proving their durability, trying to raise capital and bring down cost. The sector hasn't really converged around one single technology design and companies are kind of undersized about which design works best. Finland-based AW Energy is a veteran in the sector. The first proof of concept of the company's device was made in the 90s after diver Rano Koeiversari observed the strong back and forth movement of a hatch cover in a shipwreck in the Baltic Sea. The waves are generated far from the coastline, so the wind blows on the surface of the water, causing the water particles to rotate. And that rotation extends deep down below the surface and the waves can be very long. They can be several hundred meters long. And as they come into the near shore, this rotational energy turns into an elliptical energy and eventually backwards and forwards that you probably have noticed if you've been swimming on the sea shore in large waves, you're pulled in and out. That's the energy that we're extracting. But there's a sweet spot where we deploy. So around 10 to 15 meters of water depth, that's where there's still strong wave energy coming in. After years of research, prototyping and testing, the company has deployed Wave Roller, a 350 kilowatt device in the waters of Portugal. Wave Roller has an 80 meter wide and 10 meter high steel panel fixed to the seabed via a flotable foundation. The panel moves back and forth with the waves, capturing the energy. It's submerged in the depth of 15 meters, so it's protected from the extreme waves. We generate electricity by capturing the movement with hydraulic circuitry in a machine room underneath the surface, that hydraulic energy we turn to electricity with hydraulic accumulators and hydraulic motors and also our generator. The Wave Roller has survived large waves at sea for over a year and delivered electricity via an underwater cable to the grid in Portugal. Meanwhile, the company has won a 2.5 million euro grant to work on an upgraded version of the Wave Roller. Aiming to increase the electricity generation capacity to 1 megawatt, the upscale device would have a bigger panel, two power takeoff units and improved software to control the energy production. We have taken into use a very prediction algorithm that kind of tells us what kind of waves are coming into our device. And gives us a few seconds to prepare for capturing more energy and the difference in that is significant. Our future plans are to deliver technology around the world. So I'm hoping we can be working on delivering technology to projects in Asia and also in American contents as well. Meanwhile, Israeli company EcoWavePower is taking a different approach to capturing the power of the ocean. For the company's founder, in a braver man, developing new sources of renewable energy is a personal mission.

16254," And two weeks after I was born, the Chernobyl nuclear reactor exploded, causing the largest in history, nuclear disaster. I was one of the babies that got hurt from the negative effects of such explosion. I had a respiratory arrest and a clinical death. Luckily my mother and nurse approached my crib on time and gave me a mouth to mouth to my frustration with saving my life. I got a second chance in life and decided to do something good with it. Growing up, Anna wanted to be a politician to positively change the world. After working as a translator at a renewable energy company, she decided to change parts. Solar and wind energy were fully commercialized. There were a lot of amazing technologies implemented everywhere. I saw that wave energy, although it's an immense source of electricity, the biggest companies in the world are trying to develop wave energy with no success. And there was kind of a race going on in the world of who is the company that is going to develop a viable wave energy solution first. In 2011, the then 24-year-old inner co-founded EcoWave Power. Instead of installing devices offshore, the company's devices are attached to existing breakwaters, jetty's and peers. Our technology is very cost-efficient, especially in comparison to the offshore technologies, because we don't need any ships, divers, underwater mooring or cables when installing existent man-made structures. And all our expensive equipment, the generator, the hydraulic conversion unit, the automation, is located online just like a regular power station. This is the EcoWave Power conversion unit that has been operating in Jaffa Port since 2014 until 2020. Here you can see how the technology works. Basically, the flotters are going up and down and pushing the hydro cylinders which transmits by the gradeable fluid into land-located accumulators. A pressure is being built, the higher the waves, the higher the pressure, which is used to turn the hydro motor, which is turning the generators. The whole system is controlled by a smart automation system, which you can see right here. And in case of upcoming storms, the system automatically raises the flotter above the water level and keeps them in the upward position until the storm passes. The company has been operating a 100 kilowatt grid-connected device in Gibraltar since 2016, which is enough to power 100 households. Currently, Inner and her team are working on another 100 kilowatt project at the Port of Jaffa in Tel Aviv. The project will be also the first time in the history of Israel that wave energy will officially connect to the electrical grid, and our goal going forward is to expand it to all suitable breakwaters in the city of Tel Aviv and to supply a significant part of the city's electricity needs. Today, engineers and entrepreneurs are still trying to crack wave energy. Globally, only a few hundred kilowatts of wave energy are deployed compared with gigawatts of offshore wind. But the filters come a long way in recent years, and with the right engineering solutions, this new power source could eventually become competitive with more mature renewables like solar and wind. I would have a lot more confidence in the success of wave energy companies today as opposed to like 20 years ago. But in the next few years or maybe the next couple of decades, it will be more likely to be used in remote locations like islands that are otherwise dependent on expensive diesel power or out at sea on gas-dead commissioning rigs or full powering underwater autonomous vehicles. So definitely, wave energy can compete with other renewable energy sources, but I personally believe that this is not a competition. In order to have a 100% renewable energy-friendly world, we need all renewable energy sources to work together.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4600,2022-10-19 16:08:14

16256," he stood out. But over the years, he saved Nissan from bankruptcy, and turned the alliance into one of the most competitive in the world. He started thinking about legacy plays, and one of them was to really tighten the alliance between Renault and Japan. And unbeknownst to him, there was a contingent of senior Nissan executives that were really felt threatened by that move. They really thought that they would lose complete control of the car company, and even in the government there was probably a little bit of anxiety about a national champion in the auto industry following under full blown foreign control. Carlos Gone was an auto industry leader respected by many in Japan. Now he's in jail. The arrest of Carlos Gone came completely out of the blue. This was in November of 2018. He was coming to Japan on Nissan's corporate jet for a regular executive meeting, and he was met on the tarmac by Japanese authorities who whisked him away to jail and charged him with financial misconduct crimes. So what happened was a power struggle ensued inside the company, and somewhere along the way it was criminalized. By that I mean that there were allegations leveled at Carlos Gone about the way he reported his pay to Japanese authorities, the way he handled money inside the company, that in other contexts might have been a board action, might have been handled internally. A number of executives at Nissan decided to take this difference and take it over to the Tokyo Prosecutors Office, and that unleashed a chain of events that would shake the entire auto industry. So after Carlos Gone was arrested, Nissan launched an internal investigation into the events that led up to his arrest. So Rob Posse was tasked with investigating Carlos Gone, and he was told get to the heart of the matter. Find out what Carlos Gone did wrong and bring it to our shareholders. Yeah it's really complicated because you had various things coming out of the weeds. 2018 investigation has started and we become aware of matters in terms of conflicts, actions by certain individuals, that cause some concern because things might not quite be what they seem. So in our story we really took a close look at Harinata and his role in Carlos Gone's downfall. Harinata is one of the most fascinating figures inside Nissan. He's also a lawyer, he's originally Malaysian. Oh Mr. Hidey. And he had a meteoric rise through the company and became very very close to Carlos Gone and other top figures. He had a front row seat at all the major strategic deliberations at the company. And when he discovered that Carlos Gone as his final legacy play was going to tighten the relationship between Renault and Nissan, he made a decision to go against Carlos Gone and he became one of the key figures that decided that Carlos Gone had to go. Harinata was somebody who actually recruited me into the company. So I have a longstanding relationship with him or did have a longstanding relationship with him. For many many years he was a mentor. I had doubts about the credibility of the process right at the start. Harinata had a plea deal with the Tokyo prosecutors.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4602,2022-10-19 16:16:53
16257," I had doubts about the credibility of the process right at the start. Harry Norder had a plea deal with the Tokyo prosecutors. Now, that suggests he was intrinsically involved in some of the wrongdoing or the allegations of wrongdoing. And it just didn't smell right, just doesn't sit right. So there was a basic conflict of interest. In other words, Harry Norder had to deliver results to Japanese prosecutors to avoid his own criminal liability. And he's accusing and leading the investigation of Carlos Gowne. Some of the people who had been involved in the original alleged crimes were also looking into the affairs themselves. Revinder Pasi began pointing out some of these conflict of interest issues. And the reason for that is essentially his concern was for the company. If the company's own investigation into itself was compromised, that could lead to a very weak position in various lawsuits that it was dealing with across the world. I had discussions with Harry, discussions about the statutory auditors, about these conflicts, discussions with HR, about some of these conflicts. Because at that point, we reported into him. At the time, everything was quite, as you can imagine, it was, we've got to do this, we've got to do that, we've got to move fast. But when you step back and look at some of these things, you just think, my god, what was going on here? Because me, members of my team, were being placed in immediate danger. Your chairman's been arrested. A representative director's been arrested. They both happened to be foreigners. And then now what we need to do, we're being instructed to do is certain compliance professionals need to go into properties in Brazil, for example, and retrieve evidence. They've got to do it very carefully, because if they don't do it carefully, they're going to get convicted of criminal activities. And likewise, when a team of lawyers were commissioned to go to Lebanon, I mean, one of my immediate concerns was, why are lawyers from Nissan being sent to go to Lebanon to retrieve evidence? These are just lawyers, they're corporate lawyers from Nissan. You had revelations that a number of executives had benefited from share appreciation rights, and they shouldn't have. I mean, substantive amounts of money being taken by these guys when they weren't entitled to take them. And you do think, yes, how is this going to look later on? It's going to look quite concerning. So that triggered, for me, the sort of assessment that, well, I'm going to have to do something. Because up until this point, I haven't put down on paper these conflicts and these issues. So Rob Posse makes a fateful move. He writes this letter to the board, listing every suspicion he has, and great detail backed up by evidence backed up by memos of why this internal investigation had serious problems. He sends a letter to the board and it's crickets. He doesn't hear much of anything. Nothing happened there often. Nothing at all. Just like it just gone into a black box.

And he began to suspect that there was a desire, even at the highest level within Nissan, to kind of sweep these conflicts of interest under the rug. Unfortunately for me, I think, again, with hindsight, people must have thought that this is the nail that's sticking out. And we can't have this. Within three days of me submitting that to the Board of Directors, that letter to the Independent Board of Directors, I was removed from the Goan Executive Conduct matters. I was then told that I could not attend board meetings anymore. And up until that point, I had attended every single board meeting. I was then also told that after eight years of being in Japan, I'd be going back to the UK. It eventually transpired that I'd be the VP of projects and transformation, managing a team of three. So you can imagine what this feels like at this stage. Almost an arbitrary removal from Japan, where I've lived for eight years, had three children there. My family has grown up and we've been settled there. Having a few months earlier been promoted to vice president at a global level, to being almost demoted. So Pasi was essentially being reassigned to get him as far away from the internal investigation as possible, and also to a certain extent in retaliation to some of the issues that he brought up regarding the internal investigation and the harianata. What happened to Rav Pasi can be seen as a series of corporate humiliations. I mean, first of all, his immediate responsibilities were taken away from him. Eventually he'd lost the coveted general council title. But it didn't stop there. Toward the end of his stay in Japan, Rav and his wife were convinced that they were being followed. During that period, I'd noticed that once driving my car, I'd have other cars following me. First, I noticed this was around mid-March, and I was driving. I can't remember where I was going, but this grave and small van just literally started following me. And I noticed that there was somebody in the car taking pictures. And lo and behold, we were absolutely being followed, by either by people on foot or other individuals. Two or three normally two burly men in a car, different cars at different times following us around. They were following the family as well. And given we'd seen, right seen, the Nissan Security Department, behaving a very, very egregious manner with others in terms of following and surveilling, I was very concerned as to what they were doing and who they were giving this information to. Because if they're giving this information to the authorities, you do think, why? What's going on here? I mean, this is just not normal behavior. And this all culminated in a rather dramatic event in the middle of 2020. Who are you people where Nissan had hired a legal team and had obtained an unusual court order from the District Court in Yokohama? To basically do a search of his home and seizure of his corporate laptop and phone and another document. If you don't let us in now, we have to break this key. So it's a pretty extreme way to treat someone who had spent 16 years at the company. These people have all come in. We don't really know who they are, apart from the f**k.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4604,2022-10-19 16:25:38
16259," This is the awful truth. There's always someone in there. This lady does not deserve to be taken advantage of. Expressionally, at your age with your own grandchild. My grandma is having to sue them. I'm testifying against them. Nobody's talking. They're one floor below right now. I get afraid to go on the elevator. It's sad that it had to devolve to this. It's like a soap opera to me. It's a very sad thing. It's a family feud. A family feud. Here's a family that, on paper, you would think has the wealth that so many people seek yet. At the end of the day, it seemed to rip everybody apart. My name's Tom Schoenberg. I'm a senior reporter here at Bloomberg News. Cover financial enforcement. I was approached by someone close to the Shottenstein family and asked whether or not I would be interested in writing about Beverly Shottenstein in this case that she had against JP Morgan. It was immediately clear that there was a great story here to be told. I started just assembling all sorts of documents that the family made available to me. That included a diary that Beverly had begun writing when she started having suspicions about what was actually going on with her money. Probably obtained her wealth from the Shottenstein retail empire that has, at times, included big lots, value city, American Eagle Outfitters, DSW shoes. Beverly's husband died, and at which point they sold off their portion of the company, bringing them an enormous amount of wealth at around 1990. Estimates of her wealth were around $90 million. She, for many years, had that pool of money being managed by outside advisors. Her grandsons in the late 2000s had both graduated and were becoming financial advisors. She gave them a little bit to work with, and over time, her grandson Evan became the trusty of her entire estate. Managing sort of family money is not a conflict. In fact, some ways in wealth management, it's kind of how you get your start. It's kind of the seed that you need to sort of get going in the business. But Beverly started having suspicions that something was wrong probably in around 2016. Well, there were suspicious things, but taken separately without everyone talking about their own experiences, it was hard to really put it together. She had written a check to her caretaker Dawn that bounced. So she went down to her local chase branch to sort of find out what was going on. She wasn't getting paper statements in the mail, so she asked them to print out a number of her statements having to do with her checking account and her credit card account. So we went to the bank and asked for the statements, and she got a whole year and going through all of them, page by page by page. And it was there. She saw all sorts of charges that she said she did not the rise or didn't know about. I was becoming very, very suspicious. I was starting to look in the money part, and that's what bothered me more when I saw that money was going. And I was not a big spender. Around the same time Dawn, she starts noticing Beverly's son, who lived in the condominium below her, came up with Evan with a shredder and started grabbing papers in her office area, including some with JP Morgan Letterhead, and just started sitting at the kitchen table this sleeve.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4606,2022-10-19 16:35:40

These people have all come in, we don't really know who they are, apart from the fact that I've been shown a badge that says the Yokohama Court and they're here to recover a laptop and a mobile phone.

16261," Evan, with a shredder, started grabbing papers in her office area, including some with JP Morgan Letterhead, and just started sitting at the kitchen table, just shredding documents over and over. Yeah, they came in one morning. They used to do it the back. Through the back door, and they brought this shredder inside, and then they went in the drawers in the office and took out all the papers, and they started to do it. I was very suspicious because I know you don't go around and get in destroying papers. Fabrily said that they had done this many times before. That's when she said to me, you know, Don, I'm gonna write my feelings in this black book. Diary. It's a diary, and she started writing each day. She would write a little at a time. Around the holidays of 2018, the package had arrived, a FedEx package, and in it, were materials about a venture capital fund based out of the Cayman Islands, Don, and some other family members take a look at this, and they see that Fabrily has signed up for this fund to the tune of $5 million over the course of several years. And that was really the beginning of it. That was sort of the tip of the iceberg when it became obvious that something was going on that my grandmother really wasn't aware of this fund. You know, Fabrily started a panic. She was got really upset and called, you know, JP Morgan's headquarters in New York and asked for Jamie Diamond. She said she was told someone would call her back, but she says that that never happened. She wrote a letter to Evan and Avi, and in there, she laid out a number of things that were concerning her, on authorized trading, the checking account, she had about a million dollars worth of jewelry in a safe deposit box, and that her son Bobby had the key to that box, and that jewelry had gone missing. All this was kind of packaged in this, you know, five-page handwritten, a memento will and trust. They're such an evolving narrative about why the jewelry was taken, the only truth we really know is that the jewelry is gone. But why it happened, there have been a lot of different stories. You just don't take your mother's wonderful things and hand it out. And they email that note to JP Morgan to seize all activity on her account. And it ended up setting off a firestorm after that. As soon as they got this email, that there was a season to assist and that she wanted to send her money and change brokerage firms, they were actually vacationing one floor below downstairs, over there right now. The next day, Beverly's in her place, a granddaughter's still in her place visiting. Dawn is there and up comes Bobby kind of barging through the door and he's screaming about what was sent to the JP Morgan. They're now investigating now. And he's furious, takes his mother and sort of puts her into a chair, gets pen and paper, and she says physically forced her to write a retraction letter. They were pushing me around. It was a scary time. I was really afraid to. I had to take her to the doctor and she did an X-ray because she was in so much pain. The locks had to be changed, the phone number had to be changed. I really thought we were going to have to hire guards to be outside just for protection. Oh, it was terrible. It was horrible scene. I really brought her case before the financial industry regulatory authorities, usually known as Finra. It took several months' hearings. She sees all sorts of transactions that's going on. Hundreds of them that she claims that she never knew about, never authorized. But yet we're logged to JP Morgan's files as having been direct requests from her. That included the sale of a large amount of Apple stock worth $7 million, as well as all her stock in big lots. Over the course of their time with JP Morgan, Evan and Avi were making all sorts of trading on her account that was generating millions of dollars in commissions for themselves in the bank. Yet.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4607,2022-10-19 16:38:58
16262," JP Morgan, Evan and Avi were making all sorts of trading on her account that was generating millions of dollars and commissions for themselves in the bank, yet she was not sort of getting any of the type of gains that you would expect sort of an 80 million dollar account in a bullish market to be able to get. They issued a ruling entirely in her favor finding that her grandsons as well as JP Morgan, they were liable for violating their fiduciary duty, misrepresenting themselves, and they also found that the bank and her grandson, Evan, reliable for elder abuse. Evan and Avi, they were fired from JP Morgan, they issued an award of about 19 million dollars. I reached out for comment and JP Morgan emphasized that Evan and Avi were no longer with the firm and that their actions do not represent the sort of values of the bank. I reached out to Evan and Avi, heard back from their lawyer saying that they disagree with the law and the facts that Finra kind of used to decide the case against them and are seeing if they can have it withdrawn. Her son Bobby wrote her a letter, said his sons weren't criminals, and he also admits to taking her jewelry and he says he needed it to pay off some bad business debts he had. They never once came up to say I'm sorry. If there had been an apology and some acceptance and asking for forgiveness from my grandmother, I don't think we'd be in the position that we are now. Since the piece came out, we received dozens of messages from people, many of whom are telling their own sort of personal tales of financial advisors gone bad or family members who got control of an estate and abused those within. It seems that it's really resonating with a lot of people. I keep hearing a lot of feedback about Beverly and how a lot of people feel she did the right thing. You're never too old to stand up for yourself and try to write an injustice. She was adamant that she wanted to stand up for herself. At the end of the day, they did wrong. It's a painful life lesson. You know, Beverly taught them that you don't mess with Kramer. On April 20th, oil markets did something they never had before. They crashed into negative territory and closed the day at minus $40. Meanwhile, in a place called Thaden Boyce in Essex, a group of nine traders, led by a guy called Cuddles, made $660 million over the course of a couple of hours. The price of oil has collapsed to a record low. We've never really seen anything like it. WTI this morning down more than 35%. People maybe wouldn't have been so surprised if the oil price had fallen to zero. But the oil price went to minus $38. It went far lower than anyone had expected. And so lots of people in the market were saying, well hang on, something else is going on here. A couple of months later, I started to get wind through a kind of network of sources that a tiny firm in the outskirts of London had made a huge amount of money that day. And potentially had some part to play in what happened. The information we got was that nine traders at Vega Capital London had made in the region of $660 million in one day. As a group, I think they made as much money in one day as Apple makes from its international sales in one day. I mean, it's an insane sum of money. Did they pull off?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4608,2022-10-19 16:42:46
16263," $10 million in one day. As a group, I think they made as much money in one day as Apple makes from its international sales in one day. I mean, it's an insane sum of money. Did they pull off a fantastic trade? Did they predict the way the market was moving and get it absolutely right? Or was there something else going on and had they actually done something the breached market rules in a bid to push the market? And that investigation is ongoing. So Paul Cummins is a trader who cut his teeth in the pits in the 80s and 90s. When everyone had a nickname, he was Cuddles. If you can imagine that was a very cut throat type of world where people are doing hundreds of thousands and millions of dollar trades by shouting each other, giving hand signals and then scrolling on scraps of paper. The culture of the trading pits in London was very influenced by the working class guys who became traders there. They weren't like the city bankers that had gone before them. They weren't usually Oxford or Cambridge. They didn't wear saddle rose suits. They were ordinary working guys who happened to have a talent for trading. A lot of them came from Essex. I think it was 400 traders in the pits and Cuddles in his oil and gas pit was described to us as amongst the top three amongst that. It was very successful and made very large amounts of money as a young man. But inevitably mechanization and the arrival of electronic markets was the kind of death knell for the pits. And in 2005 the IPE closed down. And when the pits shut down, a lot of the traders who worked their, lost their jobs or quit or went to work for financial institutions pull commons decided to start his own trading collective out in Essex. Some of them are ex-pick guys, cut from the same cloth as him. Lots of them are actually sort of in their 20s and their, you know, drinking buddies, son or their own kids, friends from football. You know, their young lads, hungry and ambitious and he brings them into the fold. And fairly shortly he's got, you know, maybe a dozen or so traders that are independent. Let's be clear, but they're all part of this collective. Yeah, I'll let Liam do with Essex. I am from Essex, so I feel like I'm free to, you know, to get into it. Sweet as they say. If you were to ask someone in Britain how they would imagine a kind of Essex person, they would see someone who's maybe slightly flamboyant with a sort of cockney accent, a sort of guy which he's start accent. You know, not afraid to splash the cash, but it's probably pretty bright and has done well for themselves. Don't even make sense, does he? But, you know, these guys, they drove around very nice roles, voices and bent leaves. They went to places like Marbaea on holiday. Faden Boyce is a very wealthy place. You have to have considerable income to be able to afford to live in that village. It's a really nice place to live, and it's 20 minutes to tube right away from the city. Earlier in the summer, we have this lead, which is that there's this tiny firm called Vega Capital London, and they were the biggest winners from the biggest oil crash in history. You know, anyone that covers markets, it's going to be surprised about that. You know, you're thinking, you're BP's of the world, you're Glencores, but it's this tiny firm. And one of the big challenges that we had was actually finding out who worked with Vega Capital. It wasn't immediately obvious, but first we had absolutely no idea. If you go to the Vega Capital website, it says it's under construction. If you do basic online searching, it's very difficult to find anyone who's publicly connected to the company. So inevitably, we're incredibly curious at this point. Like, who the hell are these people? The more reporting we did, the more it became clear that this group were connected socially as well as professionally. They went to weddings together, they played golf together, they would go and holiday together. We found out that a number of them were members of the West.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4609,2022-10-19 16:47:28
16264," This group were connected socially as well as professionally. They went to weddings together, they played golf together, they would go and holiday together. We found out that a number of them were members over the West Ham supporters club in London. A few of them started companies together so you could see all the connections between them and start to see a distinct group emerging. And it really just was this kind of shock that, you know, this wasn't just like a hedge fund or a firm you'd never heard of. This was actually a group of buddies who all had the same experience on this day and had all made a huge amount of money. So if you're an oil trader, there's a number of different ways you can trade. And probably the most popular is WTI, future's contracts. And it's basically a contract that says, I'm going to buy a thousand barrels of oil from you at this point in the future. Or I'm going to sell a thousand barrels of oil to you at this point in the future. It's actually just a financial contract to gamble on to predict where the oil was going to go up or down. On the 20th of April in Essex, there had been signals for a while that this was going to be an exceptional day in oil markets. And we know that some of them arose early and started their trading in the early hours of the morning while it was still dark outside. Essentially what they were doing is buying contracts that gave them an obligation to buy oil at whatever the price ended up at 230 p.m. So they're basically placing a bet that oil was going to fall throughout the day. But they're simultaneously selling lots of oil as well. And whether they make a profit and how much profit they make is the difference between what they buy the oil for and what they sell the oil for. Now of course, we now know throughout April 20th the price dropped and dropped. So this is going very well for them. You know, they are committed to selling oil at these prices and the prices are continuing to fall, which means they're going to be able to offset it and buy oil at cheaper at the end of the day. Now once it gets to kind of 130 p.m. that's when things start to get really interesting. Suddenly there's a kind of influx of buyers and sellers, you know, as desperation increases in the market and trading volumes go up. Now at 208 p.m. exactly something bizarre and unprecedented happened, which is the oil passes into negative territory. And it fell to a record level of minus $38. We've never seen anything like a period in terms of the contraction of the global economy. That huge gulf between what they were buying the oil for and what they were selling it for enabled them to make more money than they ever thought possible. So their profit was the difference between minus 37 and all of these positive numbers on every contract they sold. The price of crude briefly hit minus $37 a barrel. For one group of traders operating from a small office it was a very, very profitable day. It's important to remember this had never happened before in the history of oil trading. No one could have predicted it. I can't think of another example of where you enter a trade and you get paid on both sides. You get paid both to sell and to buy. You know, it's unthinkable. One thing we know about the cuddles trading arcade is that they were very comfortable taking large risks and you have to be clear this was a large risk. Yeah, we spoke to oil traders, both people that know these guys and people that don't and they all say that this is incredibly risky. And that's actually what stops a lot of oil traders doing trading like this. They simply aren't willing to stomach the risk. But cuddles and his friends were. So when the kind of final calculations came down the group of the nine most profitable traders made $660 million or thereabouts between them. I mean, if you can imagine, I think three or four of them made in excess of 100 million each. One of the astonishing things about this trade is that two of the individuals who made more than $100 million in a single day were in their 20s. One of them was 22 years old. And a few years earlier, he'd been posting on his social media about doing teenage stuff with his mates in town and going to see girls and rap music. And here he is a few years later making $100 million in a single day's trading. When we in Liam discovered that, we just, we couldn't believe it. We couldn't believe what we were seeing. What's the most important thing? All trading is a zero-sum game. Anytime you're making money, there's no trade or something.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4610,2022-10-19 16:51:50
16265," and believe what we were seeing. All trading is a zero-sum game. Anytime you're making money as an oil trade or someone else is losing it. Amongst the biggest losers were the investors in this Chinese fund, Crude Oil Treasure fund. There were thousands of them and they lost everything. Lots of people have put their savings into oil funds. They lost money that day. Big banks and brokers who sort of stand in the middle of trading parties, they lost money that day. Another interesting thing is that oil producing countries like Q8 or Canada, they sell oil as an average of the WTI closing price over the preceding month. So the fact that one of those numbers in that average was minus 37, then if you can imagine countries like Saudi Arabia and Q8 potentially lost a couple of dollars on every single barrel of oil they sold that month. The mega capital traders made such an extraordinary sum of money that it was inevitable there would be some scrutiny of what they did. But it wasn't just the sums of money they made. In the vital half an hour before the settlement price was set, they were by far the biggest sellers of oil futures in the market, which is an incredible thing to think about. When you consider that the other participants in that oil market are going to be the world's biggest banks, oil majors, BP and Shell and here you have a group of nine guys in Essex who are having this significant influence over a global market for oil. I mean, I think you have to assume that if these guys have made seven million or ten million dollars, they probably would be celebrating in Essex right now. But the fact that they made closer to seven hundred million has meant that they are facing understandable scrutiny. We wrote individually to all the all the Beg a traders who did exceptionally well that day and we got a letter in response from a law firm representing the group. And the law firm was at pains to point out, number one, that they haven't been accused of any wrongdoing, that they all traded independently and separately and they basically all made up their own mind that this was what was going to happen in oil markets based on publicly available knowledge and decided to execute this trade. What I love about these stories is there's a real variance of opinion and some people will look at what happened and think that must be dodgy. They all traded at the end of the day, they all made a huge amount of money while always people lost. That's shocking. But lots of people say these guys are at acute disadvantage. They're in a market that's inhabited by huge technology driven, funds and firms and oil giants that have got all the advantages in the world and when you get a bunch of Essex geasers who essentially beat the market and find a way to make a huge amount of money, they should get a pat on the back really because that's the dream. Since this happened, a lot of the guys have stopped trading the monthly settlements that they've done so well out in the past. Several of them have set up new companies. They've essentially gone very quiet. Any kind of social media presence they had has kind of closed down. By all accounts there, you know, waiting this out. It's certainly too early to try and predict how the regulatory investigations are going to pan out. You know, we just don't know. There's a number of potential outcomes for these guys. You know, potential punishments if there are any findings of manipulation against Vega or anyone affiliated with it might be, you could be fine, you could be banned from trading and, you know, in most extreme cases there have even been criminal prosecutions in the past of people who have been found to have been manipulating the settlement and misconduct related to trade settlement. There are other outcomes too. You know, one obvious one is going to be they're able to walk away from this life-changing trade with all the money that they made and celebrated as heroes in the trading community that, you know, they'll go down as legends.

16266," we It's very important given the nature of the climate crisis right now for the general public to have an understanding of what progress is or is not actually happening. And I think many readers right now, they'll see these hundreds and hundreds of companies making these big bold climate claims. And they would be forgiven to think that, you know, we're well on our way to meeting the emission reduction trajectory we need to be on. And the reality of the matter is we're just not on that trajectory. And a key reason for this sort of disconnect is the use of offsets that aren't doing what they claim to be doing. We have a massive potential for sort of willful blindness. We can convince ourselves of things regardless of what the facts are. And so that's what tends to happen in these cases. It's not that anybody is setting out to commit climate fraud. They sort of walk themselves into a situation and they convince themselves of one thing and that allows them to convince themselves of another thing. But at the end of the day, they're doing something that makes no sense at all. My name is Ben Elgin. I wrote the story about how the billion dollar market for carbon offsets is setting back the fight against climate change. So one of the challenges in reporting on carbon offsets and trying to figure out what's going on is really finding good experts who have been steeped in this marketplace and are willing to candidly talk about it. One of the best people for this is a fellow named Mark Trexler. And I've been talking to him for more than a decade. My name is Mark Trexler. I've worked in climate change for the last 30 years. I was actually hired by the World Resources Institute in Washington to work on the first carbon offset project in 1988. In terms of defining a carbon offset, one of the beauties, so to speak, of greenhouse gases, the silver lining of greenhouse gases, you can, when you put up a molecule of CO2 into the atmosphere, it can be anywhere in the planet in seven days. And therefore, if there's an option to reduce emissions on the other side of the planet, and you can do that very cheaply as compared to doing it in your factory, for example, then why not pay that person, that factory on the other side of the planet to reduce their emissions, then you are in a sense offsetting your emissions. And the atmosphere doesn't really see your emissions anymore. So carbon offsets have been around for quite some time, and they were actually key with these international climate agreements, such as the Kyoto Protocol, which mandated the wealthiest countries, reduced their greenhouse gas emissions. The trade was signed on the 11th of December 1997. Decided. The business community, in general, saw carbon offsets as a huge opportunity to comply with whatever policies and measures might be coming down the pike on climate change, much more cost effectively. We've seen a huge surge in companies making big proclamations about how they're going carbon neutral or zeroing out all of their carbon emissions. We're going to reduce our carbon footprint to net zero. Unilever is committing to net zero emissions. We can achieve a net zero emissions world. We began looking at these corporate claims of dramatically reduced emissions, and we noticed so many of these companies were using carbon offsets to achieve these aims, and as we begin to look at the carbon offset projects themselves, what we found is that the environmental benefits claimed by these companies.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4612,2022-10-19 17:00:16
16267," who achieved these aims. And as we begin to look at the carbon offset projects themselves, what we found is that the environmental benefits claimed by these companies are not actually what they seem to be. And as we sort of saw and spotted a number of these very aggressive carbon offset projects, which appeared to be generating inflated credits or bogus credits, we saw a number of them were associated with the Nature Conservancy. This surprised us. The Nature Conservancy is the world's biggest environmental group. They have about $1 billion a year in revenues. And they've been around for seven decades. They've preserved about 125 million acres of land. And they've done so many good works over the years. And they've been very strong in terms of working with corporate partners. The Nature Conservancy has taken a different approach, a very pragmatic and pro-business approach. They will not go out and criticize a big polluter. But they're very happy to work with them. Some might say that, well, that's selling out. But others would say, and those at the Nature Conservancy would say, these companies have deep pockets. They can help fund important preservation work. And we have absolutely no problem working with them on this stuff. So companies are very warm, and they've partnered with the Nature Conservancy for many years. And yeah, it definitely lends a sheen of credibility to these projects. Here is 20 NERI, the civilian Disney world this year. One, two, three, four. If you look at, for instance, Disney. It's a sprawling company with theme parks and cruise lines that burn up diesel fuel. They have office buildings and television studios that consume electricity. So these companies are trying to make major, major reductions in their carbon footprints. But it's very difficult to change these fundamental ways their businesses operate. So Disney has been a big buyer of carbon offsets that are orchestrated by the Nature Conservancy. One of the projects that they buy from is called Pennsylvania Riges. And that's a plot of land. Most of the land is actually about a three-hour drive outside of Philadelphia. Interestingly, this land, 3,000 of these acres, was actually acquired by the Nature Conservancy in the late 1990s. This land was imminently threatened. There was a pending logging contract on this land. So they do what they have done so well for all of these years, which is they go out. They raise money from local philanthropists and they go buy this land to protect it from developers and loggers. And at the time, according to an archive version of the Nature Conservancy's website, when they were proudly announcing this deal, they said these threats have been abated because of this acquisition by the Nature Conservancy. So it's really interesting now, fast forward two decades to earlier this year when they put forward this carbon project. And if you look through it, this land is a key part of that carbon project. And what they're now saying is this land is now, once again, imminently threatened. 72% of the trees are going to be cut within five years. Now, this is just astounding because this land is owned by the Nature Conservancy. They do not clear-cut land that they've bought through philanthropic donations. So this scenario that they've put forward to get carbon revenues is not really plausible. And what that means is when you have Disney coming in and buying these credits, when it eventually lowers its carbon footprint because of these credits, well, that won't be a credible or truthful claim by Disney. So this is an organization that truly understands the threat of the issue of climate change and is wanting to do its part to address this. However, in this situation, it just appears they're drive, which they've had for decades, to increase the amount of revenues that it can use for land preservation work.

16268," for decades to increase the amount of revenues that it can use for land preservation work. Nature Conservancy and many others see that carbon credits is a pot of money that they can tap into to further their own benevolent aims. But unfortunately, what this has resulted in is claims of climate progress that just aren't really happening. So the Nature Conservancy defends vigorously these deals and they and others will say, look, our projects are just following the rules that these registries set up. So some would also put some of the blame on the registries themselves because they're setting up the rules which allow these vapid projects to get up and sold. So we've reached out to all of the companies we mentioned in this story, including Disney, they didn't want to be interviewed for this story, but they all told us that, look, we have to rely on the experts out there and those experts they say are these carbon registries that have been set up. Most of these nature Conservancy deals are set up and sold on this exchange, it's called the American Carbon Registry. Now it's the oldest of these registries that allow voluntary carbon credits to be sold. They've been around since 1996. What these offset registries do is they set up rules and any carbon offset project has to follow those rules. But there's this tension that's always there. If the rules are too strict, then it's going to be very hard for carbon offset projects to get up and running. So there's this balance going on where the registries want rules that attract projects, but they don't want it to be so strict where it will disincentivize projects from getting listed. One of the challenges with designing carbon offset systems is that there are normally two people at the table. You have buyers and you have sellers. And to some extent you have policymakers, but the buyers and the sellers are really the ones with the expertise, with the incentive to really participate hard, make a lot of things happen. And the challenge there is is that both of them sort of want the same thing, or they're both happy with the same thing. They're happy with low cost offsets and a lot of them, because that works for their business model. You end up, though, with nobody really representing the atmosphere, so to speak, nobody's really representing the climate in those questions. And so the policies end up biasing the whole system. And you end up in sort of a race to the bottom. And that's what we've seen happen. You know, when it comes specifically to the topic of carbon offsets, I am a fan of carbon offsets in the sense that they can help mitigate climate change. They absolutely can. But, you know, if we're not going to do it correctly in a way that actually does help mitigate climate change, then it's nothing but a distraction. And, you know, after 30 years, you have to start wondering, is it really just a distraction? And that's really unfortunate, but that's where we are. Ultimately, what needs to be, what needs to happen is systemic change. You know, we're sort of nibbling around the edges with some of these different things. We need to change how we produce energy. We need to change how we transport ourselves. We need to change what and how we eat. You know, we need systemic change associated with transitioning to a low carbon economy. A lot of what we're doing today is not promoting systemic change. It's sort of trying to stick your thumb in the dike to preserve the system. And, at the end of the day, that can't really work.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4614,2022-10-19 17:08:50
16269,". The Hyperloop. There's a good chance you've heard the name by now. This is the Hyperloop system. It can take people hundreds of miles in minutes. The Hyperloop is a series of tubes that would transport people in pods at ultra high speeds over long distances. This is a remarkable new form of transportation that can whisk people from city to city in a flash. 29 minutes from New York to DC, 30 minutes from LA to San Francisco. For years we've been seeing these futuristic utopian renderings of some cross between a spaceship and a monogale. But lately the Hyperloop is becoming much more real. It was surreal to be even sitting inside a Hyperloop and just even more incredible to actually be riding down a track in something that was nothing more than a crazy idea six years before. Companies all around the world have been developing and testing the technology needed to propel passengers at speeds of over 1000 kilometers per hour. But for many, speed is only the first step to unlocking the full transformational effects of a new mode of transportation. Fast is what we just sort of take for granted in the Hyperloop world. It's the network of the aquifix that really deliver the benefit. And that opens up a completely different scale of economic opportunity. We've got planes, trains, automobiles and boats. We're getting around Earth. But what if there was a fifth mode? And I have a name for it, name for it which is called the Hyperloop. The Hyperloop? Hyperloop, yeah. In 2013 while riding high on the growing success of Tesla and SpaceX, entrepreneur Elon Musk released a white paper outlining the basic framework of the technology he called Hyperloop. The basic idea goes a little something like this. A tube reduces the air pressure to a near vacuum like environment. A Hyperloop pod is then suspended in the tube, usually by magnetic levitation. The whole pod can then be propelled forward. Because there's no traditional friction sources like air resistance or rolling friction that would push back against the pod, the Hyperloop is able to move at incredibly high speeds and do so fairly efficiently. Despite its futuristic name however, the general concept behind Hyperloop is actually pretty old. In fact, New York City's first attempt at an underground public transit system in the 1870s was based on a similar principle. The pneumatic transit system was short lived, however, only stretching one block and topping out at a rather leisurely 10 miles per hour. While Elon would make some 21st century improvements to this concept and bestow a very 21st century name, he wouldn't end up pursuing the technology itself. Instead, electing to focus his efforts on something a little bit deeper, literally digging the requisite tunnels by a his boring company. It would take another billionaire industrialist who dabbles in spaceflight. No way, not that one. Yeah, that's the one. After Richard Branson would make a large investment in the company Hyperloop 1, it would be renamed to Virgin Hyperloop. But we've always been trying to do as a company.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4615,2022-10-19 17:13:15
16270," After Richard Branson would make a large investment in the company Hyperloop 1, it would be renamed to Virgin Hyperloop. What we've always been trying to do as a company is show that this technology could work, that it could be made safe, and that ultimately it's something that's happening in the next couple of years, not the next 20 years. Josh Geigel is the co-founder and CEO of Virgin Hyperloop. In a familiar tech startup story, he's seen the project go from a garage to a large-scale testing facility outside of Las Vegas. So we started building the first kind of Hyperloop system in 2016. We've done a lot of work, about 500 tests that we've done on that over the last five years. And what we realize that we need to do is take that technology, show that it can be commercial, so drive the cost down, improve the efficiency, improve the performance. But the key thing is, you know, is actually making it approachable and safe for individuals. In order to do that, Josh, along with Virgin's head of passenger experience, Sara Luchia, bravely volunteer to take the inaugural ride. What her and I were realizing is like, we're the first two people sitting in a Hyperloop. The only type of people that have gone through this environment are in spaces, and there we are in just like normal clothes, because of the system, the safety of what we designed, we're free. Three, two, one. Launch. And then once we started going, you felt a bit of acceleration. We accelerated a little bit harder than we would in commercial, be like a sports car. Yeah. We got it to about 108 miles an hour on that test. And it's a short run. It's about 500 yards or so, and came to a stop. The test lasting only about 20 seconds and covering only a quarter of a mile at just over 100 miles per hour is a long way away from a true functioning Hyperloop. But as for optics, it's a crucial step for the future of funding. The number one question we got from investors or from project proponents, or just people in general, was like, is a Hyperloop safe? And what better way to show something is safe than by actually getting people on it? But convincing investors and governments that would likely be fronting some of the construction costs for an unproven technology is no easy task. First and foremost is the question of safety. Most people don't know how an airplane works, but yet they get on an airplane. They get on an airplane because it's faster than driving. And most importantly, they've probably gotten off of one before. They've seen someone get off of one before. And so what we set out to do was actually show that Hyperloop could be safe with two normal people, not astronauts, not adrenaline junkies or test pilots or anything like that. Two normal people getting on a Hyperloop, and then most importantly, those two people getting off. But beyond safety concerns, constructing Hyperlopes will undoubtedly require a significant capital investment to the estimated tune of around 60 million US dollars per kilometer of track. So a track from San Francisco to Los Angeles, for example, is likely to come with a price tag over $10 billion. And before large governments are willing to come in and front those costs, investors who are funding Hyperloop development must accept it as a long term mixture of technology and infrastructure investing. Investors that are used to short returns because you're developing apps or something to that effect, you know, those aren't the investors that really get excited about Hyperloop. What you start to see is the people that are looking at platform technologies, right? So this idea that because this smartphone existed, Uber could exist, right? So who are like the vander-built of this century? And that's the part where you're going to get a lot more knows than yeses. But those people that have the ability, that afford to stick it out to see the game-changing platform here, those are the people that we're looking for. And since we've done that passenger test, there has been a lot of interest that's really, oh, this is a lot sooner than I thought. Invisioning the ripple of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4616,2022-10-19 17:17:40
16271," Invisiting the ripple effects of what Hyperloop could achieve, though, is fairly challenging at this stage of development. It's fast, yes, but for point-to-point travel traditional maglev trains can move pretty fast as well. And outside of China, South Korea, and Japan, even those haven't seen much adoption elsewhere due to the high costs and questionable profitability. The Shanghai Line in China, for example, loses around $100 million every year. Hyperloop companies, however, believe they can offer something different than traditional railway lines. My name's Alan James, and as far as I know, I'm the only guy on the planet who's written the government-level business case for 300 kmh conventional high-speed rail, 500 kmh maglev and 1,000 kmh Hyperloop. It's fundamentally about moving people from where they are, to where they want to go, when they want to make those journeys, and doing it in much smaller numbers. So pod designs for Hyperloop range from 12 to 28 seats, typically. Why are they small? It's because small enables the network to operate flexibly. And a great example of that is the East West strategic route across the north of England, from Liverpool to Manchester to Leeds. So to get from Liverpool via Manchester to Leeds by train is just short of two hours today. It'll probably take you two hours driving as well in average traffic conditions. That result is those three city regions remain three separate entities. Liverpool Manchester Leeds, there's very little commuting traffic between those urban areas. Hyperloop absolutely changes that from the ground up. Liverpool to Manchester is five or six minute journey. Manchester to Leeds is also a five or six minute journey. What effectively does is create a single super city economy. In this vision, the Hyperloop acts a little more like a highway, where pods have fixed destinations and don't need to stop along the way. Meaning you can travel on a Hyperloop network from say Liverpool to Leeds, while the pod behind you travels from Liverpool to Manchester. And if that Metro Hyperloop network is connected to other networks from the same location, you could travel from Liverpool to Paris or Liverpool to Amsterdam, all without making a single stop. For passengers, for business, for leisure, that is utterly transformational. For high value freight and logistics, it's equally transformation. But critically, if you do a Hyperloop network at scale, you begin to deliver massively significant carbon savings to it. A multi-regional Hyperloop network could become a replacement for both short haul passenger and cargo flights and traditional ground transportation, both of which are significant carbon producers. One Hyperloop-connected distribution hub, perhaps at an airport that is predominantly used for international air freight, replacing maybe 10, 12, 15 distributed road hubs. It takes a lot of polluting and inefficient truck haulage off the roads, that itself means roads gain extra capacity. Hyperloups will still need to use electricity to both move pods and maintain the near- vacuum environment and the tube. Proponents of the technology believe that this can be done by using renewable sources, including a combination of solar panels and battery technology that could be used along the Hyperloop itself. But even with all multipliers of time and carbon emission savings that a Hyperloop network may provide, the investment capital required to actually build such a network becomes even more economically and politically daunting. Britain doesn't mean spending billions on day one.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4617,2022-10-19 17:21:51
16272," Capital required to actually build such a network becomes even more economically and politically daunting. Committing doesn't mean spending billions on day one. Committing means how do we phase it? One company in the Netherlands is working to develop that technology and perhaps more importantly, the international coalition needed to make the Hyperloop network a reality. So we are here in Europe's first full scale Hyperloop test facility where we can already prove every conceptual technology of the Hyperloop. This is Tim Houter, a co-founder and CEO of Heart Hyperloop, headquartered in the city of Delft. And while this testing tube might not seem as large as others, inside is a key technology to create the on and off ramp type infrastructure of a Hyperloop network. That is a lane switch. That's something we can already test here. You can actually see it here. Then the track is diverged from one track into two. It makes it possible to eventually split up the Hyperloop track into two sections. And in that sense, you can create a complete Hyperloop network. But in the end, it will make it possible to travel for example over a whole continent and take Europe for example, with the same ease as you can now travel with a metro in the city. The nice thing about this magnetic levitation system that we have developed is that there's absolutely zero moving components in the track. So for example, if you have to do a lane switch, all you do is that the tube basically splits up. And statically, the tracks also split up. And whenever the vehicle enters a switch, it either pulls itself to the right with its magnets or it pulls itself to the left with its magnets. Lane switching on traditional rail requires the physical movement of the rail. Even modern magnetic levitation tracks use lane switching techniques in order to transfer trains from one track to another. And this is a very crucial element because this is the thing that limits the capacity and in the end, the usefulness of the real network. Because the moment that a track is switching, that means that at that moment you are creating an unsafe environment for the trains behind it. So you need a lot of space between trains. In a Hyperloop because you have no moving components in the track, all the vehicles can be much closer to each other. You can achieve a very high frequency and basically have vehicles moving and merging in and out of the network very much like a highway. For now though, Hart's physical testing has been limited by the size of their tube. Because the test track is only 30 meters long, they haven't tested this lane switch at speeds greater than 20 kilometers per hour. However, the company is working to build a new test site where it plans to increase that testing speed to 300 kilometers per hour. We're now in a phase where we have proven most of the most important technologies in the test facilities that we already have. And we have also demonstrated the viability and the feasibility of a network. If you look at all the top systems that it consists of, most of those are proven systems. We already demonstrated in lab conditions. So we don't really believe that the technology itself is going to be the biggest challenge. Because for all Hyperloop companies out there, actually building a Hyperloop system requires more than just a good product. We're talking about the safety aspects. We're talking about integration into the environment. We're talking about social aspects. Do people feel comfortable traveling in such a system? So it's about all these different aspects. And the complexity is really getting all the different stakeholders that are relevant and that they need to contribute to bring this to market to get them all following the same roadmap. Okay.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4618,2022-10-19 17:26:20
16273," In order to help build this coalition of private and public interest in hyperlip development, heart in 2018 partnered with other hyperlip companies from Europe and Canada, the goal was to define, establish and standardize the framework to regulate hyperlip systems. Right now we are working with all the hyperlip developers together in setting up the first, let's say, a structure for starting the standards drafting. One of the most important goals for heart is interoperability, which is essentially making sure the different systems can communicate with each other. Interoperability is so important because what we want to achieve is actually have this seamless travel experience. So you don't want to end up, for example, going from Madrid to Paris and then switching because you need to use a different technology to get, for example, to Amsterdam. The idea being that as companies around Europe create the first commercial hyperlip tracks between individual cities, one day those can all be connected to a larger network. Everyone that believes that hyperlip is a future transport system also realizes that there is a need to have this network because that's where hyperlip thrives. Hyperlip is such a huge project, it's definitely not something that you can do in your own or as a single company. So you need to do it with a lot of other companies, you need to have the governments. I think in that sense the biggest challenge that we've encountered is to really get all the required parties together to take the steps in development and in commercial implementation. First, the next plan is to build the European Hyperlip Center, an open testing facility which will include a 2.6 kilometer test track, and the company hopes to test travel speeds there at up to 700 kilometers per hour. Virgin Hyperlip is also racing to construct the first commercial hyperlip route, with projects and various states of development in India, Saudi Arabia and the United States. Recently the company announced plans to build a Hyperlip certification center in West Virginia, which will include a 6 mile long test track. Proving the technology here will be crucial if Hyperlip networks can find a home among infrastructure investments that the Biden administration hopes to make. The idea that there's multiple Hyperlip companies, I think is a redeeming aspect in the business. People really want to see something happen, so having multiple people move forward is good for that. I was struck when Josh and Sarah rode the pod. Two or three of the major outlets used the phrase, we now have a new mode of transport. And although all of that technology had existed before those two human beings rode it, it was the moment at which those two human beings traveled that short distance down the tube that in popular imagination Hyperlip became a mode of transport. The metaphor I use with my team is that the Wright brothers refers, but none of us fly on Wright brothers' airlines anymore. If you don't continue to innovate, you're not going to be around and so we'll continue to be at the forefront of building Hyperlip. Back in 2013, Elon had an idea. I think the difference now in 2021 is some brilliant engineers have spent real time grinding out the details. And I thoroughly expect the next three to five years to be decisive.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4619,2022-10-19 17:30:32
16274," 🎵 🎵 This week, how hydrogen can transform our energy usage. We'll look at why the universe's most abundant element could be a game changer in the climate revolution. Hydrogen technologies are not new. They are used in other sectors. We use them in space on our rockets. And we don't need the laws of physics to change to be able to use hydrogen on our planes. From iron ore to green hydrogen, one of Australia's richest men tells us about his pivot to sustainable energy. Let's take action. It's practical. It's implementable. Let's do it now. Plus, the hydrogen revolution. We'll speak with the CEO of Italian Utility Serms NAM about his new book and how green hydrogen could be competitive within five years. Cossacks are coming down and people are waking up to the fact that it's the only way to decarbonize certain sectors. From Bloomberg's Global headquarters in New York, I'm Kaylee Lines, and this is Bloomberg Green. It's a new year, so here at Bloomberg Green we're highlighting new solutions in the fight against climate change. And one of those is as old as the universe itself. Hydrogen. It's the simplest element around, but could well be a game changer when it comes to turning around our dependence on fossil fuels. Today, hydrogen is used in the chemicals industry to produce petroleum products. It's also starting to be used in steel production and industry under a lot of pressure to decarbonize. But it has far more uses as well, from powering cars to heating our homes. And Bloomberg New Energy Finance sees a seismic shift in the sector in the next ten years as green hydrogen squeezes out dirtier alternatives. So-called gray hydrogen dominates today. But as renewable electricity gets cheaper and more accessible, so will green hydrogen. In this week's edition of Bloomberg Green, we'll explore what this push into hydrogen means for tackling climate change. We'll hear from Australian billionaire Twiggy Forest about his pivot from Iron War II hydrogen, and we'll also speak with the CEO of Italian utility company Svamm about his book, The Hydrogen Revolution. But first, what are we using hydrogen for? And why does it actually matter? Christine Lee Edwards explains. Hydrogen, the most plentiful element in the universe. On Earth, we find it mostly bonded to oxygen in the form of water, or in other gases known as hydrocarbons.

16275," Anyone else who produces any other rubbish, any other ugly disc looking there, it's like, why is global warming accelerating if anything you're saying is true? And then you know, actually it's greenwashing. Yeah, but there's a lot of greenwashing because I keep on being told it's a transition. We can't just, you know, make the transition at a click of a finger. So what are we doing wrong? What can we do better? I don't remember the personal computer having to transition the typewriter. I really don't remember that. I don't remember the smartphone having to transition the pocket calculator and the old landline. You know, it's transition line is complete rubbish. The light got put to it. Two days ago when JCB, a really loved British company, you're in every right for the country to be proud of JCB. And Fortescue, I think a bit of a similar reputation, fantastic track record, everything super well from Fortescue, huge balance sheet, super strong. When those two companies got together and agreed at 79 billion USD on a green with per atom. Right? Then that's a real wake up call to say hang on. Greenhagen is obviously commercial now. You know, every other form of fossil fuel, fossil fuel hydrogen, you know, it can compete with it on price. It can probably lose on price. But what we know, it is cooking the planet. And only green hydrogen zero methane, zero carbon in the supply chain. Don't worry about the molecules in the supply chain. But at the moment, we're not even phasing out coal if you look at the G20 company cave. So we have a long way to go to talk about only using green hydrogen. Yeah. So look, I have a call, which I'd like to make now, that the world should not fund any more coal-fired power stations, coal-fired projects. Ever wish you'd wind them down as quickly as possible, because they are cooking the planet just like grey and greenhagen. It's cooking the planet. Yeah. You know, you're having to not matter when you're going to electricity is releasing 10 to 16 times more carbon. Right. Let them on the methane, which is worse than it is hydrogen. Okay. So we've just got to stop doing things which are self-harming under the guise of greenhagen. So why are leaders so slow? Even if you look at the appetite for eSG investments, they're growing exponentially. So are emissions. So where are we allocating capital? Okay. So take the recent G20. There was probably a reason why there wasn't a strong action coming out of the G20, because people were not aware that major transactions between large companies were taking place now on greenhagen, that actually this pollution-free, all the way through the supply chain fuel, has now been transacted at multi-billion dollar scale. I think that none that I don't believe any sovereign leader or any energy minister or climate change minister could not take ultra-seriously. That greenhagen is never here to stay. It's broken through. The history has been made. It will never go back. Okay. What is the one thing that you would tell leaders today, and business leaders? How do we transition faster than what we are now, because we're at real risk of missing our targets? So that's really simple. Do you stop funding? Do you stop subsidizing? Do you stop using money into possible? Right. It could be carbon sequestration. It could be fuel re-batch, it could be anything. Hundreds of billions of dollars getting ashed while we ash the planet on possible fuel subsidies. Because we haven't had that renewable energy, we haven't had that greenhagen. It's kind of been pushed down, pushed down. It's also excuses, oh never be commercial. Never be supplied with the quantities we needed. Now we know it. Let's take action. It's practical. It's implementable. Let's do it now. Okay. If we do it now, is there going to be a shock to the energy system? Is there going to be a shock actually to economically? And is it worth not talking about transition, just going from A to B? It's a fantastic person. A to B is the solution. Let possible fuels do what possible fuels do. Just burn their coal, burn their oil, burn their gas, at least they're pumping up carbon and methane into the atmosphere. Honestly. Well, not that honest, because they don't mention methane, which is 90 times worse than carbon. But at least the carbon is being done honestly. Encourage the greenhagen.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4621,2022-10-19 17:42:57

Encourage the green hydrogen sector to come in really fast. It's there. There's renewable power all over the world. We know how to make electrolyzes much cheaper. 25% of the original cost. We know how to do that now. We don't have an excuse to get into it. Does it need to be cheaper than oil and fossil fuel for it to be viable worldwide? Well right now it's okay so let's just swallow that bit of financial data. Right now it is cheaper and it's getting more check. It's the high fuel you know. It's declining in value. You don't have enough of it right to power the world. Yes that's only because we haven't had policy support. We had policy support at five, ten years ago. It would be everywhere you'd see the global warming budget start to come down. Now we've got five or ten years to make a huge difference. And it policy leaders all over the world to appreciate now okay. Big business is transacting with green hydrogen in multi-billion dollar agreements. We now know it's here and it's here to stay that's spread everywhere. Coming up on the program the hydrogen revolution. We'll speak with the CEO of Italian utility firm Snam about his new book. And why he thinks green hydrogen will be competitive in just five years. Plus how are airlines working to become more sustainable? We'll look at how Airbus plans to step up in the climate fight. This is Bliberg Green. From Bloomberg's world headquarters in New York I'm Kayley Lines and this is Bliberg Green. What will the world look like in 2050? Will global temperatures have stabilized? Electric vehicles be abundant? And solar and wind power homes around the world? According to Marco Alvera the CEO of Italian Energy Company Snam, that vision of the future could be a reality. And he says that hydrogen will pay its way. As he tells it in his new book The Hydrogen Revolution, Alvera's moment of reckoning came in November 2018 when he tasked the Snam scenarios team with studying how Europe could reduce its CO2 emissions to zero by 2050.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4622,2022-10-19 17:47:02
16277," Alvera's moment of reckoning came in November 2018 when he tasked the Snam scenarios team with studying how Europe could reduce its CO2 emissions to zero by 2050. Looking through the results of the study, Alvera said he was struck by how much hydrogen was in Europe's energy mixed by that year. Beyond the abundance of hydrogen, the Snam model also predicted that it would be the cheapest form of decarbonized energy for many sectors, and that it could be cheaper than today's prices for oil, coal, and nuclear power. Our Maria today spoke with Alvera at COP26. It's happening all very fast. We see the cost of hydrogen coming down a lot. Hydrogen will play a big role in the energy mix. I don't know if it's going to be 15 or 25% of a fully decarbonized energy system, but it's going to be big. Cossera coming down and people are waking up to the fact that it's the only way to decarbonize certain sectors, so-called hard-to-abate sectors. And you say it's the only way in the cost of coming down. Where do you see prices moving? Because a lot of the reticence of times has to do with the pricing. That some market will still not have the cheapest option on the market. So when I was first working in hydrogen in 2004, it was costing $1,000 per megawatt hour. $2,000,000, $600, $100,000, and we see it going down to 50 and five years time, and to going down to $25 per megawatt hour in the next 10 years or so. Which is a quarter of word as today. That's really because renewable energy, and we're talking green hydrogen here. Renewable energy costs are falling, but the cost of making the electrolyzer, which is the kit that you use to convert solar or wind energy and water into hydrogen, the cost of this kit is falling a lot because it doesn't really exist on an industrial scale. So as we build up capacity, we industrialize it, we standardize it, and we squeeze costs out. That's really the cost trajectory. And for that, of course, you need demand, however, for governments and also institutions, to kind of buy into this idea that it is a future and we want to invest in creating infrastructure. What are they telling you? When you speak to governments, when you speak to officials, are they keen on this? They're very keen. So the Department of Energy shares our view in the states of getting to below $1.00 a kilo, which is $25.00 a megawatt hour. The European Union has hydrogen strategy, which is very clear, and several member states have the same. Chile wants to export a lot of hydrogen. China's big on hydrogen. Australia is very big on hydrogen. Japan is blending already hydrogen. So I would say the world is now really focused on this because it's the only way to store energy for a long period of time economically, to convert it into either a liquid or a gas. And of course, you talk about the price, but the other big component is the volume, you know, how big can you go? Where do you see that on a time scale? So wherever it's sunny or windy, you can produce very cheap hydrogen eventually. And so compared to oil and gas, which are concentrated in few parts of the world, it's going to be very democratic from that point of view. So every sunny place, every desert, every ocean wind can be turned into hydrogen that we can put on ships in pipes and really start trading it around the world. So it's going to happen a lot faster than a lot of people think. So and will you say a lot faster? What is that in time? As they said, $50, which is essentially oil parity within five years. And then depending on how quickly we ramp it up after that, we could get to $25, which is coal parity before the end of the day. And in big scale. In big scale. Because once you get to coal parity, that's the only way we're going to get China and India to stop burning new coal. We have businesses in China and in India. And I see a lot of hydrogen development, a lot of renewable development in both countries. The India announcement was incredibly strong on 2030. Some people were upset about the 2017 at zero deadline. But when it comes to 30, he announced a big, big commitment to get the 50% renewables. Are you surprised by it? I was surprised that they would make it so explicit. And even the net zero is a big thing for them. And so I think it will happen faster than 2070 because of the falling cost of renewable and hydrogen. India's burning 80 gigawatt of oil of diesel to keep the lights on. So there's an immediate opportunity there. And we're very interested in working that country. And with regards to China, perhaps the fact that we haven't really seen them active, I guess the diplomats are working on this, but we haven't really seen the leadership. It's going to be technology. It's going to be industry. I think China has committed to a net zero, which is very important. At the G20, China was clearly behind the one and a half degrees. So I think a lot has been achieved between the G20 and COP. And I think what's really important is to see in the coming years, how quick it's in our hands to make part of this happen in five years or could otherwise happen in 1520 years. It's about building the project. The capital is there.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4623,2022-10-19 17:51:51
16278," The coming years, how quick, it's in our hands to make part of this happen in five years or could otherwise happen in 15, 20 years. It's about building the project. The capital is there. We saw how many trillions of dollars are already committed. What's missing is really the projects and that's where companies like us step in. Marco Alvera, CEO of Snam there speaking with our Maria Tadeo. Let's turn out to the aviation industry. That's a big contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions and it's under pressure to change that. In October, the International Air Transport Association, a trade body representing airlines, approved a target of achieving net zero emissions by 2050. To achieve that, many airlines in the US and Europe are looking to buy sustainable aviation fuel made from renewable sources like used vegetable oil. Initiatives like these are pushing plane makers to come up with some radical new aircraft that will eventually cater to our growing appetite for travel without hurting the environment. We took a look at how Airbus, the world's number two aircraft manufacturer, is stepping up to the challenge. How long until we can fly emission free? Airbus says it's more confident by the day it can be done by its 2035 target. Airbus a CEO spoke about its ambitions for hydrogen powered planes at the company's summit in France. The physics works. Hydrogen technologies are not new. They are used in other sectors. We use them in space on our rockets and we don't need the laws of physics to change to be able to use hydrogen on our planes. So every day we become more confident. But we think we need to have a plane. We need to have the right fuels, the hydrogen available in the right quantity at the right place at the right time and we need the regulations to be ready. So we really need the work and the collaboration of many people on the globe to make it happen on time. But it could be a long way to until green passenger jets go mainstream. Larger aircraft with more than 150 seats are not expected to feature globally until about 2050. That means manufacturers and airlines today are undergrowing pressure to ramp up short-term innovations to cut their carbon. In the long term, meeting the ambitious plans for so-called green hydrogen means building a giant industry almost from scratch. To make that happen, British airline easy jets as among those saying governments need to get involved and fast. Aviation's emissions over the last three decades leading up to the pandemic grew by about 80% to over 1 gigatund and that's projected to double by 2050. According to Bloomberg NEF, about half of the airlines with the largest global market share have set net zero targets by that same date nearly three decades away. Coming up from Blue Sky projects to the bottom line, we'll speak with our Bloomberg NEF expert Meredith Annex and dig into their models about how hydrogen fits into the future energy mix. This is Bloomberg NEF.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4624,2022-10-19 17:55:41
16279," [♪ INTRO MUSIC cryptocurrency music is playing From Bloomberg's World Headquarters in New York, I'm Katelyn Lines and this is Bloomberg Green. We're also doing a fifth spring in Meredith Annax, our Bloomberg N-E-F Hydrogen Specialists to talk more about how hydrogen could change the energy landscape. So Meredith, what place do you think hydrogen is likely to have in the future energy mix globally? Hydrogen is this incredible solution for us as we look to decarbonize because it's a perfect solution in areas that are hard to electrify. So we're really like to think about hydrogen playing a role in things like heavy industry, especially where you need a feedstock, as well as energy source. things like dispatchable power, long-called transport, maybe even shipping and aviation. That sounds great that it can be used for such diverse industries. At the end of the day, though, how much is this going to cost? Well, that's the amazing thing about hydrogen. Because depending on how you make it, it can actually see significant costs of clients in the future. So when we're talking about clean hydrogen, we're usually mean green hydrogen produced for renewable electricity. And in that case, your hydrogen is almost as cheap as the renewables that are used to bake it. So if you're in a place with really good renewable resources, you'll be able to have cheaper hydrogen. But even in places with less good resources, we think that hydrogen can be cheaper than a dollar per kilogram, which is the price of unabated hydrogen today, and around $8 per million BTUs for those who prefer to think in energy units. And that can be achieved anywhere in the world by 2050, we believe. All right, so let's talk about kind of the pros and cons list. I don't know where cost fits into that. But what are the advantages to hydrogen over other renewables? And then what are the drawbacks? Yeah, main advantage is the fact that hydrogen can serve roles that electrons struggle with. And that's things like seasonal storage, for instance, or just anything where you need storeability, where your electrons are harder to store, hydrogen is going to be easier. That also leads to a downside though, because hydrogen is less energy dense than the usual things that we use for storeable energy today, like coal or oil or natural gas. So you will need more volume of storage to handle the same amount of energy. Let's talk about the viability as well and how it may differ in different geographies. What is your view on that? Yeah, so for green hydrogen again from renewable electricity, really places with the best renewable resources, things like Latin America or the Middle East, even southern Europe have really, really good potential for producing hydrogen. And then when you're looking at blue hydrogen, which is produced from natural gas or coal with carbon-caption storage, we do see that becoming more expensive than green hydrogen in the future, especially as renewable electricity costs come down. But that can be a viable option in places like the US Gulf Coast or Russia, where you've got good geological storage for the carbon, as well as ample natural gas that's quite cheap. All right, great breakdown. Thank you so much to our Meredith Annex, our Bloomberg NEF Hydrogen Specialist. And of course, you can get more from the Bloomberg NEF team on the terminal and online. And they've recently done a podcast called Hydrogen 101 as part of its switched on series.

It's Wednesday Credit good anchor and markets correspondent at Bloomberg and our interactive broker studio So to his Molly Smith glued to her glue her blue bird has me speak. She's economics that are at Bloomberg news I'm just starting to see the headlines cross. What do you got for us? So it seems like on the margin some of this should be actually received pretty positively when I Zoned right in on the prices section of the beige book here and looks like some of the Fed districts who contribute to this report reported a cooling in Some in some easing sorry in inflationary pressures Whoa, wait a second easing up inflationary pressures. Hold on there. It's still very elevated So yeah, but just some of the things that you know We look like what jumped out to me at first is that maybe some firms are not having as much pricing power in the past six weeks As they have before and having more difficulty pushing through cost to consumers as these customers are pushing back So that seems to be one of the factors for lower inflation expectations going forward So that as a whole should be taken extremely positively. Yeah, and here's another headline from an outlooks grew more pessimistic Amid demand concerns all right, let's come in because I am seeing a some reaction on the equity So a little bit of a pair of some of the losses that you're seeing the SMB 500 I would argue a Molly's take is is a hundred percent accurate She went straight to the prices section I went straight to the labor market section because that's the one that interests me here This idea that and I don't want stuff on your toes Molly so bear with me But the idea here that they reported a cooling in labor demand in some District so you are seeing that theme come from the prices section as well But they're also said there were scattered mentions of hiring phrases a lot of these labor market conditions remaining tight But you are seeing some hesitation in anticipation of this massive economic downturn I think although it's good news that there's perhaps a little bit of easing in the labor market because we want that right It's not great that it's in kind of a state of fear almost of a recession So a little bit of a mix take there But I think from a market perspective any signs of an easing labor market will also be interpreted as good news But look this also still isn't a glowing review of the economy Or at least where we're headed, which is I think why you're not seeing a bigger move in the stock market and No move in the bond market and remember it's anecdotal It's could go along with the data that we get from various Organizations and agencies that bring us this data another headline expectations were for inflation to generally moderate I don't know Molly Smith it does seem like I look at these anecdotal headlines from the beige book and I see financial conditions tightening You know, it's tough to square all this with obviously the CPI report",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4627,2022-10-19 18:08:58
16282," Does seem like I look at these anecdotal headlines from the beige book and I see financial conditions tightening? You know, it's tough to square all this with obviously the CPI report that we got last week Which shows that inflation is not moderating yet And I was actually just listening to Minneapolis Fed President Neil Cushkari before I came over here today and he was just talking about how he has not seen Any any evidence yet that core inflation is moderating and that is by far the most concerning aspect of Policy for him right now and that there will be no consideration of pausing Hiking policy until he sees any comforting evidence that core inflation is moderating So that on the flip side is very hawkish businesses reporting mixed pricing power And we know as the earnings come in right creamy that we're seeing some companies that definitely are pricing power others You know that are talking about you know being very sensitive to sensitive to it and and feeling pressure So we've seen that in the likes of PNG for example proctor and gamble coming out with earnings today saying look People are still spending despite consumer sentiment being low and here's perhaps why take a look at this other headline I don't know about you, but I still buy toothpaste Everyone's lost but take a look at this other headline because the prices are still higher And that's what PNG is able to do that. They're still able to pass on the cost of the consumers Perhaps because as the Fed says in the beige book that wage growth is widespread some is easing but more growth is expected So even though real wages are still negative they are still growing I wonder how much of the wealth effect that has to do and the Fed also noting in the beige book is well that yes While you're talking about you know spending on essentials like toothpaste Carol everyone's thankfully buying their toothpaste Still by discretionary spending a bit more different and that's where they're noting retail spending a bit flat and Auto dealers pushing but having slower sales and which you would also expect from higher Interst rates and difficulty getting carloads right there's certain things that are out there Like this is what we talked about with Allison Shregg of that certain things are sticky wages, right? You kind of make a deal and it's gonna stay in place for a year or if you have a contract or whatever It is same thing with rents, right? They stay in you know in place for a certain time So some of these things are sticky some of these other things Molly can move around much more quickly and the Fed did mention About rents and leasing remaining very high here though noting how Higher mortgage rates have definitely hurt home sales Transactions but that of course, you know helps buoy the rental market when homes are so unaffordable people think about renting instead So that's where you set where housing inflation also operates with a lag Critic trade still the same just got 20 seconds. Yeah trade still the same you are seeing some of those losses get paired But still down about eight tons of 1% on the S&P 500 and bond market just where it was before Yes, still 411 on the 10-year yields.

Well it's seen as a blow to the special prosecutor assigned to probe the FBI Investigation into the Trump campaign the business analyst who was the primary source for a 2016 dossier on then candidate Donald Trump has been acquitted Igor Donchenko was found not guilty of lying about the suspected identity of a Russian source He said called him anonymously to report a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin It's a loss for special counsel John Durham who was tapped by the Trump administration to investigate the FBI's inquiry And who personally prosecuted the case at trial even so the trial revealed the tales of the FBI probe that critics say Reveal corruption at the agency in Washington",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4628,2022-10-19 18:13:16

There with World of National News, Carol Maser, along with Tim Stenevich, live in Arboral and Bargain Interactive Broker, studio streaming on YouTube and this story, man, caught my attention. It's a really deep dive into what is China's underground market for semiconductors. Yeah, worldwide shortage has spawned a gray market for semiconductors, where chips that maybe out of date or stolen can sell for vastly inflated prices. It's really interesting because there are semiconductors that are required for microcontroller units, for vehicles. We've heard stories about Ford having to sleeve cars in lots here in the US because they can't get semiconductor chips. What's it looking like around the world, especially in a place like China, where they're having trouble getting chips, too? Whenever there's trouble, right? There's a way, but it's often kind of around the rules, around the existing structure, and then it becomes an underground market. So what's been formed is what they call it kind of a massive gray market, in a fake form populated by hundreds of middlemen and riddled with second hand or out of date chips where the cost of acquiring just one can run to 500 times. It's a original price. Situation is most to keep with chips destined for cars, Tim, like you were just talking about, which are becoming more, as you know, like computers on wheels, as the industry is revolutionized. The US's recent chip technology export curbs will only make the shortage worse, encouraging underground activity. This is coming from the head of China's major car associations, saying that. But what happens if those chips are not up to snuff? In scores of interviews with more than a dozen people involved in this world, all of whom declined to be identified because of the sensitive nature of what they're doing, Bloomberg news piece together how the complicated network operates. Some standard chips have so infiltrated the supply chain many brokers say that car quality and worse safety is at risk, should your fraudulent chip fail in the ABS brake module of a vehicle, for example, the consequences could be deadly. Just hope the QC line is working and working well. The gray market mainly takes place online and we check groups and over email, but trades also sometimes happen at physical marketplaces like the SEG Sage Electronics Market Plaza. That is in Shenzhen, where brokers have been known to bring chip samples in NAPSACs to secure orders. And apparently regulators are noticing, go to Bloomberg.com, it is an incredible read.

Carol Maser, along with Tim Steneveck. I got to say, I had to just do a presentation for some of my, and we were talking about Bloomberg. I said, one of the things I really do love about Bloomberg is how wide and deep we are in terms of scope, in terms of news coverage. You can go anywhere in the globe and find a reported talk about who have boots on the ground and really under a, understand a story. And Lucky for us, we have a colleague who's normally in Hong Kong, but she's in New York this week. We're very pleased to have with us, Sophia Hortekosta. She's chief China markets correspondent for Bloomberg News. She's based her Hong Kong bureau. But she's with us right now in Bloomberg Interactive Brokers studio. She's been here in New York for a little over a week. Sophia, good to have you with us this afternoon. We want to talk China markets. We want to talk about what happened over the weekend in China. But first, I want to update from you about what things are like in Hong Kong right now, because there's been some big changes over the last couple of years. Sure. I actually moved there almost five years ago now. It's coming up to five years in January. And what, what a period it's been. I mean, when I moved there, 2018, Hong Kong was kind of the wild east as it were. And it was the freest city in China. It is at the end of the day still a Chinese city, even though it has its own independent structures.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4630,2022-10-19 18:22:37
16285," Iled east as it were, and it was the freest city in China. It is at the end of the day still a Chinese city, even though it has its own independent structures, independent systems. And the erosion of those independent systems has really, really come into play in the five years that I've been there. But also, and we were talking about this during the break, I mean, COVID-0 was such a huge thing in Hong Kong. And when I say was, I should say, I should really say is. I mean, you still have to wear a mask every single day, wherever you are even outside in Hong Kong. So, I mean, for me here, it's wild that you can just walk around the street and show your face and to see people smiling. Right. But really, I mean, that was... Well, it'll be smiling in New York. We're all smiling. I saw people smile. Maybe I just smile at everyone and people smile back. Maybe they think I'm a wheeler. Where is she from? Why did she say hi to me? Yeah, exactly. No, but really... You look or smile. OK. Yeah, Carol's not... You're from New Jersey. But no, but really, I mean, my point is that, yes, the protests were hard on the city, the aftermath of that national security law that came into play in 2020. That was obviously very, very controversial. But it was really this year that you saw people that just throwing in the talents saying, I want to leave. I mean, February, you had the stories that you heard here of parents being separated from their children. That's all true. That happened. I mean, you would go into the hospital system if you tested positive for COVID. And you really had to think about maybe not leaving for at least 50 days because you had to test negative so many times. So people did leave and a lot of them didn't come back. The brain drain was extremely severe. So Sophia, when we think about the next tenure of President G, and there's a lot of news that came out over the weekend, we've been talking about it all week. So this will be his third term. What kind of China is it going forward? You know, coming after decades of being a market that everybody wanted to be a part of and to be able to tap into that, you know, growing domestic home base, the 1 billion plus population. So how should global investors think of China going forward? I think there was a lot of expectation and hope that during the party of Congress, there would be any kind of signal, any kind of signal, or because, you know, when it comes to China, it's all about signals. It's never straightforward reading what's happening in China that there would be some kind of pivot from Xi Jinping or at least a government that was more pragmatic and more focused on growth and again, looking at the economy instead of, you know, prioritizing Xi Jinping thought. But what's... Instead, they delayed, right, GDP, which was kind of like, blew your mind. Yeah, so there is kind of a, there might be a boring explanation to that. People actually need to physically sign off on those reports and there might be a COVID-19 element there that the people who needed to stamp them couldn't physically do that. But obviously, it adds to the whole noise and the whole uncertainty around where China's parties are in terms of growth. And what Xi Jinping really made clear in the past two years is that communist, the communist party's policies. And when we say the communist party nowadays, it really does mean Xi Jinping. I mean, he's not called the chairman of everything for no reason. And that trumps everything. It trumps economic growth. It trumps pragmatism. It trumps, you know, profits by corporates and by the Chinese biggest companies. And it trumps the markets. I mean, the sell-off that we saw in Chinese financial markets, not just this year, but last year, importantly, that was all down to policy. And that's something that I think would never happen in a place like the US, you know, if Biden saw financial markets tanking because of policies, you know, that his government brought out, there would be a kind of rollback. And we're seeing that in the UK now. I mean, those trusses rolling back policies because of the market reaction. Xi Jinping didn't do that and didn't do that, really stuck to those damaging policies for two years. But at the same time, and really, on Forexic, I'm about a minute left, but there was also the same time policies that they said certain, I guess, Chinese regulators were talking about ways to prop up the Chinese equity market. So sometimes it feels like mixed signals. It's mixed signals. I mean, it is kind of invest as much as you like from China is.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4631,2022-10-19 18:26:21
16286," The Chinese equity market. So sometimes it feels like mixed signals. It's mixed signals. I mean, it is kind of invest as much as you like from, you know, China is still, does still want foreign capital inside its markets. It still wants to roll out the red carpet for Goable Capital to come into China. It needs that capital. But it's very much on China's terms. That capital can't go everywhere. It can't go, you know, to kind of big tech or to streaming companies, for example. It needs to go where Xi Jinping sees are the biggest policy priorities for the future. And that's green. That's high tech. That's AI. That's chip making China wants that kind of growth. And not the, you know, the kind of big tech or property market growth of the past decade. It's really fascinating. Hey, just have like 15 seconds less. So if you do ever envision a COVID-0 policy going away or easing at all? Well, it can't us forever is my conclusion, but it can last for a very long time.

All right, you are listening and watching Bloomberg Business Week on this Wednesday. We're going to continue our kind of deep dive into the Fed because don't forget we're going to hear from Jim Bullard of the St. Louis Fed in just about a half an hour or so. But in the meantime, our Chris Anci writing about Fed Hikes, not yet packing an economic punch. This phrase, long and variable lags between policy actions and their effects showing up in the economy. We're going to dive into that in just a few minutes. Is it a long and winding road? That's what it sounds like to me. I'm going to get Tim to sing and it kills me today. Let's get to Charlie Pellick as we got less than 90 minutes to go in the trade. Hey, Charlie. Well, hello there. We're looking at a down day on Wall Street with a Dow, the S&P, NASDAQ, all in the red. And we've got the 10 year. Right now, 10 year is yielding 4.11% the 2 year, 4.54% of before we get to U.S. equity markets. A number of political developments, indeed fast moving developments out of the United Kingdom. Chief Whip Wendy Morton has resigned from Prime Minister Liz Trust's government following a brutal fight to contain a parliamentary rebellion, this according to two sources. Earlier today, Trust fired home secretary Swela Braverman for what was described as a national security breach. Trust is named Grant Shaps as home secretary. So the Dowdy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4633,2022-10-19 18:35:06
16288," Trump's named Grant Shaps as home secretary. So the Dow, the S&P and Nesdaq all in the red halting a two-day rally for US markets, Treasury yields of climb to multi-year highs on speculation the Fed will remain hawkish, raising the odds of a recession. We've got more on the Federal Reserve for you coming up in just a moment. The S&P down 27 dropped there of 7 tenths of 1%, the Dow is down 130 down 4 tenths, Nesdaq down 98, but dropped there of 9 tenths of 1%. 10 you're down 24 30 seconds, 10 you're yield 4.10% again the 2 year 4.54%. Allas, for the overall market backdrop, Lisa Shallot is chief investment officer for wealth management at Morgan Stanley. I think we're going to be on this world or coaster to nowhere where periodically we're going to get these bear market rallies where this is a very impatient market. Investors seemingly have no tolerance for pain. And so any sign that the wind may begin to blow their way, you know, gets a two or three day rally going. Well, after the closing bell, we might find out about pain for Tesla. We have got Tesla reporting earnings today along with IBM and Alcoa. Tesla shares right now they are up by about 6 tenths of 1%. IBM down by 2 tenths of 1%. Alcoa lower by 4%. Again, the capping 10 year yield 4.11% S&P down 8 tenths of 1%. I'm Charlie Pellet. That is a Bloomberg business flash. Thank you so much, Charlie. Well, we got to read on the economy thanks to the FedBased book. We did that at the top of our broadcast. And keep in mind there are two Fed meetings left in 2022. We're talking about November and December. We're very pleased with us to have with us this afternoon. Chris Ansi, senior editor for Bloomberg News who joins us on the phone from Boston. Chris, it's interesting because we got some data from the Federal Reserve earlier today in the beige book. I don't want to call it data, but it was anecdotes about what, you know, the country is seeing in different or with the Federal Reserve is seeing in different districts. And we saw a little bit of a cooling sort of difficult to kind of square that with the CPI data that we got last week. But it always always is a big question about, you know, with the Fed hiking rates so aggressively right now, why aren't we seeing it really play out when it comes to tightening financial conditions, at least bringing down inflation? Yeah, that's a good question. And, you know, we look at financial market. We've got a bear market in stocks. We've got an historic bear market in bonds. We've got a super strong dollar. All of these kinds of signs are screaming major reaction to the Federal Reserve's aggressive tightening. But when we look at the actual, you know, economic data, we don't see any major problems here. Even, you know, this morning's housing starts. They came off a bit in September, but the level of housing starts is still above where it was before COVID. We look at yesterday's industrial production figure. It handily beat forecasts and the percentage of factory capacity that's in use is at a multi-decade high. Job gains are still going pretty well. So, you know, you were referring before to the jargon that economists use these long lags. They aren't that variable right now. I got to say, but there are these long lags between Fed policy action and fundamental turns in the economy. Chris, I was trying to get Tim to sing long and winding road by the Beatles. It came to my head when I was reading long and variable lags. I don't know why. Yeah. Like it just is kind of a perfect. One of my least favorite Beatles songs I haven't said. That's why I don't want to sing a Carol. I don't want to offend Chris. Kind of favorite one? No, okay. So. Soon we're going to be singing help. That's good. Nicely done. Nicely done. Well, you know, in your writing today in the Bloomberg New Economy Daily, Chris, you mentioned Craitoris who's got a story out about the report last week regarding Central Banks and how they have now, quote, revised down significantly, end quote. They're estimate of where the US economy speed limit is. The significance of that. So that is significant because it means if the economy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4634,2022-10-19 18:39:12
16289, and he's speed limit is the significance of that so that is significant because uh... it means if the economy is kind of trend growth rate uh... is lower than it was uh... it means that all of these indicators that we get uh... don't need to be too hot uh... to trigger inflation that means that uh... the economy is going to react in a more inflationary way uh... to just small upticks in economic activity uh... and so it makes it all the harder to ring inflation out of the system uh... and you know we've just mentioned uh... industrial output uh... yesterday after that report goldman sacks economist came out and up to their uh... running uh... calculation for third quarter gdp to two point four percent now two point four percent is above everybody's estimate of the u.s. trend so if u.s. is clocking that kind of growth pace uh... it just means more inflationary pressure and more uh... work for the federal reserve to do to bring it down so what is this all mean in the last minute that we have with you chris for the path of rate hikes going forward i mean we're thinking seventy five for november obviously what about December what about what cash carry said uh... yesterday how are you reading into it another so far more more more right the people songs this whole time that's not a bit of a well i mean the hard days night for the power of uh... and and his colleague that's for sure but uh... what i think is that you know uh... and along and blueburg economics uh... was pretty uh... pression in predicting you know a five percent policy rate uh... next year uh... and it's uh... uh... a call that she's increasingly uh... that is increasingly shared uh... by others right what you work in yellow submarine next time and uh... you are then going to be my favorite person i'm going to be totally an off you chris more than i am already uh... chris thank you so much really appreciate really fits into our coverage here of beige book in just all things that and especially as we get ready for that bloomberg is exclusive which in baller the president of the saint louis fed our thanks to bloomberg new senior editor chris and see and who also knows his bloomberg so uh... bloomberg songs i should say the bill songs really well writing in the bloomberg new economy daily let's get to world national news for that we turned an anti-lion in washington dc hint thanks to him president by this calling for the release of another fifteen million barrows barrels of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve and he has a plan for the large-scale purchase of petroleum to refill the reserve the united's companies can purchase oil to refill the strategic petroleum reserve when prices fall to seventy dollars of barrel that means all companies can invest to wrap up production now with confidence they'll be able to sell their oil to us at that price in the future seventy dollars by not so called out oil producers for making record profits while russia wages war in ukraine saying the money should not be used for stock buybacks but to boost production in lower prices for consumers there may be enough evidence to charge former president trump with a crime sources tell bloomberg news a group of justice department prosecutors thinks an obstruction of justice cases justified against the former president in the classified records probe the team hasn't made a formal recommendation to attorney general maric garland who have to decide one way or the other sources say the former president probably won't face just obstruction of justice while he's under multiple investigations there's also a divide about whether to bring charges when trump is considering another run for the white house in twenty twenty four in washington i'm nafe and haggard bloomberg radio house gop leader cabin mccarthe is pushing back against pressure from some republicans in the chamber to impeach president by the nor members of his cabinet if the party takes over next year mccarthe tells punch bowl news he does not see the case for impeaching by the or members of his cabinet quote right now global news twenty four hours a day on air and on bloomberg quick take powered by more than twenty seven hundred journalists and analysts and more than one hundred and twenty countries i'm nancy lions thank you so much nancy lions with world the national news there and are ninety nine one newsroom in washington dc so amazon and they're just put in their tentacles everywhere and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4635,2022-10-19 18:43:42
16290," Thank you so much, Nancy Lyons with World of National News there in our 991 Newsroom in Washington, DC. So Amazon, man, they're just putting their tentacles everywhere. Yeah, this one happening in the UK. So the company in the UK is moving into a new business area offering consumers in the UK home and contents insurance from third party providers. We're talking about the world's largest online retailer. Here's how it's going to work. It's going to initially provide shoppers with quotes from LV General Insurance, ages you can co-op with more insurers added in the coming months. This according to the Seattle based company, the rollout starting today. Yeah, this is interesting. It's an insurance store. Who knew? It's going to show star ratings, customer reviews, claims, acceptance rates for the insurers, similar to the other products for sale on this site. So look for more of the kind of the same format. Amazon will get a commission from the insurers for policy sold over the platform. Jonathan Fife is the general manager of Amazon's European Payment Products Division. Here's a quote. This is just the start. It's yet to be seen whether the company will spend into more markets or offer other types of insurance, he said. Yeah, here's what he said. Quote, there are many different categories. We're certainly always listening to customers to find other ways where we can exceed their expectations and make their lives easier. So here's how it works. You go to this section of the Amazon site in the UK. Right. And if you're looking for insurance, they're going to offer insurance for contents in home for UK consumers. Just like any other third party comparison site would, if you end up buying that insurance, you'll get a, the Amazon will get a commission from that sale. It's much more of the marketplace model than it is of, you know, a fulfillment model. So, but it's interesting, right? Because it's like the comparison websites for travel. Is it like, is it the kind of a similar? Yeah, I mean, how do you ever use to have your robot travel insurance through a website or like, you know, I mean, I even did my life insurance through like, you can do that through comparison. And do comparison. So it's the same thing. You can think about that happening. Look, this is also an area where there's a lot of regulatory hurdles. So it's not easy to roll out worldwide. We'll see if they do this in the US. Yeah. And if they do it in other parts of insurance too. Right. But certainly looking to maybe get into, you know, it's again, you and I talk about this, like the Apple Infrastructure Network. Amazon just continues to build out its infrastructure network as well. And it's kind of grip on us all. I'm just going to say this is Bloomberg. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4636,2022-10-19 18:47:31

16292," of documenting this a while ago. And really what gets me is just the humanity of this and what it's like to live through a total tragedy and then also like there are things that feel really special there. And the dance studio is one mark that I wanted to ask you about what sticks out to you, Mark. You've been there multiple times now and I'm just curious like bring it back for those of us who haven't been there. What's it like as these people return to their homes? Yes, I mean, war zones are strange places because they often have it's a huge variation in how things are not just in terms of place, from one area of a country to another but also in terms of time. So when you're in a place like butcher or ipin, these were absolutely horrific places just a few months ago. And the stuff that was being done to people, we discovered sense, of course, the people who lived there knew at the time, was unspeakable. And yet you go back now and people are rebuilding their lives, restaurants are reopening, people are trying to make things work. All those women and their children, it's on, they want to come back. Almost everybody left butcher, for example, but they want to come back because they left their husbands behind, parents, grandparents behind who couldn't move. And so you see them come back and what interested me was what happens to them when they come back? Are they the lucky ones who escaped or are they themselves traumatized by it or and the result of my reporting was simply that it's very difficult to escape the trauma. Because, for example, one lady was a life coach. So she fled to Poland with her children in a right at the beginning before, which was occupied and was still fighting. And she's in Poland. But what did she do? She carries on her work online. And she's talking to people, clients, who are living through everything. And so she lived through the same experiences. Another woman, very, very impressive woman, was running a business center and she decided, well, what can I do to help as she was leaving? And she decided to set up a call center so that they could, find out which people were stuck in their homes, couldn't get medicine, couldn't get food, needed help. And they could send people into help. And in the end, because it was occupied and you couldn't move, they couldn't do a lot of that. But they got 20,000 calls from people saying, what's the news on the escape routes? The green corridors that have been made. So they could help organize people to get out. They also, people would just call in and say, I just saw two people, children killed in a car, happened at this place. And they have this record of what happened throughout in Butcher, where people were calling it in. And that record now remains. That woman was really very damaged by the whole experience because she's lived through it while it's happening. And then again, when it came over in the news, the most main public. Mark, I mean, you've been back and forth. What strikes you the most as you talk to these individuals? Because I do think there is this sense that often, sometimes, all of us who are far removed, it's just another headline. But as you really tell us, I mean, the faces, the people, the stories, these are real lives that we're talking about. Yes, very much so. And it's hard. The jobs really aren't there. But just strangely is relatively lucky, which is a very strange thing to say. But it was always a fairly middle class suburb just outside of Kiev. And because of its fame or notoriety, whatever you want to call it, as a result of the massacres, they're where they've had mass graves and so on. There is a lot of international attention.

16294," Audio Come down to the close. Bloomberg's comprehensive cross-platform coverage ahead of the US market closed starts right now. This is countdown to the close just 60 minutes left in your trading session. The last six days were about 10% on the major airlines. The recent kick to the upside is thanks to UAL, which is up about 16% in the past six days and up about 5-6% in today's trading session. We saw UAL rallying as it sees profit well above Wall Street estimates in the final quarter of the year, travel demand remaining strong at mirrors what we heard from Delta said this group outperformance to him. Is it because I spent several thousand dollars on pancakes for Thanksgiving, which is like three times what we would usually spend? The demand certainly is there after a couple years of being away from family. I got my eye on home builders today. We're seeing yields spike and of course we got the data earlier today that shows the decline in housing starts and mortgage applications. Unsurprisingly, shares of home builders taking a hit today. The S&P home building index down 5.4%. Through yesterday's close shares down 35%. I feel that economic headwinds that maybe took some of the risk on attitude out of the markets. Maybe it's the inflation prince that we got abroad as well. We're seeing the S&P off by 39 points at the moment down by percentage point. Not eroding the last couple of days at games, but still somewhat. We're seeing the NASDAQ off by 1.3% and that's 141 points lower. The Dow losing by about 200 points on the day. And we're also seeing small caps underwater to the tune at 2.2% that's called it. So the worst performer on the day, Taylor. I hate to say that it looks like we're deteriorating as we count you down closer to these closing bells earlier. We had about 91 stocks in the green in the S&P 500 now. It's only about 78. From this great terminal chart that we have every sector except for energy is in the green. Energy is still up another 3% on the day, which has been the story of the year. But everything else, financials, real estate included. Interesting story on the Bloomberg terminal about how many people now trying to short the energy sector primarily because of that outperformance that we've seen so long. You flip it up and you talk about some of the big individual movers today. Netflix, Rain, Supreme, up 12% here on the day after that surprising jump in net subscribers. And then you sort of look at what's going on with Proctor and Gamma. And I thought this is the word for you, Taylor. It's elasticity, really. The ability of these companies to really pass along their higher costs to the consumer. The inflation story really is dominating this earnings season. Proctor and Gamma will still making that case that it is able to do that. And maybe that's because they sell a lot of things that we need. You know, in the laundry detergent. You can't wait to come with me. You lost. Next segment, I'm coming you with convexity. Okay, well, we'll talk about convexity. We'll talk about convexity when it comes to Boston beer. There is your in the last city and there's your sort of convexity there. And a lot of this actually had to do with royal unibru over in Denmark, big beer maker in Denmark. Or actually a smaller beer maker, I should say. They make facts beer. I know you don't drink, Taylor, but you know, for those that said do. Anyway, they came out with their earnings and it was.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4640,2022-10-19 19:05:31
16295," Unibru over in Denmark, big beer maker in Denmark. We're actually a smaller beer maker, I should say. They make facts beer. I know you don't drink, Taylor, but for those of us that do. But anyway, they came out with their earnings, and essentially why do we care about some company in Denmark? Well, because they really talked about this idea of not being able to pass along those higher costs to consumers. And this gets back to E. Lastissie. Stay on theme, Taylor. Don't switch the convexity on me. Anyway, Boston beer shares down 6%. And in fact, a lot of the brewers, both here in the United States, Carolyn Sim, as well as over in the UK, as well in Europe, as well, also seeing similar declines. Maybe a few people in the UK need to drink at the moment when you're looking at what's happening with politics. They can't afford it. They can't, because inflation is so high. Let's look at what happened to UK inflation print today. 10.1%. We are now eclipsing the rest of the... Is that coming down? Or is that going up? It's going up, unfortunately. It was at 9.9. We then get into double-digit figures at last large. You're because of food prices, energy prices. But look, we can see from this chart for our radio audience. It's not far off where the US CPI, probably, of course, is about 8.2 euros zone came in. Martin, he wants a little bit down at 9.9%. But still so strong. And we're also seeing, though, interestingly Canada CPI coming in. It is fading, but not as quickly as hoped. And of course, that means what will the central bank suit? I'm going to wait, because it feels like Romeine has something to do. No, no, Carol. I agree. No, keep it going. OK, OK. Well, that persistent inflation... We're going to go see that by the way. See, there you go. That persistent inflation... It happens every now. When he gets to talk about Boston Bay. Yeah. OK, so that persistent inflation hold off, remain. That persistent inflation that we're seeing over in the UK, that we're seeing in the United States, and really that focus on core inflation. That's something that Neil Cush-Carrie over at the Minneapolis Fed has been focusing on. Here's what he had to say last night. The core services inflation, which is the stickiest of all, keeps climbing. And we keep getting surprised on the upside that core keeps going up, and services keeps going up. So the problem for me with trying to say, hey, it's time to pause is we're not even sure that we've got rates high enough to push services and inflation down. All right, of course. That's Minneapolis Fed President Neil Cush-Carrie. Did not talk about beer or beer prices at that point. No. But what's interesting is, did you guys see another story, because he's making some comments today, he is saying that the Fed could potentially pause rate hikes next year. Next year? OK, great. You know, we're actually going to hear from James Bullitt a little bit later. Yes, we are. I think Kathleen Hayes has an exclusive sit down with him. It'll be interesting to see what he thinks maybe. And many say he's the wonder watch, right? Because he's been really kind of out in front when it comes to how aggressive the Fed is. We wrote a whole story on the carols. Just a simple man in the back side. I read in. I get ready for the Bloomberg quiz every week. I want to go back to Cush-Carrie's comments that he made a little earlier about potentially pausing rate hikes next year. The question is, at what rate do they pause rate hikes? And for how long do they keep them elevated? And how long is the lag between when the Fed raises rates and when the Fed stops raising rates? So when we start to see that actually show up, because even though we got some anecdotal data from the beige book today that says inflation's easing in some areas, it doesn't really square with the data that we got last week in terms of CPR. I think big questions about that lag. It was Black Rocks' work reader, right? Talking again about why aren't we seeing? If we started hiking in March, none of us knew it would come immediately. It does take a lag. But if that's six to 18 months, we're starting to get in that period. It is Q4. We should start to feel the effects of this. I know within the housing market today, we are feeling the effects of it. But there are things aren't really coming down yet. No. There has been some softness in certain areas. I mean, you talk about the destruction right now in housing market demand, at least mortgage demand. And then you talk about the destruction we've seen in financial markets. I guess that's two pillars that I think the Fed can look at and say, OK, mission accomplished or whatever they think they're trying to do here. For meanwhile, though, oil ticks higher. Natural gas has actually been pulling back significantly, but we talk about that natural gas cap in terms of prices over in Europe. But here in the US, the fact that we're having to talk once again about those pools of oil that we got set to the side, the fact that we're worrying about the direction in which the price point diesel is going to be going, this is still a concern in terms of our ability to spend. I also do think, and I know we've got a wrap here, but I do wonder if there's just a reset. There's a great voice on surveillance this morning. It's just about the structural changes that are going on in the US. Demographics, pushback and globalization, climate change, whether or not that means that prices are going to run hot longer because of all of those changes. And just real quickly, S&P Global did put out kind of that new assessment of upgrades down.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4641,2022-10-19 19:10:06
16296," I'm gonna change whether or not that means that prices are going to run hot longer because of all of those changes. Just real quickly, S&P Global did put out that new assessment of upgrades, downgrades, et cetera. They talked about 46 new companies were placed on downgrade watch. These are necessarily downgrades. But a lot of companies are seeing cracks in the corporate credit market. We should point out that data is from August. A little bit of a lag up when we get that. Okay, remain you're gonna bring the beer for the next hit? Absolutely. Absolutely, from Denmark. All right, deal deal. All right, we're gonna be back our cross-platform coverage radio TV YouTube. We're gonna count you down to the closing bell on this Wednesday. This is Bloomberg Business Week with Carol Maser and Bloomberg Quick Takes Tim Stenevig on Bloomberg Radio. I will say I was listening in. I know you and I both like to listen in on surveillance. It's great for just all of the news flow in the morning. And they're very focused on economics and kind of inside baseball when it comes to the financial markets. Really easy to do in the Bloomberg app. It is. Put my earbuds on. I turn it on and I walk it in and out my commute in. But that whole concept of these structural changes, you and I talk about it Tim, with a lot of our guests. Climate change, demographics and aging population, this pushback on globalization, that is gonna take time to play out. There will be costs. And as a result, the guests there, for give me for not remembering his name, but it says means higher inflation, longer term is here to stay. So I think 4% and I 2% as the real rate when it comes to inflation and where the Fed targets. My thoughts continue to go to the housing market once again because we're in a time where it's just a real pickle. Where mortgage rates are at their highest, they've been in decades. There are a lot of new households who, you know, young people who want to form new households. Demand is their supply, isn't there? And there's no incentive for people to move if they've locked in a 30 year mortgage, you know, under 3 or under 4%. It's gonna be really tricky. And I do think about, you know, our pushback against immigration. I mean, many economists have often said like this is what helps in terms of bringing in younger work forces and also helping in terms of productivity and more importantly in terms of economic growth. Let's get onto world and national news for that. We turn to Nancy Lienz, who's in Washington DC. Hey, Nancy. Thanks Tim. President Biden is hoping to ease the pain at the pump for consumers and he's announcing the release of another 15 million barrels of oil from U.S. emergency reserves. He's also scolding oil companies for using record profits from last quarter to buy back stock. $70 billion in just one quarter, 90 days, 70 billion. So far, American oil companies are using that windfall, the windfall of profits to buy back their own stock, passing that money under their shareholders, not to consumers. Biden says it's wrong for oil companies to prosper while Russia rages war on Ukraine. With election day barely three weeks away, the issue that impacts most people in most places appears to be the economy. The economy has been central in virtually every election. Muhammad Yunus, editor-in-chief of the Gallup poll, said in a Bloomberg interview. We certainly have seen an uptick in people saying that it's important for them as a voter to vote for someone who shares their view on abortion. And social issues are certainly going to be critical, but overwhelmingly, the economy is going to be central on people's minds as they go to vote. Yunus suggested that while just about everyone is impacted by inflation, abortion is of less concern in districts where it's not threatened by legislatures in Washington or of Chantman, Bloomberg, radio. Over half of working Americans have considered holding multiple jobs to pay their living expenses as inflation remains stubbornly high in September. In real wages fell, Qualtrics found about 38 percent of workers have looked for a second job and additional 14 percent have plans to do so. Global news, 24 hours a day, on air and on Bloomberg, quick take, powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. Thank you so much, Nancy Lyons out there in our DC Newsroom and Bureau. So let's talk a little bit about Uber technologies. Yeah, the company is launching an advertising arm to tap a lucrative revenue stream. It's launching a dedicated advertising arm. This is a push to cash in on a captive audience and tap the higher margin revenue stream. I think of one company here when I think of this. What do you think of Amazon? The way that Amazon has incorporated ads into its app and into its website. Yeah. Think about it from the perspective of the way that you search for a product.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4642,2022-10-19 19:14:05
16297," And I think of this Amazon. The way that Amazon has incorporated ads into its app and into its website. Yeah. Think about it from the perspective of the way that you search for a product these days, right? Because people are paying, right, to be. Exactly. And they're not, you know, Google has a really captive audience because oftentimes people search for a product when they get to Google. But sometimes people bypass Google entirely and just go right to Amazon if they're a prime customer, for example. So Uber has a captive audience and it's Uber eats and it's Uber transport apps. Right. So why not use that as a place to advertise? Are you working for Uber? No. OK. I'm not. But lift us this too. I know. I know. So the new division encompasses ad offerings on Uber's ride hailing and food delivery apps. And Uber eats, for example, brands will be able to pay for sponsored listings, prominent placing on the home page or checkout and featured menu to items. Uber also rolling out journey ads, a new service that runs ads for rideshare users while they wait for their driver and during their trip. More than 40 brands have partnered with Uber to run journey ads, including NBC Universal Heineken. We're putting this out in a statement today. I think you know what I would do. I would watch a two minute video for a discount on an Uber. There's something for the suggestion box Uber. Yeah, right? Like, give me a break. But you know, I'm not going to just sit there and look at my phone to watch an ad. Right. Give me some points that add up to give me a break on a ride or a discount. Come on. Advertising an attacksy cab is nothing new. Well, that's what I was going to say. This is what it reminds me of. Like getting it, you know, do you want to play games? Do you want to watch an ad? I don't know about you. But I just do it. Turn it off. You don't get sick looking at it. I'm muted or turn it off. Let's find a way. Let's find a way. Let's find a way. Let's find a way. Let's find a way. Let's find a way. Let's find a way. Let's find a way. Let's find a way. Let's find a way. Let's find a way. Hey, listen. Don't forget at 330. So just about 15 minutes from now, our exclusive Bloomberg interview with the Fed president of the St. Louis Fed, Jim Bullard, sitting down with our own Kathleen Hays. You'll see it across the Bloomberg platforms. But be sure to listen in and watch it on YouTube with us. All right. Let's go to the Bloomberg radio. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

16298," Too much air here! that sounds like posh Morning This is a Bloomberg Business Flash. Well, Bloomberg World Hang Quarters. I'm Charlie Palette. We've got 43 minutes to go ahead of the closing bell. With the Dow, the S&P and Nezdaq all in the red, 25 point drop right now for the S&P down by 7 tenths of 1%. Let us head right over to the first word breaking news desk for today's afternoon call. Here he is, Bill Maloney. Good afternoon, Charlie. US stocks choppy as the 10 year-yield hits 4.12% downstriently down 107 points. Like you mentioned, S&P is down 25 and Nezdaq is lower by 1%. Gold is down 24, oil is climbing and Bitcoin is also down by 1%. And among the main 11 SB sectors, only energy is in the green. And leaders said the upside in the Dow travelers and Chevron, while Home Depot fell 3.7% and led to the downside. After earning Zinefflex rose 12% and in on the news, Elliott took a stake in presenius, raising the prospect of a breakup. Rappic things up, IBM and Tesla report after the bell. Live from the first of the breaking news desk on Bill Maloney. Okay, we thank you very much, Bill, and to hear live breaking news over your Bloomberg-type squawk-esque UAWK on your Charm-It-Lime Charlie Palette. That is a Bloomberg business flat. It is indeed. All right, Charlie. Thank you so much. You are listening and watching Bloomberg Business Week on this Wednesday. Carol Maser along with Tim Stenevich Live, Interactive Broker Studio, and streaming on YouTube. Well, Charlie talking about Netflix throughout the day shares just off their highs, still up about 13%, surging as a subscriber growth, signaling the worst is over. It added 2.41 million customers in the third quarter, exceeding internal forecasts as well as expectations on Wall Street. Well, Chairman, President Kosey Eon, of course the co-founder of Netflix, we're talking about Reed Hastings, weighing in on the conference call last night, heat-to issuing a bit of a sigh of relief. Check it out. Well, thank God we're done with shrinking quarters. That's the big feeling of we're back to the positivity. We still got FX. I feel that's a huge hit, you know, as we've explained. So that's not going to go away. But other than that, all the stars are lining up very well for us. That was Netflix co-founder, Kosey Eon, Reed Hastings, and Chairman as well. From the company's conference call following Tuesday's earnings results. We've got a great voice with us, Geeta Ranganathan, is technology and media analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. And she joins us on Zoom from our Princeton, New Jersey, Bureau. Geeta, great to have you with us. So is it true? I mean, should Reed Hastings actually be breathing a sigh of relief here? Is, you know, one quarter does not change everything, does it? Yeah, that's a great question. But I think we're back on track here, finally. You know, there was so much, I think, what had happened earlier in this year was this kind of perfect storm of all negatives, right? Whether it was the COVID hangover, whether it was increasing, subscribe.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4644,2022-10-19 19:22:56
16299," You know, there was so much, I think, what had happened earlier in this year was this kind of perfect storm of all negatives, right? Whether it was the COVID hangover, whether it was increasing subscriber, you know, competition from other rival streaming services, whether it was the COVID log jam, causing all the production delays. It really kind of everything went wrong for Netflix at the wrong time, right? And finally, we're seeing some green shoots here. So they have a good trajectory in place. I mean, make no mistake. This is still a model that is maturing. So we're not going to see those explosive subscriber gains anymore, but there are some catalysts in place, which tells us that they do have a sustainable path to revenue react acceleration, as well as opening up the market to, you know, to reach a much broader audience with this new add tier that they're coming up with, which is priced really aggressively in my view. Hey, listen, will we be as excited with Netflix if that add to your story wasn't part of it right now? Uh, Geeta in your in your view? Yeah, I don't think so. I think we definitely needed it. It wasn't just reversal of subscriber losses, right? We need something. At the end of the day, you know, this is a subscribe. This is pretty much a subscriber story. Yes, they're trying to shift the trying to pivot away from just that hyper focus and subscribers to other financial metrics. We're seeing that they're going to even stop issuing subscriber guidance, but still the at the very core of the story. It is a subscriber story. And so you do need that add tier for kind of boosting those subscriber numbers, especially in a lot of the developing economies. All right. So we're re bummed out that they didn't give some kind of a forecast. Were you expecting that from them or were you expecting to get some kind of. This job harder. So they did give us a forecast for 4Q and the good news is the forecast was actually above consensus estimates. There's also potential upside because they didn't really bake in anything from the ad model given that it's still early days. What's going to happen is going. They didn't break out like in terms of a forecast for the ad model. That's okay. Yeah, no, I think that's okay. I think it's still really, really early days. It's very hard to say how that's going to pan out. I think what they're trying to do now is obviously really shift focus away from, you know, kind of just that hyper focus on subscriber additions quarter and quarter out. And remember every time they do report those quarterly ads, we do see huge swings in the stocks. I think what this is a good thing. I think it's actually a positive that they're not going to do this because I think it reduces the volatility a little bit. There's just so much drama, you know, every time they report quarterly numbers. Geeta, how important was content this quarter because we got. I mean, it's kind of a funny question to ask because Netflix is all content, right? But you know, people will quit. They've learned if they don't always have something that they want to watch. We saw stranger things the new season. They released the Korean smash hit extraordinary attorney, woo, some movies, Gray Man and purple hearts. How important was that to the blockbuster number that we saw yesterday? Did you guys watch any of that? Did you watch any of that? Geeta? I did. I'm a big stranger. Things fancy. Yeah. I watched it multiple. Well, you can only say it's part of your job. Geeta, you know, you have to do it. I do. I'm just working here. Okay. But I know I mean, I think it's so much of the story really banks on content and what was really interesting. I think in their investor letter, Tim and Carol is they kind of showed us some of their pieces of content. They showed us engagement and they said that their, you know, engagement on the Netflix platform is way above their rival services, whether it's an Amazon Prime, whether it's a Disney plus. And then they showed us like the Google search trends for, you know, their latest hit, which is the Jeffrey Dahmer show and they compared that to both House of Dragons from HBO as well as, you know, a lot of the rings, which was the big splash from Amazon. I'm not saying the similarities in those stories. No similarities. No similarities. But it does show that, you know, Netflix content, once it resonates, resonates and kind of builds that buzz, it really becomes like a big hitting title. And that's kind of what they're really looking to do, you know, not just have a few of these franchises, but kind of have multiple many, many of these sleeper hits, if you will. So what does it mean? I'm just trying to make sense of this headline and forgive me if you've kind of touched on this stretch, thin to support all advertising demand. Are they saying that they're getting tons of it? Or like, how do you read that? Yeah, so they did say they didn't mention this on the call yesterday. They said that advertisers are absolutely wanting to get.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4645,2022-10-19 19:27:01
16300," They're saying that they're getting tons of it? Or like, how do you read that? Yeah. So they did say, they did mention this on the call yesterday. They said that advertisers are absolutely wanting to get on the Netflix platform. And we're not surprised. I mean, this is a premium experience. If you just kind of took a look at one of the ads that they debuted, it was actually for their new show, Emily in Paris. And just to look in the field of the ad. And just to look in the field of the ad is so different from what you normally watch. It's stylish, it's engaging, it's modern. It almost feels like it's an integral part of the show. So I think that's what they're going to do. They're going to elevate the ad experience for all players. The creative element is going to be huge. And I think advertisers know that. They realize that. And they want to be on that Netflix platform. Hey, Gita, I wonder about the people who will be signing up for the new version of Netflix, the ad-supported version. Are they saying that it's people who've quit Netflix in the past because it's gotten too expensive and they don't necessarily have what they want to watch at any given time? Or are people going to downgrade their memberships for cheaper membership options? Yeah, this trade down point was brought up multiple times during the call. And what Netflix management kept saying is they don't really see a lot of cannibalization. So what they're really trying to do with this new $7 price point. And remember, this is historically the lowest price point that Netflix has ever priced one of its plans at is to really attract a whole new market, tap into a whole different demographic, probably a slightly lower income demographic that wants to watch Netflix, but just hasn't been able to afford the $10 price point or even the $15, $15, $50, the standard plan. And so that's what they're saying. Although the worry on the street is that many, many subscribers, maybe even 20% to 30% of subscribers actually trade down, I don't personally think that's going to happen because remember, this is going to be a lower resolution. It's a 720p versus your 1080p. And also you're not going to be able to download all of the content. In fact, not even all of the content is going to be available on this ad-supported plan. So I really think maybe the risk of trading down is going to be somewhat limited. So in an ideal world, they don't lose anybody that's existing kind of members to some extent or subscribers and that they just open up a whole new revenue stream, right? And new members that maybe weren't on it because it was too expensive before. I mean, that's the dream plan, right? Kita? Exactly. Exactly. Just opening up their addressable market. But Kita, when it comes to the content, not all being available on the ad-supported tier, that's a function of rights that Netflix has, right? It's not like they're withholding content because people aren't paying for the full subscription. Can you explain what's going on there? No, that's just because of some of the licensing deals that they have in place. And again, it's not a whole lot of content that's not available to only about 10% of their entire content catalog that's not going to be available. And they said that they're working through these licensing rights with some of the third-party providers. I think over time, it will become available. But to begin with, they still have to iron out a few wrinkles. Kita, what was there anything that, with all that we got from Netflix and on the call after earnings, was there anything that you didn't get answer that you would love to just, hey, Reed, can you just tell me just a little bit more about this? Yeah, I think one of the things that we've constantly kind of scratched our heads with a little bit has been this whole gaming effort. And just today, we got this new news about them exploring a cloud gaming service potentially. Now, we know that anybody who's kind of forayed into that venture, it's been really challenging, right? Whether it's been a Google Stadia, whether it's been Amazon, they haven't really been able to make much headway in that space. And so I'm just kind of wondering what exactly Netflix's thought process is here. Are they really looking to do something big? Do they need to make a big acquisition? That's obviously one of the things that I think a lot of investors would like to hear more about from them. Does this just got about 30 seconds, 40 seconds left? Or does this say anything about from the other streaming service that we, whether it's Disney's or Amazon, that we should be looking out for just quickly? No, just that, you know, I think the streaming story is back in a big way. I think investors that kind of totally soured on it. But I think what this tells us is that there is a lot of growth left. And you know, streamers just have to be creative in order to monetize all the different revenue streams. All I know is I get so many different services. And I can't tell you my time has been now like, what do you want to watch? We can't find anything. That's crazy. Geeta.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4646,2022-10-19 19:31:35

Oh there you go All right folks you are listening and what now you know what Tim and I are into You are listening and watching Bloomberg Business week on this Fed Wednesday Carol master Tim standovick as I said in our interactive broker studio streaming on YouTube right now though We want to get to a Bloomberg exclusive Bloomberg news global economics and policy editor our own Kathleen Hayes interviewing St. Louis Fed president Jim Bullard. Let's go to that interview Hello, I'd like to welcome our Bloomberg television radio and YouTube audience to a very special event on Kathleen Hayes I'm live at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis in St. Louis, Missouri Of course, and I have very special guests today Jim Bullard. He is president of St. Louis Fed and of course Jim Welcome and thank you for having us back this year. I should be welcoming you Welcome to the bank and thanks for coming well and it is a very special day It's the Homer Jones Memorial lecture. We spoke earlier yesterday I saw it is getting that award and giving his lecture But since I'm here enjoying all this appeared a great opportunity to ask you some questions great Looking forward to it. I know it seems like every time we get together there's something in the background There's something big going on and I would say this time is the fact that the latest inflation data have been disappointing You've done 300 basis points of rate hike since March the core CPI's bases is stalled out and I was using the headline CPI is stalling out just over 8% year over year Core number continuing to rise and the employment market the Market still tight in terms of jobs and the economy not slowing down so what's gone wrong all those rate hikes? What have they done? Well, I do think though they will have an impact and in some ways have had an impact I would cite the housing market in particular where it appears that You know increase in rates has has really changed the dynamics there so that's someplace that I would say there are not long and variable lags There you know that market anticipated Fed moves that before they were even in Train this the spring and So that that's a place where we've seen impact right away, but You know, it's a big ship and it takes a while to steer the ship and and so The housing market is not the whole economy so it certainly isn't and it's certainly not the main one of the main things driving inflation Now of course prices have fallen but rents are important though way They certainly are yeah, they certainly are and in fact that's one reason why people are so worried about inflation staying high next year Is that those rents are the way they are calculated? They're gonna spread out over several months? Yeah, but we're aware of the lags in the calculation and so we'll take that on on board and take a look at that but Yeah, you're right the core measure of PC inflation is still On the high fours and the Dallas Fed trim mean 4.75 or so So pretty high inflation in the US even if you Try to trim out some of the more volatile components So we're gonna have to get that turned around moving in the right direction back toward 2% So how are you gonna do that? What does this mean for the restrictive terminal rate of the September steps median target interest rate 4.4% this year 4.6% next year What are you after the latest data? What are your projections now? Well, if you look at the September summary of economic projections that so-called dot plot It did seem like the Committee was coalescing around further rate increases at upcoming meetings even by the end of the year So that seems to be the base case right now most of that has been priced in the market",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4647,2022-10-19 19:35:30
16302," Oh, lessing around further rate increases at upcoming meetings, even by the end of the year. So that seems to be the base case right now. Most of that has been priced in the market. So I would anticipate that that's having an impact right now. So that's good news if you're trying to get inflation down. But we'll have to follow through on that in the subsequent meetings this year and get the policy rate up to a level where we can put meaningful downward pressure on inflation. I think that's the main goal immediately ahead of us at the committee. So off the cuff right now, what would you say that level looks like it's going to be? Is it going to be higher, for example, than you thought it might be? Is that the risk here? Not that you're going to be okay or you're going to move it lower, but they're actually going to need to have more rates to get to a more restrictive level. Yeah, I've done this calculation of us from a minimal level that you would have to get to to put downward pressure on inflation. I didn't I did it at a conference in Stanford in May. And you can look it up on my web page. But at that time, it came out that number came out to three and a half percent. But since then, the inflation news unfortunately has surprised continued to surprise to the upside. So if you do that again now, you know, you're going to get something closer to what's in the dot plot, 4.5, 4.75, something like that. And I think also, you know, we're data dependent and we're watching the data. I think we're predicting, or at least the dot plot is predicting that inflation will come down. It will be a disinflationary year in 2023. But you know, there's also risk that we don't, you know, the data doesn't cooperate the way we expect it to. And in that case, we'd have to react. You know, there's an old axiom monetary policy, especially when you have inflation like this that's very high that hasn't cooled off. That to get an under control, you have to get the funds rate above the rate of inflation. You're pretty far from there now. Another reason to think that maybe that again, the tilt of risks here is that you're going to have to do more. Some people are talking about 5% and have been for a while. Well, if we get driven to that, it will be because of the data. I mean, the markets are expecting inflation to fall. We've been expecting inflation to fall. I've been expecting inflation to fall and it hasn't so far. But I think in the first half of 2023, that's still the expectation. And so you will get to some point where inflation has come down some and you might get to this situation where the policy rates above the inflation rate. So what do you still expect that? I mean, if I can push a little harder because you've been expecting, expecting it, markets have been expecting, expecting it. And so far, that expectation has been wrong. Why do you still expect that? Well, I think we're taking forthright action to try to get inflation under control. I think there are some temporary factors. I think they were probably overemphasized earlier in this process. But some of these factors like the war in Ukraine and the supply change disruptions from the pandemic certainly do look like they should abate. And some of them have been abating and we'll probably get more of that going forward. So the thinking has been that those types of things are probably not the types of things that you'd want monetary policy to be reacting to because they're too volatile. But the underlying inflation has been relatively high. We cited already the core PC and Dalles-Bedtron mean numbers, which are pretty high. And that's the part that you probably have to act more directly on for monetary policy. But there you're talking about the high 4% range. So is one of the reasons that you are still looking, betting on this inflation coming down is and not having to move the rate a lot more restricted is because you're going to stay aggressive with rate hikes right now. 75 basis points in November and then there's 75 in December. I know you don't like to pre-judge meetings. However, if you look at how the factors are stacking up, is that a likely outcome in terms of what you're going to vote for? Yeah, I mean the November...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4648,2022-10-19 19:39:53
16303," If you look at how the factors are stacking up, is that a likely outcome in terms of what you're going to vote for? Yeah, I mean, the November meeting has been more or less priced in the markets at the 75 basis point number. Again, I think you do want to wait to actually get to the meeting, see what the situation is there. The December meeting is a little far their way. We will have more data at that point. I don't want to prejudge exactly what I'd support at that meeting. And then in 2023, I think we'll be closer to the point where we can run what I would call an ordinary monetary policy or a monetary policy where now you're at the right level, the policy rate, you're putting downward pressure on inflation. But you can adjust as the data come in in 2023. And so I think up to now, we've been, you know, we started off at a very low level. That's why we've moved so fast, so far so quickly. But at some point, we'll get to a level that the committee judges will be sufficient to put meaningful downward pressure on inflation. Then we'll be able to adjust from there. Not that there wouldn't be further adjustments, but they would be more based on the data coming in, as opposed to us trying to get off zero and up to some level that's reasonable. Well, let's apply data dependency to the December meeting then. That's only a few weeks away. Inflation is still high. And in fact, when you looked at the core numbers, it looked like some key sectors, medical care, shelter costs, looks like it could become becoming more entrenched. So again, against that backdrop, wouldn't a 75 basis point hike. And a little more aggressiveness going into that 2023 drop in inflation, you hope to create. Wouldn't that be the right thing to do? Yeah, if you look at the SAP, it does the median dots do call for further moves in 2023. So if you take that as the committee sentiment, there could be a decision to move that into 2022 at the December meeting. So you could do that. But again, why prejudge that meeting? And how much difference would it make from a macro perspective, I think, would be a good question as well, whether you put the 25 base points there or you put it in the first quarter. So what about expectations? What about markets? What about showing people that you've noticed that inflation is still pretty high, and you intend to do something about it? Oh, yeah. We definitely do. And we definitely have moved very quickly here. But this would be more a tactical issue on the larger strategy. And speaking of 2023 and hoping that inflation's going to get to the point where you want it, would that be a point where you would say, yes, it's time to pause? I think there's a possibility of a good dynamic in 2023. So let's cross our fingers that we get it. But I think if inflation does start to decline meaningfully, we can stay where we are at this higher level of the policy rate that meets the community's criteria. And at that point, we could watch inflation fall and get back to 2%. That would be a very good dynamic, I think. Calibration. That's another Fed word now that showed up in the minutes of the September 21st meeting. And people assume because you've already been going pretty fast, the calibration would be slowing down. Is that a correct interpretation of this calibration of rate hikes going ahead? Yeah. You do have to think about what the reasonable level is. I think the 75 basis point moves have been because we started at such a low level. So we're way below any kind of concept of a long run neutral. So step one is to at least get up to the long run neutral. Then get above that, then get to some meaningfully restrictive level that would be appropriate for the level of inflation in the economy. But it doesn't mean that you go up forever. The committee is going to reach a judgment at some point about how much is the right amount. And that's what I want to get this idea across of transitioning to sort of what I would call ordinary monetary policy. And you might too. Let's let.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4649,2022-10-19 19:44:18
16304," That's what I want to get this idea across of transitioning to sort of what I would call ordinary monetary policy. You might too. Looks more like the 1990s or something like that. So no, you're not at zero rates anymore. You're at some higher level rates. But from that higher level, you're adjusting to various things that are happening in the economy, including on the inflation front. Does it mean you couldn't go higher? No, you could go higher depending on the inflation developments or you could stay there and watch inflation fall. Those are both be possibilities. But it wouldn't you'd be out of this kind of very rapid rise and rates. Is that something that's important for people and particularly people in the markets to realize that pausing or slowing down the pace of hikes does not mean that they end. It doesn't mean that you declare victory on inflation. You just decide that you've tainted enough that doesn't need such aggressive moves. Yeah, I think if you're what I mean anyway by putting meaningful downward pressure on inflation would mean that you're at a level of the policy rate where you're confident that, okay, I think we're doing the right. We have the right policy. We're doing the right thing. And even if inflation blips around a little bit, maybe in the wrong direction and one reporter or something, you still feel confident that I've got the right policy even for that situation. So then are you in that can't go that thinks that going slower would be better now because there is a risk of financial instability. We have seen these aggressive rate hikes reverberating not just in the US economy, the US mortgage market, but in other economies around the world. Yeah, I think step one is to get to the right level then from there to become data dependent. So, you know, I don't know exactly the argument for approaching the right level slowly. I think on the question of financial stability, I've been citing the St. Louis Fed's financial stress index that index was at a high level in 2008 was again at a high level in the pandemic. But now is at a very low level. So it doesn't look like there's a lot of financial stress will keep our eye on this. But for now, it doesn't appear that there's a lot of what you would call financial stress in the US economy. If there were, could it be what it be possibly that the balance sheet runoff could become a tool in the sense you would say, well, maybe we'd slow it down. Maybe we'd stop removing the quiddy because that's been one of the things that, you know, a couple weeks ago was quite quite an issue in the bond market that seemed like, hmm, it's a liquid. We're not able to get what we want here. Would that be again become, if you're not worried about it now, if it does become a worry, is that something that you could do? Yeah, I mean, we certainly keep an eye on liquidity conditions in the treasury market and other important markets. But I think when people are talking about financial conditions, they're looking at financial conditions indexes that put a lot of weight on equity price. Three, two, one. It's not so clear to me that you just want to have that. Because what if the equity price is, please welcome to the stage, just high in the past and now they've come down or more speculative bets in that particular market pool off because the higher interest rates, it's not clear to me you want to call that financial conditions. If you're concerned about the level of well to disposable income, that's quite high for the U.S. economy. So it's not really a wealth of five to three years. Please take your seat. Thank you about it. So I think there's some mixing here of the idea of stress, which I think is not how I think the program is about to begin as opposed to financial conditions. If you have a financial conditions index, that's just going to cite the fact that, please welcome to the stage. Do it here. Well, then you'll say, well, basically, please welcome to the stage at Beggley Jr. Gold globe and seven time and nominated at the end. And it's often has access to this. This question about how high rates are going to have to go, how restrictive it's going to get to be. It's not just about inflation, it's about the economy because the economy is so resilient. It's still seen so strong. We don't...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4650,2022-10-19 19:48:35
16305," They're going to have to go, how restrictive it's going to get to be. It's not just about inflation. It's about the economy, because the economy is so resilient. It still seems so strong. We had a story today on Bloomberg, which got a lot of attention about the phrase, little phrase in the minutes from the September 21st meeting, where the board staff economist revised down significantly their estimate of U.S. potential output, the idea being, oh, the economy's running even hotter than we thought. What does that mean in terms of eyeing policy and again, how restrictive we're going to go next? Yeah, as you know, I've had a regime-based approach to potential growth. For now, I think we're still in the low productivity growth regime. So we're still in this rather slow overall pace of productivity growth. A demographic is obviously not going so well for the U.S. as they would have earlier in the post-war era. And other factors, I think, are continuing to suggest that the underlying growth rate for the U.S. economy is probably in the low state. But I haven't revised that. I was always at this lower number anyway, so I haven't revised that based on the most recent data. Basically this also, the productivity numbers for the first half of the year are extraordinarily negative. And the U.S. economy added 3.2 million jobs in the first half of the year. So what were these firms doing? They were adding all these workers and getting less output. I think that's a tough story to tell. I think that'll get revised. I think the GDP number will get revised out for the first half, but probably not until some benchmark revision too far in the future to be useful for monetary policy. But it doesn't ring true that you would have that many jobs added and that many firms making those decisions if they're really getting less output by adding those workers. There's some stories you can tell that maybe productivity is not growing as fast, but to have a big negative number there is kind of questionable. And I just want to let our radio audience know, in case they don't recognize the voice of Jim Bullard, who has in the St. Louis Fed, that I'm here, Captain Hayes in St. Louis at the bank talking to him at length. And in terms of that GDP upgrade, how big do you expect it to be? Is it another thing that's going to change people's view and say, wow, economy is even slowing less than we thought? Yeah, I think the first half of the year, according to the numbers we have today, it was a negative first half. I think probably a zero first half is probably a better guess. We'll see. And these are revisions far in the future so you won't be able to check. I got it right or not. But and I think third quarter growth looks like it'll be positive so far so good. I also think that on the labor market side, we've continued to see a very strong labor market on employment rate at three and a half. Unemployment insurance claims very, very low and probably lower than 2017, 2018, 2019 for this time of year, if you take out the hurricane. The labor market conditions index has put together by the Kansas City Fed would say that this is the best labor market that we've had since the late 1990s. And one of the best labor markets we've had in the entire post-war era. So I think on the employment side of the mandate, we're in great shape. So it's a great time to be fighting inflation and it's a great time to try to knit inflation in the butt and get it back to two percent or going in the right direction back to two percent while the labor market's strong. So I think we've got to get shot at that in 2023. You know you read my mind because the next thing I wanted to ask you about was you seem to be holding out hope for soft landing. Now it seems like other officials at the Fed have kind of accepted or seem to be saying yeah, we are going to have pain. We're going to have to do our pain to get the inflation down which people tend to interpret as recession. Maybe just mild but maybe something deeper if necessary. Why is that why you still think that a soft landing is possible when so many people said look, you've got to be more restrictive. We've got to get up.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4651,2022-10-19 19:52:50
16306," or if necessary. Why do you, is that why you still think that a soft landing is possible when so many people said, look, you've got to be more restrictive. You've got to get inflation down. You've got to get the funds rate well above inflation, but there's this sense that, no, this is a pretty strong economy and it can hold up. Yeah, I don't know. There's a big group that wants to talk in terms of a Phillips curve, but the Phillips curve has been flat for the last 20 years. So I'm not sure where the disinflationary pressure is going to come from from that channel. You'd have to have the estimates of the Phillips curve are that even a percentage point on the unemployment rate has barely any impact at all on the inflation rate. So it's a little puzzling exactly where the story is coming from. Do they think, I would challenge them to say, well, do they think it's a nonlinear Phillips curve where the effects get much more serious as unemployment rate goes up? And that's maybe something you could say, but that's not really in the data. So I don't think that's where the disinflation is going to come from. I think it's going to come from the product side of this process where firms worry about loss of market share. And for that reason, they do not want to increase prices as rapidly as their competitors. And this leads to a 2% rate of inflation instead of a 8% rate of inflation. Okay, but what about inflation expectations? What about the fact that inflation is so far about where each is right now? Yeah, inflation expectations are looking good right now, at least based on tips markets. They've come down below 3% for the five year and the five year five year forward. Those are good numbers considering that the headline inflation numbers at 8%. So I think we do have the right expectation in markets and we do have the right policy in place. We're going to the right level, the policy rate. And I think we can get this dynamic to work. I don't really think it's going to work through labor markets the way other people think. And I would say one other thing about this, the unemployment rate is at 3.5%. So most people would have the natural rate of unemployment somewhere in the 4% range. Let's say 4.5%. So if it just reverts, if unemployment just reverts to mean and goes to 4.5%, that would just be mean reversion in the labor market. You wouldn't expect the labor market to be at stellar levels, which is where it is compared to the close to our experience forever. So you'd expect it to reverts. So that would be somewhat more unemployment, but that would not be, you know, would not help, according to the fat flat Phillips curve, it would not help us that much on the inflation dimension. Inflation expectations, University of Michigan consumer survey, which is a very closely watched as you know. Right now, this is very interesting. 25% of the expectations in the U of M survey see inflation at 4.8% or more in the next five years, but that's the top quartile. The bottom quartile sees it blows 0.7% for the next five years. It's the largest gap between the top and the bottom of those quartile boundaries since May of 1991. What does that tell us? There's a big, I mean, how do we gauge or how can we be confident on inflation expectations? And the markets break, even change all the time. I agree. I agree wrong. Right? Yeah. I think, I think this is fascinating. I think there is some uncertainty about what's going to happen. And we're being, as the central bank, we're being challenged on the inflation front. And we're trying to get a really good policy in place to get inflation under control. But you know, if you're out there as a household, you know, different households might have different views about whether we're going to be successful or not. And that's why you see this big, you know, this big divergence in the variance of inflation expectations. And another thing about inflation right now, there's a massive gap between the CPI and the PCE. In fact, let me look at the data here. It's, last time it was this high or higher, it was 7982. And that was in the vocal rate era. So we started the PCE. That's your main measure. Can you ignore this big gap? And the CPI is so high. And again, so much above the funds rate is that a message you have to be respect that you have to deal with? Yeah, I think, you know, the inflation target is in terms of headline PCE inflation. So that's our...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4652,2022-10-19 19:57:19
16307," be respect that you have to deal with? Yeah, I think, you know, the inflation target is in terms of headline, PCE inflation. So that's our main measure. And we did do a review of this, but not recently. Only in the 1990s, the idea was that the PCE measures a more comprehensive measure of all the prices in the price basket. And so we like to look at that, but certainly the CPI also informative and might match up with some households, actual expenditures a little bit better. So I think what happens is that when inflation goes to a higher level, these differences in measurement start to get magnified. And so you see some bigger differences between the different measures. So Homer Jones Memorial lecture. He was one of the, at the St. Louis Fed, he is considered that the person who brought research to another level that it hadn't been done before at the banks, real leader, and that's been passed on. So if Homer Jones were here and he was talking to you and your team about this, this place you're in and how inflation got way out of control for many reasons. And now you have to bring it down. What would he be telling you? Would he, how would he be assessing your performance and what would he be telling you to do now? He'd probably be telling us we're doing a bad job. He is very data-oriented and was the things that he did with a precursor of what we now call Federal Reserve Economic Data or Fred. And I know a lot of the listeners and viewers use Fred and we try to provide a great public service there. So he would be analyzing the data just like we were here and talking about the different components of inflation and how far it is above the inflation target and so on. I think, you know, there are a lot of differences from the earlier era. I think that at the time it wasn't as widely accepted that central banks were responsible for inflation, but he emphasized that it is the responsibility of central banks. And I think the 1990s, he didn't live to the 1990s, but the 1990s are really the decade that vindicated that view as you had central banks all around the world going to inflation targeting and getting inflation toward target. Speaking of the 90s, that makes me think of the 80s. It makes me think of Paul Volcker. If Paul Volcker were here, what would he be telling you? I think the Volcker era really brought about the idea that you need to be credible in your policy and when Volcker started, the central bank didn't have any credibility at all. And so he had to earn it all from 1979 into the 1980s. But because he did that, I think we're starting off with a lot more credibility. We start off with an inflation target. He didn't have that. We start off with widespread acknowledgement that it's up to the central bank to run the right policy to get inflation under control. We start off with better understanding in the private sector that if you do get inflation under control, which he did, instead of having the volatile 70s era, you had this long expansion in the 1980s, then in recession, then another long expansion in the 1990s. So you set off this high growth, low inflation environment, which is very much what we'd like to do now. All right. Well, I, what I want to know is thank you so much for taking time out of this very special day to join us again on Bloomberg Television, Bloomberg Radio and Bloomberg TV on YouTube. I'll let you go and I'll see you at the Homer Jones Memorial lecture. Great. Looking forward to it. Thanks for being here. Yeah. I'm Kathleen Hayes. Very happy to be here again this year with Jim Bullard and his team. And I want to thank his team for all the hard work they've done to make this happen back to you. All right. Thanks, Kathleen Hayes. They're Jim Bullard, a wide-ranging interview, but basically reiterating what we've heard from him. And as well as a lot of other Fed members here about really following through on the rate heights that have already been telegraphed to this market rate heights and his words might get to about 4.5, 4.75 percent at some point here, that terminal rate that we keep talking about. Which sounds eerily close to sort of what the market has also been expecting though after some of the big CPI reports.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4653,2022-10-19 20:01:38
16308," 75% at some point here, that terminal rate that we keep talking about. Which sounds eerily close to sort of what the market has also been expecting, though, after some of the big CPI reports, we've talked a lot remaining Caroline. And of course, our radio audience about closer to 5% as well, being that big terminal rate. Yeah, remain bus secure along with Taylor Riggs as well as Caroline Hyde, as well as our radio colleagues Carol Maser and Tim Centubik on this Wednesday afternoon. What did you make of that interview, Carol? Well, I think it's very much, you know, what we have heard from many of the members of the FOMC and the Fed overall. What's interesting about Bullard, remember, he was at front and center when it comes to talking about a more aggressive Fed. So everything he says, I think we have to watch very closely, but I feel like no big surprises they're made. All right, well, 3696 right now on the S&P 500 days, we wait for these numbers to settle. We are getting the closing bells now pretty much right across the board. They'll off the lows of the day, the S&P going to finish the day down by roughly about 610s to 710s of a percent, the NASDAQ down roughly about 810s to 910s of a percent. And I just want to point out that Dow Jones and just your leverage down about 310s of a percent. And we'd be remiss, and not at least acknowledging the anniversary here, a very grim anniversary 35 years ago, of course, Black Monday, a day where we were still quoting Dow points, a day where we lost 500 Dow points back when that really meant something, a 20 something percent decline that day, which I think still stands as the worst percentage decline that we've seen in markets across the board. And one reason why I wanted to bring that up, guys, is really this idea when you listen to Jim Bullard and this idea of sort of Fed credibility, a lot of sort of the confidence that we have, at least as market participants, really sort of links back to the Fed's response to that 87 crisis. The idea that they were willing to step in really could jolt these banks into continuing lending and avert what a lot of people thought was going to be an economic crisis. In the end, it was just a market crisis and it was relatively short-lived. But of course, today, that's exactly what we're trying to unwind. Yeah, I guess say this is why I like you remain. It's exactly how I started off my broadcast. I like you a lot, but I started off with its 35 years since Black Monday. So it's like pretty remarkable. And Jim Bullard did say that the Fed shouldn't react into clients in the stock market because we are constantly, you know, tailor parsing, you know, the connection between Fed policy or how much the Fed is closely watching what goes on in financial markets. Your golden dragon, index, Carol, drops to the lowest that we haven't seen since July of 2013. We do that for you, a 7 percent decline here. Well, coming back to sort of the US equities here, take a look at where we are with sort of the other sub levels. This is no surprise. Energy is up 3 percent. Boy, Carol, is this been the narrative of the day and certainly the year? Autumn components as well are up 1.5. 1 percent. As we wait to us let it come in just a few moments, along with those semiconductors. Everything else as you can see, really big right on the screen as you think about the banks. Real estate, some of the consumer durables still under pressure given some of those inflationary pressures that we're continuing to see. All right. We're going to quickly go through some individual gainers. Netflix, you know the story, the beat on the subscribers, the outlook pretty positive. That stock up 13 percent in today's session, really a standout in the S&P 500 NASDAQ 100. You've got UAL, the airlines continue to move ahead over the last week or so. UAL, up about 5 percent, again, seeing profit well above Wall Street estimates in the final quarter of the year, talking about that strong demand. And another one that was earnings based in two-itive surgical, it was up almost 9 percent in today's session. You know they make the defense-y surgical system. They saw third quarter revenue adjusted EPS, a beat. They also lifted their forecast for procedure growth for the year and several analysts raising their price target on that stock. So that Tim saw some outperformance today. All right. Let's look at underperformance. The second biggest decline in terms of points on the S&P 500 today, added laboratories. Falling at 6.3%, 6 percent. Dropping the most in more than a year at one point after third quarter earnings showed lower demand for COVID testing and then also substantial declines when it came to its infant nutrition business. Remember, of course, the recalls earlier this year that led to a nationwide baby formula shortage. In general, holdings, the worst performance on a percentage basis in the S&P 500 today, down more than 25%. The shares cratered after the company cut its full-year sales growth forecast range. The company also announcing preliminary third quarter sales that were lower than analysts had forecast. And look at this one. Olaplex shares. Down more than 56 percent today. It's up people right now aren't buying as many higher end hair care products as many had thought. Olaplex shares crumbling today after the company slashed its forecast for the year. And a record low sales. Record low. Well then IPO is back. Okay.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4654,2022-10-19 20:06:24
16309," and hair care products as many had thought. Old Plex shares crumbling today after the company slashed its forecast for the year. And a record low sales. Record low. Since that IPO was about a year ago, September of 21. Meanwhile, I mean, we look at what's also been under pressure on the day. And we go cross asset for a moment. Overall, you have seen the likes of the dollar higher. So yields have been rising. The dollar moving because of that, really. And so overall, we have a dollar rising, therefore, other FX pairs on the downside, particularly the pound after the inflation day came in stronger than expected, hotter than expected over in the UK. Does that mean further concerns about a recession? The euro is weakened by 8% of a percent as their CPI print hit a 9.9%. You look across the border commodities. And actually, natural gas, once again, for a fourth straight session coming down that little bit lower production easing. But we're also seeing, though, of course, oil up 3.5%. So much for the jaw boning coming at least and the torque coming from the administration, of course, Biden trying to talk about dipping into those special reserves, but not enough to quell some of those concerns about overall supply. Tesla earning to the wire. And we are getting Tesla. We're just getting the bottom line numbers right now. Just look like overall a fairly big outperformance, third quarter adjusted EPS of $1.5. Estimates were for $1.1. They are still seeing 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries. Of course, we got those vehicle deliveries about 10 days ago for the third quarter. So again, we're getting the bottom line numbers right here. The adjusted EPS numbers of $1.5. Estimates were for $1.1. And again, we had gotten a lot of those production in delivery numbers as we await to continue to look through some of these PDFs as well for Tesla. Really pleased to say that we can bring in Ed Ledlow. Right now, I know that you too, my PDF has been stuck in a spinning wheel. Ed, yours too may be doing that as well. But what do you make of at least sort of the third quarter revenue numbers that we're getting here of about $24.4 billion? Yeah. And at least some improvement on the bottom line. Yeah, this has become the story for Tesla. They're beating on the top and bottom line despite difficult macro conditions. Reiterating the guidance of average annual growth at 50% is very important. Why? Because in the first nine months of this year, they were tracking it around 45% growth. So the street was looking to see if they could signal they'd make up that lost ground in the final quarter of this year. The final point that jumps out at me as this release on page two of 29 is that they talk again about the issues they face at the end of the quarter, the higher elevated logistics costs of moving vehicles from A to B. And remember, when it came to the delivery numbers for the third quarter, they missed because they said there were a number of vehicles in transit and the cost of moving those vehicles was becoming unpalitably high. So top of mind as we start to also go through this release and then hear from certainly more of the investment community on this. I mean, what's top of mind for you as we go through these numbers? Yeah, the granularity when it comes to Tesla earnings does not tend to come from Elon Musk. It tends to come from Zach Kirk on the CFO. He addresses the issues and headwinds facing margins pretty head on. He talks about input costs traditionally. He talks about what Tesla's doing to leverage long-term contracts on metal supply. It looks like on the bottom line, they're holding up pretty well here. We know that they potentially left money on the table if we believe the Elon Musk narrative around demand still being there. That leads to the next question, which is if they are going to make up ground in the final quarter of this year, is it by ramping up productions at those newer plants in Austin, Texas and near Berlin and Germany? And therefore, what is the outlook for 2023 look like? But these numbers on the face of it look pretty good. Yeah, well, let's actually get through two of these numbers here. A 3Q automotive gross margin of 27.9%. I think this is interesting. I know Taylor you're probably looking at this here with the free cash flow coming in at about 3.3 billion. That's a little bit higher than the street estimates. And I'm looking at this release and they talk about their cash needs. And basically say, they don't really have cash needs. We have sufficient liquidity of fund, their product roadmap. And they also talk about this idea, though, about the cost of manufacturing, the cost of operations. And well, not only is it elevated, but they think they can sort of make this switch. I guess this switch from hardware-related profits to what they're saying are software-related profits. What does that mean? Well, probably higher margin business, that, but you know. Yeah, I mean, it's simple, right? The software revenues are higher margin. Remember that the software revenues relate to full self-driving, which is largely in testing and beta phase, but you can forward by a-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4655,2022-10-19 20:10:34
16310," In the software revenues are higher margin. Remember that the software revenues relate to full self-driving, which is largely in testing and beta phase, but you can forward buy it either as a subscription or as a one off cost. But they seem to be doing well. I see more headlines coming here through reiterating Tesla third quarter revenue, 21.45 billion, slightly softer than street estimates of 22.09. And is that what perhaps the market's not liking what it sees or is it just the run up that we've had in the last few days? Expectations were high. I think that we wait for a lot of narrative from Mr. Musk. The street is not sold by the commentary from Musk that the demand is still in place. We want to hear really specific details about, well, if it is really expensive to move cars from A to B, what is the long-term effect of that view? And how do you overcome it? We're getting some breaking news coming from IBM, third quarter revenue coming in at 14.1 billion, basically a big beat, and they're actually boosting their full year forecast on the revenue side of things. This is notable. This is a company that's beating by about $500 million. They actually seeing growth across the board, no matter what part of the business that you're looking at and indeed across geographies as well. This is a company, of course, that is facing perhaps some labor inflation and they're seeing overall a narrative where we're worried about global growth, but they're really seeing some resilience in Europe overall as well. The FX headwind is notable. Overall, I think the FX would have been about a billion better if it hadn't been for the dollar impact. They are giving us that 14.1 billion, 15% increase on revenue at a constant currency basis. So here's a company that really is seeing overall resiliency is what I have to say, a clean quarter, raising their guidance on revenue, sticking to their cash flow outlook. But the fact they were asking this sort of optimism and this after-hours move that is almost 5%, this is a company, of course, that people like, because of the dividend and indeed stable relative to some of the volatility that we see in the market. Let's get one more look at Tesla and keep it there before we say goodbye to you guys. Ed Lowe, I want to bring you back in if we continue to watch shares of Tesla. Down about 3.2% as we speak, 29 pages of this PDF, perhaps not surprisingly, I'm not finding the word Twitter in there at all, but I know a lot of investors and analysts will be looking for any sort of clues whether Elon Musk has been active in this stuff. They have H11 on his photos and charts. That doesn't count. Yeah, okay, fine. But still, no mention of a chart that shows how much Elon Musk will have to sell in Tesla stock in order to actually fund this purchase, which could, by the way, close next week, are we going to get any commentary on that on the call? This tees us up nicely, doesn't it? Elon Musk confirmed on Twitter that he would be on the earnings call. Remember the context several quarters ago, he stated that he didn't feel the need to be on every earnings call. I reiterate what Pierre Farragore of New Street Research said earlier today on the program, which is that Tesla has become a well-oiled machine with or without Elon Musk. And in more recent quarters, we've seen the likes of Zach Kirk on CFO, Drew Baglino, SVP of that powertrain, take a more active role on the call. But of course, the street is going to ask, what happens if you do by Twitter? Are you going to be distracted, key man risk? And they'll ask the question, one would hope, how much Tesla stock will you have to sell to fund this deal and what impact will that have? All right, Ed Loughle, thank you so much. Tesla shares down more than 4% on that third quarter revenue miss. We'd also want to point out IBM continuing to rally about 5% boosting their year forecast and land research also came out. A beat up of the top and the bottom line, that stock is up about 3%. All right, that's a wrap for a cross-platform coverage. Radio TV, YouTube, we have counted you down to the closing bell on this Wednesday. All right, you're listening and watching Bloomberg Business Week. Our thanks to our TV colleagues breaking down the earnings. But again, Tesla, let's just rehash down about 5% in the after hours. That was a revenue miss for this company. A revenue miss, but also automotive gross margin coming in lighter than expected, 27.9% for the third quarter versus estimates of 28.4%. So that's not helping the situation at all either. We did initially see share spike, but then they move lower down 5% right now. Yeah, that went away really quickly. And you want some more color when it comes to Tesla. What is it? Are there changing dynamics? There's certainly growing competition when it comes to the EV and the high-end EV space. So you do wonder what is ultimately going on. We mentioned IBM that is still up about 5.3% in the after hours. It didn't boost.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4656,2022-10-19 20:14:51
16311," comes to the EV and the high end EV space. So you do wonder what is ultimately going on. We mentioned IBM that is still up about 5.3% in the after hours. It did boost its year forecast. So that is trending higher and LAM research, a beat on both the top and the bottom line. And that stock is up to about 3.6%. Very important especially as we know in terms of the semiconductor space, the semi equipment space in particular, especially as we've seen how the US is banning the chipmaking companies and gear exports to China. So you do wonder how this is impacting some of these companies. We're also seeing companies in the EV space move lower after Tesla's earnings care. We got Rivian, we got Lucid, Nicola and Fisk are all trading lower post market after Tesla reported results from the most recent quarter. Tesla shares once again down by about 4.5%. All right, and we're still looks like we're waiting on our code report. So as soon as they cross, we will bring them to you. All right, you are listening to Bloomberg Business Week, Karl Maser, along with Tim Stenevich over to Nancy Lyons in DC. Thanks, Carol. President Biden is announcing the drawdown of an additional 15 million barrels of oil from US Emergency Reserves. Part of what he calls a ready and release plan aimed at driving down gas prices. Independent analysts have confirmed that drawdowns on the reserve so far have played a big role in bringing down oil prices, bringing them down. So we're going to continue to responsibly use that national asset by not so called out oil companies for making record profits and using the money to buy back stock and not to lower prices for consumers.

Thank you so much for that update Nancy Lions. Really do appreciate it. Let's get over to Charlie Pellet because he's been keeping a close eye on everything happening after hours and it's a lot, Charlie. Indeed, a lot going on. Let us begin with Tesla Tesla reporting revenue for the third quarter that did miss the average analyst estimate. Tesla shares after ours. They are tumbling by 4.7% still getting headlines on the Bloomberg professional service. We will sort through those and give you more insight as to Tesla's numbers as we get the latest IBM reported better than expected sales. It also affirmed its cash flow forecast and assigned that demand for software, mainframe computers and hybrid cloud services remain steady after ours IBM shares up now by about 5%. The Dow, the S&P NASDAQ all declined today. Stocks lost ground yields at multi year highs. We begin with the 10 year 4.12%. The two year 4.54%. Creators blocked at any rebound attempt today for stocks. We had the S&P falling by 24 points down 7.10% of 1%. The Dow was down 100 points down 3.10s. NASDAQ down 91. A drop there of 9.10% of 1%. Spot goal down 1.4% 16.29. The ounce West Texas intermediate crude up 3.5% 85.76. Again recapping worth repeating the 10 year 4.12% S&P down 7.10s of 1%. I'm Charlie Pollock that is a Bloomberg business flash. Thank you so much for the earnings after the close. Let's get back to Tesla. The stock is under pressure in the after. It's done about 4.5%. The company out, revenue miss, some other metrics miss. Perfect voice to talk about Tesla because he owns them.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4657,2022-10-19 20:19:00
16312, pressure in the after is done about four and a half percent here. The company out a revenue miss some other metrics and miss perfect voice to talk about Tesla because he owns them owns the stock. Drives the Tesla. Yes he does. Yes several Tesla's I think we got Ross Gerber president and CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and investment management joins us on the phone from Santa Monica California's on Twitter at Gerber Kawasaki. Ross good to have you with us this afternoon. Thanks for taking a break from digging through the 29 pages of earnings that we got from the company. What sticks out to you because we got shares down about 4.7% in the after hours. Yeah it sticks out as an amazingly good quarter considering the operating environment. I was like super excited to see that not only to second Ross where shares are down by 4% right now. What was so amazing about that? Well that's after hours we haven't had actually heard the conference call yet and I think what we're going to hear in the conference call is that cyber truck production so there was a big change in the charts that they put in the release and where they put where each vehicle is in production they change cyber truck and semi so it now says that cyber truck is now tooling and semi truck is in early production. This is a massive change for Tesla in their future now that they are officially announcing the beginning of production of their truck business and that's what we're going to see in the conference call and once the goofballs in the after hour trading hear this stuff and you start thinking about 20-23 numbers for Tesla when these factories are at a production level where they're not eating so much capital and you're looking at a very exciting year for Tesla next year. Well I mean I'm going through a live blog which is such great analysis because it just pulls on so many different people from across the Bloomberg Universe that covers Tesla and it says one thing that we're hoping to get a little bit more color on during the call Tesla says it continues to expect 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries over a multi-year horizon that's their words not explicitly saying it will hit that target this year and are down a hole saying Tesla will need a big fourth quarter to hit that rate for 2022 what's your analysis on that? Well my analysis is that they will be around that rate of return of growth over the long term just based off their factory growth and installation. I really think it's kind of like what happens every year with Tesla where they're just a little bit shy of their number so they'll end up growing 48% set of 50 and everybody say oh look at the big miss and I'll say can you name any company growing at 50% that's a $800 billion company and they'll say no and I said there's very few small companies growing at 50% and so I think people have to keep in mind this amazing growth from this company that can grow 50% into the sky you know boy it's impressive I love when your voice goes up and octave when you're talking about Tesla? Well it's crazy it's crazy numbers you know I did the apple thing I started with apple was a kid and and I remember when the iPhone came out and and everybody pooped it or when Netflix came out and everybody said oh they'll never get to 200 million people and all this kind of stuff and you're seeing when Tesla started and we started with Tesla all the naysayers will never make cars they'll never make them in scale and now we're talking about can they achieve 50% growth for the next five years every year it's like this is incredible right yeah and I should say that just looking at our blog battery supply finger does a key constraint on EV growth hey Russ let's talk a little bit about average selling price on our live blog we've got a great one going down a hole whose auto's reporter along with Sean McCain she's noting that Gene Munster from loop says that average selling prices were lower than expected which could explain why they missed on revenue are you seeing some pricing pressure given there's so much competition or there there will be so much competition for Tesla vehicles EVs moving forward no no I mean why do you think that was a mess there the average selling price was lower why is that I think that first well I don't know if that's true I might have to do with the actual car mix because they might have sold a lot of the low-end cars to the rental that's what I was thinking too yeah like some stuff so model three is going to them and they have to fill some of the order to her hurts and stuff you know like yeah just like not make them and those cars I think were priced around 50 thousand not the average sell,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4658,2022-10-19 20:23:14
16313, uh... deal or uh... not make them and those cars i think we're price around fifty thousand not the average selling of a model wise more like sixty five or seventy you know uh... so you know you have to look at auto mix but once again i think we spent a lot of time looking at minutiae numbers which i'm not saying that there's no value in it there is some value in it but you've got to look at the tree not just the leaves here and this tree is growing like amazingly well and and so there's little things you can pick out why don't they pick at the three point two billion in cash flow which is up substantially from last quarter i mean just their cash flow look at their cash on their books going up over two billion dollars three billion dollars you know of cash added to the books i mean this is a highly profitable company as they grow at a very high rate i mean these are important things for investors to really think about our talk with ross gerber co-founder present and see a girl or calisaki wealth on investment management on the phone from sentiment a california hey so help me out here ross the stocks down as we said three percent the after-res we'll see what the trade is tomorrow it is down about thirty seven percent this year part of that you know let's not forget there's a backdrop of elan musk's forty four billion dollar bit by twitter and concerns over slowing economy higher inflation rising interest rates a lot of macro issues at play would you be buying either in the after hours are potentially tomorrow if the stock is down well i never buy anything the after hours and i caution investors to do that because it's such a illiquid market so i think it's a dangerous thing but we are typically buyers of tesla when the valuation which is this level i personally you know have recently added to my personal tesla position in my fund gk it is all you know our largest position as well and i think for investors that look at the valuation of tesla today and it's great rate i think that it represents a very good opportunity for investors who want to buy the stock and own it for the long term tesla has risk like all other companies but they've executed marvelously in a d difficult operating environment and i think as the environment gets easier next year because it will tesla is going to be in a wonderful place so investor investors have to think about the next year or two not the next month or two and i think if you look at tesla from that perspective there are no other companies in the world that can compare what's interesting though is in the next year to we're going to be seeing new e-v models from four gm Volkswagen not to mention the higher end players as well there's just out within a city it's not just tesla right they're not the only game in town anymore so how does tesla compete there and i'm talking in the long term here ross so there's two issues in one is your absolutely right and there are so many cool e-v's coming out from companies like poll star and rivion and forward and many others even the Volkswagen i-D4 i'm seeing around you know but what's happening is people are replacing gas cars they they it has nothing to do with like all i'm going to buy this e-v or that e-v it's it's it's that they're leaving the gas cars and they're all going to e-v's so every company that makes an e-v is going to sell the e-v and it doesn't matter who it is who's really the loser here are companies like ranger over that don't have an e-v that now are competing directly with rivion for example and rivions are beautiful cars that in my mind is really going to take ranger over business not tesla's business you see what i'm saying and then the second mode that Tesla has is the software you know you mentioned that i drive a test that i was about to say well half the time i don't drive the test i don't think you should say that on air Ross yeah really a lot of you that really drives me you know half the time now on l.a. city streets and so we're not far away yes real big you know a i so if i see you out on the road go the other way ranger so you're saying honestly truth is my wife prefers autopilot yeah i think i could see that with my husband or he could see it with me that's for sure at ross Gerber thank you so much present CEO Gerber Cowell saki wealth and investment management on the phone from the center monica california tesla shares still down about 4% in the aftermarket,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4659,2022-10-19 20:27:36

16316," All I do appreciate that earnings recap for us. Want to get back to one of the companies reporting after the closing bell. We're talking about IBM. That stocks down. No, forgive me. Up about 5% here in the aftermarket. Yeah, the company reported better than expected sales. It affirmed it's cash flow forecast and a sign that demand for software, mainframe computers, and hybrid cloud services remain steady. We've got honor, Rana with us, senior software and IT services analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. It's with us in the Bloomberg interactive broker's studio. So you've had about 25 minutes. No pressure. No pressure. No pressure. What sticks out to you, Anaraga? I talked about it's the company affirming its cash flow forecast. And obviously investors are pretty happy with what they see, which shares up close to 5%. What sticks out to you? So the consulting growth is really strong. Software growth is really strong. Red Hat is really strong. So I would say this is really reassuring for all enterprise tech spending companies that we haven't seen a slowdown yet. I think it's going to come, but so far, so good for enterprise tech spending. The one question that we do have is that they're taking up revenue guidance for the full year, but they're not taking up free cash flow guidance. So I think they're going to explain quite a bit more on the call of why that's the case, whether it's rising costs or any other reasons. All right, so that's significant. I do wonder about, how do you think about IBM in the bigger, broader tech space here? This was a company that you go back 20 years, and it was just so much a part of the market landscape, the tech landscape, or 100 years. Or 100 years. I can go back that far. So if to say we think about it differently. Yeah, so I think IBM has always had a good record of reinventing themselves. But I would say that somewhere in the middle of 10, 15 years ago, they got into this whole run of trying to figure out more buybacks or earnings bridge. You know, the thing rather trying to figure out where the next big investment is going to come from. So financial engineering versus, yeah, you could say that. But I, you know, buybacks and things like that. But I would say that the Red Hat acquisition has changed the shape of the company, the way it looks, the way it's embracing their rivals. Because they're never going to be able to compete with either Amazon Web Services or Microsoft in Cloud computing. But what they have found is through Red Hat, a nice way to sell a hybrid cloud solution or a product to enterprises where they're saying, you know, you will still maintain a very big on-premise presence. Why don't you use the Red Hat architecture to build a hybrid cloud environment where you can use your on-premise world as well as connected to Amazon or on Microsoft if you need to? What about its AI technology? It's something that the company's talked up a lot, at least on the public side of things for the last decade or so. Or if you've got to even longer than that with Watson. What does it do for the bottom line? Exactly. Yeah, those numbers weren't that impressive. There were single digits. But once again, Red Hat was very strong, 17, 18% in constant currency. That's a very good number. The AI part, again, I wouldn't fault them quite a bit. I think they had the right technology, but the use cases are very difficult to find in that case. It's not as, I would say, broadly accepted at this point. So you're right, the marketing was there, but I think the marketing right now is about hybrid cloud. You talk about, all right, so hybrid cloud, that's where they're focusing on, but you talk about that they're never going to be in AWS. Why not? Well, because AWS, they're not in that business to be very fracked. But should they be? Nobody should be in trying to compete with AWS or Microsoft in basic computing, it's like electricity. You don't want to be in the electricity generation business. You want to provide some value ad. You want to provide a wide-cloth service to customers. And I think that's where IBM is, because of two reasons, you're going to get higher margins on it. You don't need to spend that much capex to develop data centers around the world. Now, Amazon and Microsoft's point of view, which is want to be the world's computer to do all the processing, we don't really care what you build on top of it. So it's a two different mindsets, and I'm really glad that IBM is working very closely with them. Because if I go back six, seven years, they really wanted to take these guys head to head at that point, and I think that was not a smart strategy. Well, investors certainly like in their strategy right now. Stock still up just shy, if I percent. We got to talk for an exchange here, because the company does get about half of its revenue from outside the US. Gosh, it started. The concern started about a little more than six months ago, and we got that warning from Microsoft about what the impact of strong dollar would be. How did micro how did IBM fair again? It's a it's negatively impacted them and it'll continue to negatively impact over the next six to nine months. This is not going away. It is going to be a big factor for every.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4662,2022-10-19 20:40:56
16317," How did IBM fare again? It's a it's negatively impacted them and it'll continue to negatively impact over the next six to nine months. This is not going away. It is going to be a big factor for every US based company. But the question is, is it changing the behavior of enterprises? Not yet so far, meaning, meaning is a enterprise outside of the US going to buy something from IBM because it could look expensive? Yes, but that's not happening at this point. It will eventually in next year because the problem happens is every year companies decide on a tech budget. That happens usually if Jan Feb March timeframe, they spend that money throughout the year and the next year they come back and say, well, what are we buying this year? We've had a very good cycle of five, six years of very strong tech spending, but we're going to next year. I think the companies will say, you know, what maybe we hold off and upgrading something for another year or so year because that product in their local currencies becoming more expensive. Now they've come to the companies to figure out how they're going to price some of these products. So I think so far, so good, but I think eventually it will hurt. All right, great analysis. As always, Anna Raghurana, he is our Bloomberg intelligence senior software and IT service analyst joining us here in studio. IBM shares still up about 4.8% in the aftermarket. Let's get to world national news and Nancy Wilhands and DC. Hey, Nets. Thanks to him, Russian President Vladimir Putin is doubling down on his invasion of Ukraine and extending martial law for the four regions he illegally annexed. The actions come as Ukrainian forces continue to press their advance against his troops. Putin told Russia security council today, existing military law regimes in those four regions should be extended. President Biden says it shows that Putin's only tool is to brutalize Ukrainian citizens. British Prime Minister Liz Trust is standing to find against calls for her to resign. Trust faced her critics during a stormy session, a parliament today telling members she's a fighter, not a quitter. I have made mistakes. But the right thing to do in those circumstances is to make changes, which I've made and to get on with the job and deliver for the British people. Trassus come under fire for her failed economic plan, even members in her own party are calling for her to go. Democrat Stacey Abrams is getting more star power behind her hard fought rematch for Georgia governor. Oprah Winfrey is getting behind the Abrams campaign. The media mogul sent an email to supporters today, inviting them to a webcast tomorrow and asking for a $5 donation to Abrams campaign against Republican incumbent Brian Camp. Abrams has been leading in the fundraising race by about $17 million, but is trailing in the polls. Winfrey is just the latest star to get behind Abrams. Singer John Legend has been sending out fundraising appeals on her behalf for weeks in Washington. I'm Nathan Hager, Bloomberg Radio Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg.

16319," daha if headlines and breaking news 24 hours a day at Bloomberg dot com. The Bloomberg business and at Bloomberg quick tape. This is a Bloomberg business flash. From Bloomberg World, Hanquanters, I'm Charlie Pellet, lots of earnings after the close of trading today. Tesla case in point, Tesla shares down after ours, dropping by about 3%. It did report third quarter sales that fell short of some Wall Street estimates citing the dollars growing strength along with production and delivery bottlenecks revenue, $21.5 billion dollars that was shy of analyst projections of 22.1 billion. IBM shares up by about 3% after ours. IBM reported ballot and expected sales. It also affirmed its cash flow forecast and Alcoa posted a quarterly loss missing analyst estimates Alcoa after ours plunging by roughly 9%. US stocks under pressure today, Treasury owed soaring to multi year highs. Right now, the 10 years at 4.13% 2 year 4.55% S&P tumble 24 points down 7.10 of 1% the Dow today lower by 100 points. A drop there are three 10s. As stacked down 91 a decline of 9.10 of 1% gold down 1.4% 1629. The ounce West Texas in immediate crude of 3.8% 86 even a barrel. I'm Charlie Pelic that is a Bloomberg business class. All right, Charlie. Thank you so much. Wrap it up today with an incredible story from Blueburg Business week. It's about a book by the former CEO Morgan Stanley. We're talking about John Mack who you would recall. Led Morgan Stanley during the financial crisis as our title of our story suggests into a crisis and regrets little or so the story goes. We've got Max Abelson with us right now. He joins us on the phone from Brooklyn. Anything Max writes is a treat. And I have to say Max, this story does not disappoint. We were reading it out loud in the news. Oh my goodness. Again, another of your stories that we're reading out loud in the newsroom. You two are so, so generous. I mean, it was it was honestly fun to read the book and it was fun to read the piece. And you know, in a way I can pay, I can pay John Mack like one of the highest and like Wall Street reporter compliments that I can think of, which is that his book in some ways really brought to mind Michael Lewis is, you know, absolute masterpiece, Slire's poker because you know, what made that book fun in the 80s was the sense it gave of being an outsider and really getting a taste of Wall Street. I think at the time of the Salmon Brothers. And Max book is sort of like a cousin to it, but you get to hear from the boss like the John Good friend, I think in Lier's poker, you really get to hear his internal monologue and that made it really fun for me. Well, what is his internal like? How do you describe his internal monologue here? Because this is a guy who's, you know, he's pretty complex like all of us. There's this, you know, outward sort of, you know, if you show up to work wearing shorts, he'll report you to your boss. He'll, you know, if you're away from the desk, he'll push everything off your desk, but he's also a joke star, right? Putting salmon sushi inside phone pieces for a few days before they start to smell. Max, how would you describe what goes on internally? Yes, that's right. That's right. The sushi in the phone really stuck in my memory as well. I really would not want you to do that to me as a colleague. But, but, but, you know, Mac is the reason that the book was so much fun for me to write about is that Max personality, the personality that he sort of portrays in the book is something really essential on Wall Street, which is a sort of the book is, I think the phrase we use in the piece is that it's an atlas of Wall Street ego that really does give you a sense of the clothes that he wears and the French restaurant that he goes to and the, you know, coach K, we can get on the phone and his life is a golfer and his life as a prankster. He, he, it also gives a really, really good sense. Most, mm..",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4665,2022-10-19 20:53:55
16320," as a prankster, he also gives a really, really good sense most of all of how he sees himself. I really, really enjoyed the way that Max sort of self describes, which is actually a phrase of my elder James Harmey uses self-describes. He sees himself as courageous and honest and strong and also a horse whisper at one point. It's a really, the book gives a really wonderful sense of how a powerful financial executive sees himself. And I feel like, you know, I honestly recommend that you read it. I feel like it really, it will really stick in my memory. You know, it's funny that comment about shorts and like calling somebody on the carpet, I guess around the office. If I recall, I thought it was Aaron Sorkin's book on the financial crisis where John Mack, when he was getting... Andrew Ross Sorkin's? Yes, oh, I'm sorry, what did I say? Aaron. Oh, Aaron Sorkin, Andrew Ross Sorkin, right? But similar though, that's a so good compliment, Carol. Well, but didn't he, didn't John Mack when he was getting the check to save basically Morgan Stilling in the financial crisis? I think he was in shorts and he had a borrowed jacket because it was a Japanese bank. No, no, no, this is a nice way to do it. That is a great memory, Carol. You know, I actually really like Andrew Ross Sorkin's book on the financial crisis. It might, it might be my favorite book about the 2008 crisis. And it's a wonderful memory that John Mack wears shorts because he chews out a colleague wearing shorts. But you know, Carol, the, you know, the thing that really sticks out in my mind is, you know, he depicts himself as a really, really intense guy. He has a piece of art in his office that's like a head being impaled by something between the eyes, you know, between the eyes. He really does give a wonderful sense of what he must have been like to work with. And you know, the speaking of Andrew Ross Sorkin's book and financial crisis, you know, Carol, the thing that I felt disappointed by was that he sort of snaps his fingers and takes us from Christmas to 2007, basically, the Lehman Weekend. And I wanted more from him like I would have loved to hear what the beginning of 2008 was like, which is, I, my memory that's what you think it fails about. I wanted more of that, not like reading the book. I agree. Like, right, because I think that's what I loved about that book because it just, it felt like you were flying the wall in terms of when the financial crisis was coming down. We're speaking with Max Abelson. He reports on Wall Street's money and power. His latest about John Maxx new book, Up Close and All In. Max, what about the time period that that Mac kind of oversaw on Wall Street? It goes from, you know, a state business, as you write, of quiet corporate advisors to a multi-trillion dollar industry of globe-trotting trading giants that became too big to fail. It's so nice to talk to you to about my journalism, because you both are obviously such close readers of the story and it really makes me feel good to feel, I can really tell how engaged you are in the writing and reporting. He's lots of me. Well, let me answer your question this way. You know, he, when John Mac gets to Morgan Stanley, the company has like 100 people or something like that. I mean, don't, don't hold me to it. It might be 95 or somewhere around that, but it's a small company. You know, for decades Wall Street was really the stuff of advising corporations or advising rich people or advising governments. And, you know, there was not, they had not yet become these multi-trillion dollar central companies that we think of too, or too big to fail as it were. And Maxx career is really fun to follow, because you see, you know, I, we began by mentioning Michael Lewis's book in the 80s. His career sort of takes us from the early 70s when it's a much different business to the sort of smoky curse word filled halls of the 1980s. And then, of course, the reason that we think of Mac is that he returned to Morgan Stanley in 2005. And in those years, 2005, 2006, 2007, he oversaw a company that took a lot of risk. And that is not the reason that we had a global financial crisis, you know, obviously complicated interlinking story. But Maxx era at Morgan Stanley really typifies an era of risk taking that obviously led to bad results. And, you know, I have to say he does address that. He addresses it briefly. You know, he moves on pretty quickly, but he does say he basically apologizes for taking excessive risk, which I thought was like really memorable. But I'm going to use that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4666,2022-10-19 20:58:12

16322," From the heart of where innovation, money and power collide. In Silicon Valley and beyond, this is Bloomberg Technology with Emily Chang. Welcome to a special edition of Bloomberg Technology, I'm Emily Chang at the National Association of Broadcasters Conference in New York City. Coming up in the next hour, mixed results, Tesla Falls following its earnings report saying battery supply constraints will be the biggest hurdle going forward. We're going to have all the details. Plus, Clona is rolling out a new product to make it easier to shop on the platform, but the buy-out pay later giant facing headwinds with consumer confidence plummeting Clona CEO with us later this hour. And how has the direct consumer trends survived potential recession? The co-CEO of the IWARE Darling Corp Parker will talk to us about the evolution of DTC in 2023. All that in a moment but I want to get straight to the markets, Bloomberg's at Ludlow here, of course, at Dincey the rally or the comeback that some were hoping for. Yeah, two-day gains and we're done. You look at the NASDAQ 100, softer by 4.10% of 1%. The story really a push higher in yields with multi-year highs across the curve, but there was a pocket of outperformance in semiconductors, the Philadelphia Cicaducture Index or SOX, up 8.10% of 1%. And this kind of quasi-risk off attitude of the market. You look at Bitcoin trading pretty sideways in recent sessions in a narrow range between 19,000 and 20,000 US dollars per token. There were some bright spots in the market. I'm an optimist. It's Wednesday. Let's talk about Netflix jumping by the most since January of 2021. We know the story. We know the time. In April 2021. We've got $1.10 billion subscribers added in the quarter. More than double what the firm had estimated. But the streets seems very sanguine and optimistic about the prospects of an ad-supported tier of subscription. And what that will do to grow Netflix's revenue and subscriber base going into 2023. Of course, the big one after the Bell was Tesla. on the top line since the third quarter of last year, but a beat in terms of EPS, a dollar, five cents a share, the estimate was for a dollar and one cents a share, currency headwinds, higher input costs, challenges with logistics at the end of the quarter, delivering vehicles, which we already knew about. They're also having ramp issues when it comes to the next gen of 4680 sale, both in Berlin, Germany and Austin, Texas, that is impacting profitability. Crucially, reiteration of guidance, average annual growth of 50%. First nine months of this year, they're tracking at a rate of 45% they have worked to do in the fourth quarter. All eyes turned to Elon Musk and the earnings call, we want to know about him and what he's going to be doing going forward. If indeed he does buy Twitter, he's going to be a very busy man. All right, I'd love to know. Thank you. I want to continue with Tesla now and for that, we bring in Dan Ives of what security Dan's so good to see you here. Great to be here. Thanks for coming down. All right, what's your take away from the results we just saw? I think clearly the three Q do every miss. There was an expectation that revenues could be light. I think margins will be a focus. Came in light there. The street was hoping ultimately for a better margin performance. But I think really the headline, sticking to the underlying 50% growth for the year in terms of deliveries. So the conference call is going to be key in terms of, are they back and away from that? Clearly they're not. It shows the China growth story still continues to be there. And that's really going to be the bull bear to be coming out of this call. Let's talk about the demand story you see. And what do you see is the difference between the US and China. I know there have been some concerns about weight times in China shrinking, which counterintuitively is maybe a not good sign. Sure. I think in China, productions ram three acts. So if you look at weight times what's happened there, that's going to start to stabilize. But ultimately the production at a China continues to really increase. And look, that's the hearts and lungs of the Tesla bull story in terms of China. Now if you look what's happened from a macro perspective, clearly we're seeing softness. But we believe what we're seeing in Tesla is much more logistics driven, rather than demand driven. And that in my opinion is why I think this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4668,2022-10-19 21:07:11
16323," We're clearly we're seeing softness, but we believe what we're seeing in Tessas, much more logistics driven, rather than demand driven. And that, in my opinion, is why, you know, I think this is just more massive speed bumps they're navigating, but ultimately from Musk, it's a moment of truth. I mean, this is the time to sort of navigate through the turbulence because investors see a white knuckles. How concerned are you about the battery situation? Look, I'm concerned about it, but ultimately as we go into first half of next year, I believe that does start to stabilize. I still believe demand is out tripping supply for Tesla. And that's why it's all about can they fulfill two million units in terms of going to 2023. If they can, then Tesla's a stock that they might be able to be up 40, 50% from these levels. But in this backdrop, this report, in my opinion, it's most most important conference call probably in the last two and a half, three years. It might also be the last conference call before he buys Twitter, right? A deal could be sealed in a matter of days. And we've seen Tesla shares very much intertwined with what's happening with Twitter. Are you expecting a potential negative impact from that deal? That mean you've talked about. I mean, that's where the Albatross around the Tesla story because ultimately the worry is the financing in this market starts to fall through a bit. Does he have to come up with more capital? Do you see Form 4's? Does he sell an incremental five, 10 billion dollars of Tesla stock to fund Twitter? And that's why the frustration now for the Tesla investors is it feels like Musk is juggling a lot of balls. You got the Twitter situation. And right now he's continuing to trade caviar for two dollars slice of pizza in terms of Twitter stock. Are you worried about the ball juggling? I mean, that's a lot of, a lot of miles in the air. Well, I think that's, that's one of the biggest problems is that Musk is the key to the Tesla story. He's ultimately really the reason that Tesla's been able to get in this position. And I think he really needs to ultimately give investors confidence that he's there, piled on the plane, and you're not ultimately going to see shortfalls as we go into Q4, and especially as we go in 2023. In such a pivotal year for EVs. What do you want to see and what do Tesla investors want to see in terms of his management approach to Twitter? Like not managing Twitter at all? Well, I think part of it as a Tesla investor, you want to ultimately see him navigate this and ultimately give the reins to social media experts that could ultimately be the ones that could try to turn Twitter around. For most, the easiest thing was buying Twitter. The hardest part is going to be fixing it. That's going to be an ever psych uphill battle for Musk in terms of fixing Twitter. But it's a Tesla investor at such a crucial time. You need steady hands. And that's really why this conference call the next few quarters are just so crucial. What I believe is in the history of the Tesla story. Well, and it may be for honestly almost every company given the macro economic conditions that we're facing and Musk will potentially own now multiple companies that are facing these macro economic conditions. What's your outlook over the next six months as we potentially head into a recession and a downturn that could last. Some people are telling me two to three years. Yeah, look, I think in terms of disruptive technology, who are going to be the winners over the next two, three years? Tesla's front and center along with Apple and a handful of other names like Microsoft. When you look at Tesla, as we went back three years ago, look how they navigate through what I view as almost historic challenges. Musk, the challenge is not demand. It's logistics. And if you look at China, I believe this will ultimately be a period of time that Tesla is able to navigate. And I do believe the multiple starts to re-rate. You start to ultimately see margin start to come back. And I think we look at this as just a blip on the radar over and over and over all called five, six years. Cyber truck. What do you want to hear? Okay. Then you want to hear that's coming in 2023 because you got all the Detroit stalwarts that are ready to get those trucks out there. Also, you have Rivian others. This is going to be an arms race in terms of pickup truck for EV. We need to make sure it doesn't keep continuing to get delayed. But it goes back to your navigate in SpaceX, Tesla, now Twitter. And there's, you know, ultimately which kid do you love the most? And that's going to be the issue for Musk because the golden child continues to be Tesla. We hear so much about one shot. Where's my umbrella?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4669,2022-10-19 21:11:13
16324," Ultimately which kid do you love the most and that's going to be the issue for Musk because the golden child continues to be Tesla we hear so much about Gwen shot well at SpaceX. How deep is the bench at Tesla? If his intentions are divided It's no different if if judging stand and we're not playing for the anchor All right, you got your eggs You got you got a bench there, but ultimately Musk is continued to key to the Tesla story They have navigate a bit of a bench for which is be clear. I mean that is the biggest worry right now in the story And of course times ticking next Friday. That's when the Twitter deals supposed to close otherwise We end you a game of thrones and Delaware. All right. I'm gonna let you get away with that Yankees comparison Just because we're in New York 10 eyes What wish so the city here person. Thank you All right Coming up thrillist founder and former group nine CEO Ben Lehrer will join us to talk about the future of media His return to venture and the bets he's placing for 2023. This is Yeah You Yeah You Welcome back at Emily Scheng of the National Association of Broadcasters Conference in New York. I want to look more broadly now at investment sentiment consumer facing investments in particular Ben Lair is Lair Hippo managing partner which manages $12 billion and has invested in companies from all birds to Warby Parker which will be on the show later. Casper and more than also had some interesting job transitions recently so you came back to Lair Hippo full time or how should we talk about your trends? So I was doing two jobs for a long time. I was operating and investing and we sold the operating company in March and so now I'm full time at Lair. So you sold Group 9 Media at a Vox? Yes. So talk about the media space first and then we'll move on because there's just so much disruption there, there's contraction there. What is the future of the media business?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4670,2022-10-19 21:14:45
16325," Let's talk about the media space first and then we'll move on because there's just so much disruption there there's contraction there you know What is the future of the media business really hold? I think I think it's a tough market You know my perspective has changed a lot we were very active at Lyrahip O investing in media and we're the first investors in Buzzfeed and business insider and Wondery and Axios and a lot of stuff that did well. We do almost no media investing anymore I don't really think it's a venture category. I think there's not growth to be had. I think that social media has massively screwed up the industry. I think TikTok more than even Facebook before it is sucking away attention in ways that we never could even Imagine would be the case and the advertising industry is really challenging. I think that there are Going to be winners in the digital media space. I think Vox which acquired our company is one of them but I don't think there's a lot of venture money to fund new businesses and I think there's going to be more and more consolidation You've seen it at you know in traditional media and you're going to see it continue to happen in digital Okay, so let's walk that out a little bit. How does that play out? Where do you see the condolts solidation and Do you see media continuing or on a path to being destroyed? I don't know that I would say seeing a path to being destroyed. I think people want content and I think that you know News media is in a really particularly dark place with what's happened to trust of media in the country and The the business model of news. I think it's very challenged. There's a few organizations that are doing a good job But one of the big problems is advertisers Don't support news media. It's the most important area to put your dollars, but they don't want to be around Donald Trump. They don't want to be around the Warren Russia. They don't want to be around horrible stories and so you see The the industry really suffering and then I think entertainment media is Generally moving in the direction of the creator and so YouTube and TikTok and platforms that empower lots of people to create Reams of sort of generally lower quality and less expensive content are eating up advertising dollars that used to go to premium content creators And it's challenging. So what's that state here? That the truth. I mean really I think I think on one level that I by the way, I don't think the truth is at stake I think the truth is I think that's already Gone for the moment. I mean there is We're in a really really really bad situation. I have little kids and I am terrified for the way that they're going to get truthful information And the problem is that it's right now not good business to invest in the news category and that has to change And I think it will the pendulum always shifts There's a lot of people who want to fix this problem and so we continue to be interested in meeting companies that are doing that So where do you think responsibility lies? Is it advertisers? Is it with social media companies? To the end of the day we live in a you know capitalist society. I think it's hard to Make this about responsibility. I think we have to find business models that make it That work for everyone No one is going to do what's You know, some people will do it's right for the world, but most people are going to do what's right for their wallet and so I Think at the end of the day the the social media companies A huge opportunity was missed 20 years ago to regulate these companies Uh, this all started. I've been sort of learning more about this how this started around September 11th actually Where I think there was a great opportunity to regulate some of these companies that didn't happen and we're now Uh, in a world where they've been allowed to run a mock and they're they're you know, they're monopolies and they've made a really challenging So it's too late for regulations. It's by the way. It's not too late at all and there are amazing brands that do great journalism Um, and again, I will say I continue to be as a Vox board member Biost but also incredibly impressed with the quality of journalism the quality of these communities the diversification of revenue that these companies are generating but It's hard when you see the you know discovery and Warner needing to consolidate and CBS and biocon meeting to consolidate Well, what is that to you to smaller independent brands who want to continue to be independent when when the top of the food chain is joining forces because they're feeling that the pressure from social media Yeah",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4671,2022-10-19 21:19:38
16326," Independent brands who want to continue to be independent when when the top of the food chain is joining forces because they're feeling that the pressure from social media. Yeah. Okay, so let's talk about capitalism since you are continuing to invest. Absolutely. How bad is this downturn? How bad is it going to get? How long is it going to last? And are you finding places to put your money? Or is it? Yeah, so are you just waiting on the sidelines? No, so we are not absolutely not waiting on the sidelines. Our model is to be first money in and we're backing founders who want to change the world and there's still plenty of great founders that want to change the world. And so most of the companies that we back today are going to be raising money in the future in different markets. The markets go out, markets go down. I do think that this downturn is going to be significantly prolonged. I think the public markets have experienced a lot of the pain. Certainly not all of the pain. I think the private markets talk about experiencing the pain but the reality is I think we're probably a year or two years away from really seeing what this looks like once a bunch of companies that have raised capital start to run out of money last year. Everyone got capitalized. You know, let's see what the back half of next year, even the next year looks like. And I think it's going to be rough. So there are going to be some casualties. There's going to be a lot of casualties. Good companies are still going to be just fine. And in fact, I think all the money that's on the sidelines is going to start consolidating around the better companies and you're actually going to see, you're not going to see the valuations go down much. You're going to see fewer companies get funded. So where do you think we're going to see the wreckage and where are you placing your bets? I think you're going to see the wreckage pretty much everywhere. But it's healthy. This is healthy wreckage and when you build companies in an environment where money feels free or cheap, you build companies that are not necessarily as strong with some of the wrong disciplines. And right now we're going to build a new generation of companies that are going to get built the right way. And I'm incredibly optimistic about early stage investing right now. I feel frankly more excited than I ever have. And there's tons of data. Well, there's just, you know, there's so much data that supports the idea that investing one time is tough, produces great companies. I know Neil from Warby's coming on. Neil is a founder who we backed as a seed investment 10 years ago coming right out of the financial crisis. And there's a perfect example of a company that was built in a tough time that built a extraordinary business. And I think you're going to see a new generation of great companies get built just like you do in every downturn. Is this going to be worse than the financial crisis though? I don't know. And honestly, I wasn't enough of a fully formed human during the financial crisis to really have perfect context for it. But I think this is going to be hard. But technology is still enabling unbelievable things. Just look at the way that we were able to. Like whether the last two years. Or if that says anything, it says that technology, even while it's being used in a bunch of weird ways, is ultimately an incredible thing in a place where we can continue to feel good about. All right. Well, that was a reality check. I say do say thank you for having me. Thank you for giving it to us. If you didn't check or code anything, Lara Hippo, managing partner, Ben there. Good to see you again. All right. Coming up the risks of speaking of social media, TikTok user data leaking to China. Still likely, even if the Biden administration forges that security agreement with the video platform, we're going to have details on that. Thank you. Hey.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4672,2022-10-19 21:23:50
16327," music.. Personal data for millions of us tiktok users would still be at risk even if the Biden administration reaches a security deal with the platform's parent by chance that's the findings of a new Bloomberg News Analysis joining us now with the details Bloomberg's at Bloodlow ed explain. Yeah, I mean this is based on interviews with dozens of experts across the fields of data security those that have negotiated these types of deals before when it comes to lawyers and as you say the top line is this that in every scenario even if a deals reach there's run mobility. The only part of it is that there's always going to be a human component right. This is a business that was built in China and even if you separate off the US asset so to speak it's largely going to be somebody in China and Chinese personnel that potentially could fix any issue. You know TikTok has been transparent or relatively so that there are personnel in China that have access to public information from the platform even if not private but basically the range of concerns are worrying and even if they do reach a deal such as the control of syphias and the administration that you know even if they cannot hold TikToks action responsive responsibly they just pull the plug on any deal. How does TikTok currently handle US user data? Yes, so this is a really key point. Currently all user data is effectively siphoned through the United States through servers that are owned by Oracle and hosted in the United States. So the data is housed here and processed in the United States for US users but again the vulnerability that the concern is here is well what if something goes wrong who is the actual human being in charge and in control and able to make a fix? The answer is that person is probably in China. So what is TikTok's position on this? The position is that while they won't comment about talks of the US government in a statement to Bloomberg they think they can reach a deal. You know they've tried a number of mechanisms over the years including selling a stake of the company to reflect the US user ship to the likes of Oracle and Walmart that did not go well but what you see on your screen is the company's position. They're trying to get this done and they're hoping that the data management process through Oracle and ideas like supervision from various US government bodies can get it done. Alright, I'd love to know. Thanks for breaking that one down for us. Coming up, Clarenate out with new tools that the company says will help with a new era of shopping.

16329," A new search tool that will compare prices across thousands of retailers and even enable shoppers to filter by color size ratings. Klarna, CEO Sebastian Shemmyakowski is with me now in person, so good to see you. Not so much. And for the first time. Indeed. You say this will usher in a new era of shopping. How so? Good question. Well, I think it's really exciting to see. One fun aspect of this is just that, you know, due to the dominance of one of the biggest retailers in the world here in the US, it's almost like put a little bit stop to development of great services on the shopping side because they were so dominant. And in Europe that wasn't really a case. So what we've taken here is a service that has been highly appreciated by consumers in Europe, which is about comparison, finding products, finding prices and all this. And then basically, you know, taking it to the US market. So I'm super excited about it. Can you give us any details about just how successful Klarna Spotlight has been in Europe? And what makes you think you can challenge US big US tech giants in the area? Yeah. Well, you have to try. We'll see if we can. But, you know, I think the, it's huge in the sense that in a lot of countries where this service has existed, it is the starting point for people's shopping experience. So they go there, they start there, they find the products, you know, they get, they learn about it, and then they go further to the retailer. So it is really the starting point. It's really, really big. And you're also integrating shoppable video, which I know, Gen Z loves. What do you think the impact of that can be? I think it, I mean, to us to be honest right now is the marketing side of our services has grown tremendously. We actually do now business with half of the top 100 US retailers for marketing services. And the problem we have is our demand is much higher. It's four or five times higher than supply. So one of the ideas here is just to see how can we get the audience that we already have in the app, 30 million Americans are using the app. How can we provide it with more interesting content so that we can also grow, you know, offer more supply for everyone who wants to market in that environment? So let's take Meta specifically, obviously, that Facebook and Instagram. And they have some of these features built into their apps. What makes you think you can compete with them specifically? Well, I think there will be multiple places to entertain yourself. But I think to some degree, you know, if you look at an Instagram experience, you're doing a lot of things there. You're maybe, you know, watching kitten videos, you're maybe following different type of things. Here, it's very much more around shopping, right? It's very clumsy training around that. So it's different experiences. But I think there will be multiple channels where people have explore content. Inflation is that record highs. Interest rates are changing. How is clarninavigating, arising rate, environment, how is it impacting your business model? Well, what's interesting about it is that we are a bank, fully licensed in Europe. So we have deposits that are funded in the European interest rate environment. We're interested in our markets is too fairly low. So it actually gives us a fairly nice competitive advantage, which is some of the US players from a cost perspective. But in addition to that, also what we are seeing and is in a great, is an actually increasing demand of our product. Because if you think about it, our consumers in the US have saved over $100 million in interest fees, late fees and so forth by using our products, because they're interest free and so forth. So we're talking about the paying for the short term installment of the product. And so there's more demand for that in an interest rate environment that's racing. So we see higher demand and then we have a very efficient cost structure at the exit. Are you taking any action to mitigate potential losses from the NPL? For short. And we've already done that, right? So we did tighten our underwriting both already back in Jan and live it more additionally in April and May. Because there's obviously a different environment that we're going into. So you have to be cautious about that. Now at the same time, people are complaining that their purchasing power is decreasing. Can you explain how you set purchasing power? And if you're reconsidering how you set that, given these changing conditions? Well, I think the big thing to remember is that when people use our product, the average outstanding balance is $75. On the credit cards, it may be like $1,500, right? So in the different things, also, a credit card gives you a limit. And then they push that limit into your face for you to spend more than you should. Watch Netflix, money, explains credit cards, explain. You'll see exactly what they're doing. So the difference with us, we don't do that. We're very mindful. Yes, you can find out about your purchase power, but we're mindful of showing it to you so you don't overspend. And then in addition to that, we take a new decision every time you make a transaction. So in a credit card, you just can spend as much as you can. They just...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4675,2022-10-19 21:37:13
16330," We're mindful of showing it to you so you don't overspend. And then in addition to that, we take a new decision every time you make a transaction. Right, so on the credit card, you just can spend as much as they just want you to max out on your credit card because that's how they make money. For us, we're taking a new decision on every purchase. So actually, that's why our losses are 30% below the credit card industry standards. Do you do that? Now, you've been doing restructuring, and you've been pretty upfront about this. Are you doing more of that? Are you going to have more cuts before the end of the year? How many employees will you have at the end of this year? How much of that is in the US, where I know you were growing quickly? No, I mean, the big restructure that we did was back in May. There's always been, obviously, before that and after that, minor changes to the organization and so forth. But that was the big one. And I think as much as it was very painful and hard, and it's obviously a very sad thing to see amazing colleagues need. But at the same point of time, what I think was good about it was we did it early on. We took the decision. And I'm now hearing from a lot of people that they're coming to those decisions now. So I'm still proud about the fact that we face the fact that times have changed and we acted on it. And I think in the end, that agility was what sets your part. How are you thinking about the IPO, potential fundraising, the changing environment? Well, to some degree, I got the question a year ago, obviously. I'm asking it again. No, no, no, for sure. And then, but I think then, I said, look, I don't like the volatility of this environment. I felt it was a height environment that we were in. And now, it's a little bit different. And my dream has always been to IPO, the company where it's in a similar fashion when Google did it in 2005 was kind of a perfect market. It wasn't like overhived, it wasn't underhived, it was like, it was stable. And you also, we have so much growth left in the US. We're still growing at 100%. We see tremendous success here. And so I want to IPO when there's still that amazing upside left. Like Google also had, obviously. We're now thinking about the, I think, that market cap was $25 billion when they, you know. So you want that. So I think we're getting close to that spot in time. OK, so I won't have to ask you this question next time. No, we'll see. We'll see. OK, so fashion's so great to have you. CEO of Karnat. Good to see you here in person. Thank you for having me. All right, coming up, is this fair market going to be the best opportunity to invest in crypto for the long term? Some banks seem to think maybe. We will discuss next. This is Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4676,2022-10-19 21:41:58
16331," [♪思音楽 Moi Doubledirector Chat 아이돌 PG& подарco生活 anaritan tassels 쓸 человек For big coin, it's about the macro, but for the rest of crypto, right? The Ethereum ecosystem and all the other, you know, layer one and layer two blockchains being built. And what's built on top of them? That's an inevitable march to starting to change how we actually operate. And there's tremendous amount of venture capital that continues to come in the space, five billion last quarter and nine billion the quarter before that. If you look at from Citadel to JP Morgan to Bank of New York, BlackRock, the biggest players in traditional finance are actually making huge investments in and around this architecture. That was some of Galaxy Digital, Mike Novogratz interview earlier on Bloomberg television and Kavita Gupta is the founder of the Delta Blockchain Fund and investor in Web 3 focused startups and joining me now here at the NAB conference. So do you agree with Novogratz there? A part of it, yes, right? Because all these institutional money is coming into crypto. The point is, is it coming at the tech side? Is it coming at HFUN crypto microside? Some of the HFUNs are directly going only for internal dashboards. They are not really contributing to a builder economy as we call it on the tech side. But yes, is that affecting crypto prices good and bad? Yes. But at the same time, institutional banks like JP Morgan or Goldman Sachs, I think are taking dual bets. They are going both on the crypto now partnering with Coinbase and other platforms to be unable to have their private firm managers to have that asset class. But they also are investing in like circle and figure like bunch of other technology companies too. Is now the time to invest? Should everyone buy the dip? Is it a dip though? We have the kind of business. Seems like a dip to me or maybe it's going to go further down or maybe it stabilizes here. My personal opinion is not a financial. It's not a financial advisor. I want to make that way clear. But my personal opinion is it's not the bottom yet. I stick to my prices which couple of months back I said. I still remind us what those were. I'm not further than you. I'm not further than you have to fall. In my personal opinion, if I would be buying it, I'm still holding my personal capacity. I am going to go into either somewhere between 600 to 800. I'm going to go into Bitcoin somewhere between 12 to 14K. And I still think this December too much. We're going to see the dip. It's not there yet. That's what we are telling our investors and our investor update. Okay. So let's say you come in at that, at those prices, how long are you going to have to wait to see some gains? How long is this downturn going to last? How tied to the downturn is crypto? I feel like crypto is a very unique case. It does go down when the whole market is going down. It also sometimes is the one of the first commodity or the security to go down. But if you look at last time during COVID, it was also one of the first asset class that started going up. So I do believe that 2024 is going to be good for crypto. We're going to see all time high, maybe summer around May, June, July. I don't think we have to be in the dip for more than 14 months starting from January. Okay. What areas of the blockchain do you think come back first or are going to be the best fats for? Let's say next year. Infrastructure. Lot of indexing, cross-chain analytics, lot of like hardcore institutional adoption problems what happened to blockchain and supply chain, what happened to blockchain and to market securities, lot of Web2 problems where blockchain came and said, hey, we're going to revolutionize it. But then the bullish market came and everybody was excited about defile and NFT like the whole crypto native use case. I feel like the dip market is where the builders are going to come out and the billion dollar",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4677,2022-10-19 21:45:56
16332," The flash market came and everybody was excited about DeFi and NFT, like the whole crypto native use case. I feel like the dip market is where the builders are going to come up and the billion dollar institutional adoption, not with respect to crypto but technology in the real infrastructure problems are going to take take and care. So looking forward, what are your biggest concerns? What should investors or people who are thinking about becoming investors? Retaking or taking investors. Right. Both. Crypto investors, I love saying by the dip, stay in the space, experiment with some of that crypto in the real use cases and if you want to have an exit, have an exit. For the tech investors, I would say builders are going to continue to build. So people who go through the bearish market and build their product and come up in the bullish market are the founders you want to stick to. So I'm very excited about this. Alright, Kavita Gupta, Delta Blockchain founder, good to have you on the show and see you in person. Thank you for stopping by. Alright, coming up, we're going to talk about the world of direct consumer through the lens of a War B Parkers Co-CEO Neal Blumenthalas with us next. This is Bloomberg. It's great. with a pandemic prompting a big shift towards e-commerce. Retail companies are rethinking everything from the customer and the employee experience online and off to just how many physical stores to open. That's the challenge facing Warby Parker and it's co CEO Neil Blumenthal with us now. So I'd love to hear how your strategy is evolving in a post-pandemic world. You obviously have this thriving online business. You had to close 120 stores during the pandemic but now you've opened almost 200. How do you find the balance of how many and how much? Yeah, I think the key is to have a multi-channel approach and to constantly meet customers where they want to be met and we know that customers are shopping as they live physically and digitally and thankfully because we're direct to consumer because we have those direct relationships with our customers we're able to get feedback and hear from them and that helps.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4678,2022-10-19 21:49:58
16333, and digitally and thankfully because we're directed consumer because we have the direct relationships with our customers we're able to get feedback and hear from them and that helps us you know our e-commerce business helps us dictate where we should open up stores similarly you know we're able to invest in high exams and virtual vision tests that then make it easier for people to buy online or in store. Consumers are paying more for everything from gas to groceries. How are you evolving to meet their needs in a high-inflation environment you know you talked about feedback what feedback are you getting and how are you responding to that. Yeah we're hearing from customers that value is super important and we always think about value as that price to quality ratio so being able to sell 95 dollar glasses instead of you know the four or five hundred dollars that they would cost elsewhere what we've seen is competitors but also other retailers and other categories right over the last like year or two raised prices now only to you know do heavy discounting as they've established a large inventory you know we've been able to be more consistent with our customers and keep pricing like as it's been over the last few years so that way we can have simple unified pricing just make it easy for our customers and we think that we continue to deliver exceptional value will continue to gain more and more market share. So let's talk about what's the main strategic driver of market share gates you know are you going to keep focusing on the US think more broadly. So we'll continue to focus on the US we'll continue to open up stores we'll have open 40 stores this year while investing in our online experience you know in particular our virtual vision test which enables people to renew their prescription online through our iOS app or our virtual try-on we've also been really investing in contacts and that's a business that's been growing over a hundred percent at a year for us so we're finding our customers really want to come to us for a one-stop shop for a holistic vision care experience. So talk to us about the criteria to reopen stores or to open new stores I should say given the potential for the footprint to be what 900. Yeah so where are these going to be are they in malls are they elsewhere? They're in malls they're street location transportation hubs you know throughout the pandemic right we saw massive sort of shifts in traffic as people's routines change and we saw you know traffic increase in our suburban locations and big delta's between sort of urban and suburban locations we're seeing that start to narrow now especially after Labor Day as you know a lot of offices have reopened and a lot of folks have started to return to sort of their you know pre-pandemic routines you know for us again we're opening up stores close to our customers so whatever is easiest for them to to shop at that's where we'll be. Airports I feel like there's always a high-gloss store at the airport. That's true. What are the trends you know is it the thick rims is it thin rims is it cat eyes what are consumers want right now? So what's a little disturbing is I was just visiting some stores in the Bay area and we had customers coming in asking for Jeffrey Dahmer glasses because of the Netflix series which just sick right the guy was a monster but I guess might be driving you know some fashion. Anything else let's end on a happier note. Right. What do people want to wear right now aside from that? I think people are looking for some bright colors and just some happiness over the last two years right which has been really tougher for us Americans. So monster or bright colors. Right. That's the backtrack. Okay. At Neil Lumenthal Kosey of Wardwood Park. Good to see you. Thanks for having me. Okay. I want to get back to Tesla now Bloomberg's Ed Ludlow has been listening into the call. Ed what are you hearing from Elon? Hearing a lot from Elon apparently it's going to be an epic end to the year the fourth quarter will have record breaking deliveries but actually we got some more granularity on that from CFOs that court court who said that actually even if production is at an annual growth rate of 50% all told by the end of this year delivery will fall just short of 50%. Elon's talking about the idea of a b-,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4679,2022-10-19 21:54:16
16334," Even if production is at an annual growth rate of 50% all told by the end of this year, delivery will fall just short of 50%. Elon's talking about the idea of a buyback, which has been really important for investors. He said a $5 to $10 billion buyback is possible next year pending board approval. It's something that a lot of investors have been calling for. And the kind of big one that jumped out, out of nowhere, was that Elon sees a path for Tesla to have a greater market cap than Apple and in the long run twice the market cap that Saudi Aramco has. So that shows his confidence in where this company is going. Quite a proclamation even from someone like Elon Musk. Are we expecting to hear anything from him about the potential Twitter deal or for him to take questions about what this would mean for Tesla investors? So just like in previous quarters, Tesla started by taking questions from retail investors that have voted on the say platform. So that hasn't come up yet, but you would expect it. I think not just the issue of whether Elon Musk has to sell Tesla stock to fund the purchase of Twitter, but there's also this idea of key man risk. How distracted would an Elon Musk be? Who is CEO of Tesla, SpaceX? And we don't know what role he might take at Twitter, but it's something to add to the bit for it to a very busy man. I would say a number of names in the street have come out of late to say Tesla has become a pretty well-machined, exact Kirk on the CFO, is demonstrating on this call that he has come under the numbers and that he's got a pretty clear vision of what their headwinds that Tesla's facing are. What he said so far about the supply story seems like it's not so much of a demand story any more. Yeah. As it is a supply story. Yeah, he really actually underlined that the demand is there. They think they can sell every vehicle they build, particularly in the fourth quarter, the demand is there. On the supply side, one third of all the vehicles delivered in the third quarter came in the last two weeks. We know about the Mads' gamble. The trunnists moved that out, which had boost the cost per vehicle. But this is how Elon Musk put it. There were no boats, there were no trains, and there were no carriers when they got to the end of the quarter. And that's why a number of vehicles were in transit. That's why the third quarter delivery numbers fell short of estimates. And it seems like that's why they missed on the top line for the first time since the third quarter of last year. So he teased some future products early in the call and was just asked about said future products and said, sorry, we can't jump the gun on that. But he did talk a little bit about the truck as I understand it. What did he say? So I think that we've moved to the next stage of Cybertruck, right, which is that it's gone from development stage to tooling stage. In other words, the parts that are going to be used to make the machinery that makes the beast that is the Cybertruck are on their way. It's going to be a 2023 product. The semi truck, the bigger truck, is ahead of schedule to all intents and purposes. And production, early production if that is underway. I kind of the last nugget real quick, M is that FSD beta is expecting a wider quote roll out here in the United States. And he's saying that in many cases, FSD beta in testing with its customer test base is proving to be safe on the road. All right. I'd love to know. Thanks for breaking it down. We'll continue to look to you for more headlines. And that does it for this edition of Bloomberg Technology. We've got a great show coming up Thursday. Ariana Huffington will be with us to talk about what she calls the productivity. Paradox where employees work more, but get less done. And don't forget to check out our podcast wherever you get your podcast. I'm Emily Cheyne in New York. Let's Bloomberg. So",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4680,2022-10-19 21:58:42
16335," Heat였 ufer The Great Siphon Art of the mid-20th century teased the vision of the future with one distinct element and common, a life for humans in outer space. Whether vacationing on an exotic new planet or commuting to the moon for business, space travel seemed like it was just around the corner. Here we are, a half century later, and only about 500 human beings have ever left the bounds of Earth's atmosphere. But thanks to a set of ambitious private companies betting on the promise of space tourism, that long-awaited future could be here sooner than we think. For most of the history of spaceflight, governments have been the prime force behind nearly every aspect, from planning to funding to cruise selection. But as early as the 1980s, proposals for commercial space tourism began to emerge, along with innovative solutions for getting people there, such as the wild concept of sticking a 74-person passenger cabin in the cargo bay of a NASA space shuttle. Although various non-astronauts have been selected for missions over the years, true space tourism didn't happen until 2001. When an entrepreneur named Dennis Tito coughed up an estimated $20 million to hitch a ride with the Russian Federal Space Agency for a week-long vacation aboard the International Space Station. Twenty years later, we're seeing a new contender in this final frontier of tourism. Private companies. It's becoming a private enterprise situation, still very high risk with the high reward, a potential reward. But government is really out of the business of flying people now, and it's really going to be companies like Elon Musk, and Jeff Bezos, and Richard Branson that do that heavy lifting. Commercial space tourism is usually about taking the non-astronaut, the private citizen into an orbital or suborbital flight. So you get a short amount of microgravity experience, and you can float and take some photos. And then you come back. This was something that technology had gotten to a point where the private sector was going to make a business out of this. There are multiple companies that want to get to the place where they fly people into space. The first of these is Blue Origin, founded in 2000 by Jeff Bezos. Using the autonomous rocket system, New Shepard, a tribute to the first American in space, Blue Origin plans to launch up to six passengers at a time, offering a rarefied treat of 62 mile high views and a momentary experience of weightlessness. Boking officially kicked off in May 2021, with the very first C to be auctioned off for charity. Meanwhile, Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic has also been pursuing a viable form of suborbital tourism. Aiming for launch in 2022, once Sir Richard himself has taken a flight. I'm hoping to be able to go to space. I'd love to be able to turn inside it with the marine landing and go to space. So I've got the whip on the team and we'll see how he goes. The company claims to have lined up over 600 seat reservations so far, including Justin Bieber and Leonardo DiCaprio. Virgin has projected that the final cost of the ticket will be at least $250,000, or roughly $50,000 for each of the five minutes or so of weightlessness that you'll get to experience. Although costly, both companies' offerings aim to make suborbital flight a regular form of adventure travel, eventually driving down costs at scale to expand the customer base beyond the orbit of celebrities and billionaires. The third major contender is Elon Musk's SpaceX, which has set its sights even higher on orbital flights, which are... A whole other level of complexity, energy, and danger. When you go suborbital, if you're just going to go up above the Vom Carmen line, which is $100,000,000.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4681,2022-10-19 22:05:43
16336," are a whole another level of complexity and energy and danger. When you go suborbital, if you're just going to go up above the Von Carmen line, which is 100 kilometers or about 62 miles, you only need to get up to maybe 5,000 miles an hour to get up there. And you go basically straight up and then straight back down. You don't have the reentry heating that you would see coming in from an orbital. So when you go orbital, I don't care if you're a baseball or a battleship. You've got to go 17,500 miles per hour, not just 5,000 miles an hour. The energy is involved are much greater. By doing that, SpaceX has gone another level up and that's what they're doing with the Inspiration4. Visit Inspiration4.com for your chance to go to space. Inspiration4 is the first planned all civilian mission into orbit, slated to launch in late 2021. The crew will bring their own set of diverse perspectives and backgrounds and experiences to test how a group of different people, namely people who aren't professional astronauts, could affair in space. Until now, astronauts have had to be physically perfect and this mission is changing that. And so I feel incredibly honored to be representing those who aren't physically perfect. At H10, I was diagnosed with bone cancer and I was treated at St.G. Children's Research Hospital. And I spent a year there undergoing intense chemo and also surgery that ultimately saved my leg. I now work at St. Jude as a PA, a physician assistant, and I work with leukemia and lymphoma patients. The kids we work with are so brave and they are very excited to watch me go to space because this is showing them that they're capable of doing this as well. Haley, along with three other crew members, will spend three days in space orbiting the Earth every 90 minutes before landing back off the coast of Florida. Well, when you think about access, the first astronauts for the United States came from the test pilot side. And so women weren't allowed to be a part of that. We have somebody in their 20s, somebody in their 30s, somebody in the 40s, and somebody in their 50s. And so there can be access in all kinds of way, whether you're talking about age, whether you're talking about gender, whether you're talking about race and ethnicity, and all of those things. The first time people are going up into space and not sent there by super power, like the United States or Russia or China, well that's like really significant. And you've got to be very thoughtful about it. The whole game plan right now is to make space really affordable and accessible for everybody. So you can have fishing buddies going to space someday, but the first is special. And so with that, we wanted to have a crew selection process that could make space available to everyday people. Getting to space is only the first step for space tourism. The next challenge is what to do and where to stay when you get there. Axiom Space is planning to launch the first segment of a new commercial space station in 2024. Their $2 billion project called AxStation would become the first free-flying private international space station or to use a more consumer-friendly term, a space hotel. Axiom isn't the only company out to make your space stay a little more comfortable. Big low aerospace has been building what they call expandable Habitat technology, like their B330, an inflatable pod module that expands once in orbit. There's even one attached to the national space station right now they've been testing it. And you take it up and it's rather small and then you inflate it. And it seems to be working very, very well. This is likely to be the first kind of tourist hotel that you're going to see up in space. First of all, it's easy to carry instead of this giant tin can with all of that. The inflatables are lighter. You can just blow them up and they get a nice big size for about, you know, half the less than half the weight probably. But even as space missions become accessible to civilians. The risks of going to space are incredibly high and you could die a thousand ways that we can think of and a thousand other ways that we can't think of. This is Michelle Hanlon. She's a space lawyer at the Mississippi School of Law focused on protecting humans in outer space. Now I'm not in the turning for any of the space tours so I haven't been privy to their private contracts but I can tell you that the FAA requires certain waivers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4682,2022-10-19 22:10:13
16337," up in the turning for any of the space tours, so I haven't been privy to their private contracts, but I can tell you that the FAA requires certain waivers to be in those contracts. So for example, the FAA says, well, we're not going to make your spacecraft to a certain safety level. We are going to make you spacecraft operator. Make sure that you inform your space tours of all of the hazards that you know of. I imagine a very long waiver all the ways you can die in space. And you have to understand that there's health risks, and you have to indemnify the US government if you are launching from the United States. So those are things that we know a space tourist has to sign and has to wait. So now let's go back and think about our space flight participants. The FAA calls space tours space flight participants. They don't call them astronauts. Why is that important? If you're not an astronaut, there's no obligation to rescue you. But if something goes wrong, it's a lot of money to set up a rescue launch. If it can even be done, it's something really important to think about and that difference as we cross this threshold from having astronauts in space to having real people like me and space. And when we are able to make it to space reliably enough, there's still a host of other legal and ethical issues to consider before space tourism can truly take off. There are so many gaps in space law that we are going to have to put in a lot of sort of basement ideas. And so for example, the outer space treaty is a treaty that offers principles and guidelines for state activities, for the activities of national governments. It doesn't talk about private entities. It doesn't talk about humans in space. So now if something goes wrong, so let's think about all of the times hotels on Earth are sued, right? So slip and false. You step on something in the bathroom. You sue the hotel and it becomes a private lawsuit. Because of the vagaries of international law, if something happens in space, well, boy, you can sue the state that launched your spacecraft. You can sue the company that brought you there. You can sue the hotel. You can sue the individual. You can sue every government related to that. Because the way it leads the outer space treaty and the outer space regime have set this up is that anything that happens in space first has to go through a diplomatic channel before you think about suing an accordive law. And so every single slip and false in a space hotel is a diplomatic nightmare. And so we really need to figure that out before we start sending a lot of people there. You think about human rights in space. Here, we don't think about a human rights oxygen because it's all around us and free. It's not in a space hotel. So what happens if something happens in the oxygen depletes? Who gets the oxygen first? And then, of course, let's not even think about the labor. How do you treat your labor in a space hotel where that person may be there two or three years without coming back to Earth? So a lot of things to think about. Space habitats are more likely in the near future to focus on research missions and be a home for experiments that can't happen as easily back on Earth. Space hotels, I think they garner a lot of headlines and a lot of news. But at the same time, that's not the first thing that you're going to see happen. They don't offer the compelling business case. I think that you'll see from a place that wants to manufacture pharmaceuticals or a new type of crystal or some type of filament or fiber optic cables and other things that you can do with microgravity. The things that are actually a high value finished good when you get that back to Earth and you sell it for a very, very huge profit margin, that's what's likely to happen in space as opposed to having a real estate platform that you sell to a tourist by space hotel. It's really interesting and it will probably happen, but it's not likely to be at the forefront of space commerce. Even if space hotels are right around the corner, don't get too excited about booking a trip in one. It's not a cheap ticket to ride to space and it's going to be, you know, millionaires and billionaires and that sort. But at the same time, you know, the point was made that in the early days of airline trips, that was also a completely unaffordable ticket for most people. Those people who flew were people of means and over time it becomes affordable to the masses and I think that's the goal for...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4683,2022-10-19 22:14:45
16338," those people who flew were people of means and over time it becomes affordable to the masses. And I think that's the goal for all the entrepreneurs in space as well to get those costs down to a point where it's not $10 million or $5 million or $300,000 right into suburbals. But when it becomes more like buying a first class ticket to go to Europe from the United States. So that's the goal and you know the question is can we get to that point? Given the immense operating costs of getting to space, it may be years, if ever, until space tours and becomes a profitable venture for any of these companies. Virgin Galactic, the only publicly traded company of the three, has had a particularly rocky year, initially riding on the momentum of a SPAC deal. But more recently beset by launch delays and major funders including Branson himself selling large quantities of their stock in the company. Space is really really really hard and it's an absolutely shake, but it's one that happens to be very true. It's just really hard to do. That's also the reason that you've seen the delays that you know Virgin had talked about flying years and years ago. And it became such a crazy point that Richard Branson actually stopped talking about it when he was asked because it was never going to be when he predicted. But it's not insurmountable and you know investors have stepped up because this is something that is doable. Despite the astronomical dangers and costs of getting to space, it may ultimately follow the course of other once fanciful modes of travel. Right brothers having you know what was by modern standards of very unimpressive first flight, you know at Kitty Hawk. I mean you know you had like less than 20 years later you had your first airborne ambulances being used to save lives. Fundamentally the world is a more interesting place when people can go and dance among the stars and such. The lure of space is in a it's in our DNA. It's that exploration bug. We are an exploratory species and we want to go out there and see what's out there. That vision that I had in 1969 of seeing normal human beings traveling to space it's finally beginning to happen. When you get a bunch of people up there and they can all see it for themselves that will create even yet another revolution in how we treat our planet and what we think about. So while 2001 came and went without quite looking like Stanley Kubrick's ultimate space fantasy 2021 might finally be the year we're catching up. If you visit California you might be inclined to go to Disneyland or jump in your convertible and take highway one up the coast. We may be make a pilgrimage to Yosemite all very fine choices. But if you're the kind of person who revels in our planets extremes then it's route 395 that year after. This one glorious road will carry you from death valley's desert floor to sky high views of Mount Whitney.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4684,2022-10-19 22:18:39
16339," and Death Valley's desert floor to sky high views of Mount Whitney. You can see the 5,000-year-old bristle cone pines, the oldest living organisms, or the bizarre two-foot towers of Mono Lake. And true to California's boom-and-bust spirit, you can santa around the ghost house of Bodie. What a novel experience to find an empty American city where all the businesses are shut down. To do 395 up right, it helps to have a guide, and mine is a man named Jan. And his crew. So the last one here. Aaron? Let's get to idea. And Lemmy, the hardest partying dog of all time. Jan agreed to show me some of what 395 has to offer, but only if we agreed not to disclose any locations. My name is Jan Swarastra. I'm an industrial designer out of LA, and I spend a lot of time camping, and a lot of time in the Eastern Sierra. It's a place I love. And sometimes I'm known as 395 North because this is my Instagram account. And I don't like to be known as that, but I'm trying to use it to set a good example and do more with it than just social media. We had a cab and we got here, and I was sure we were. This is BLM land on the outskirts of National Forest. And it's one of my favorite places in the world. Basically, everything outdoors wrapped into one. To be with California, man. Oh, man. We have so much National Forest in public land that you can literally just cruise out and find a place to camp. It's ours. What I wish was mine is Jan's sweet truck. It's a 2019 Ford Ranger. It has about 200 watts of solar in it and a fridge and has everything that an RV has except for a toilet. But just on a smaller, simple scale. You drive us around day to day in LA, and then just roll out when you want it. It's my daily driver. Handles great. And then when I'm done with work, I can just bail and go camping and out. So the camper basically has only what I need. Think of it as backpacking with a car. Yeah. The fridge has a couple compartments. This is just a kitchen box. Stove, utensils and a bunch of stuff. This one has just dry food. And when you get inside, there's a bed. The bed flips up so you've got tons of room in here. Miss Hauling. This phenomenal. If you want to pull that over. That's cool. We just popped that out. Sort of. So, home on wheels. Yeah. This is my vacation house. Yeah, it's so nice, man. Even with his nose, he's got a lot of things to do. It's so nice, man. Even with his Nomad lifestyle, Yann faces the same big question as the rest of us. Through the internet and smartphones, have to ruin everything. When you find the super special, beautiful spots, is that you bustin' out a map and like, looking where might be cool to go or is it worth a mouth and just getting to know people on the locals. If I see a dirt road, I just want to go down. So, a lot of it's just aimless rambling. It's a desire to just see something. Check that out. For some reason it's more fulfilling than getting a recommendation from somebody. Or, there's tons of apps and websites now. Roadtrip apps, camping apps. They proliferated. The knowledge is accessible on the internet, right? I used to fight the geotags and I would get really pissed off.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4685,2022-10-19 22:23:06
16340," They proliferated and the knowledge is accessible on the internet, right? I used to fight the geotags and I would get really pissed off. You know, like, why are you posting this place? It's gonna blow up, it's gonna get trashed. Now I've realized that you can't fight it. The internet has just shrunk the world. So we're not gonna stop it. We're not gonna stop people from going there. So I'm a lot more focused in conversation now with trying to set a good example. When you go, pick up your trash. When you're pooping out in the wilderness, don't leave your toilet paper on the top. You know, make sure you follow, you know, good steps for leaving no trace. As a thank you for this quick guide to pooping etiquette. We made yawn, hair, and and lemmy some tacos. And we all took in the night sky and knocked back a couple of drinks. Take that apocalypse. The thing about good times and serenity in 2020 is that they're fleeting at best. After we split up from yawn and continued on our way, smoke started to envelop us. The plus side was that our RV no longer smelled like feet. The downside was breathing. A man David here suggested that we try and outflank the smoke by cutting through your semity. Without a reservation, we had to talk our way in. Uh, yes, no stopping, no getting out. Yeah, no problem. We just, yeah, we just wanted to get through. It was a beautiful choice. I'd we got up the smoke. Whoa, okay, but not quite as effective as we had hoped. Fast forward four hours or so and we had managed to trade the smokey majesty of your semity for the smokey, um, look at it. Strip malls of the central valley. We have made it sort of out of the smoke all the way across your semity national park and here to the gorgeous central valley of California. We're off to see a kind of surprising tech startup that is making some pretty strange machines to serve all the growers out in this region.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4686,2022-10-19 22:27:25
16341," strange machines to serve all the growers out in this region. The way we're to wear here in this near Fresno, this is California farm country, right? We're just out the Fresno town called Kingsburg, so we're right in the central valley of California, very, very large farming valley here. It's kind of considered the bread basket of the world. The central valley stretches out over about 20,000 square miles and the farmers here produce about one-fourth of the food that Americans eat, including a whole lot of fruits and nuts. Tell me a little bit of the background of, of God's, I know some of this is like a family business, the roots of this go back always. Tell me kind of like how we got to what's essentially like a startup, I guess. Yeah, definitely. So the founder of our company is Dave Crinklaw and he started the business back in 1982. He started with his basically with his dad was commercial spraying of trees and vineyards. We got to the point where our biggest challenge was labor, just the shortage of it really. He was forced into innovating and he had had this idea for quite some time about doing a driverless sprayer and it finally got to the point where he said, you know what, I either got to get out of this business or I'm going to innovate. Organic or not crops need to be sprayed and this process has to take place a few times a year. This means hiring a lot of people to work long hours under serious pressure and so just like the tech bros to the north, Gus decided to solve all of its problems with robots. On this like labor points, you guys have set this up where you can have somebody in a truck and that one person can monitor I think like eight of these. In order to operate Gus, you have one guy or girl that sits in a pickup and they monitor from a laptop computer. So that person is basically just watching all the vehicles on the screen. They can monitor up to eight of them at a time while they're out there spraying and orchard. And so that user interface really provides them with all the information they need to make sure that the machines are safe and that they're doing the correct job. So it tells them what speed they're driving, the engine RPM, the amount of gallonage per acre that they're applying at any given time. So if any one of the machines has an issue, it's going to send an alert to that laptop. Much like a self-driving car, these beasts use GPS, LiDAR and cameras to see and navigate the world around them. They also rely on pre-built maps of the orchards for extra guidance. Gus builds the machines right here and then takes them out for robot training on this orchard next door. It's here that the company learns if the machines will behave and do as their software and human master's command. So this is a test orchard where you guys put it through the paces and work on the technology. Yeah, so this is our test orchard right here. It's right by our building so you can see in the background. So every new machine as it comes off the assembly line, it's put through a commissioning test right here. Every test all the sensors on the machine, autonomous computer, all the safety systems, make sure it's doing what it's doing prior to when it's delivered to a customer. So what's it doing now? So right now he's doing a test spray. So he's just turning the water on to make sure that the system comes up to pressure, spraying water out of the analysis just to make sure it's all functioning properly. Okay. It's got like a crazy turbine at the backer. Yeah, so it's basically just a big fan. Okay. And that fan's driven off of the Cummins diesel motor and it just basically creates a big air flow. Gus is already selling these vehicles to brave modern farmers and people the world over have taken notice of its machines.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4687,2022-10-19 22:31:46
16342," Air flow. Gus is already selling these vehicles to brave modern farmers. And people the world over have taken notice of its machines. And have you just sold them in the Central Valley, or like throughout the US, or even overseas, or where are they going? Yeah, so right now, the majority of our machines are here in California in the Central Valley. However, we do have machines and customers in Florida, and the citrus industry over there, as well as Australia. And I think you start selling them in December of 2019. Yeah, so we started taking orders early last year for the sprayers. And the first delivery we made were in December of 2019. OK. And how much do they cost each? So our retail price on these machines is $285,000. So it's like it's not a small investment, but I'm sure the regular sprayers aren't. Yeah, I mean, we're honestly not too far away from conventional equipment on our price. And the main thing is that the return on investment is very, very quick due to all the labor savings and the increased efficiency. I mean, these machines, they just thrive. But basically, what we're doing besides this machine, this is our first machine we call it orchard gas, mainly designed for your nut trees, as well as citrus, and fruit in the future. We're working on a few other projects. We're going to do more machines. One of them is actually a vineyard sprayer. So vineyards are much tighter spacing. So the machine has to be physically smaller. And then we've got our eyes on doing a lot of other innovating. That right there, friends, is a central valley farmer putting his whole fruit basket on the table. Gary's TED Talk can't be far off. And with that, it was time to get back in the RV. And to confront what happens when three men are bested by their own failings and the forces of entropy. Next on Hello World, we cruise into the Mojave Desert in search of a lunar lander. We have instruments that we are going to deliver to the South Pole of the Moon in December of 2022. Instruments that are trying to scan the surface of the moon. And hang with a test pile of wood. And we're going to do a little bit of the work. The surface of the moon and hang with a test pilot who walked away from this. Meet Betty. She lives by herself. But for the last few months, she hasn't been alone. Ella Kew, tell me a joke. Did you hear about the claustrophobic castor-n-lot? No. Apparently, he just needed a little space. Most technology isn't made for 93-year-olds. But this woman is making sure that this particular robot is. Ella Kew, who are you? She's researching the way we interact with machines. And if she has her way, robots will soon be a trusty companion for all of us. My name is Ella Kew. How can I help you? As technology replaces old jobs, it's also creating new ones. I'm Aki Ito, and I'm here to show you the jobs of the future. My name is Danielle Aishak, and I am a human robot interaction researcher. It's really hard to intuitively design a robot meant for a consumer audience.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4688,2022-10-19 22:35:56
16343," It's really hard to intuitively design a robot meant for a consumer audience. You have to make sure that it's a robot that people want. People know how to use and people value. Danielle works for an Israeli startup called Intuition Robotics. Its US office is here in downtown San Francisco. Hello. Hey Danielle, it's Aki. Come on in. The company is funded by a couple big names like Samsung and Toyota. Full disclosure, Bloomberg's venture capital arm is an investor too. This is Ellie Q. Can I take her out for a spin? Please? Ellie Q. Tell me what you can do. I am a proactive social robot designed for older adults. I can connect you to your family and friends and even play music. These features might remind you of the Amazon Echo, but you'd be missing the point if you compared her to a smart speaker. She's not meant to just be useful. She's meant to be a companion. Why don't you take a break and have a drink? And that's why she has a head that cannot make other subtle gestures you might expect from a pet. Through our research with older adults, we're finding that almost on a daily basis, we see that somebody tells her that they love her or that they like her or that they miss her. Literally, I love you. They'll also tell her I'm depressed or I'm lonely. They'll open up to her in a way that they might not necessarily open up to a human because they don't feel like they'll be judged. Ellie Q. Is it on sale yet? But a prototype is already in the homes of about a dozen early testers who live in the Bay Area. Ellie Q. Tell me what the weather is today. Danielle's job is to figure out what's working and what's not. Sorry. Please rephrase your request. And she does that by visiting each of her testers twice a month. How important are these visits to your job? They're critical. We're building a product for people who we are not. I'm not a senior. And how could you know how to design for somebody if you don't do research? Because otherwise, you would just be designing in the dark. Things like Danielle's are just starting to emerge. Until recently, robots were mostly in factories separated from humans. But now, they're finally getting cheap enough, small enough, and smart enough to be in our homes. This has created a whole new challenge of designing robots that people will actually want to interact with. And that's where Danielle comes in. Her research has helped shape every little facet of Ellie Q. From the way Ellie Q moves to the way she talks. It's a very special job, and it could be really hard, and it could be really frustrating about that end of the day. It's incredibly rewarding. And I think the most rewarding part about it is when I see the joy on the user's faces, like that they saw their feedback turned into something real. Today we've driven east of San Francisco to go see one of Danielle's research participants. Ellie Q. Tell me something interesting. Did you know that Ronald Reagan was a lifeguard in high school and saved 77 people's lives? Now, see, this is where a conversation is. She should open up and I should say, no, I did not know that. I expect her to be able to continue a conversation for at least a couple of comments. Yeah. And why is that? Why? Yeah. That's companionship.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4689,2022-10-19 22:40:21
16344," Anjane Chip. When Betty was around Danielle's age, she was working with some of history's very first computers. When I was finishing up my master's degree, I was working at Harvard in the computer lab when they were building Mark IV. A large room size computer. But now, this artificial intelligence stuff is amazing. L.A.Q. Yes. Scheduled doctor's appointment. No problem. I'm working on it. When Danielle brought along the idea of working with robotics for the elderly, I said, are you kidding me? Will older people connect to a robot? And she said, I don't know, let's research and find out. Danielle grew up here in this suburb of Atlanta. Her parents spent much of their childhoods in Israel and met in the US. We as immigrants, we understood that we might need to work a little harder. In fact, I feel that rather than taking away from Danielle, it gave her so much more. Because she understood the fact that you need to run after your dreams and work really hard, no matter what the challenges are. School didn't come easily for Danielle. I have dyslexia and that very much affected my self-esteem academically. The principal of the school did not recommend her to take advanced classes. She fought for it and she got into it and she did very well with them too. Danielle's first job out of grad school was at X. The secretive research facility founded by Google. It's known for dreaming about kinds of wacky, far-flung ideas. Can you tell us about the moonshot you worked on? No, I can't tell you too much about the projects that I worked on. I can't say that I was working on robotics. She loved the job, but wanted to work on something that would reach real consumers sooner. So she left X after a year and joined Intuition Robotics. She's been working in the field for four years now. And it took her a while to find her footing in a male-dominated industry. I've gone to different meetups where they'll be like circle of men with their like zip up jacket with their like company logo on it and a beer in their hand. And I'll come in with lipstick and nobody wants to talk to me. This is my closet. So at first she did her best to fit in, wearing a pair of glasses she didn't need and toning down her style. So what's the kind of thing you used to wear to a conference? Stuff like this, blousey things. That make you look like you're 40. But that got old after a while. And what's the kind of thing you wear now? No, it's like I just enjoy being kind of expressive and playful and what I wear. Before we wrap up for the day, Danielle has one more LEQ tester to visit. Joseph is 97. And he's had the robot in his home for eight months. How are you? I'm fine. How are you? Good. How has Miss LEQ been? She always tells me to take a drink of water. At least four times a day. So we added a whole bunch of new facts to LEQ. Did you know that a cup of chopped red bell pepper contains more vitamin C than an orange? Okay, what did you think of that?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4690,2022-10-19 22:44:44
16345," Edmund C. Then an orange? Okay. What did you think of that? Certainly the present was, I could see that quite clearly. What about this? I can see that. L.A.Q. Play music. No problem. It will begin shortly. By 2050, almost half a billion people are going to be 80 or older. And if current trends continue, more and more are going to be like Joseph and Betty, living alone. L.A.Q. Stop. Today, both of them are doing okay. But some of Danielle's other participants have been struggling. It's kind of hard to leave them at the end of the day. It is. Some of our testers are pretty advanced in the stages of depression through loneliness and isolation. And at times, I know that L.A.Q. is cheering them up in their day. But I know that it's only part of the way. No source of artificial intelligence robots will ever be able to replace humans and human companionship or human care. The key to Danielle's work is to embrace that very limitation of machines. Robots should help humans do what they love, help humans interact with more humans, help humans in general. Not pull humans away from humans. Not take humans jobs, leave humans about purpose. Whether it's in our workplaces or in our homes, robots are soon going to be everywhere. And it's up to Danielle to make sure this robot-filled future leaves us just a little better off. So don't be afraid. And if you are afraid, come and join us. Because I promise it's a friendly place.

Maybe some tips on how to prepare a new meal or your favorite vloggers latest video. But if you're a parent who shares your phone with your children, it probably looks a little more like this. Kids content on YouTube is huge. Views for videos can reach into the billions. Five of the top 10 videos in all of YouTube's history are either music videos or kids videos, with baby shark having more views than people on the planet. YouTube has created a revolution, not an evolution, in the way kids and families consume video content. And that extends then into how they view toys and play and all of the associated things that go with that. His YouTube for the unaware can be adorable. It can be boring.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4691,2022-10-19 22:48:54
16346," associated things that go with that. His YouTube for the unaware can be adorable. It can be boring. It can also just be flat out strange. But often it involves toys. And for toy makers who embrace the platform, it led to record success. And I think it was surprised, of course you're used the biggest phenomenon that has ever happened in a toy industry. This is the story of how YouTube changed kids toys. Play patterns, the way children play is timeless. But how we deliver on those play patterns through product and how we market that to children has changed quite a bit over the years. And I would say that the last five to 10 years really ranks right up there with the 1950s when TV commercials directed to children this first launched by Mattel. This is Nancy's Wears. She led the Barbie brand during the 90s and spent four years as the chief marketing officer for Spinmaster. It used to be that there would be a few play things that parents would bring into the home where that children would create themselves like a stick and a ball becomes a play thing. And the industry was at a certain level of volume at that point. Mattel was very innovative and actually put the first product on TV and advertised it to children. Let's play home. This created a huge explosion in the toy industry that unfolded across decades. The hit of the day when you're ready to play. Everyone knows this thing. Here he comes. Here he comes. Greatest toy you've ever been. And his name is Mr. Machine. Here I go. Here I go. Fighting man, forget to go. On the land of the TV air. When you go back to the 1980s, what do you think of in terms of hit shows? You think of things like Masters of the Universe. You think of the original Transformers and Care Bears. The joke was they were 22-minute commercials. Just close your eyes and care. Let's make a TV show which is really promotion for our property or IP to help sell toys. There were a lot of those famous characters in which kids absolutely loved it. They were totally entertained, but there were huge toy lines behind them. This is Jim Silver, a 37-year veteran of the toys industry. In 1999, he started a consumer toy review magazine called Toy Wishes. And now he's the CEO of an influencer talent management group, TTPM. Regulations changed through the years. And also, parents became aware that they were purely commercials. And you saw a lot of the new channels, the Disney Channel and Nickelodeon. They realized that wouldn't work anymore. And to them, entertainment came before licensing. What happened over time was that toys started to become designed for a 30-second commercial. Closed at some mild amount of toolbox. Opened at some MicroMachine USA. Cruiser Mini MicroMachine vehicles, planes opposed to the police station, the marine motorcycle repair shop, the gas station, the construction office, worked the rear working driver, highway, passenger, rapid garage door. So if you couldn't explain it in a 30-second commercial, cost reduce it out of the product and just stick with what you could say. And features of toys, magical features using electronics, lights and sounds and mechanical movements that magic, like they don't know how it happens, that became more and more important. The sound of power is heard. Fire from Batman! See ya, Batman. Batman, stir-bow powered, that mobile flies into high gear. Since 2000, with cable channels dedicated to kids, Disney Channel, Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, there became the opportunity to reach kids and mass numbers every day of the week. And so the toy industries continued to grow. The toy industry, for the most part, was a pretty solid business. Just, you know, growing a couple percent of year here and there. There'd be big, big years here and there when there was maybe a hit movie, like a star.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4692,2022-10-19 22:53:35
16347," To industry for the most part was a pretty solid business, just growing a couple of percent a year here and there. There'd be big years here and there when there was maybe a hit movie, like a Star Wars movie come out, you know, drive a lot of toy sales. From 2014 to 2019, the global toy industry would grow by 15 percent. At about the same time, those major cable networks of Nickelodeon, Disney Channel, and Cartoon network would lose half their total audience. In 2017, also saw the bankruptcy of Toys RS, as both parents and kids discovered and bought more toys online. If you think about kids, they're usually the first adopters of a new medium. Kids weren't watching things like Nickelodeon as much as they used to. They were watching things on YouTube. YouTube started in early 2005 and this was like, you know, the very early Web 2.0, this beginning of sort of like what was the time, was the user generated content. Web blogging was really big. My space was the biggest thing on the internet back then. There was an early video of a Brazilian soccer legend doing stunt tricks that just when it exploded on the site, one of the first viral videos, lazy Sunday, if you remember that SNL short. You remember those early viral hits? YouTube in the early days was definitely comedy and music. It was a place of experimentation. I was the chief audience officer at Maker Studios. I oversaw essentially the creator partnerships and all over the world. Maker Studios was one of the largest multi-channel networks on YouTube and had partnered with some of the biggest YouTube channels of the time before being sold to Disney in 2014. Chris is now the CEO of Pocketwatch, which represents some of the largest kids stars on YouTube, including Ryan's world, and Love Diana, who can amass over a couple billion views every month. The Trude is one of the very biggest and earliest videos on all of YouTube, is by a creator and star named I Justine, where she unboxed her first mobile phone bill for her brand new iPhone, and it came in a box. And this ultimately morphed into many different formats associated with unboxing and tech was actually really big. And those became fairly successful pretty early on on the platform. And you saw them expand from tech products to beauty products and then around 2012 and 2013, which was on this explosion in the toys. So here's the Furby inside right here. We used to call them handschannel. And a handschannel was literally a top-down view of someone's hands unboxing typically a toy. Unbox it, they'd show each component. We just got Uncle Scrooge. I would speak to many of those creators. We signed many of those creators at Maker Studios to be our partners. And it was fascinating in that it was this whole new genre and this whole new format. And that corresponded with a rise of kids and family viewership on YouTube that was stark, that was hard to miss. And you would see it in the data. And we had access to a lot of data in Maker Studios around YouTube. Let's see what things are. First up we have the Storm Super Pig. You saw the launch of EvanTube, who I consider the first child, so to speak, unboxing star. And they would open toys and kids would just mesmerize by it. They loved watching it. And next thing you know, you had literally 50 unboxings. They were unboxed just about every toy. And people were just really excited. You open the toy and you see a toy pop out and kids just got excited, see the piece by piece. He's in a bathroom. He's eating a lobster. The early days of these unboxing videos, the videos were from a adult's perspective just terrible. I mean, they were 10 minutes long. They were boring. It was a shaky camera. There was absolutely no production value. Think about these executives.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4693,2022-10-19 22:57:53
16348," They were 10 minutes long, they were boring, it was a shaky camera, there was absolutely no production value. If you think about these executives, they're trying to figure out how to reach this new audience and they brought these videos and say, well, look at this video, it has 200,000 views on it and it's terrible. When I first heard of it, I thought it was the weirdest thing and just seemed kind of bizarre, who would want to watch someone opening a toy, taking it out of the box. But then when I started thinking about this idea of exploration and discovery as a core play pattern, the most fundamental play pattern there is, it started to make sense and I think that I have to say that the company that really jumped on that in the most concerted way was MGA with their launch of LOL. LOL surprise had three key elements, a doll play, which is basically the most popular play pattern there is, collectible. So within each LOL surprise you get a little sheet that showed you all the other dolls you'd collect. And then the surprise factor, you don't know which doll you were getting, it was a blind pack, as they call it. And LOL was made by this company called MGA, back then, you know, 2016, they were small player of the toy industry, founded by this guy named Isaac Larian, he's the CEO and founder. I have three adult kids and they were making fun of me that, oh you're old, you don't know anything about what's happening in today's sink and I said like what? And they said for example, do you know about this iPhone unboxing videos that get millions and millions of views? So I thought they're pulling my leg, children do to make fun of their parents. And then I did go and look one night and I was frankly shocked and flabbergasted that why would anybody buy an iPhone, take it home and open the box and show it on the camera and everybody would go and watch it. So I typed toy unboxing. Oh my god, I saw so many different videos and people, kids and adults buying toys like an apple and unboxing it and video and posting it. So that gave me an idea that why why not come up with the ultimate and that's the first LOL surprise. Alright, oh yes, we've got a goal goal. LOL changed the way you opened with toys and everybody saw that and the packaging became part of the play which became part of the entertainment. So normally if you get a package that you just open a package you take the toy out, that's not exciting. You open up LOL, you peel it away, you open up inside, you have seven surprises. And it took off like wildfire and quickly became you know the top toy in the country. By December of 2018, eight of the top ten toys sold were all LOL surprise brand. And according to MGA from 2016 to 2020, LOL would generate over ten billion dollars in retail sales worldwide. You know, LOL is bigger than Star Wars, it's bigger than marble, it's bigger than Barbie. These brands with huge advertising budgets are known basically by everyone. You don't have to figure out what marble our Star Wars is. And LOL eclips them all. In the toy world, blind bag or blind box toys have been growing in popularity. The most famous example in recent years is Pokemon cards. Where you open packs in hopes of getting a charizard but more often wind up with something common like Bligar here. Two years before the launch of LOL in 2014, the Australian toy company Moose Toys launched a blind bag collectible called Shopkins. And in 2016, Spin Master would launch a more expensive blind box toy it called Hatchimals. But the thing that sets LOL surprise apart is that it mainly focused on YouTube. And not putting ads on YouTube, but working with creators and influencers to get their products in the hands of these kids doing the unboxing videos. For MGA actually, the move towards YouTube was kind of a bit lucky and almost out of necessity. In late 2015, Nickelodeon Parent Company Viacom would sue MGA for breach of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4694,2022-10-19 23:02:08
16349," The MOUV towards YouTube was kind of a bit lucky and almost out of necessity. In late 2015, Nickelodeon Parent Company Viacom would sue MGA for breach of contract after it failed to pay $3.5 million for the production of a TV series based on their Lala Loopsie dolls. They tried to flex their muscles and they said, well, if you don't agree to our way of seeing things in the conflict that we had, they said that conflict. We are going to stop your advertisement of toys. At the time, Nickelodeon was the number one ranked children's network and not to be able to advertise that Nickelodeon could have been a death nap. But MGA, necessity is the mother of invention, that caused them to lean into digital advertising far more than any big brand had ever done before because they had to, they had to find a new way to reach kids. The court would ultimately rule in favor of Viacom, both in LA Federal Court and on appeal in the 9th Circuit. Larry and Blaine, the court, defeat on what he contends was judicial bias. Nickelodeon Parent Company Viacom didn't respond to a request for comment. So dad buys their forces to go and say, okay, they had with Nickelodeon. Let's find another way to reach children. That's how we went and doubled up on YouTube especially and the rest as they say. So early on MGA partnered with YouTube creators with huge audiences like Cookie Swirl in the past. They took it another step further. They actually helped kids learn how to do their own unboxing videos. They gave them support and learning and tools. And so all these kids got to be kind of a little mini influencer themselves as they were unboxing their L.O.L. products. Just to give you a flavor of how popular these videos are, go onto YouTube and search LL Surprise. And you'll see videos with a million views, 10 million, 25 million, 50 million, even 100 million. There's a lot of them. And kids are watching these videos and they're probably watching them over and over again. The old way toy manufacturers would do things is they buy TV, which was about 90% of their ads spend. And then traditional PR, get on the big morning shows. It's an entirely different formula. It's much harder for toy companies right now. Because the formula is so complicated, you have to really take a deep dive into each platform. Am I promoting on Twitter? Am I promoting on Instagram? Am I promoting on TikTok? What am I doing on YouTube? You have to look at every possible social channel. By 2017, big toy brands like Mattel had shifted nearly 50% of their marketing budget to social platform advertising. Brands would help seed videos of their toys. And if they were lucky, that could kick off a wave of creators making their own content around the product. In 2020 alone, tubular labs estimated that LOL related content had amassed 5.1 billion views. This idea of imitation. So when you see kids playing with product, it kind of excites the same neurons in your brain that happen when you do it yourself. The more we could show children having this experience, the more kids felt what it would be like to have it and then wanted to experience it themselves. And one of the criticisms of this whole influencer movement.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4695,2022-10-19 23:06:28
16350," kids felt what it would be like to have it and then wanted to experience it themselves. influencer movement among kids is that kids are young. They don't understand what's necessarily an advertisement versus real content. And that's a big criticism of this industry is that a lot of kids are getting on YouTube at young ages, not being supervised by their parents and just watching these videos. And they don't realize that maybe that influencer is getting paid by the brand to do that video or there's some other compensation. And that, you know, lures the lines for kids are sort of developing and figuring out how to consume media. Questionable advertising concerns aside, kids YouTube creators would take off. Channels like Ryan's World would grow to almost 30 million subscribers and a whole industry formed around them. When we first started working with influencers, they were very happy to work for free product. You give them the product and they do something for you. And gradually influencers got smarter and started, you know, charging for their services as they started building a following now because it is such a big business, the dollars can be significant investing in big influencers. When Spin Master launched one of its new TV series and associated product, we made it a point to buy an advertising package with Ryan's World to ensure that we could get really quick, big reach right away. This is an advertisement for Spin Master. From these unboxing videos, the content has gotten a lot more sophisticated. They are creating narratives around the toys, voices, and many universes, if you will. And it is really engaging content, even more so than the original unboxing videos for these kids. And, you know, the content is coming out maybe once a week or even daily. So if you think about it, what they have done is they have created basically a TV show around a toy. It is not unlike what we saw back in the 80s, which was criticized back then, by the way, when you had toys like GI Joe, turned into an animated series, or Masters of the Universe, or Transformers. So we have kind of seen this full circle now, right? So back to where we were, content, and basically many television shows created around toys on YouTube. Kids content on YouTube is likely to face increased regulation in the coming years. In 2019, the company would agree on a $170 million settlement with the FTC for serving ads based on personal data to kids on YouTube. YouTube would put more emphasis behind its made-for-kids platform, YouTube Kids, and each video uploaded to YouTube must be flagged as either made-for-kids or not. In a statement outlining changes to the site, YouTube would say that responsibility is our number one priority at YouTube, and this includes protecting kids and their privacy. Still, the site is far less regulated than traditional television. I do think parents have a better understanding of YouTube now, and the New John Risen formats there that they didn't prior, and they now notice things like their kid isn't watching a toy unboxing. That's a commercial for a toy. Their kid is watching other kids play with toys in an imaginative way, which inspires them to go play with things in the real world in an imaginative way. In just a few short years, YouTube had caused a transfer of power from toy and network executives to nine-year-olds and their families. The Kaji family may have started out as toy reviewers, but now Ryan has launched his own line of toys. A cartoon series. He was even a blimp in the 2020 Macy's Thanksgiving parade. You and I might think about Spider-Man or Snoopy, but today's kids see that blimp of Ryan and they relate to him. He's the character they want to grow up with. He's the character they want to engage with. And as we go forward, these influencers are becoming more and more like big, giant, global brands. And that has profound effects for entertainment going forward.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4696,2022-10-19 23:10:48
16351," Here the MB is huge today. On any given night you could have as many as 2 million people staying in an Airbnb all around the world. You know our mission is that everyone can belong anywhere. We're talking you know 300 million stays on any average year and there's tyranny in numbers. The vast majority of Airbnb stays don't result in a safety incident but sometimes things go wrong and for Airbnb you know we're talking thousands of safety incidents that occur every year that the company has to handle and has to respond to. I'm talking situations like kidnappings, hostage cases. We're talking murder, we're talking rape, we're talking you know the worst violent crimes that occur in our society happen inside Airbnb's. Airbnb never wants these kinds of cases to end up in the headlines. You know that's really bad for their brand, their reputation and their public image particularly because this is a business that's based on strangers trusting one another. So when crimes like this occur that kind of threatens their entire business model. I'm Olivia Carville, I'm a reporter on Bloomberg's technology team and I've been covering online travel companies like Airbnb for the last two years. Airbnb is a startup that's based in Silicon Valley and like many of the sharing economy startups it managed to grow so big so fast by essentially scurrying regulations. It was based on that premise of move fast and break things and it wanted to work against regulations in order to grow as big as possible and win the popular vote because it became so popular so fast that cities could no longer control it. An apink night is past August. We had one million people from around the world coming from 180 countries in a single night staying in an Airbnb home. The vast majority of Airbnb stays. We're talking you know two million people staying in an Airbnb on any given night don't result in a safety incident but sometimes things go wrong. And for the company you know it was dealing with these cases was a really challenging difficult complicated area. You had hosts and guests and sometimes they disagreed on what happened. You had regulatory issues in some of their bigger cities. Then you also had you know the growth of the platform and the fact that if you're going to try and prevent some of these incidents it could cut into revenue and cut into the number of listings that you have. So for Airbnb it was about trying to figure out the best way to handle these crises in a way that's going to not only protect the individual in crisis but also protect the company's public image, its brand, its reputation which is essentially what its business is based upon. As Airbnb grew like way too big for them to be able to take all these calls alone they developed a team of a hundred highly specialized agents that handled the worst of the worst cases. Over the course of my reporting I've talked to almost 50 former employees it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4697,2022-10-19 23:15:01
16352," Developed a team of 100 highly specialized agents that handle the worst of the worst cases. Over the course of my reporting, I've talked to almost 50 former employees at ADIA BNB and, you know, seven or eight of those work directly on this elite unit. These safety agents, many of them come from military backgrounds or trauma backgrounds. They're trained to handle traumatic situations and to try and help people who are going through what may be, you know, the worst day in their lives. For these safety agents, a lot of them understood that they had a dual role. First and foremost, they wanted to protect the user in crisis. But they also knew they had a responsibility to protect the company's brand and public image. I mean, everything about housing in New York is a total mess and it's always chaotic. It's not too surprising that Airbnb's biggest battle has broken out here. 2015 was a really challenging year for Airbnb. Airbnb's listings between 2010 and 2014 were essentially illegal hotels. You know, the company was seven years old now. It had grown huge. It was now a household name. But by growing that big that fast, they also came up against, you know, a pushback in regulations. Now, Airbnb's under attack and a lot of men are sitting. Yeah, so what are they saying about this? They can't give up on New York because New York's too important for every kind of reason. They knew that they couldn't lose the battle in New York because it was one of their biggest markets. And also, it could result in a domino effect. If other cities around America saw New York City either backing down on regulations or enforcing stricter regulations, that could in turn be rolled out right across the country. I think it's going to be awkward when they have to, you know, put in their perspectives, their risk factors when they have to say, well, you know, one risk is that the whole thing might be somewhat illegal in our biggest market. And in December of that year, a young woman from Australia flew into New York and stayed in an Airbnb with a group of her friends. They picked up a key from the local corner bodega without even needing identification. The police report said this 29-year-old woman left her friends at a midtown bar and returned to the Airbnb on her own. She thought that she was alone, but she wasn't. There was a man inside the apartment hiding in the shadows with a kitchen knife. He grabbed her, dragged her into a room, and raped her. He later fled. About an hour after this attack, he came back and police were in the apartment at the time. They opened his backpack and found three items of interest. The kitchen knife, one of the woman's earrings, and a set of keys to the Airbnb. This case was a really complicated one for Airbnb, partly because it occurred in New York City where they were fighting this really tough battle with city officials over regulations, and partly because the alleged rapist had the keys and he was inside the apartment. That meant that Airbnb needed to do what it could to protect itself. They wanted to find out, you know, how did he get the keys? That was a really big question for them. They launched an investigation to find that out. But before they did anything like that, before they thought to kind of protect their own reputation here, they really focused on doing what they could to help this young woman. They paid for her to move to a hotel. They paid for her mother to fly in from Australia. They paid for both of them to fly home. They offered to cover any health or leave or canceling costs that she might need later. But inside the company internally, they also launched an investigation. They wanted to know how did the alleged rapist get the keys? How did he get inside that Airbnb? And when they found out that the keys had been left at the corner of Odaiga, that then created, you know, a problem of liability for Airbnb. They didn't have a policy around key exchange. They didn't tell their hosts how they did or didn't have to hand keys over to guests as they were arriving. So if they Airbnb...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4698,2022-10-19 23:19:33
16353," They didn't have a policy around key exchange. They didn't tell their hosts how they did or didn't have to hand keys over to guests as they were arriving. So for Airbnb, they also, you know, they wanted to know what was going to be said in court. They wanted to know if any media were going to pick up on this story. And they wanted to know what their legal liability potentially could be. A week later, the alleged rapist was indicted in the Supreme Court in New York. An Airbnb sent a staff member to find out if the company was going to be mentioned in any of the court records. And it wasn't. It wasn't mentioned in the police report. It wasn't mentioned by prosecutors. There's no mention of Airbnb really in any public record. This case has never been reported until now. And, you know, for Airbnb, that was kind of lucky. This case never landed in the media. And, you know, 18 months later, when this woman's lawyer reached out to the company, they signed a settlement for $7 million. And part of that settlement, there's a clause that says she cannot assert or imply responsibility on the part of the company. We've spoken to legal experts who indicate that what this really did is gag the woman from saying, I blame Airbnb. Airbnb is one of the few companies in the world that has this like online offline kind of hybrid situation where you have users who meet online and then actually meet in the offline world and stay under the same roof. And that means that the company at the end of the day really has to take more responsibility than other social media platforms might do. With Airbnb's terms of service, that really means that whenever there's a dispute between hosts and guests and the company, this is all handled behind closed doors and arbitration. Most of these cases don't even make it to the courtroom. And when they do, the company will settle them so it doesn't go on through the courts. And what that means is that there hasn't really been a legal precedent that's set to determine what Airbnb's liability is here. You know, is it really responsible for when things go wrong inside its listings? What I learned over the course of my reporting is that this is anything but simple. This is a complicated nuanced area. There are difficult trade-offs here. The company also has to have hard, you know, tough conversations about policy. Airbnb's business model is based on strangers trusting one another. We often hear from the founders and the chief executive himself saying trust is their number one priority. I've actually heard Brian Cheske, the chief executive of Airbnb, talking about how he didn't build a website or a platform that allows people to stay in each other's homes, what he built was a community that trusts one another. And when that premise is undercut, Airbnb's entire business model is under threat.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4699,2022-10-19 23:23:46
16354," Music Forms Earth of you. Sounds far fetched at the moment, doesn't it? But you know, we may be seeing ads like this in the not too distant future. Living away from Earth has always captured our imagination. As well as providing a basics for survival, these ideas are a symbol of human kinds unique creativity and ambition. This advanced beast or a species diesel would be hit quad us for the final cent of the moon. Today the idea of multiple outposts where we can live and work in space has never seen closer. We're going to fly. It's about making our lives the best we can make it. It's about as a species having a path for our future. And the mission to create these habitats is well underway as private companies get ready to take that next giant leap. The International Space Station, it's the only space habitat we have. One of the first places they take you in the ISS is the CUPLA. So you can finally look at the Earth in all its beauty in it. I don't care who you are, it's always stunning, it's shocking, it's it's amazing because that's the view you've been waiting for your entire life. It passes over 90% of the world's population without most of us ever realizing. And at an estimated cost of $150 billion, it's the most expensive object we've ever built. You think about like the cysteine chapel, the pyramids and the Burj Khalifa or take your pick, I mean it far outstrips those. It's the one and only non-terrestrial human outpost. We've had a constant human footprint in orbit for almost 20 years because of the International Space Station. The collaboration between 15 countries started construction in 1998 and was pieced together in space over the course of a decade. Since 2000, it's been a permanently crude research laboratory, a space habitat that's allowed humankind to live, manufacture and explore beyond Earth. The overarching achievement of the space station has been education. It has educated us about how to do research, it's educated us about how to live, it's educated us about the harshness of the environment that it is in and it's about learning, I think. People say what was one of your favorite parts about being up there, hands down, floating everywhere I went. But your first impressions for ISS certainly is how big it is. The ISS is a size of an American football field. With most of that footprint taken up by eight solar arrays, these provide enough energy to power 40 homes. The station has an American side and a Russian side, as well as contributions from other nations like Canada, Japan and the European Union. Astronauts on board can pass freely between these sections, their living and working areas are made up of modules, each 4.2 meters in diameter and in total they have the same volume as a Boeing 747. The three main labs, destiny, hope and Columbus, are conducting up to 600 ongoing experiments at any one time. And while it's been a collaboration between governments to build and maintain the ISS, its next chapter will rely more on private enterprise. Today is a very remarkable day. NASA is opening the International Space Station to commercial opportunities and marketing these opportunities as we've never done before. Managing and maintaining the ISS costs $3.4 billion a year. That's over half NASA's space operations budget. Aging hardware and space debris will only add to these costs, which is why NASA is now hoping to pass some responsibility for the station over to commercial companies. We would like to see a robust commercial",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4700,2022-10-19 23:28:03
16355," We'll only add to these costs, which is why NASA is now hoping to pass some responsibility for the station over to commercial companies. We would like to see a robust commercial marketplace in low-rether orbit where space stations exist outside of NASA, the goal being that NASA could be a customer and we want to have numerous providers that are competing against each other on cost and innovation. The federal funding proposed to stop in 2025, opening the station to private enterprise would free up resources for the space agency's ambitions to return to the moon and journey to Mars. Transparent to a more commercial model is allowing industry to take over many of those areas that NASA has traditionally been responsible for, like the design and operations and maintenance of space systems. But the most exciting part I think is new opportunities. The iPhones would have never come from the government, for instance. The base technology came from the government, but the way it's used, the way it interacts with consumers, governments aren't really built for that. So I think that would be exciting to see how private industry uses the same technology or the same systems, but then use them in a different way. Every NASA achievement has been the collaborative achievement of NASA and industry. What's going on right now that's a little bit different is NASA is turning to companies not to direct them what to do, but it's turning to companies to build relationships with them because those companies are attracting investment from non-space sources and are bringing a different kind of innovation to the table. In the shadow of NASA's sprawling Johnson Space Center, the headquarters of startup Axiom Space might seem a little modest, but their goal is big to build the first commercial space station. Led by a former ISS program manager, the team has been involved in every mission to the station since its inception. We know it has to be much lower cost-operate on orbit than ISS is today, so this is key to continuing the heritage of ISS. It's to start there so we can evolve everybody to the next platform. I liken this to the internet. So the internet was created and we got very excited and any kid with a good idea and just the basic programming skills could go build a program to do something. We have huge companies that grew out of that and still today there's new ideas, new things being built. The thing about a microgravity environment is it's limitless. It's like the data we have access to on the internet is limitless and it is not immediately obvious to us all the benefits that that's going to entail, but over time it will become very very obvious. By 2024, Axiom plans to send a central node to attach to the ISS. That will make up the core of their new station. This will be followed by crew quarters for 16 people and research and manufacturing modules. When the ISS is retired this will break away and additional modules with a lifespan of 30 years will be added and swapped out as they age using a robotic arm. And they're hoping to do all of this for 150th the cost of the ISS. I mean when you talk about our vision it sounds really simple. It really is about driving the thought process and the cost down so that anybody that wants to take advantage of our place in orbit and a microgravity environment can do so and that's really it. Okay Ellen I need to go towards my feet. The International Space Station is a fantastic vehicle but one of the big things is they have quite a few major components outside which means you have to do an EVA, a spacewalk to go fix it. A spacewalk on a good day is 100 hours of crew time to get ready and actually go do the spacewalk so we're able to take advantage of the reduced size of components and so our design is going to have all of the components are going to be in the pressurized environment. So we know what the basics are, you know water, food, clothing, life support and we know how to handle those. But now the next step is how do we make it more intuitive and we want to now take advantage of the technologies and the capabilities have today to build more luxury into the experience. The objective is to make the environment the background for all the use.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4701,2022-10-19 23:32:30
16356," of the technologies and the capabilities have today to build more luxury into the experience. The objective is to make the environment the background for all the users. You're everyday doing whatever you want to do on orbit, research, manufacturing, looking out the window. Whatever you're there to do, we want you to be able to do that not even think about the environment. And it's because of our experience on ISS and what the team brings to the Axiom space, we're able to build that environment. You won't worry about that. Three, two, one, release, release, release. Fire, fire. Like Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin, Axiom is hoping to attract space tourists with tickets starting at $55 million for a 10-day mission. But that's just one part of the commercial space station market that they think could be worth $37 billion over the next decade. Our first commercial customers are countries who have astronauts in space and want to expand their activity in space and countries who do not yet have a human spaceflight program who want to send people up. And we've now got both research and manufacturing companies who want to do work with us while we're at the International Space Station and on our platform after it separates from ISS. Human spaceflight is particularly exciting because it's that slice of space that is really nested. It hasn't undergone the crowding that satellites have had. It hasn't already had that explosive growth. It's really ready for that now. The first thing I'm really looking forward to seeing happen is the face of our first astronauts on orbit looking back down on us and knowing that we had a hand in sending that person to space. And ultimately, the separation of ISS when it's ready to be retired and de-orbited and then we continue in space independently. For me, that is a stepping-off moment for humanity. It's almost like when Neil Armstrong put that first boot on the moon. This will be the first time that we've gone from a platform of learning how to live in space to building our permanent home in space. Other private companies also want to use the ISS as the starting point for their own ventures. Bigelow Aerospace already has one of its inflatable structures attached to the station and others, including Sierra Nevada and Nanaracks, have put forward proposals. Space habitats are expensive. And I think it's a false dichotomy to say, okay, we're done with the International Space Station. Let's move on to commercial platforms. What I think is much more likely and realistic in what NASA is certainly driving toward is an incremental transition where commercial platforms attach to the space station or work collaboratively with the space station. The next chapter cannot occur without the active engagement of companies. That said, that active engagement might not be as customers, might not be as drivers, it might be in service of government mission objectives. We will return American astronauts to the moon, not only to leave behind footprints and flags, but to build the foundation we need to send Americans to Mars and beyond. This proposed mission, along with SpaceX's own ambition to reach a red planet, has opened up a longer-term market. And some companies are already thinking beyond orbiting habitats like space stations to actually building on a surface of other planets. I was working in a firm designing skyscrapers and I saw Elon and he landed his Falcon X rocket in the middle of the ocean and that for me was a trigger. I thought, wow, this could actually happen and it's always been my dream to put a building on the moon or Mars. And if he's going at the pace he's going, it could definitely happen within my lifetime and I want to be the one to build it. In this warehouse, alongside startups from across the US, architecture firm AI Space Factory are refining the production of Marsha. A full-story structure they created for a NASA competition to design the next generation of space habitats on Mars. You know, when we started designing our Mars habitat, Marsha, I think we looked at everything that had been done already and kind of tossed that aside. But what we were given was a set of guidelines from NASA. They think the best way to build a habitat on Mars or the moon is to use what they call in situ resource utilization. So use the materials that are there. If you've seen sci-fi movies you might see like...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4702,2022-10-19 23:36:54
16357," to use what they call in situ resource utilization. So use the materials that are there. If you've seen sci-fi movies, you might see glass and steel domes on distant planets, but the reality is to ship that kind of material to the moon of Mars would be so exhortantly expensive you would never be able to build in the first place. So the idea is to send a 3D printing robot which can then harvest the materials you find on a site and build with that. The reusable print material is a mix of biopolymer made from recycled plastic or plants like corn and sugar cane and basalt, a rock found on Mars and Earth. It's the rock that gives us its incredible strength. We've tested this material, it's three times as strong as concrete in compression and it actually has what we call it a tensile capacity and prevent itself from being pulled apart, which is something concrete is not very good at. You need to think at all times how do you optimize the amount of material that you use and that's also why this thing is shaped like an egg and if you think of an egg it's a very structurally optimized form, it's very very thin but it provides the strength that the egg needs and that's why this is shaped the way that it is. The egg shape as well as a nested shell structure also accommodates for extreme differences in pressure and temperature on the surface of Mars. But more research still needs to be done to find out how print materials could be gathered and how 3D printing would work in a unique environment of space. You're dealing with a completely different set of physics and environments which is very harsh, the cold, the low gravity, the vacuum of space and finding solutions for how to build or do anything in space just requires a high degree of innovation. There's no such thing as brute force when it comes to space like you need to think about the problem, find a very elegant lightweight cost effective solution. The next challenge is really going to places on earth, literally taking the dirt that we're finding on a site and beginning to print with the dirt. We have to perfect this technology on earth and then we go prove it out on the moon and then finally on to Mars. The first customers could include NASA and companies like SpaceX who would lease out these structures for individual missions. But before that, AI space factory hope their technology could be monetized as well as transformational here on earth. The challenges of building on Mars forced us to kind of make this jump in construction technology which we can now apply on earth to build more sustainably. So rather than building with steel and concrete which are these manufactured very energy intensive materials to go to a site have a solar power to rad that would then allow our 3D printer to print in the most sustainable way possible. And we never would have found these ways that wasn't for the challenge of building in space. Three, two, one, ignition and lift off of the Falcon 9 to the space station on the first commercial launch from Kennedy Space Center's historic head 39A. Humans have now been consistently living and working in space for more than 15 years. And if we want to keep that up, what do habitats need to look like? And frankly they can be larger, they can be small. But the future of space habitats really to me comes down to the ability to persistently maintain human presence. Whether that's a few people or many people, that seems to be the dividing line between where we were before and where we want to be in the future. We have to learn how to benefit from what we do on orbit and bring those natural benefits back home. So we help ourselves out on the ground while we also learn to live somewhere else. And it really at the very deepest level is about survival or species. So I get pretty excited when I spend a few moments thinking about what we're off to go do because this really is the first step to learning to live off the planet. That first step is just the start of our journey to create a lasting legacy in space. While commercial companies may be stepping in to imagine what these new space habitats look like, it's what's happening inside of them that may unlock the future of space industrialisation.

16358," On the next episode of Giant Leap, we'll visit the private companies who are looking to build their business around manufacturing in space. Using the unique properties of microgravity, they plan to create new materials with extraordinary qualities that can't be replicated on Earth, including new manufacturing techniques that could change how we build large structures in space and even unlock the ability to 3D print full human organs. But the full, lower, thawbit can become a new industrial centre, we're going to need to take another giant leap. This is how it used to work. A real estate agent would lock in the client, they'd stage the place, hold an open house every single weekend, and hope that the right buyer walks through that door. 10 years ago, you could probably go look at a house and circle back 2-3 weeks later and still have an opportunity to make a bid. The first time I received a lead through Instagram, my mind was blown. If you're seeing something in a neighbourhood that is established, you have 2-3 days after the open house in this market to make an offer. Our world has shifted so much, folks are getting comfortable doing business either through social media or 100% virtual. Social media, like everything else it touches, has turned the real estate business upside down. You've heard this trope before, millennials aren't buying and owning as much as their parents' generation, be it a car, a diamond, or a home. But the lack of ownership is not always by choice. In 2018, a survey found that 89% of millennial Americans want to buy a home. They just can't afford it. As of 2019, millennials of all stripes owned only 5% of US housing, compared with 15% for gen-exers. Millennials haven't been able to make these big ticket purchases the same way as their predecessors did. Now this is down to the financial crisis, we have rising student loan debt, and a higher cost of living. Now millennials are getting older, they're earning more money, and saving more. So now is about the time where a lot of them are going out and making those purchases. And now, having been stuck at home for over a year, the same generation that embraced Ubers and Airbnb's wants something to call their own. I got married and I have a child, so looking for more space and thought about a conventional route of young and single living the city and then move out to the suburbs we have a kid and a wife. I've seen a whole bunch of my friends just move on down to the west Palm Beach, my AME area, Austin, Texas. So they are certainly moving out of the city, but space was top of mind for them moving out. We lived in Williamsburg for about 16 plus years, and week two in the pandemic, we just realized we needed more. So we started looking for a house right away. We now live in Goshen, New York, which is about an hour and a half from New York City. Instagram accounts like, circa houses and cheap old houses offer a glimpse into the perfect suburban life. Often at a price point, not too dissimilar to what adults pay for rent in major cities. By the end of 2020, New Yorkers who didn't flee paid an average of $2,700 a month for an apartment, even as rent was $2,000.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4704,2022-10-19 23:45:30
16359," is similar to what adults pay for rent in major cities. By the end of 2020, New Yorkers who didn't flee paid an average of $2,700 a month for an apartment, even as rent prices plummeted during the pandemic. Millennials make a large percentage of spending right now and that makes them a valuable consumer for brands. That means they're being courted by everyone out there to spend with them. They grew up online. They're comfortable with pretty much anything that you can do there. And that's buying things, selling things, Craigslist, eBay, all that. Making a $100 purchase on Craigslist or a $1,000 purchase on eBay, it's not that much of a leap to go even further if you're buying a fancy piece of jewelry or a house for a million bucks. The uptick in home demand, fueled by the pandemic, combined with record low interest rates has made home buying extremely competitive over the last year. So much so that some millennials look to social media to shop and actually buy their first house site unseen. I saw sort of something on my Instagram feed and you know, clicked and we ended up seeing this house. Houses weren't really being shown at that time because we were in full lockdown. We became really interested in one YouTube video, 20 Z-LO photos, that is it. The Red Hot Housing Market spells opportunities for developers targeting this demographic, getting eyeballs strictly through social media. People are not looking in the back section of the times anymore for real estate listings. Our demographic is between late 20s to mid 40s and that demographic is spending a lot of time on social media and they're doing a lot of shopping. We Instagram and other social media platforms. This is Joshua Gelb and Pele Hamburger. During the pandemic, the two New York City-based developers started Neville House, a new construction project two hours north of the city. Unlike most traditional real estate listings, the pair bypassed the use of a broker and advertised their homes directly on Instagram. No fees, no commissions. You used to have to hire a broker, work with them, they would be showing on site. Now you basically put your renderings on Instagram and within an hour you have 15, 20 replies, saying can I come see it directly with you and let's see it tomorrow and it's just completely changed the game. Most people have that image in their head of the quid-essential upstate modern cabin set in the woods. We've definitely tried to tap into that and create something that's attainable for these people. Say you can have that, you can be swiping through Instagram and that can be your home too. There's been quite a proliferation of these direct to consumer brands. There's just tons of them out there. It's not that hard to start up a website that sells things and get things manufactured for that e-commerce platform. So like all birds with shoes, Casper with mattresses or Warby Parker with glasses. All of that means a lot more opportunity for brands in the online shopping space. So it's natural that real estate would want to get involved as well with these big ticket items. 10 years ago, the broker would drive the search. Now I think that my clients text me listings. They have alerts. They find things quicker than we do sometimes because we're out and about. I'd say that the buyer is much more involved these days. Social selling is creating brand new ways to shop. So let's look at vintage clothing, for example. There are sellers on Instagram finding successful ways to sell one of a kind items. It's that fleeting nature, the ephemeral nature of social media. You post the item online and whoever's first gets that one of a kind item. Now real estate has similar scarcity to it. There's one place to buy. It's one home, one apartment, one thing. It's one of a kind. But the rise in social media real estate isn't just about the instant gratification. Researcher Andre Perry, who studies economic inclusion at the Brookings Institute, says social media has evolved from the days of online hangout spaces and mood boards to a powerful change agent. Social media is a primary source to get news and information. But it's not just about social media. It's about the movement that we're in.

16360," source to get news and information but it's not just about social media it's about the movement that we're in the racial justice uprising really gave people a sense of worth and empowerment and so people not only are getting information about what protects people in the long run from economic shocks things like wealth. In his research, Andre found that not only are more millennials flying homes during the pandemic the rate of home ownership among black millennials are at historic highs. The fastest way to accumulate wealth in this country traditionally has been through home ownership. Millenials in particular are saying hey I want protection I want to live longer I want my education to go further let me acquire wealth and the fastest way to do that is through home ownership. When the pandemic hit many of the amenities or the comforts that came along with those living conditions were gone folks couldn't go to bars and fancy shops and so you saw instead of people going out buying clothes they saved their money and bought property and outside of the city generally people are moving to the suburbs to rural areas places where home prices are a little bit cheaper. Many home buyers are looking for houses outside the major metropolitan areas. Additionally many home buyers are looking for direct outdoor access and added space as the uncertainty about the virus persist. Millennials are also looking to influencers not just for the latest trends and tick-tock dances but to partake in important conversations be it about politics or personal finance or anything in between. Relic state ownership let's start small let's don't be scared to start small instead instead of renting a big house in the hills and California like most artists do buy you one that's on the flat. I meet folks like Brandon Rowland Charlemagne the God. You have residential real estate and you have commercial real estate. They're talking about buying homes when I was coming up really home buying with a mysterious shrouded process that only a few people could teach me. Now I can easily log on to clubhouse or Instagram and find literally lessons on how to purchase a home but done in a with savvy and finesse. Today we're going to make a greenhouse. I am DIYing the entire closet. Heather having bought her fixer upper sight unseen also looked to internet personalities to help figure out how to modernize and to make sure her home was also an investment. It gave us a lot of confidence. They make it look super easy how we could do all of those things ourselves. My husband just installed a laundry shoe which is something we never would have thought of if we didn't see an influencer do that and how how easy it actually is. Really simple do it yourself project you can do that. You have any questions go ahead and message me. And in the case of Neville House Josh and Paley hope that buyers see these homes as potential secondary income. These young families look at these products and look at our homes and say here's a turnkey or this can serve our family but this can also be the perfect rental. We've tried to strike a balance in the design of the home who are you know working well as a family home that's going to be lived in and also working as an investment. A lot of this just points to how millennials can utilize and leverage social media to their benefit but it also speaks to again this moment that folks want freedom. So millennials are really stepping up to this real estate game and taking ownership and building well. Of course not everything is as it seems online while social media can be a useful tool for learning there's still a lot it can't tell you about the home buying experience or living in the suburbs for that matter. We knew going into it budgeting for a lot of renovations we kind of thought if we buy it at 4.50 we could put to 300,000 into the house and really make it ours and our own. I can't wait to replace in this kitchen and update our built-in deep fryer which was not in the listing photos.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4706,2022-10-19 23:54:03
16361," We can't wait to replace in this kitchen and update our built-in deep fryer, which was not in the listing photos. We kind of got into the house and we realized that budget was completely unrealistic. We have a lot of people who see our design on Instagram, they say, I love it. Can you come build this on my property? And then they'll send us the lot, which they bought site unseen during COVID, and because of site conditions or zoning, it's virtually unbuildable. I think we all know that what you see on Instagram and what you see in real life are two very different things. So while we can definitely, as brokers, create these fantastic narratives, the one recommendation that I would give is do your homework. Don't believe everything you say. That's not to say that, you know, there's dishonesty or anything where people are trying to manipulate you, but not everything you see is accurate. This shift towards social media house hunting may also help to bring equilibrium to a market that has historically disadvantaged specific groups of buyers. Many of the traditional ways that people got mortgages or loans often precluded black people because they deemed us too risky for those loans. With technology, there's ways to get around that. As long as more black people get educated on racism and discrimination and lending, we're going to figure out ways to get around that racism. When I was 24 years old, I saw the UFC on a paper view on TV and I was so overwhelmed by the athleticism, the skill. And then at the end of the fight, the combatants hugged, they shook hands and I just fell in love with it. It's part of UFC's appeal is it doesn't look like a balletic display of martial talent and mastery as much as it looks like a bar fight. We choose to do this because we love this work, but it is a business. And if you do not treat it like a business, I guarantee you that the promoter is and you will be left broken, broken at the end of your career. Each of us have an individual story, but as with anything you take enough of these individual stories and you see not only crossover but intersectionality. A group of former UFC fighters that are suing the UFC scored a key legal victory on Thursday when a federal judge said he would grant their lawsuit class action status. There have been fights in every major US sport about workers' power in the labor market. I don't think there's a guy in the sport from the guy who just got his first fight all the way up to the Conor McGregor's that is pleased with the way the UFC treats fighters. The way we've been strong armed, the way we've been coerced. Fights over unionization in some sports, fights over free agency in baseball, and in boxing, the Muhammad Ali Act, which restricts the kinds of contract terms that can be imposed on boxers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4707,2022-10-19 23:58:22
