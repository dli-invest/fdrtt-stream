12107," This is a birthday's lucky month warm-up! It's many and a huge tolerative Maybe you do as I eat I prepared big mandate of columns When I was 24 years old, I saw the UFC on a paper view on TV and I was so overwhelmed by the athleticism, the skill. And then at the end of the fight, the combatants hugged, they shook hands and I just fell in love with it. Part of UFC's appeal is it doesn't look like a athletic display of martial talent and mastery as much as it looks like a bar fight. We choose to do this because we love this sport but it is a business and if you do not treat it like a business, I guarantee you that the promoter is and you will be left broken, broken at the end of your career. Each of us have an individual story but as with anything you take enough of these individual stories and you see not only crossover but intersectionality. A group of former UFC fighters that are suing the UFC scored a key legal victory on Thursday when a federal judge said he would grant their lawsuit class action status. There have been fights in every major US sport about workers' power in the labor market. I don't think there's a guy in the sport from the guy who just got his first fight all the way up to the Conor McGregor's that is pleased with the way the UFC treats fighters. The way we've been strong armed, the way we've been coerced. Fights over unionization in some sports, fights over free agency in baseball and in boxing the Muhammad Ali Act which restricts the kinds of contract terms that can be imposed on boxers. The fighters who brought this lawsuit see it as the continuation of a tradition in sports of athletes fighting to have agency and power in the terms of their work and who they do it for. Mixed martial arts used to be pretty culturally and legally fringe in the United States. It was banned by most states. John McCain had famously called it human cock fighting. There are some rules in the UFC but to a large extent all sorts of body parts and tactics and attacks are on the table and people get seriously injured at times. My nose has been broken multiple times. I had my right pectoral torn off how to get that reattached. I've had my jaw broken to two places I've had my neck broken. I had my left ankle broken how to get that repaired. I've had a torn right labor I'm in my shoulder. He broke my eyeball. I mean the bone that holds up my eyeball. I've had my left eye orbital fracture twice where my eye caved in. I was walling my own blood. I knew don't blow your nose or both eyes as well. At the time that UFC was bought for just $2 million by the former boxing coach Dana White and a casino owner. He'd been friends with Lorenzo Fertida and his brother Frank Fertida. UFC was struggling as were other mixed martial arts promoters. It was pretty much a fixer upper. The money that they spent to actually purchase it for $2 million was much less than the money they quickly had to sink into it in order to revitalize it. They've hold off a multi pronged strategy that was quite successful. First, they did what White has referred to as running towards regulation. They found ways to make compromises with state regulation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,333,2022-10-07 00:00:30
12108," First, they did what White has referred to as running towards regulation. They found ways to make compromises with state regulators so that the sport would not be illegal. And at the same time, they also popularized it. They made gambles like paying the production costs themselves for the first season of a reality TV show, the ultimate fighter on Spike TV. UFC under Dana White had a gift for weaving, compelling personal narratives and rivalry, people throwing shoes, a guy coming to the octagon with who let the dogs out playing while he was dragging another guy on a leash. My first contract with the UFC is kind of an interesting story because here I am on this reality show, the ultimate fighter. And they started to realize how big of a stepping stone this was going to be for the UFC. It's at us all down individually, put a contract in front of us and said, hey, we realized that this is going to be huge and we really want to have you all a part of this. UFC family moving forward. So we want to go ahead and get this out of the way, just sign this simple contract and we'll be able to move forward as one unit. But as I'm looking at this thick contract and wondering what I should do, Dana White looks at me and says, don't worry, this thing takes off, we'll take care of you. The fighters would say at the heart of UFC's power is the contracts that it signs with fighters. Before boxing had competition boxing used to be dominated by a few dominant promoters and the contracts were ported over from boxing. And the contracts are basically designed to control every aspect of a fighter's career. They're long term. They last multiple fights. Fighters under these contracts are bound to fight only for UFC for a period of time. And UFC can extend that time if a fighter declines a match or if a fighter gets injured. They control who the fighter fights. They control when the fighter fights. And then they have a number of different clauses that make it very difficult for a fighter to ever break free from UFC if that fighter ever did want to become a creation. Contracts are so one sided, there really is no negotiation room for any of the things, especially as you're coming up and as their stranglehold on the sport of MMA got so much stronger. Part of what's at the heart of this lawsuit is the ways that UFC successfully took other competitors off the board. The UFC had such a stranglehold on mixed martial arts and as they were buying up so much of the competition shutting them all down, they really became the only option for anybody that wanted to do this professionally. If you follow Dana White's Twitter or watch him on YouTube, you could have seen Dana White calling himself the grim reaper and bragging about how he has defeated or derailed or acquired one after another company that tried to compete with the UFC. In 2011, UFC acquired strike force, which at the time was the most prominent rival still standing. Come lead, it's unbelievable. It was a great fight this year for one more time, Scott Smith and come lead. The CEO of Strike Force, Scott Coker, has said in the past that he saw himself like Luke Skywalker up against the Death Star trying to compete with UFC. Eventually, when Strike Force was bought out by UFC, my only option was go to UFC because they had the rest of my contract. Now I'm under a contract where it's only an 18 month contract with six fights, but five years later, I'm still stuck in the contract.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,334,2022-10-07 00:04:48
12109," What's This Oop is? The month before UFC's parent company, Zufa, completed its acquisition of Strike Force, a UFC executive sent an email and the subject line of that email was, we own MMA. And the UFC has admitted in documents that have now become public, that they've almost never lost a fighter that they wanted to keep. In internal UFC emails, we now know the company referred to what it was doing as choking off oxygen to the competition. The most important oxygen that UFC allegedly ran a foul over the law by cutting off two its competitors is the fighters themselves. And not only did they make it clear to us, they made it clear to the whole mixed martial arts world, there is no negotiating. These are very strict, never-ending contracts and that's the case for this day. The UFC just says, oh you want to fight for us, you sign here, if you don't want to, we've got 20 other guys that will take your spot. They have 70, 80, 90 percent of the top fighters under exclusive contract, meaning that those fighters are not available to any other MMA promoter. And fighters, even if they wiggled their way out of the very restrictive contracts that UFC imposed on them, didn't have another professional mixed martial arts option because there weren't robust rivals to go sell their work to. On Tuesday afternoon, a class action lawsuit was filed in US District Court in San Jose against Zufa LLC with fighters, Kung Lee, Nate Corey and John Fitch attached to the suit. Rampe Jassin came to me and says, hey, Kung, I know this lawyer, he will help get the fairness for the fighters in the marketplace. And I decided I wanted to step up for all the fighters that being affected. At the end of 2014, more than six years ago now, a group of now all former fighters filed anti-trust class action lawsuit against UFC. And in broad terms, the case is an antitrust case where we're claiming that the UFC is both a monopoly and a monopsony. Usually when we talk about monopoly, we're talking about the power that a company has when it becomes the only one selling something. Monopsony is about the power of being a monopoly purchaser of something, and particularly a monopoly purchaser of labor. A key argument in this lawsuit has been about as UFC succeeds in its revenue sores, how much should we expect that absent illegal conduct, the fighters pay would soar as well. In UFC, year after year, the share of the company's revenue that goes to actually paying the workers doing the fighting has hovered around or below 20%. And what this analysis shows through complex statistical regression modeling is that if the UFC was competitive and did not allegedly violate the antitrust laws, it would pay its fighters 50% or more of the revenues is generated just like baseball, just like hockey, just like basketball, boxing. If instead of paying 20% of the revenues generated, it paid 50% or more of the revenues generated, the fighters would have made $1.6 billion more during the period that we measured 2010.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,335,2022-10-07 00:09:07
12110," A 50% are more of the revenues generated. The fighters would have made $1.6 billion more during the period that we measured 2010 to 2017. Sometimes when you write about allegations against companies and particularly about lawsuits against companies, those companies don't want to say a whole lot about them or are pretty dismissive of the significance of litigation against them. UFC in their comments to me has been pretty feisty about this, saying that they see this lawsuit actually as a threat to the ability of businesses to take risks and succeed and that they don't want to roll over, that they want to fight it and they want to defeat it. The fighters I talk to describe having side jobs, being reliant on UFC in part because after taxes and expenses, they weren't making enough money to feel financially secure. The overview of my career from a financial perspective is something that had a challenge in admitting. I can tell you now that I lived in my mom's attached to the entire time I was fighting and I had a second job as a bouncer and a bartender, a third job as a personal trainer, just to make ends meet. Nate Quarry told me that over his time in UFC, he fought fights while he was tens of thousands of dollars in debt coming into the fight. It gets so disheartening because I've seen fights that are called the fight of the year. This is just this brutal war and they battled for four and a half rounds until one guy's body just gave up and then you find out, oh, that guy made $60,000 for that fight. In one of the hearings in this lawsuit, UFC's attorney argued that if the fighters were really the product, if all that UFC were selling were the fighters, then the fighters wouldn't need UFC at all. That a fighter is not themselves the UFC product any more than an Apple engineer who makes a cool iPhone is the product that Apple is selling. We the fighters make this whole thing happen and it's been driven by Chuck LaDell. It's been driven by Reyna Gattour. It's been driven by Conor McGregor. It's been driven by Brock Lesnar. It's been driven by all the greats that have walked before us and that walk this path right now. We are the product. If the fighters are not the product, then go ahead and release us from our contracts. You'll do fine without us. Clearly, it's the identity and rank and popularity of those fighters that attract the eyeballs and make the sport what it is. And if you can lock all those up and keep them from other promotions, you can dominate the sport, which is what they've admitted they've done. William Isaacson, a lawyer for UFC, said in a statement that UFC has spent many years building a world-class organization, enhancing the brand of our athletes, and championing the sport of MMA. UFC pays its fighters more than any other MMA promoter with average fighter compensation rising by over 600% since 2005. Our efforts have raised the global popularity of the sport and the overall revenue potential of all MMA organizations and athletes. In December of 2020, the judge announced a crucial step in this lawsuit, which is that he is going to certify it as a class action. Class certification makes this lawsuit a much more significant threat to UFC, and the judge made clear long before saying how he planned to rule that he expected whatever he did to be appealed into federal appeals court and on from there to the US Supreme Court. So we are likely in for many more months and years of wrangling over this. Teamwork! Kyle Pingsbury said that he doesn't think any settlement would be acceptable unless it includes a change to the restrictive contracts that UFC uses to keep fighters bound to the UFC.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,336,2022-10-07 00:13:32
12111," The ball, unless it includes a change to the restrictive contracts that UFC uses to keep fighters bound to the UFC. My son's about to turn six years old and it started when he was in the womb. You know, we're in this thing to the end to change the sport forever. We want the same freedoms that are offered in any other major sport. Every other major sport has gone through what we're going through right now. People tell fighters, you know, just shut up. Look at how lucky you are. Well, no, actually we're fighting for what we believe in. We're going to continue being fighters and that's how we how we're made. We're going to continue being fighters and that's how we're going to continue being fighters. We're going to continue being fighters and that's how we're made. Every nation that's a coastal state has some region of the sea floor that falls within their territorial waters. And many countries including the US, the area that's underwater exceeds the area that's above water. So huge amounts of nations, areas and regions are just really unexplored, uncharacterized. We don't really know what's there. We know less about our sea bed than we do about the surface of the moon or Mars. Only 20% of it has been mapped. The map of the sea floor could lead to all kinds of discoveries like numerous species and rare earth minerals like cobalt that we need for electric cars and mobile phones. The value of all the gold deposits are loan on the sea floor is estimated to be around $150 trillion. A map could also help us when tragedy strikes. Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared from radar screens. The mapping of the ocean floor is being carried out. The problem is that the southern Indian Ocean is just so incredibly huge. To me, a map is a fundamental piece of understanding of who we are, where we are, where things are. Once you understand something, you start to value it more. When you start to value something, that's when you start to really think about making it healthy and preserving it and keeping it going. A map is the first step. It's the basic understanding that you need to figure out where you are. Oceans. They cover over 70% of the planet, but most of what lies underneath is a mystery. The sea floor is a really fascinating landscape. We don't have a lot of data to describe the shape of it in detail. But in places where we do, there are spectacular features. There's neanderings channels with all kinds of interesting topography. There are canyons, there are sea mounts, mid ocean ridges, all kinds of things that we see on land that are just basically hidden from us by the water. As it stands, this is what a map of the sea bed looks like. All that black? Those are the parts we haven't mapped yet. At present, most people think that the sea floor is actually mapped because you'll see a world ocean map and you can see some shape of the sea floor. But most of that is based on prediction. Roughly 80% of what you see for the world ocean floor is modeled based on measurements of the sea surface height and a computation based on gravity. In 2017, the Nippon Foundation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,337,2022-10-07 00:17:44
12112," is modeled based on measurements of the sea surface height and a computation based on gravity. In 2017, the Nippon Foundation and the General Barthometric Chart of the Oceans, or JEPCO, launched C-Bed 2030. It's a collaborative project to collect and collate data oceanwide and create a complete map of the sea floor by the end of the decade. To do this would take one ship around 350 years at a cost of up to $3 billion. That's why data is harvested by all kinds of vessels from fishing boats to freighters. Because there is so little data, it's important that vessels that are capable and willing to acquire data when they're just moving around the ocean do so. So we have a lot of data that's collected during transit. There's a lot of academic requirements to make data publicly available. There's industry data that's starting to become more and more available. There's government data. So there's a lot of different ways that this data is coming in and it's a really messy and challenging puzzle that put together. But what's exciting is that it's a puzzle that put together. Since C-Bed 2030 launched, the area map has risen to 20 percent and all the information collected is freely available. The more data we have collectively and other people can access, the faster the discoveries are made, which really pushes forward our understanding at a faster rate than if you held on to that data and it was only you with that data. Things like machine learning and artificial intelligence are also going to kick in in the next decade. Because with all this data, they'll be able to make connections that are a lot faster than perhaps we would have been able to which then again feeds our human understanding and also gives us new ideas, new ways of thinking, of exploration. Until the early 20th century, mapping technology was simple. Usually a weight attached to a long rope known as a lead line. After the Titanic sank in 1912, explorers proposed using sound waves to find its hole in the North Atlantic. This led to Sona, the most common technique used for mapping today. Operated by the Schmidt Ocean Institute, the Falcaw is an 82 meter long research vessel equipped with two multi beam Sona systems that have helped Deborah Smith and a team of other marine technicians to map over a million square kilometers of the sea floor. You know, you go from somebody with a rope with some knots to Sona or Acoustics that is, I call it math magic, but it is incredibly advanced mathematical technology to be able to measure the distance and time of travel of sound on a moving ship. Multi beam mapping works by using Sona's. So Sona is taking sound and the measurement of time. So you have a multi beam Sona and it sends out a ping of sound. That sound travels through the water column, hits the sea floor and comes back to the ship and we measure that time and we're able to calculate the distance. Each individual ping of sound has many many beams. So it looks like a giant fan across the sea floor and that fan is moving along the sea floor. So you have many tiny little beams going across and they're traveling along a track. You can look at that data and look at both the peaks and the valleys and the highs and the lows and sort of create a three-dimensional image of the sea floor. The accuracy of multi beam Sona really depends on the water depth that you're in. Think of it like a flashlight beam and if you're holding a flashlight and you're shining it on the floor, the closer you get to the floor with your flashlight, the smaller that beam is. If you have 400 of these beams all across, so think of 400 people holding a flashlight. The closer they hold that flashlight to the sea floor, the smaller your beam is, which also means the smaller that you can find information or data about. So it really depends on the depth of the sea floor in order to see how much you can define an object. This variation in depth means that mapping resolution will range from 100 by 100 meters in shallow waters to 800 by 800 meters in the deepest parts of the ocean, which go down as far as 11,000 meters. Remote.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,338,2022-10-07 00:22:14
12113," to 800 by 800 metres in the deepest parts of the ocean, which go down as far as 11,000 metres. Remotely operated vehicles or ROVs can then be sent down to investigate seabed features up close. We've just crossed the 1000 metre mark and it's 4.6 degrees C and now we're going to drive the ROV down at a high rate towards the sea floor. On a recent mapping expedition, scientists on the Falcourt discovered a 500 metre tall coral structure in Australia's Great Barrier Reef, the first to be discovered in over 120 years. A place that is incredibly popular, well-visited, well-traveled, we're still finding new things. You don't know until you map it and so until you get that high resolution picture, you don't know the sand waves or the old riverbeds that used to be there or the waterfalls off the side of a volcano that used to be above the surface and now is below the surface. It's a little bit of everything. Think of let's say Hawaii or someplace where you see a volcano above the water, picture that below the water. I'm really kind of obsessed with the whole concept of scale here. Although we can create 3D models and kind of come up with these visualizations, it's not the same as that feeling of looking out over this big landscape. But I mean, I think we'll get there soon with VR and other kinds of technology, but it's really spectacular to think about, especially with the familiarity that some of us have with these features, like what it looks like. We look out at the ocean and it just looks flat, maybe with little bumps. We really don't think about all of this that's underneath and it's really an amazing landscape that's just hidden from us. With more than 90% of the ocean deeper than 200 metres, fleets of autonomous vehicles could make the data gathering process faster, cheaper and safer. And new discoveries might help with exploration of all kinds. I think the ocean can actually provide us with huge insights as we go out into space as well and look for life and other kinds of life forms. I also think in this next few years we will have a different kind of access to the ocean because of virtual reality and augmented reality. And so that will allow us to sit in our living rooms and really experience what's underwater in a different way and see this different alien planet. Since the dawn of man, meat has been on the menu. And even with growing trends of vegetarian diets and plant-based substitutes, around 89% of the world population consider themselves omnivores. We have come a long way from our hunter and gatherer roots. We have managed to establish a whole industry designed to feed almost 7.7 billion people. We've maximized production and we managed to reduce hunger over the past couple of decades. And although we've become exceedingly efficient at putting meat on the table, raising livestock animals by the billions comes with its own set of consequences. And if animal agriculture continues to expand.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,339,2022-10-07 00:26:31
12114," Own set of consequences. If animal agriculture continues to expand the way it has, there is a race that we won't be able to stop climate change. But with rapid advances in technology, we might soon see a food industry that leaves all those problems behind. I'm going to be one of the world's first commercial customers for lab-grown meat, cultured meat. It's eat-just as the company and I'm very, very excited. Here is the chicken. Looks pretty crispy outside. I'm going to be able to eat the chicken. I'm going to be able to eat the chicken. That's really good. I mean, look, it's really tasty. Here at 1880 in Singapore, cultured chicken is being served under a regulatory approval granted by the Singaporean government. It's the very first time a cultured meat product, meat made from animal cells grown in a lab, has been approved for commercial sale. Eat-just, the company behind these chicken nugget-style dishes, is based out of San Francisco and got their start in 2020. Developing plant-based egg substitutes like mung bean, scrambled eggs, and mayonnaise. But it wasn't until 2017 that they announced they were shifting focus to a cultured meat product. In order to feed the world that we live in, a lot of animal protein, we need to take a third today, and it'll be more tomorrow, of our world and make it dedicated to feeding chickens and cows. We go to areas that are filled with biodiversity rainforests, taking a bulldozer to them, and planting soybean corn, to feed the chickens that we climate change is accelerated by the kind of animal production that we engage in. When we bring animals in tiny little spaces, it accelerates the probability that more zoonotic diseases are going to impact our families. And from a morality perspective, why do we need to cause any harm to any other living thing? To have dinner that tastes good? It does not have to be that way. And those things underlie the force of this idea. The meat alternatives that have made it to the market thus far have been plant-based. Immutation beef and pork made from ingredients like pea protein and coconut oil by companies like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods. That's a very different proposition from cultured meat, which is made from actual animal cells. I'm a huge fan of any company, of any person trying to make a product that's improving the food system, including all the plant-based proteins. Maybe in some future menu, you'll have this kind of cultivated chicken and you'll also have a plant-based version. That's fine. But I guess you have to ask yourself, in our lifetime, is that diner likely to also remove the conventional option on the menu too? We do think we need a more permanent solution. We do think we need, if you will, an end game to this problem and we just think this is more likely to be the path to achieve that. So animal cell technology has been around for several decades for applications such as development of vaccines and other biotherapeutics. The first known prototype of cultured meat was done by Mark Posts earlier in 2011. And essentially, he was developing beef patty. It was a very expensive prototype, if I'm not mistaken, above 250,000 euros at the time to produce just one beef patty. It was more of a group of concepts to really demonstrate that this technology is possible and that it can be done. The way that we grow and produce culture chicken is essentially we isolate chicken cells from the chickens without having to kill them. So from a small biopsy, for instance, we merge these cells in a liquid broth that contains the nutrients that the cells need to survive and be healthy and to grow. We really need these cells to multiply, to reach the numbers that are sufficient to make a meat product. We're looking into the cells that are really important for meat, so we think about muscle cells, fat cells, by the isolation, we are able to form those muscle tissues in culture. The culture happens inside of a fermentation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,340,2022-10-07 00:31:04
12115," isolation we are able to form those muscle tissues in culture. The culture happens inside of a fermentation tank, what we call the bioreactor, which is essentially providing the same conditions as the animal body. Warm temperatures, some sort of mechanical stimulation, so that the cells that are exposed to very similar conditions that they have inside of the animal. After the cells proliferate and reach a certain density, the final step is essentially to separate those cells from the liquid broth that they are in. We just make sure that the product meets our quality and safety standards, and then those cells are ready for consumption. Milk, cheese, yogurt, a lot of those derived from fermentations. The only difference is that they are starting from a different cell type. In this case, we are just using the animal cells as the initial and beginning of the product. Eatjust has developed chicken nuggets so far, with far more textured chicken breast plan for the future. But another cell-based meat startup, Memphis Meats, has already started working on culturing other animal cells as well. We've done beef, we've done duck, we've done chicken, and these are things that are favorites in various parts of the world, for instance, people in America love beef and chicken. People in China love duck, so we wanted to show that we at Memphis Meats can produce meats that we as a global population love to eat. There's a lot of similarity on how we grow the meats from various animals or fish, but they're also different because of nutrients they need and how they actually come together to form the final product they meet. I think it's very similar to how we also grow various animals. There's similarities in the feed that we gave cows and pigs and chickens, but there's also differences how we cultivate and it's very similar for us as well. So we've been working with the FDA and the USDA for the last three years and really developing the guidelines on how this food should be regulated when we come to the market. As soon as we get regulatory approval in the United States, people will be able to go to the supermarket and buy it and enjoy it. They'll be able to go to a restaurant near them and order meat directly from animal cells. But it's not just getting the meat right. It's approved the gates open to a very high potential demand and scaling becomes the next big hurdle. Before we can only make chicken for myself, my friends, my friends, my family, my colleagues, now we actually have the ability to make chicken for millions of people. So that allows us to invest and to allow the economies to scale to drop the price. The second is we need to reduce the cost of the nutrients that these cells are consuming. So they can feed, raise or drop the price of chicken. To nutrients, we feed ourselves those the same things. We need to drive that down. The cell density is another technical element. We need to continue to increase that and hammering on those things. So of course, in the next five, 10, 15 years, we'll put us in a place where we're significantly below the cost of this animal protein and that will be one of the main inflection points that we'll lead to a new way of eating meat. So here is a close-up of a half-eaten crispy chicken bite. You know what? What I'm really thinking is, I'm just eating chicken. I like chicken. No. The normal chicken's eight. I don't know where they came from. And so I don't know why I should be very stressed where this came from either. The meat market is worth more than $1 trillion annually. And there are over 60 startups in the cultured meat field. Cultured meat has attracted several prominent investors, including Sergei Brin, Richard Branson and Bill Gates. What is also interesting is that even meat giants such as Cargill and Tyson have invested in the space. It's this disruptive potential of the market as well as a promise to greatly reduce the climate impact of meat production that has attracted investors. It remains to be seen who will get regulatory approval in which countries and whether consumers will like lab-grown meat enough to make the switch. And while there's no evidence that lab-grown meat is any less healthy than traditional meat, there's an ongoing debate over how healthy eating meat is.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,341,2022-10-07 00:35:24
12116," lab-grown meat enough to make the switch. And while there's no evidence that lab-grown meat is any less healthy than traditional meat, there's an ongoing debate over how healthy eating meat is in general. But if these products are a success, they could be the beginning of a more humane, less destructive meat industry. The food and ag industry is the most innovative industry in the world. It's always figured out how to feed a growing population. And we've never failed doing so. And it's been very clear to us that we are part of that, and we're going to figure out how to feed the next three billion people joining us. And I just see an evolution. We can do this a bit differently. We can do this in a way that is consistent with the kind of people that we want to be, the kind of planet that we all want to live in. We can build a food system that reflects really the best characteristics of who we are. And that makes me really hopeful. In possible foods might be the world's most ambitious company. Just listen to founder and CEO Pat Brown. People wonder how big the plant-based meat industry is going to be. It will be the meat industry in 20 years. We're going to look back and basically say, well, remember back in the day when we used to his animals to make meat? Yes, impossible-stated gold really is to replace the use of animals as a food production technology globally by 2035. That would mean supplanting a $1.2 trillion industry not to mention a source of sustenance as old as time. To be fair, the company has got a lot of people talking about its products. So there's this thing called the Impossible Burger. What's called artificial meat? The realest, fakes the burger in the world. Not bad. But before impossible foods can take over the world, it's going to have to overcome strong competitors, penetrate tough new markets and generally transform its product from a conversation piece into a ubiquitous staple food. With the coronavirus turning the world of food upside down, this could be the moment when impossible's new fangled meat goes mainstream. The Impossible Foods was founded in 2011 when Pat Brown, a longtime vegan, was nearing the end of an accomplished career in biochemistry. I've been assigned to my whole life and just came to this realization that by far the most important scientific question in the world is, what makes meat delicious? Pat Brown, someone call a zealot for his mission. He really doesn't hold back when it comes to talking about wanting to completely replace animal agriculture. The fact that we're producing meat from animals is the most destructive technology on Earth. And if we're going to avert catastrophic climate change, we have to find a better way to produce meat. You've probably heard about the dangers of cow flatulence. Their digestive systems produce large quantities of the powerful greenhouse gas, methane. In fact, it's estimated that livestock farming is responsible for nearly 15% of all greenhouse gas emissions. In possible claims, it takes 89% less GHGs, 87% less water, and 96% less land to produce its burger. The key, of course, would be to get people to actually eat the thing, which is where the company's secret ingredient comes in. We also say, in a way, we basically forms a safe habitat forordre animals.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,342,2022-10-07 00:39:45
12117," The key, of course, would be to get people to actually eat the thing, which is where the company's secret ingredient comes in. Him, a genetically engineered substance with a bloody iron-rich taste like red meat. So him is a very controversial part of the Impossible Burger. It's also what makes the Impossible Burger what it is. There are a lot of consumer groups and anti-GMO groups that oppose the Impossible Burger because of the heme. The studies on its safety are a pretty short term, but the FDA has approved it and the company says it's completely safe and there isn't any evidence that it isn't. Critics have also challenged the company's claim to health advantages over traditional meat, pointing out that while the Impossible Burger has less fat, sodium and calories than it's beefy cousin, it's also more highly processed. But let's be real, we're talking about minnicking hamburgers here, not kale salads. These burgers are definitely better for the environment, so that's a plus, but they are not necessarily better for your health. After years in the lab, Patton's colleagues were confident they had a product even Ron Sponson could love, and the Impossible Burger made its debut in 2016. Their burger began its life in the public when it was sold at David Chainsaw with Foucault and they went from sort of higher and fine dining restaurants into higher and burger restaurants like Bare Burger and Mommy Burger and then suddenly they started popping up everywhere. It tastes like a burger, it tastes like meat. This is all made from plants. All made from plants. This tastes like meat. Doesn't that just look like real meat? So meat-like. They always say it's what they say. They're just like a burger. It tastes like yuckers. It's the form of the world, the relics. Yeah, it doesn't taste like a burger. Opinions differed on the Impossible Burger's relative meatiness, but the debate itself was fantastic for your advertising, helping to propel Impossible into major chains like White Castle and then in the summer of 2019 into more than 7,000 Burger Kings across the US. To date, the company has raised over a billion dollars and a funding round in March valued the company at around 4 billion. But fake meat is a happening space these days and impossible faces some daunting competition. So I'm now for the stock of the hour and that is Beyond Meat Shares of the Foumeat or Plant-Based Protein Company are soaring today. Beyond Meat is also making a very meaty burger from plants, they're very non-GMO, they stress that all the time to differentiate themselves from Impossible. It will be much easier to genetically modify plant material to make it take on the texture and appearance and aroma of animal protein, but we won't do that. Beyond Meat had one of the biggest IPOs of the year in 2019, so Impossible, which is still privately held, has some catching up to do. But you won't hear Pat Brown knocking his biggest competitor. I wish I'm nothing but success, they have the same mission we have. The only rival we care about is the incumbent animal-based industry. Rivals or not, Impossible and Beyond certainly agree on one thing. The true prize isn't the American market, it's China. The 77% of the world's meat is consumed in China compared to just 9% in the US. The Chinese population eats a ton of meat, they are a huge market. China is a really interesting case because they have long had vegetarian cuisine as part of their culinary culture and whether they are looking for meat replacements is still an open question. What we found in our reporting is that some consumers are excited about them. It's just we don't know if it's going to be enough. To improve its prospects, Impossible is developing a plant-based replacement for pork. Globally pork is the most widely consumed meat. It's almost 40% of all the meat consumed globally. Number one in Europe, number one in China. So if we're going to achieve our mission, pork is right up there. No word yet on when Impossible Pork will be available.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,343,2022-10-07 00:43:58
12118," on in Europe, number one in China. So if we're going to achieve our mission, pork is right up there. No word yet on when Impossible Pork will be available. This morning, growing concerns about the nation's food supply. From butchers to national supermarkets, supplies now limited and prices rising. The impact of the coronavirus on the price and availability of meat has given a boost to companies like Impossible Foods. Over the four weeks ending April 19th, sales of plant-based meat increased. But Impossible has acknowledged some negative effects from the pandemic as well. This being a product that has primarily been served in restaurants, they took a pretty big hit with all the food service shutdowns, although the company doesn't want to say, you know, how much of a hit. They have, however, announced some new retail rollouts. Recently, they announced that they're going to be rolling out with crogrer supermarkets. And that's big, that's great for them. The question of whether this is like a long-term sea change for these companies. Uh-huh, just off the wait seat. It's safe to say Impossible stands a slim chance of achieving its goal of replacing the entire meat industry. But it's early days for the science of plant-based meat, and it's not impossible that these products could one day contribute to a greener, more humane future. In the meantime, as the technology improves, we get to look forward to many more years of this. This is meat. No, this isn't possible. Yeah, that's what I thought. This is the meat burger. I like it better. It's not even close to a veggie burger or a tofu burger or anything. Oh, that's very, very much. Get it done. What are a strategically important point on the map of Pakistan? It's very close to Iran actually, on the very southern coast. It's about a 10-hour drive west of Karachi, but it's only about an hour drive to Iran. The area is extremely poor. It's very arid. It doesn't have enough water. Electricity has been very spotty. One of the most surprising things about visiting Guadar is the high degree of security that is absolutely everywhere. There are armed guards that are required to escort foreign visitors everywhere you go because it is contested region because there have been militant attacks in the past. Despite all this, Guadar is a key part of the China-Pakistan economic corridor, also known as CPEC. The crown jewel of President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road initiative. We will leave no stone unturned in ensuring that CPEC and all the projects under its umbrella are materialized in time and in full. So far just one-third of all CPEC projects have been completed. In Guadar none of them have been and the promised improvements for local people like job creation and better infrastructure have not materialized. So what has China got to gain from developing this seemingly obscure city on the Pakistani coast? We have seen this movie before. An outside power comes into Pakistan. It spends heavily on big infrastructure projects. China is not the first to do it. Right after Pakistan became independent in the late 1940s, early 50s, the US was sending advisors into Pakistan to help.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,344,2022-10-07 00:48:20
12119," Right after Pakistan became independent in the late 1940s, early 50s, the US was sending advisors into Pakistan to help plant economy. US was doing infrastructure projects there too. Those early projects helped the US gain Pakistan as an ally against the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The US has provided about $80 billion in aid to Pakistan since its independence, but overall the result is disappointing. One of the recent attempts was in the late 2000s as part of the US effort to combat terrorism in Afghanistan. The number one item on that aid package was to build these high visibility infrastructure projects. So there are literally projects that the United States tried to do or Pakistan proposed to the United States in the 2000s during that period that have become Belt and Road projects. China is stepping into a gap which has been left by retreating ambition from the US. The Belt and Road Initiative is China's President Xi Jinping's signature foreign policy initiative. Launched in 2013, it comprises an overland belt stretching through China's central Asia into Europe and a maritime road stretching around Southeast Asia through the India Ocean and up past East Africa. So a benign way of characterising China's Belt and Road initiative would be infrastructure influence. So when Xi Jinping announced the Belt and Road Initiative, shortly afterwards China designated Pakistan as its showcase flagship project. So the China Pakistan Economic Quarter was going to be the biggest and most important showcase for the success of the Belt and Road. Pakistan is in great need of infrastructure development. They wanted to create a railway, highway road, all kinds of economic development that is intended to help Pakistan and it's meant to provide jobs 2.3 million jobs for Pakistanis. It's meant to provide a 2.5% boost to GDP growth. And China would gain economically as well. XiPek was intended to reduce oil and gas routes from the Middle East by thousands of miles. A way to cut overland into western China instead of going around Southeast Asia by ship. Projects in Pakistan also provide Chinese state owned companies with an additional market. Chinese workers are brought to Pakistan to build infrastructure and then take wages home. XiPek is also strategically significant for China and Pakistan. China wants to strengthen this relationship to counter their shared rival India. XiPek is both an instrument of Chinese power as well as a test of Chinese power. If it succeeds, China will be demonstrating that it's able to do what great powers have not been able to do in Pakistan, including the United States. Which is why Guadal is so important. It's in Pakistan's Bologchistan province, an area with serious electricity and water shortages. Bologchistan province is actually populated by people who are of Bologch origin. There are different ethnicity. They speak a different language from the majority in power in Islamabad. And they feel as the poorest province in Pakistan, they have not sufficiently benefited from some of the economic achievements that the rest of Pakistan has had. That area is quite contested by the Bologchistan Liberation Army. The people who feel that even Pakistani people have encroached into their territory. So quite a number of people are still staging attacks and they attacked the biggest international hotel in Guadar. Shout up the lobby and killed I think five people. But this unsettled city is where the China-Pakistan economic corridor is supposed to lead to. Authorities plan to develop Guadar into an international port city. Guadar port has an interesting history.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,345,2022-10-07 00:52:29
12120," Pakistan economic corridor is supposed to lead to authorities plan to develop Guadar into an international port city. Guadar port has an interesting history and an interesting location too. It's located in Baluchistan. It's about 120 kilometers from Iran. Pakistan purchased this territory from Oman, I think of the 1950s. And so for a long time Pakistan has had on its agenda trying to develop this area. Since the 70s it's wanted to build a port in Guadar. Actually approached the United States in the 1970s and tried to convince the Nixon administration to pay for a port. Even offered naval access if the United States was willing to pay for that. The US rejected Pakistan's offer, concerned that the port would not be commercially viable and would cause geopolitical tension. But in the early 2000s a Chinese company was awarded the contract to build the port and they completed phase one of construction in 2006. The port was then managed by a Singaporean government entity. In 2013 a Chinese port operator took over from the Singaporeans. In 2015 China announced that it will expand the port as part of the CPEC initiative but five years later little has happened. When you look out at the port you can see it has only three births and all of them were empty. And the only ship that was in the port at the time was a Pakistan naval forget. And so it indicated to me that the port is not particularly operational for commercial purposes and a number of analysts have talked about the strategic importance in a military sense. If eventually China were able to use the port of Guadar as a military base. No one would be surprised if China did use it in that way. I don't think in the short term like it is set up in Djibouti where it has a permanent base. I think it's more likely to use it as almost like a sort of forward based resupply option. Something it can use when it wants to. A 19km highway linking the port with the Macaranc hostel highway in Balochistan is under construction too. Most of the people who live there and work there already are fishermen. They rely on access to the sea. The way that the highway expressed by way from the port was originally proposed would have cut off their sea access. So that was a real point of contention with the community. There have been some proposals to allow them to underpass. It's still a little bit unclear how that is finally going to be resolved. Even if those projects are eventually built there are serious questions about who will work there. There is a problem with manpower of course in Guadar. It's a very small city. One proposal has been well will just ship Chinese workers in from China and build lots of fancy housing for them. The first Chinese build community in Pakistan, a 500 million dollar development spanning over 10 million square feet with over 60% open spaces. That kind of proposal is what makes a lot of the Pakistani local people quite upset. A Guadal based journalist expressed concerns to Bloomberg over projects like this. The journalist spoke anonymously for fear of persecution from the Pakistan government. These projects are creating jobs but they're not really creating jobs for the local people of Guadal. They're not against economic prosperity but they're against the development that leads them behind. Pakistan doesn't have the money to build these projects. It's gone to the IMF for its 13th bailout since the 1980s. By engaging in CPEC projects the government of Pakistan has incurred more debts from China. Not only posing challenges for Pakistan but possibly the international community if Pakistan eventually defaults on its debts. But CPEC is still set to go on. Even if most current projects haven't been completed the two countries have recently signed new projects worth $11 billion. Pakistan's Prime Minister said the country's economic future is linked with China. It's hard to imagine how the China-Pakistan economic corridor is going to be.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,346,2022-10-07 00:56:53
12121," is linked with China. It's hard to imagine how the China Pakistan Economic Quarter is going to be the game changer that the Pakistan government would like it to be. We're not seeing the economic growth or benefit from the projects that were set out. We're supposed to have seen by now. We're not seeing the job creation. Project delays, accumulating debts, commercial viability. These problems of CPEC are also typical of Belt and Road projects around the world. For China, though, it's never the narrow accounting perspective that matters. It's the bigger strategic benefits. As China's dollars continue to flow, as China's concrete continues to pour, China's influence continues to increase. There was some degree of runaway expectations. I think there was also some degree that they were an extremely forthcoming with the state of the game. The Cyberpunk 2077 story is very much kind of a story of everything that can and will go rock in game development. What is this bug? Jack is AI flipped out. It wasn't there before. Where's my gun? I can't shoot. The release of Cyberpunk 2077 in December of 2020 will go down as one of the most disastrous game launches in history. And it instantly rewrote the narrative of its celebrated developer, CD Projekt Red. Larger studios with bigger budgets weren't able to create the same quality of open-world game. The inside story of the making of Cyberpunk depicts a process marred by unchecked ambition, unrealistic timelines, and a focus on marketing and the expensive development. When CD Projekt Stock was at its high, it was the largest stock in the Polish stock market. Cyberpunk was supposed to be the biggest game of 2020. This was a game that was starring Keanu Reeves. This was a game that was from the makers of The Witcher 3. This was supposed to be the big temple release of last year. And for it to become such a disaster for so many people, I think, will have pretty far-reaching consequences. CD Projekt Origins are somewhat unique in the game's industry. In the West and Japan, the late 80s and 90s were dominated by games through the home console market. And characters like Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog were becoming household names. The same was not true in a post-Soviet and economically depressed Poland. Most games were done on PCs, and most games were copied and sold in small markets around the country. You could go to the market down the street in Warsaw and buy and sell CDs. And these two guys, Marchine Winski and Michal Kaczynski, decided they were going to start selling CDs and they wound up striking a deal with the people who made a game called Baldur's Gate, and they were kind of like the seminal role-playing game in the late 90s. It was never a business, it was kind of lifestyle. So we're actually pretty bad with counting money. So you can kind of think of it almost like Nike, you know, where Phil Knight was selling shoes out of the trunk of his car, you know, you can kind of think about it the same way. It was, you know, just selling physical goods and then evolving that into a much broader...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,347,2022-10-07 01:01:31
12122," You know, just selling physical goods and then evolving that into a much broader enterprise. CD Projekt, named for selling CDs, would move on from just reselling games to localizing Western and Japanese made games into the Polish language. But it wasn't until 2002 that the company would make its own game, the Witcher. The Witcher is a huge, huge series, huge fantasy series in Poland. And so it was a pretty big deal that these guys got the race to make the video games. The Witcher book series is a source of national pride in Poland. And as CD Projekt released the Witcher 2, the video game series would become an important economic symbol for Poland as well. The CD Projekt Red had become this behemoth of an institution in Poland. And they were really big in the Polish technology scene because they were getting more worldwide attention than most Polish companies do. And I'm making a lot of money and in 2011 when Barack Obama came to visit Poland, the Prime Minister actually gave him a copy of the Witcher 2. I confess I'm not very good at video games, but I've been told that it is a great example of Poland's place in the new global economy. But it would be the launch of the Witcher 3 in 2015 that would elevate CD Projekt Red from representing the best of Poland to representing the best of the game's industry. I mean really the thing people look for first and foremost I think is that the game is just good and Witcher 3 was just a phenomenal game. There's a level of just storytelling and emphasis on making every side quest count on top of the atmosphere, the dialogue, the character interactions, the different way stories can end. They nail that. Other open world games felt empty and enforced and the developers of them gave excuses as to why there couldn't be more rich story or interactions. And the Witcher 3 blew them out of the water. CD Projekt Red was beloved. They were seen as a studio that was willing to make what the player wanted and to truly put in the love and effort required to make a high quality game that really connects with the people playing with it. And the winner for Game of the Year 2015 is the Witcher 3. The Witcher 3 would go into an over 250 game of the year award, but along with being a critical success for CD Projekt it was also a financial success. Estimates put the sales of Witcher 3 at around 28 million copies in 2019. A huge step up considering by 2014 the Witcher and the Witcher 2 had only combined to sell 8 million copies. And with two large expansions for the Witcher 3 CD Projekt also helped separate themselves from other AAA publishers at the time. And the game award goes, oh man I have to pay a micro transaction to them. That's so stupid that this has to hold on. I got this guys. Here we go. Other games and the most notorious one to do this was EA's Star Wars Battlefront 2. They got really aggressive on micro transactions in a game that already cost at least $60. You could have paid more if you bought premium editions, but not only was it that they were being very aggressive and trying to get you to spend money, but you could actually get items that helped you win. Well, gamers kind of draw the line in the sand there and they don't like them. CD Projekt had done this phenomenal job of marketing themselves as a gamer friendly company. We've said this a million times and I'll say it again, we're gamers first of all and we all like to be treated fairly. So it only makes sense that as developers we apply the same principle to everything we do here at CD Projekt Red. So giving everyone a bunch of free DLC was an absolutely no brainer. They said we're not going to sell you DLC that's like horse armor packs and other nonsense. We're going to just give you free stuff and then we're going to sell big expansions as part of the Witcher 3. And not only were they really good, they were offered at a fair price. And this was a company that was seen as just like a company that really cared about quality and cared about its...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,348,2022-10-07 01:05:43
12123," Not only were they really good, they were offered at a fair price. And this is a company that was seen as just like a company that really cared about quality and cared about its customers and would not do anything to kind of screw fans over the way that fans see that EA and Activision and all the other big publishers do. With a critically and financially successful game, as well as the goodwill from the gaming audience, all the focus would shift to CD projects next release, Cyberpunk 2077. It's actually funny, they first announced it through like a press release. CD Predic Red though wouldn't put out another trailer for Cyberpunk until 2018 at the E3 Trade Show. Welcome to the gameplay demo walkthrough of CD Project Red's upcoming title, Cyberpunk 2077. The gameplay you're about to see is from a work in progress version of the game. Everything you see is potentially subject to change. This, if they can live up to what they showed me, it's game over. It all looked incredibly impressive, they had enough action, enough narrative beats with just the right amount of tension. They touted how each of these NPCs, their thousands of them, each one with their own daily routines and everything. We've greatly enhanced our crowd and community system to create the most believable city in any open world game. So yeah, so people were certainly blown away by the demo at 1 E3 Awards and just people left the theater just in awe. What they didn't know of course is that the demo was completely fake. Fake demos are common at E3. Studios put together builds of games to show off what they tend to be like rather than the actual state of the game. What was unique about this demo was that it was impressively long. It kind of plays into this idea that CD Project is very much a market and driven company and so demos were really, really important to them. So it was really important that they make this demo blow people away, which it did, but that might have come to the cause of like some time they could have been spending on the game. A year later at E3 2019, fans would get another big surprise. Wow, no way, of being there, of walking the streets of the future is really going to be breathtaking. The cyberpunk trailers showed gorgeous cities beautiful.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,349,2022-10-07 01:09:40
12124," The Cyberpunk trailers showed gorgeous cities, beautiful lighting, really cutting-edge technology when it comes to the rendering of the game itself. People were very excited to be immersed in this gorgeous Cyberpunk world. They saw over 8 million pre-orders, which is a ridiculously large amount for any title to sell, let alone pre-sell. And you saw the stock price start to go up and up and up into the right, pretty much in a straight line. If you just look at the polished stock market, like the Wig Index, when CD Projekt stock was at its high, it was the largest stock in the index. And that was around the time that they announced that the game would be coming in April of 2020. Behind the Seaheens, people were pretty shocked that they were saying April. I don't think a single person who worked on that game actually thought they had a chance of coming out in April of 2020. So in April of 2019, I published an article for Kotaku about the making of a game called Anthem, which was a game from Byware that was disastrous in many ways and the article kind of ran through why that was. And afterwards, I started hearing from other developers who had stories to share that they said sounded a whole lot like Anthem. The deadline is unrealistic, the direction keeps changing, things are floundering, we're going through a lot of problems. This sounds exactly like what you wrote about Anthem. Around that same time, perhaps coincidentally, I heard from the CEO of CD Projekt Red who wanted to reach out to me specifically to talk about Crunch. CD Projekt Red had a reputation for Crunch, especially during the development of Witcher 3. Their management wanted them to have a reputation for treating workers well and not forcing them to go through Crunch. So Marchinevinsky, who is a co-founder and co-CEO of CD Projekt Red, came to me and said, hey, I want to make a vow right now that we're not going to force anybody to crunch, that people will not have to work mandatory overtime on this project. Over the course of reporting, Bloomberg has conducted interviews with more than 20 current and former CD Projekt staff, most of whom requested anonymity, so as not to risk their careers. CD Projekt declined a comment on the process or provide interviews with this story. The company would end up delaying the game three different times, first pushing from an April 2020 release to September, then November, and once again to December 2020. In order to meet the deadline, the studio would scale down the size of Cyberpunk's main city, as well as canceling some features, and while those measures helped, developers still said they were under significant crunch, including one former audio programmer who claimed to work up to 13 hours a day, five days a week, and stating he had seen friends who had lost their families over this. This was not a big secret in the office that the game was not going to be ready, but a similar sort of thing happened with Witcher 3, and a similar sort of thing happens with a lot of games, where they don't seem ready until suddenly everything just clicks. Some of the best games ever made, like we created through this process. I don't know that it's the most efficient or the wisest way to make video games, but it's what a lot of people do. I think that management there has genuinely tried to change it, or they said they wanted to change it, but it has proven very difficult to change that when you make games in this one specific way. Game studios, some of them see crunch is part of their core culture, that all of their games that they've made under crunch have been successful, so it must be a core element to the magic recipe for creating good games, and that's really not the case. We've run studies and seen that at eight weeks of working 60 hours plus, the output of a professional is the same as if they were working 40 hours a week. So chronic overwork degrades how effective someone is to the point where then it becomes negative and overworking them is just getting less and less productivity. And so these guys, the People at CD Project, having made the Witcher 3, we're kind of riding on that high, you could call it arrogance or confidence, or whenever you want to call it, of having made the Witcher 3. And I think that having a certain level confidence can certainly...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,350,2022-10-07 01:14:26
12125," 3. We're kind of riding on that high, you could call it arrogance or confidence or whenever you want to call it of having made the Witcher 3 and I think that like having a certain level confidence can certainly be a good thing but in this case it could also be dangerous because it kind of blinded them to the reality which was that this game wasn't going to call us. 3. Sony Pictures Entertainment is reeling from what may be the biggest and most devastating computer hacking in Hollywood's history. Hackers attacked in waves. First crippling Sony's internal systems, then leaking 5 Sony movies online. Today the US government pointed the finger of blame directly at North Korea for the devastating cyber attack against Sony Pictures. Sony pulling the plug on the interview saying it will not show the controversial comedy about an assassination attempt on North Korea's leader. The Sony Pictures hacking was taken very seriously because it was an attack on the free world. What we have been building in terms of our civilization and our freedom and our ability to exchange information freely have been disrupted by a country that we knew very little about. North Korea has reportedly made attempts to steal COVID-19 vaccine technology by hacking pharmaceutical giant Pfizer. The Justice Department has charged three North Korean hackers over a wide ranging scheme that included the attempt theft of billions of dollars for multiple companies. My name is Sam Kim. I'm a reporter for Blue Mug News and I wrote a story for Business Week about North Korean hackers. My story is about people who are sent from North Korea to countries like China to hack for the regime, spy on enemies and make money. North Korea's cyber abilities began about in the 1970s with a lot of students going to countries like Russia, China and even East Germany to learn coding was aimed at improving the productivity of factories at home. But in some time in the 1980s and 1990s the current leader Kim Jong-un's father Kim Jong-un thought that it would be a good idea to develop a team, an army of people who could hack for North Korea's military. So they began this team of basically hackers who would spy for the North Korean regime and also go out there and make hard currency for the regime. I think Kim Jong-un takes the hacking ability more seriously than his father. He also enjoys a bit of tech sadness as well. He's often shown traveling on his airplane where on the desk there's a Mac computer. He understands the importance of computers. He understands the importance of employing technology to improve productivity of his economy. North Korea is an isolated country with its",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,351,2022-10-07 01:18:23
12126," North Korea is an isolated country with its economy pretty much dilapidated nowadays. It's been under increasing pressure and sanctions from the US and the international community basically. It does not have the resources and money to build a kind of conventional weapons that other countries are able to build. So what happens is North Korea concentrates its resources on building nuclear arms and missiles which exports called basically a symmetric weapons. It's the kind of weapons that gives North Korea an instant edge. Think of cyber hacking abilities in that context. It doesn't cost them much money. But if you have the right people and if you have the right training, you are able to cultivate an army of people who are able to penetrate into computer systems of other countries. And that's what North Korea is after. But if you consider the fact that there are only about a thousand IP addresses in North Korea available and many of them are basically loaned from Chinese communications companies, you can kind of tell why North Korea is willing to send its hackers abroad rather than operate from within. What's the matter with operating from within? Well, first of all, it would mean that a lot of information would have to be coming in from the outside world which could risk exposing the government and the people to whatever truth there might be about them. So they're sending their trained hackers to China and other countries where access to information is better. But at the same time, because these are allies and also because they have their diplomats station in countries like these like China, they're able to regulate and control these hackers better. But formally, North Korea denies engaging in hacking and describes accusations to that effect as enemy propaganda. It took me at least half a year to track down these people. It felt like a wild goose chase in the beginning because a lot of the people like these are protected by the government in South Korea. But at the end, I was able to find a person who had pretty extensive ties to the North Grand Thefectic community here. And then I was also able to gain access to the people who had actually done programming hacking from North Korea before coming to South Korea. And Jung is one of them. Jung actually is not a real name. I knew before meeting Jung that he was in his late 30s. But when I actually met him, he looked at least a decade older. He wouldn't open up. I mean, it took me at least an hour to make sure that he would trust me enough that he would share with me his life story. When he was first sent to China, he was a student studying computer science at a university near the border with North Korea. And he came back and realized that there was a lot more to do in China because he had more access to information. And he asked that he'd be sent back to China. And there was also recruitment going on for people who would actually do coding officially, but really hacking from North Korea. So he applied and he got the job. Once he got to the border, he crossed by foot and from there he took a bus. And then when he arrived at the station that he would spend years in later, he learned that the three-story building in the heart of a city was actually provided for free actually by a Chinese man who had business ties in North Korea. And there were actually two other people that I had met.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,352,2022-10-07 01:22:55
12127," by a Chinese man who had business ties in North Korea. There were actually two other people that I had met. They all said that they go on to this freelance website for programmers and clients from around the world would come and give them orders, give them jobs to do. Some of the jobs given to Jung were cracking open, commercially successful anti-virus programs. Once he was able to open that up, he replicated that program into another product, which his client would repackage as a whole different product to be sold to other people. He also created what we now call bots. They are very popular online games, including lineage. He would create a bot that would just roam around without any supervision from the user and basically trade items without a user on that game. He would grow that bot on lineage and sell it for almost $100. Another defector said the money from clients was wired primarily via PayPal to accounts controlled by minors because they were the only ones with access to legitimate bank accounts. Jung had to make at least $100,000 in a year and he doesn't get to keep most of it. Actually, most of that money goes to the minors to the North Korean regime. But if you don't meet the quota, the minors will make sure that they'll put enough pressure on you. If that happens repeatedly, you will face the growing odds of being sent back home. Among the three people that I spoke to, there's a common thing that they all tell me, which is that on every Saturday, they have to do this propaganda session, which is basically about gathering all the hackers together into a room and they have to recite whatever messages, whatever lines come from Pyongyang, about the Kim family, about socialism. If you're especially someone with a free set of mind, that's stressful. One person actually was really stressed out what he heard about North Korea. Once he was in China, the propaganda sessions, he just couldn't take it. Jong was a senior member of the unit that he belonged to, and he was good at Chinese as well. Whenever a senior North Korean official came from North Korea to check on the hacking units in China, Jong would accompany that official. He doesn't provide me details, but he calls it unsavory instant that happened between him and an official that he was traveling with, and that altercation prompted him to defect. But there was no one that he could turn to after defecting. He would, in disguise, roam around China. He called me that he actually enjoyed it. He actually enjoyed the freedom of not being known to anybody, just roaming around a country that was huge. How did he make the money that he needed to carry on? He did the same thing he did at the North Korean unit. He would take orders, reverse engineer software to make money. But at one point, he was just sick and tired of all of a sudden. He wanted to find a place where he could just settle down, and he contacted South Korean authorities. Now, he lives in Korea. He met a woman here. Last time I checked, they had a baby. He worked for a software company, ironically. An antivirus company. What keeps coming up in my...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,353,2022-10-07 01:27:17
12128," So after a company, ironically, an antivirus company, what keeps coming up in my head, even long after I spoke to these people, is there was one common thing about them, which was the sense of disillusionment. Once they had access to outside information, once they were able to freely roam in the internet, there was a spark. And once they realized that there is a discrepancy between what they think is really happening and what North Korea is telling them every Saturday morning, that's when the spark gets bigger. The little fire is what eventually drives them to decide to leave, if it takes a huge risk on their lives.03 Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Step into the shopping center of the future. A world filled with exciting ideas. Since they started popping up in the 1950s, malls have been the quintessential American shopping experience. Useling temples dedicated to the wonders and excesses of retail, food service and entertainment, the rise of the mall coincided with the growth of the suburbs. The heyday of the malls really is the 1970s, sometimes referred to as the malling of America. They really thrived at providing some sort of public gathering space, some sort of social life in addition to actually giving people places to shop. Over the past few decades before then, lots of developers were building malls and it kind of coincided with the growth of highways. So as more people started traveling and interstate started being built, developers really wanted to put something to attract people to stop. Take a look at an average American mall today, however, and you'll see a very different picture. Closed stores and empty hallways became the norm in many malls even before COVID-19 delivered them another set of problems in 2020. So what happened? This is the story of the rise and fall of American malls.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,354,2022-10-07 01:32:24
12129," When malls work best, they survived and thrived thanks to their anchor stores. Those are the stores that are on the edges of the malls and that are outward facing to the parking lot. So if you're a shopper, you're going to walk through one of these big, usually a department store. So if you're thinking about macy's or sears or jc pinney, those are called the anchor stores. So once shoppers are done shopping there, maybe they wander to the middle part of the mall, shopping at the other apparel shops or even going to buy some food. But you really had to have a reason for people to shop in the first place. Because anchors bring in all those people, they tend to pay very little rent. Around 80% of income from mall owners come from the inline stores inside the mall. Over the past few decades, malls have been facing challenges from all sides. The first being, there's just too many of them. As early as in the 90s, the malls were beginning to compete with each other. We have a lot more retail square footage per capita than Canada. We have only seven times more retail square footage per capita than Europe. After the 2008 financial crisis, lowered retail spending across the board, malls and especially their department stores also had to contend with a new challenge that was growing fast. Malls started to suffer in the early 2000s with the rise of online shopping. Suddenly, they didn't have that captive audience who had to go to the mall to buy something. You didn't have to get up, get in your car, drive all the way to the mall and then see a bunch of other people. You can just do it from the comfort of your own. The stores overall have become less relevant over the years. Many have fallen totally off and that's Sears, JC Penny. Several bankruptcies in this space have really hurt the industry. But as department stores go, so does the mall oftentimes. So if department stores start closing locations, that means they're usually leaving malls. This is the Green Briar Mall in Southwest Atlanta, Georgia. It's in many ways emblematic of the problems facing malls today. It's been there since 1965. So for more than half of a century, it's been serving this area of Atlanta that's predominantly black and also as middle class neighborhood. It started with anchor stores, our department stores. So we had JC Penny and then Riches, which was later bought by Macy. So you had these two national chains. It had the first Chick-fil-A in a mall, like that type of format. So when you think about the history of malls, like Green Briar had like the perfect template, but now Macy's will be exiting the mall, meaning that the mall will be left without an anchor, which is vital to attracting other shoppers to come into the stores. Green Briar, then because it's kind of an example or a test for all these other middleing malls across America about what do you do when these large department stores as a business decision on there and are trying to just stay in the high quality malls. How does a middleing mall survive? What's their next strategy? Green Briar is a textbook example of how closely the deterioration of the middle class in the US is tied to the health of its malls. The median income for the surrounding area has reduced by 2008 and is still the best…""",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,355,2022-10-07 01:36:05
12130," textbook example of how closely the deterioration of the middle class in the US is tied to the health of its malls. The median income for the surrounding area has reduced by $6,905 over the past 15 years, to a total of $20,756 per year. And yet, residents and store owners hope that Greenbrier Mall will see better days. Malls are made up of the people and communities that help fuel them. Greenbrier is still a place that people go to and cherish, even if on paper it doesn't have the elements that make it a thriving mall. A lot of the existing constituents and residents there feel in many respects that they worked hard their whole lives to be able to experience the American dream, the single family suburban house in a leafy yard near a big mall that had a great NACS, then they're very reluctant to see that taken away from them. Now that NACS is gone, Greenbrier may try to take inspiration from what many malls were doing in the years following the financial crisis, focusing not on shopping but experiences. That was a trend we were seeing in 2016 up into the pandemic pretty much. And by experiences I mean everything as dramatic as a water park or hosting concerts to have people want to come other than just to buy stuff. Having Instagramable moments, making sure your store is pretty that people want to take a photo and post it on Instagram or Twitter. Historically the mall has always been a place for teenagers. You like to hang out, see your friends and also kind of be seen at the mall. And that hasn't completely changed like before the pandemic, about 95% of Gen Zs. So today's teenagers had gone to a mall in a three month period. So teenagers are still going to the mall and they've always been key to having thriving malls because they're coming into their spending power. And once you win over teens, hopefully you're really winning over a loyal customer for life. But thanks to lockdowns across the country, most malls at one point or another were shuttered in 2020. That means no one using the multi-billion dollar American Dream mall's indoor ski slope. No one going to the king of Prussia mall's indoor skydiving attraction. Basically the pandemic gave malls what they didn't need, another problem. What would your net income or net operating income have been in 2022 without COVID and what is it now in a post COVID world. So our views is roughly 10% hit to net income over that period. That's Vince Taboni from the analytics from Green Street Advisors, which rates American malls from A to D just like a report card. And if malls did have a report card, they wouldn't exactly make honor roll. During the US, out of the thousand malls in the country, there are roughly 250 malls, we grade A minus or better. The B and C quality malls, which is the vast majority of the malls by count, we think are on a negative trajectory. And it's going to depend on a lot of the local dynamics, ownership, decisions around how much money to invest in the property. We'll determine whether this mall can survive as retail or so, you know, rapidly melting ice cube. While there have been a few bankruptcies among real estate investment trusts that own mostly B to D malls in the past few years, A malls really are doing just fine. Some of the most productive shopping centers in the country are super high-end. So I'm talking about bowel harbor shops down in Miami, Florida. There is Americana man has it in Long Island's Gold Coast. The Grove in Los Angeles, these are places that have all high-end stores and have done quite well. A lot of that has to do with efficiency of their property, so their sales per square foot are really high. But also, they've invested a lot in their actual mall because it has to look beautiful. It has to have all the services that a wealthy shopper expects. So what will the future hold for less-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,356,2022-10-07 01:40:21
12131," Actual mall because it has to look beautiful. It has to have all the services that a wealthy shopper expects. So what will the future hold for less sought after malls that can't revive their golden years? For many of these malls, it will mean closure and then hopefully conversion. If they can't get a new use to come in, it's expensive, but you can just demolish it. And there are still quite a lot of sites just sitting waiting. Amazon has been picking up more and more of those building their big fulfillment centers. Also, a lot of communities see this as an opportunity to redevelop, re-enhabit this dead mall. To help that community meet the challenges it was never originally designed for. The number one reuse of an existing mall is as workspace. It's actually pretty easy to just throw some carpeting down, cut a few more windows and turn it into office space. The sort of number two reuse of malls is either medical, healthcare or education. Lots of great examples of community colleges all the way down to elementary schools. Moving into malls, then the third strategy that I wish happened more is actually just demolishing the mall and re-greening. Either reconstructing the wetlands that used to be there and that frankly we never should have built on in the first place or providing community parks and gardens. While most analysts say post-pandemic retail shopping could breathe some life back into the American mall, many are not long for this world. Depending on where you live it might be time to make one last visit, grab some food, do some shopping and say farewell. President Trump traveled to Utah today where he dramatically cut back the size of two national monuments in that state. When former President Donald Trump announced plans to scale back two national monuments in Utah, there was outcry from a lot of people. One company in particular. Patagonia really is a resistance brand. They embraced the liberal resistance against President Donald Trump and really put themselves at the forefront of that movement. In 2017 it sued the Trump administration for sort of slashing the size of these two national monuments in Utah that were kind of mechas for climbers. It said at the time joining the legal fracas was both extraordinary and obvious. So the company's general counsel said it took exactly one email to the board to decide to actually do that. I said the case is still out.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,357,2022-10-07 01:45:06
12132," One email to the board to decide to actually do that, I send the case is still out. Well, I think the only thing to administration that stands is lawsuits. We're losing this planet. And we have an evil government. And I'm not going to stand back and just let evil win. This year it got even more active, it changed its mission statement to quote, Patagonia isn't business to save our home planet. And then it manufactured these little tags on some of its clothes that if you flip them up, it says both the assholes out, very implicit, running up to the election. And it launched a digital tool to help people find the polling place. And on that digital platform, it says both the climate deniers out of office, again and again on the loop. This isn't the first time that taking a stand has paid off the Patagonia. The business which is now worth over a billion dollars was built on it. I couldn't care less about making more money. But by doing the right thing, it always ends up making me more money. So it's this all a strategy, a sort of premeditated strategy. Who knows? I mean, Sean Arck's been very vocal from the start and makes no bones about. He calls himself a dirtbag climber and an accidental entrepreneur. So I don't think he's fudging this, but what's important is that it's sort of a textbook marriage of philanthropy and profit. If you want to understand the entrepreneur studied at juvenile delinquent, because they're saying, this sucks. And I'm going to do it my own way. Of course, like every other teenage kid, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. When I was 16 years old, I took off and drove across the country, went into the Wind River Range and discovered mountains. Patagonia was born out of rock climber of Von Schoenart's first business, Schoenart equipment, which made in soul climbing supplies. Von Schoenart was a blacksmith in the 50s, and he started selling climbing gear out of the back of his car. That was less harmful to rock faces. This is sort of the origin story of the company. It's called itself the activist company, not a activist company. Six months out of the year, Von Schoenart is a blacksmith. He makes mountain climbing gear. The other half of the year he climbs. In 1968, Von Schoenart and four friends, including Doug Tomkins, the late founders of the North Face brand, embarked on the ultimate road trip from California where they were based to Patagonia in Argentina. This trip became a documentary about these friends who were hippies in the 70s, climbing in the Samhiti where the sport became a lifestyle, and how these friends became pioneer of the outdoor industry. Schoenart moved from selling petons to polyester, and in the 70s Patagonia was born. In 1973, Schoenart and his wife Melinda opened the very first Patagonia store in Ventura, California, where the company's headquarters remained today. Melinda Schoenart was the driving force behind many of the employee benefits, like on-site childcare, that helped the company achieve an impressive 4% employee turnover rate. The retail and consumer product sector average is more than triple that at 13%. I do think that Patagonia was a leader.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,358,2022-10-07 01:48:56
12133," average is more than triple that at 13%. I do think that Patagonia was a leader, one of the first corporations to take into account the human capital and make sure that their staff, all their employees were cared for in many ways, not just wages, but also they just cared about their people and knew that that's a good business model. Patagonia began donating 10% of its profits to grassroots organisations in 1985. This later became the 1% of sales that Schuwenard labels and Earth tax. I don't think it's for land three, it's rent for us living on this planet. While Patagonia was creating the blueprint of how to be a socially conscious brand, it was also turning a profit. It even made ink magazines list of the fastest growing privately held companies. So every time the company makes a decision to do something socially environmentally active, it is met with success and that isn't lost on Schuwenard or any of the other leaders of the company. The more money Patagonia made, the more it gave away under its philanthropic programme. Between 1989 and 1991, the payroll grew by 40%. But trouble was on the horizon. I think for 1991, we are looking at a recession. The question is how deep that recession is going to be and how long will be in it. Sales fell flat and the bank called in the companies revolving loans. The company that prided itself on taking care of its own laid off 120 people, roughly 20% of its workforce. That was when we decided that we were going to start doing things differently. And we were going to start running the company as if it's going to be here 100 years. With a renewed sense of purpose, Patagonia was ready for what it called business unusual. It started with the costly move to recycle an organic materials before launching a clothing repair service to discourage fast fashion. And Patagonia's influence was growing. What was intended as Schuwenard's philosophical handbook for employees became an international blueprint for sustainable business printed in ten languages. What's interesting to me is that all this, I hate the term on brand, but it's very on brand. It really works for the kind of company he's created. It works for the kind of employees he's been able to recruit and retain. It all is very seamless in terms of the identity of him and the company and what it means in the marketplace. So over time, the company's mission and its marketing have become the same thing. The inflection point came in 2011, actually Black Friday, Patagonia took out a huge ad in the New York Times that said, don't buy this jacket. And it's sort of got into the nitty-gritty on the carbon footprint and the water footprint that goes into a piece of a peril like a parke. And at the time Schuwenard said, the best jacket for our planet is one that already exists. So the company at that time said it needed to address the issue of consumerism, which coming from a for-profit business hits pretty hypercritical. As the company encouraged its customers to buy less, its annual sales increased by almost 40%. The stance of this is hypercritical is loud and constant. Talking about consumerism in a critical light while very much being a part of it. Best fashion is top on the list of environmental destruction and not just destroying the environment but impacting human health. They are in the fashion industry, they're clothing retailer and to come head to head with that is courageous. You're not only just trying to create a product that'll last, but you're also educating and entire generational people to understand that whole ideology that you don't need to change out our outfits. In 2014, Rose Macaria was appointed as CEO. In the next six years she grew Patagonia into a billion dollar company.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,359,2022-10-07 01:53:21
12134," In 2014, Rose Macaria was appointed as CEO. During the next six years, she grew Patagonia into a billion dollar company, while also scaling up its environmental goals and bringing a more political voice to its activism. Yvonne had this model where he was basically saying you can have a great business, you can make quality product, but you can also do the right thing by the environment, by your employees, by your community. And that, to me, was like the most holistic vision of business that I'd ever seen. So right now, Patagonia has a team of about 20 people solely focused on activism and grants. And this all comes at a time in the past decade when consumers are paying much more attention to the social footprint of companies and where they buy their goods. So what's happened is all this is good business for Patagonia in the past 10 years, revenue and profit at the company of roughly quite group old. It's private, but estimates are it does about a billion dollars in annual sales, which is sizable. And that's part of the reason why it's been such a fortuitous cycle as it's ramped up its activism and become more vocal on these things. It's resonated with the market. And it's the company branched out into other areas, including a venture capital fund for environmental causes and sustainable food. Revenue reached a new peak of over one billion dollars in 2017. But this was still small change compared to fast fashion heavywaste like Nike, who made $37 billion that same year. Patagonia's conscience hasn't always been reflected in its customer base either. Personalized vests have become the go-to corporate uniform. And the expensive price tag has helped the brand and the nickname Pataguchi. It's expensive stuff, it's expensive apparel, and that is part of their calculus in terms of the activism, you know, a lot of the more sustainable parts of the supply chain are there's a premium for organic cotton or sustainable down. The Pataguchi label is a symptom of that. Patagonia products are very popular, of course, with people who are active in the outdoors, but also with people who are not as active. For instance, you know, people in finance where the Patagonia vests go to the office. And that's because of the image that the brand projects. And so they have to deal with the fact, although they, you know, preach for the environment to stand for good, their victims of their own success. Patagonia set sales records in the first three years of the Trump administration. Now, in 2020, things have changed. As COVID-19 brought the business world to a halt, and the American people voted in a new administration, Patagonia appointed Brian Gellert as CEO. As far as its CEO transition goes, this one's happening quite strangely. There's no real budget for next year yet, because of everything that's going on and all the uncertainty around that. Patagonia's new focus is going to be on forging a relationship with the Biden administration. It should be a more close relationship, but Gellert still has his guard up. During the Obama administration, they didn't always agree, and he expects the same with Biden in the White House. They plan to bring litigation wherever needed against any government needed, and then, uh, about the issues that they care about, and that's climate change in the environment.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,360,2022-10-07 01:57:53
12135," music Okay, so you built this, so this is all. This is new since the pandemic. We assume Googlers would want more indoor outdoor options. I mean, it's so exciting. It's such a fun... It is. It is, but I would say the thing we're really excited about are these new buildings because we were building sustainability and everything we do. So really forward looking. Good? Okay. From one of the newest workspaces at the Googleplex in Mountain View, California, this is Bloomberg Studio 1.0 with Alphabet CFO, Ruth Porat. We're not far from her childhood home. Her father was a physicist at Stanford, her mother, a psychologist. After graduating from Stanford herself and then earning a couple more advanced degrees, Porat landed her first job on Wall Street in 1987, where she would spend almost three decades until Google's co-founders lured her to Silicon Valley. It's wonderful to be here with you. It's great to have you here at the Googleplex. Thank you for having us. So we are at Google headquarters in Mountain View, and at this very same time you are making massive investments in New York office real estate. You're expanding headcount in Atlanta and Chicago and Washington, DC. What's the strategy behind all of this? Well, at the core, we believe in hybrid work. So we do want to bring people back on campuses, but not full-time. We're thinking it'd probably be a three, two work week, but we think coming together is just such a core part of innovation, serendipity, culture, every element of it. And we're growing at a really rapid clip. So we are excited to be expanding our real estate footprint. And then we also wanted to make sure that we're meeting people where they want to be. And so enlarging the number of sites that we have available for people in particular, sites where you have great, diverse populations. Sundar just told me that Googlers will have this option of working in hybrid mode forever, like literally forever. Obviously, you're embracing this massive cultural shift. But what are the risks? What are you worried about? So the positive we've seen is there's a productivity uplift we believe in giving people the opportunity to be at home some of the time, not do the commute, be able to deal with everything else in their life, and coming into the office. So the risk is, I think about my career, and so much of the benefit in my career was the informal coaching being pot-pron into meetings, all of the touch points that you have. And so I think that one of the most important things for all of us as leaders is we need to evolve the way we lead. We need to make sure that we're thinking about this hybrid work life and why that's the way to be the best magnet for talent, and make sure that we're continuing to reinforce all of those great practices while opening up new great practices. Speaking of your career, before you were CFO of Alphabet, you were CFO of Morgan Stanley, and you started your career on Wall Street in 1987. What was about the journey of going from big banks to big tech?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,361,2022-10-07 02:05:17
12136," Before you were CFO of Alpha Bat, you were CFO of Morgan Stanley and you started your career on Wall Street in 1987. Talk to us about the journey of going from big banks to big tech. Why did you make that leap and what impact did you want to have? Well, I loved being at Morgan Stanley and I became CFO the day James Gorman became CEO, yes, needed to join him in that journey and that was January 2010. And we were still recovering coming out of the financial crisis. There were still some pretty rocky days and a lot of decisions that needed to be made. And then I got to a point where I felt like we were in a great spot at Morgan Stanley. And obviously it's continued to do really well. And I just wanted that next chapter. My view in my career, I've always been focused on continually learning and I feel like when you hit a plateau, the right questions, what's my highest and best use and it's been an extraordinary time. You also survived Wall Street in the 80s and 90s, which is notorious Boys Club. And Silicon Valley has sort of come to be known as a Boys Club of its own. How would you compare those two cultures? When I was starting my career many decades ago, it was tough and much worse than it is now. And it evolved, no question about it, not where it needs to be, but certainly evolved. And I saw it through my career. I would say the biggest difference out here is the level of impatience. And I love it. It's the view is if you can do some of the extraordinary breakthroughs that we have out here, if you can do natural language translation, everything we do with AI, with VR, with self-driving cars, why can't you fix this now? And that level of impatience I think is fantastic. Legend has it that when you got to Google, you were going to reign in the spending, tighten up on the moonshots. Your nickname I believe was Ruth Vader. Was that a tough job to take on? So I think the narrative was written before I got here. And what I find most interesting about that is I firmly believe the single most important thing in capital allocation is investing for long term growth. I think if you don't, you are sowing the seeds of your long term decline. And I learned that really early on in my career. Now if you're investing in an industry like this and trying to do truly transformative things, by definition, everything can't succeed. And so by definition, you should have the metrics and data and milestones to assess, is it working or is it not? Because if everything's working or if you think everything's working, I would say one of two things are wrong. Either you're not reaching high enough or you're not being honest enough with yourself about the pace of breakthrough, whether you're going to get there. So to me, a really natural part, kind of a sister organization to investing for long term growth is actually thinking about how are you doing with the risk that you're taking, stack rack them, and figure out what's at the bottom so you can redeploy those resources to the top. They go together, actually. And so I find the narrative, it's a false choice to think that it's either about growth or it's about pruning, stack ranking. They go together and you have to think of them as actually empowering one another. You advised the Treasury Department during the Great Recession, what lessons did you take away from that? What struck me is a lot of the lessons from the financial crisis are relevant in good times and bad times. So the most important is it's easier to prevent than to fix. And so that was really clear during the financial crisis. The financial crisis was about liquidity and it dried up quickly and it would have been really easy six to 12 months prior to build a durable liquidity. You couldn't do it in the moment. And so this notion about really building a solid foundation on which you operate, you need to do that ahead of time. It needs to be all of the work we do on trust and safety and content, moderation, security. That is the foundation on which you can build everything else. The handpiles at one point said to me, you have to have the will and the means. And too often by the time you have the will, you no longer have the means. His comment was, be decisive, act early even in the absence of information. I think that's true in this whole notion of investing for long-term growth. Because if you're not actually assessing progress along the way and you just assume, you know what we can keep in.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,362,2022-10-07 02:09:30
12137," notion of investing for long-term growth. Because if you're not actually assessing progress along the way and you just assume you know what we can keep investing in everything. At some point down the road, you'll say, I wish I had made those tough calls to double down on the things that really mattered. What times are we in now? What's your read on the economy today, especially with rising inflation? Well, look, I think back to March of 2020 and where we were. And I think of all of the intervention and steps that have been taken since then. And you've certainly seen the recovery coming out the back end. And it's been really gratifying from those painful days to see the breakthroughs that we've had not just on the medical front, but we've also seen the improvement across businesses. I think one of the biggest concerns in particular, as you're seeing us, go through a digital transformation and the acceleration of it, is ensuring that everyone has the skills, the digital training and skills to thrive in this new economy. Google now reaches more than half the people on the planet. Why shouldn't we view Google as a monopoly? We often say that people come to Google not because they have to, but because they want to. It's really opening the world for so many people, so that's the intent. I want to talk a little bit about regulation. You were drawn to M&A in your early days at Morgan Stanley. Microsoft is making some big acquisitions, deals that some think Google maybe would have wanted to win in a former life, is antitrust scrutiny constraining any of your business plans and your ability to compete. The main thing that we've done throughout our life of Google is really invest in innovation, its organic growth, and we're continuing to do that at a really rapid clip. We have then layered onto it, tuck in acquisitions and larger acquisitions, and we're continuing to be active, more on the smaller ones and the add-ons to be fair. We think there's a lot of opportunity ahead of us, and so we're continuing to invest in partnerships, in some acquisitions, and do you think that there's still upside in a lot of different areas? So would you say this regulatory scrutiny isn't slowing you down? It's really important for those of us in certain leadership positions to be very focused on constructively engaging and working with regulators on what are the issues, what is it they're trying to solve, and how can we constructively engage with them. At the same time, our engineers should focus on innovation and continuing to up the bar on everything we're doing, address what is most helpful for our users. Google is facing more serious legal threats at this time in the United States than the other big tech companies. How are those conversations with regulators going? Are they frustrating at this point? There are certain elements that are frustrating because I listen to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,363,2022-10-07 02:13:48
12138," How are those conversations with regulators going? Are they frustrating at this point? Well, there's certain elements that are frustrating because I listen to the outline of some of the proposed legislation. And I think it's inconsistent with some of the priorities for public policy. So as an example, there's a lot of focus on what is called self-preferencing. Are you putting too many of your own products together? But during the pandemic, one in three small businesses said they would have failed without digital skills. Why? Because what they were able to do is connect with their users in different ways. So if you go search for a small business, you can then go to a map and you can get directed to the small business. That's a good thing. We have 6,000 small businesses who wrote in and said, you know what, we need these digital tools and skills. Same with a number of things on racial equity. Real surge in searches about, where can I wear a black owned business near me and the ability to direct people through search and maps. So I think that what's really important, and that's why I said it's about constructive engagement, let's make sure we understand what they're trying to solve and work with them on what is it that we're trying to address through products so that the products are helpful in the ways that they want. Facebook has taken a serious reputational hit. Has that had ripple effects or created collateral damage for Google? Well, I think that whenever there's a backdrop that's challenging, it has ripple effects. But what we're really underscoring is all of the steps and investments that we are making to really protect the ecosystem the way we are commitment to our users. So we know how sacrosanct that trust is. And it's all about privacy and what are the steps that we're taking to make privacy protected for our users. What is it that we're looking at to protect content and content moderations? Google now reaches more than half the people on the planet. Why shouldn't we view Google as a monopoly? So I go back to the earliest days when Google, I first learned about Google back in 1998. And in those earliest days, I heard about this eight search engine. The question is, why do you actually need it? And back at Morgan Stanley, it's working with our research analyst Mary Meekers. She actually had her team put up white pages all around the conference room and was doing this comparison. Well, provided the most responsive results most rapidly. And all of a sudden, you could see, well, when did this Google thing actually, maybe we do need something new. And that's been the ethos at Google since inception. It's just continued to innovate to make this eight never better experience for users. And so if we can deliver on that, which is what drives people here, it's really opening the world for so many people. So that's the intent. Facebook and Twitter are exploring digital currency. What is your thought on the crypto market? And is there a play for Google? So we look at it. There's nothing to comment on now. I think we're much more interested in blockchain and the underlying technology and the implications for the business and also for the way we can support our cloud customers. So certainly a lot of effort there. There's considerable chatter in the crypto universe that Web3 and the blockchain could circumvent the power of Facebook and Google and more. What do you think about the next frontier of the internet? At this point, I think there are a lot of different things ahead of us that are actually studyingly exciting that enable us to actually continue to address different needs and requirements. Like I look at, for example, in something like health, where I think blockchain will be very valuable when you think about health and health records. There are also a whole host of other areas where the data analytics that we provide are absolutely critical. Should we make excuses to our employers? Should we tell our, like, if I have to head to a parent to teach your conference or take a kid to the doctor, do I tell my boss that I'm talking about? You don't tell your boss. You've got to get over the guilt.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,364,2022-10-07 02:18:11
12139,aż breast cancer twice. What was your biggest fear at that time and how did you overcome it? Well the biggest fear was I wouldn't make it and I remember when someone at some interview while I was going through chemo said where do you want to be in five years and I froze because it was I want to be alive and I learned a couple of really important things. One given breakthroughs in medical technology I learned to love the word manageable. These this journey does become manageable not for all cancers but for many more cancers and that gave me a lot of confidence talking with other survivors about it is manageable get the best care and just plow through it I was just I'm very grateful. I'm grateful for all of the investments people have made over the years but for anybody out there and I think everybody sadly will be touched by cancer either themselves or someone they know and love many of these cancers are manageable and just go at it with gusto so that's what I did. You're a mom of three sons and I find that especially remarkable because I also have three sons. How have you managed that over the course of this you know incredible career? How do you find that right mix of focus and free time to spend time with your family and doing the things that you love? So my kids my kids give me energy they're remarkable and I think one of the important things for me is this notion that you do have to have a mix. It's not about trying to find balance the physics of which is really challenging I think when people try for balance they always feel they're failing on something because something's out of whack. So this metaphor that life is like a kaleidoscope and you need to have different shaped pieces of glass and different color and sometimes one is larger than the other and what's beautiful about life is when it's constantly moving around and so to me that metaphor has actually been sort of an anchoring principle. The other is you have to put the kids first so like they they know that I'm there you know when they need always and and I think that just making sure that you're setting the boundaries the way you need to I would say it's much easier today than when I was growing up in banking you know we had a cubicle there was a there was a computer room you were anchored to the computer room one of the many beautiful things about going through this evolution in work is understanding that hybrid works. So how do we get rid of mom guilt especially in this new work world I want to shake my mom guilt how do I do okay so even when you feel it just say you know what it's an investment in my career because I can stay in this longer and be operating at a higher level if I'm really getting the stimulus from all parts of my life so you've got,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,365,2022-10-07 02:22:27
12140," in my career because I can stay in this longer and be operating at a higher level if I'm really getting the stimulus from all parts of my life. So you've got to drop the mom guilt and when on the other side mom guilt with kids, I think they get it. I think they understand what we're doing and you know, they'll never forget during the financial crisis at one point I was working on AIG. We went around the clock. I came home to shower that one like right as we were landing AIG and my three kids at each written me a yellow sticky note with a message on it and one of them was based, you know, the essence of which was I get why you're doing this and they saw it as the right thing for the country. I don't need to over dramatize what it was but that's what it felt like at the time. And that level of pride, I still have those three stickies right by my bedside because I get it. I get the mom guilt. I wish there were certain elements like you could have done differently but I also see the relationship we have and they understand what it needs to actually be engaged in society and doing something you care about. No mom guilt. No mom guilt. Thank you. It's not allowed. Should we make excuses to our employers? Should we tell our like if I have to head to a parent teacher conference or take a kid to the doctor, do I tell my boss that? You don't tell your boss. You don't tell your boss. Guys don't tell their boss. So what do we say? I don't think you say anything. I actually made this point at an event at Morgan Stanley. I'm like do not tell your boss. You've got to get over the guilt. The only way to move on from it is realize I'm a professional. I do things when I when I can and it makes sense and I get it all done. I just do it on my own timeline. And I actually had a woman who emailed to me afterwards and said I know you said I'm not supposed to tell my boss. So I won't but I can't not tell somebody. So I'm going to email you. And I'm like okay that's step one of five step journey. Do not tell your boss. You're tell your boss you know what I need to do certain things for myself and I'm getting I feel guilty doing it but I get everything done. There's no question you are so beyond having to check in with people. Well thank you. So do not. We're in the middle of this so called great resignation and people are reflecting and changing and making big decisions what's your advice to people in this big evolution you know huge choices ahead. Well I think you framed it really well. I don't think it's the great resignation. I think it's the great reshuffle and people are reflecting on what do they want and how do they want to work and how do they want to live their lives. So I think for all of us thinking about what does that mean for our institutions it is about evolving the way we work, the way we interact, the expectations that we have to say but I grew up in a cubicle on the 26th floor of a skyrise doesn't work anymore. And so what should we do as leaders and I think that our this generation appropriately and it's very exciting expects more from all of us. And so it's not just in how we work but it is in what we do. And I think all elements of what's the mission are you delivering on the mission is really important. Okay so if you rapid fire questions someone you'd love to have dinner with. Well I'd love to say my parents because they passed away in over years ago. Favorite family ritual? We do this crazy thing that we've done for years which is everybody gets to pick where we travel. We come up with the five different locations and then we all vote and then we get the grid and that's where we go. What's your favorite getaway? Probably I would say maybe Iceland was the vast that's an amazing one. New York or California? Oh so unfair. Well sitting here outdoors right now and knowing I can do that for the rest of the years for you nice for the energy from New York so I'm not going to like my pick amongst children. So in closing Google is a massive company multiple divisions many bets. Where are you spending most of your time now? I'm spending most of my time on your very important question about capital allocation because if it really goes to this core point you've got to invest for long term growth and making sure that you're investing with the right intensity I often say I don't want to get to the two-yard line but not score so you need to make sure you're investing with the right intensity to support long term growth that's the most important area where I would say I spend the ball.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,366,2022-10-07 02:26:57
12141," You are blind but not score. So you need to make sure you're investing with the right intensity to support long-term growth. That's the most important area where I would say I spend the bulk of my time. And then of course, you have to prioritize in order to recycle to support those efforts. What kind of discussions are you having with Larry and Sergey now about this next phase of Google? So when they made the announcement about the role of change, they were very serious about moving to this board role and they're amazing board members. Sundar of course relies on them for counsel wherever whenever but most of the interaction is really around what are we doing at the board level. It's been great. And you have your freedom to allocate capital as you like. I work closely with Sundar and Phillip and Thomas. Yes, we work as a great team. So what's the vision for Google then? 10 years from now. It's fascinating to, I think I had the same reaction you did when I heard Sundar say search is the biggest moonshot. And I think that continuing to find ways to be helpful to users to solve what they need where so many people are coming online and it is video going to be the way they understand it's going to be about search is going to be a different type of experience. So much of it's going to be about voice first and language translation. So it's going to continue to evolve. And what about for you personally? Where will you, it's been so amazing to hear about your journey and I'm just curious about your personal growth. What you feel you've accomplished in the last, since you've been here and what you hope to accomplish. I find that the opportunity to try new things and to invest in new things and as we think about, well, what does that mean for each one of our areas? I think that intellectual curiosity keeps you young. And I think that continuing to learn is like your brain is like silly putty getting pulled in a lot of directions. So to me, it's continuous learning. Ritpoorat, thank you so much for joining us. It's been wonderful to be here. Thank you. Great to have you on campus. Come back anytime. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Good to see you. Thank you so much for doing this. Thanks for doing that. Of course. Thank you. Thank you so much for doing this. Thanks for doing that. Of course. Not at all. It gave us more chance to tweak the lights for the 50,000th time. You're doing well? Yes. How often are you coming into the office these days? About two to three days a week. How about you? I guess you come in? Yeah, I'm in every day now, so no more kids on the set. I have to ask, is your son still mining Ethereum? He and I literally were talking about it last night. He's like, Dad, you are the one who made me give up on it. I'm like, no, I didn't. But yeah, the thing that's good about this is, I think, it excites a whole new generation about technology, which is good. I really appreciate taking this time. Well, thank you for doing it, and thank you for coming down to do it. I'm ready to go in you guys are.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,367,2022-10-07 02:31:54

I'm ready to go when you guys are. From Google headquarters in Mountain View, California, this is Bloomberg Studio 1.0 with Alphabet CEO Sundar Pachai. Born and raised in India, Pachai had almost no access to a computer until college, but just years later found himself rising through the ranks of the world's largest search engine. In 2015, it was Pachai that Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin chose to run Google and later Alphabet. Now valued at more than $2 trillion, it's one of the most powerful companies on the planet. Sundar, it's great to be with you today. Thanks for doing this. Great to be here in person. Google just hit a $2 trillion market cap. Alphabet, I should say. Where is the next trillion dollars going to come from? You know, I've always felt, you know, your market cap valuation is an effect of the value you provide and I feel fortunate our mission is timeless. You know, there is more need to organize information than ever before. I still feel searches are biggest moonshaws as a company. You know, people will want radically more conversational experiences. They will want what we call multimodal experiences. They may speak to search. They may look at something and ask what the information is. Being able to adapt to all that and evolve search will continue to be the biggest opportunity. We are so excited about the YouTube cloud or hardware products, Google Play. So we're building a diverse set of businesses. But underlying all of it is the investments we are making in AI. You know, we've invested $100 billion in R&D in the past five years. And so applying AI in a deep way is probably where we will create the biggest opportunity ahead. Microsoft is making some big acquisitions. Apple's anti-adtracking technology is shaking up the industry. What do you make of these competitive moves? Your competitors say they're on the right side of history. Are they? I look at the fact that there are three billion people who have access to knowledge of their fingertips. I look at the opportunity we provide. I look at the skills people are learning through YouTube. You know, I feel it everywhere when I go talk to people and and providing access to information and knowledge. I think we'll end up being on the right side of history as well. Your predecessor, Eric Schmidt, told me that he feels the latest Facebook revelations are disturbing. Google also has access to massive amounts of our data. Why should half the world's population, more than half the world's population, trust Google to do the right thing? We are trying to do more with less data. One of the biggest changes we made was making auto-delete the default setting for new users signing in. And now over two billion users have their data continuously being deleted. Look, we rely on trust for people, you know, every day when people come to Google, you know, they place their trust to us in vulnerable moments. Maybe a healthy shoe on which they are trying to understand. There's no more important responsibility we have than doing right by that trust. You know, when we provide Gmail to journalists and realize that their accounts may be under attack by an authoritarian government. I mean, that's what motivates us to make sure be privacy, be security, be trust. We are doing the right thing. Over time regulation will have an important role to play here. I think privacy regulation is important in areas like AI regulation will be important. And so I think, you know, those who will be part of the answers as well. The Facebook follow out, that Instagram can be toxic to teens, for example. Has this raised more or new concerns for you about the impact of technology, tech addiction, algorithms, YouTube even on our children and their development and their mental health? I mean, you're a parent and you also have a lot of power over how this plays out. You know, I mean, like you, you know, bringing kids up in this modern.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,368,2022-10-07 02:35:38
12143," And you also have a lot of power over how this plays out. You know, I mean, like you, you know, bringing kids up in this modern digital world is something I think all parents are anxious about rightfully so. I think, you know, it's part of why a few years ago when in YouTube, you know, we were exposed to a set of concerns. You know, we invested, it became our number one priority to work harder. The reason YouTube invested so much in developing YouTube kids as a safe destination for young children, so on. The technology is going to play a big role in helping give children the next wave of opportunity as well. So the answer is to develop it responsibly. We have changed our balance in these areas and saying we think about content responsibility first. And then the pace of development or new features in areas like YouTube. And so that's how we approach it for a while. Facebook and Microsoft are all in on the metaverse. What do you think about the metaverse? What's Google's metaverse strategy? It's always been obvious to me that computing over time will adapt to people and people adapting to computers. You know, you won't always interact with computing in a black rectangle in front of you. So just like you speak to people, you see and interact. Computers will become more immersive. They'll be there when you need it to be so always been excited about the future of immersive computing and being computing AR. And we are in that count as the metaverse. Is that what that is? You know, metaverse is I think it means different things to different people. The way I think about it is evolving computing in an immersive way with augmented reality. As part of that, there'll be many experiences, some of which will be immersive interactive virtual worlds, you know, which is, which is the metaverse concept. And you know, but I think this doesn't belong to any company, right? I mean, this is the evolution of Internet and you know, the web, the internet, all of it will continue to evolve. Google was famous for its campuses where you could go and never leave. You had everything you ever wanted. Now you've said they can be flexible. They can work from home. They can work at the office. They can be hybrid. They can work remotely permanently, perhaps. Are you committed to really letting them do this forever? And if so, how does that change the future of work and society? Look, we have, we have, we've really embraced the fact that the future is going to be flexible. At Google, we've always tried to give, you know, agency to our employees. But we do realize the importance of bringing people together, the creativity community and collaboration that comes with it. So the balance we are striking is, is this notion of three, two. And what we're giving the strength of our companies, we have more locations than most of the companies. So we're giving people choice to move anywhere in the world. Four weeks they can work from anywhere. We're going to accommodate 20% of our workforce to be remote over time. So we're going to embrace that flexibility and forever. Forever. Yeah. And, you know, we're committed to it. Through it to all it forces us to design better products. And since people use Google workspace to run their companies, I think gives us a chance to innovate and bring all that out. You know, I think there is so much value in giving people more flexibility between their personal and professional lives. And I think it will lead to people being happier. And I think companies can be successful in that model. And so we're trying to get the best of both worlds, but embrace the flexibility and see where we go. How confident are you that when you look back, you'll be able to say Google did enough to help save the world. We are putting so much energy and resources into it. Hey.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,369,2022-10-07 02:39:45
12144," You grew up in India, you lived through droughts, water was scarce. How has that experience shaped your feelings about the urgency of stopping climate change? I grew up in Chennai, India, and a big part of my childhood was a really pretty severe water scarcity. We would get water trucked in for the streets and stand in lines and carry a few buckets of water at home. There was no running water for many years. But fast forward a few years ago, Chennai had one in a hundred-year flood, which was a very extreme event. Kind of drove home. That combined with a few years ago, waking up to the orange skies here in the Bay Area, seeing the look of concern on my children's faces and having to explain it, all kind of drove home in a deeply personal way for me. So I think it's the most defining issue we all face and definitely something very motivated on working towards. I remember waking up to those orange skies too and having to have that same conversation with my kids. Do you think the commitments at COP26 went far enough? You know, encouraged by many things, you know, we have to tip our hat to the people who are working super hard. The issues and the trade-offs are genuinely difficult. You know, you have to keep the economies growing, you know, it really matters. But at the same time, it's a pretty severe urgent issue. So I'm encouraged by the progress. I think it builds on the Paris Agreement. So I can see the forward progress. There is the deep anxiety that it all may not be enough. But, you know, we have to be optimistic and keep pushing. Google has set some aggressive targets to run entirely on clean energy, to be the first tech giant to do so 24 hours a day. How confident are you that when you look back on this time, let's say a decade from now, you'll be able to say Google did enough to help save the world? We are putting so much energy and resources into it. It's always been kind of a founding value for us. We've been carbon neutral since 2007. We've been matching our energy consumption with renewable energy over the past few years. So this, you know, we are now pushing. It's a moonshot to be 24, 7 carbon free. That means every search you do, every email you send, that we can do it carbon free. We were at 61 percent in 2019. The number is now 67 percent. We have set our goals to be 100 percent by 2030. And to do it globally, that means we have to solve new things which we haven't done before. Wind and solar alone won't be enough. We just started geothermal in Nevada. We will be investing in newer technologies, including carbon capture, etc. over time. So that's what excites me. We are a technology company at heart. So part of there are many answers to this problem. Some of it is that we are going to have to innovate our way out of it. And, you know, we want to push as hard as possible in doing that. Our Bloomberg New Economy Forum is happening this year in Singapore and the Asia Pacific.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,370,2022-10-07 02:44:09
12145," and we want to push as hard as possible in doing that. Our Bloomberg New Economy Forum is happening this year in Singapore and the Asia Pacific region is one of the fastest growing internet economies on the planet. Where do you see the most room, the most opportunity for Google to grow there? It's such a 13 time frame. Glad you're focused on the region. It's the most vibrant region we see. It's our 20th year since we opened our office in Tokyo. It was the first office outside the Bay Area. You have two and a half billion people on the internet. There are many areas in which they are leapfrogging trends which are here and embracing the future. Digital payments is a great example. So many of our products originated from APAC, Google Maps, Google Pay. A lot of our journey to bring computing to more people is playing out in Asia as well. I am excited about also the work we are doing through cloud because the companies there are rapidly transforming themselves digitally. So a chance to provide that is something very exciting for us. So super dynamic region. Glad I feel like we are learning as Google being in the region. And so I think it will transform. The first 10 years I would have said we took products here and brought it to APAC over the past few years. We are beginning to build things there. And some of our future global products will be APAC first and rest of the world later. You can't talk about APAC without talking about China. And you're facing stiff competition from Chinese tech giants there and beyond. What should US policymakers know about competing with China? You know, there's a lot of conversations about US and China, the competition is fierce. Many look at areas like AI and quantum computing where we are investing a lot. Chinese companies are neck to neck. What I think about, I was encouraged by the news coming out of Glasgow about the US-China Agreement on Climate. To me, while we talk about all the areas where we are competing, some of the biggest areas which are common challenges for all of humanity. The pandemic was one. AI and AI safety over time will be a shared one. Obviously, sustainability is another area like that. So I think these are all areas in which the countries can come together. And so I think that's a way by which we think about as when we compete on the internet and there may be different versions of how the internet plays out. So I see opportunities both sides. What are the chances that Google search will ever come back to China? Or that Google Cloud would ever come to China? Today we don't provide most of our signed services in China. And I don't see that changing. But there are ways, as I said, in areas like AI or sustainability, I think there'll be opportunities for us to work together. Through Cloud, we will support multinational companies which have presents everywhere. And so maybe there are opportunities to work that way as well. AI is advancing at an astonishing rate. And it is hard to understand sometimes what this really means. In concrete terms, how will our lives look different? Let's say 10 years from now. As a result of AI. You know, done correctly. In many ways, it's going to be helpful to you. You'll take it for granted. The same way today, for example, in India, over one third of the queries on many phones come through voice. But it's something people take for granted. You can do it. So over time, you'll expect to speak and be able to understand any language in the world. And those are always, it's going to make it better. You may go to a doctor's office and go through a scan. And the system may be prioritizing for the radiologist so that they don't miss some important things, maybe giving them a second opinion. So these are all ways in which it will seem to at least start playing a role. And I think we'll see that if it's a fact. You mentioned if done correctly. And there are concerns. There are fears that AI will replicate the worst of society, even under Google's own roof, from your own researchers. What scares you most about AI? What keeps you up at night? It's the most profound thing we are working on as humanity. And any time we...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,371,2022-10-07 02:48:37
12146," What scares you most about AI? What keeps you up at night? It's the most profound thing we are working on as humanity and anytime you're developing technology there is a dual site to it. The journey of humanity is harnessing the benefits while minimizing the downsides. The good thing with AI is it's both going to take time. I think I've seen more focus on the downsides early on than most of the technology we've developed. So in some ways I'm encouraged by how much concern there is and you're right even within Google, you know, people think about it deeply, we publish a lot of research. There are, I think it's more important that there are outside academic institution, governments, nonprofits looking at this issue as well. So I think it'll be an issue which will have a lot of attention which gives me a lot of comfort as well. You said you'd pick up some new hobbies in the pandemic. What did you start? Cooking pizza, just learning cook which I would add. I'm caught on a little bit better. No doubt,�n. I don't need to worry! You have presided over Google through massive social movements that reverberated in and outside the company. What have you learned as CEO since the walk out? For me, it was a moment. I think it changed the company for the better. We've always been committed. It gave us an insight on what more we could do. We undertook deep commitments. And the biggest overall and diversity and inclusion, I think if you're committed and you actually put in the effort behind it, you can make a difference. Now we have stated clear goals. We are on track to meet those goals. But it forced us to think about new answers. So for example, tech companies used to talk about the pipeline problem. But we are now going to places where the talent is. We are working much harder. So going to Atlanta, going to DC, going to Chicago, going to New York. That's improving our diversity and representation at all levels. The war for talent is even more competitive now in this new world. What are you offering? Elon Musk has said, big tech is a place where talent goes to die. How do you respond to that? OK. I look at the fact that we are looking to hire 30,000 people next year. I look at the impact we have on many people coming and working in the latest cutting edge things. And many people come in. People leave Google. We are proud of people who have left Google that are, I think, that are over 2000 companies that have been started by whom we call as supers. I'm equally proud of that. I think we are one part of a...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,372,2022-10-07 02:53:06
12147," 2000 companies that have been started by whom we call as Zouplers, I'm equally proud of that, right? I think we are one part of a big system and, you know, I think, I think I'm proud of the role we play in bringing in people and the impact they have over time and outside world. All right, that's most of the heavy stuff out of the way. We're going to do some rapid fire just to get to know you a little bit better. You said you'd pick up some new hobbies in the pandemic. What did you start? Hi, you know, pizza, cooking pizza, just learning to cook, which I was never good at. I've gotten a little bit better. Cricket or soccer slash football? Wow, stuff. Both. Please don't make any clues. Okay, squid game or Ted Lasso? I watched both. The Ted Lasso is much more calming. And so I'd rather take Ted Lasso over to the games any day. I know you're a voracious reader. So what's the last good book that you read? You know, I've been on a podcast bench. So a lot more podcasts than books nowadays. Okay, favorite videos you watch on YouTube with your kids. A lot of music videos, music videos. This whole notion where creators are watching other things and commenting on it. It's a trend which my kids are really into and I've kind of gotten used to it now. So, you know, watching other games, it's a bit, it's a phenomenon. Screen time policy that's worked for you as a parent. And what's not worked? You know, I've kind of given agency to my kids. The only thing I tell them is that I can look at their digital well-being once in a while with them. And so... How do you do that? I asked them to show it to me and they show it on their phones. So, you know, so that's pretty much the only thing. So, beyond that, you know, it's agency and talking to them about it and making sure we are spending time doing other things. And making sure they develop good habits, basically. Metaverse or real world? Done correctly. You know, you shouldn't feel and feel the need to make a choice. You know, you always want to be present in the real world. And when you feel the need to do something, you want to do that. But, you know, I do think presence and the realness of the real world will end up mapping for humans for a long time. Do you own any crypto? I wish I did. I've dabbled in it, but, you know, in and out. In and out. Okay. Larry and Sergey, I'm not going to make you choose. How many times a week do you talk to them? I talk to them regularly. You know, it kind of ebbs and flows. You know, and so there are times we get excited about something and we spend a lot of time talking it through, but it depends on, you know, what I mean. A piece of advice you wish you had in your 20s and a piece of advice you wish you had in your 40s. 20s would be, you know, being patient. You know, I think when you're young, you're very impatient, which is a great thing. But sometimes you do amazing things by slowing down and being really focused and doing it over a period of time. And so I would advise the younger version of me to be more patient. Maybe at 40, I would say, you know, when I look at climate, you know, I want all of us to be impatient. So, you know, I feel like when there's an urgency towards something, I think the world needs to be impatient. So that's the advice I would give to a older version of me. How much do you personally wrestle with the decisions that you have to make? And how much longer do you see yourself being the CEO of alphabet, not just alphabet, but also Google? Yeah. On the first one, there are moments we all have to make tough decisions and, you know, and some decisions weigh on me. But it's a privilege to do it. I have very good people helping me think things through. So I think the combination makes it all fine. On the second thing, I'm so energized by the things we need to do. I didn't have much access to computing growing up. It changed my life a lot. The one laptop or child goal really motivated me to come into technology. And when I look at last week, us launching a affordable smartphone in India, the chance to bring the next billion users in Asia and in Africa online, that gives me a lot of energy.

12149," Mza. Jeff Bezos shocked the world when he stepped down a CEO of Amazon. Less shocking was his choice for successor. Annie Jassy was not only one of his longest tenured lieutenants, but the architect of Amazon's multi-billion dollar cloud business, Amazon Web Services, a moonshot that helped transform Amazon into not just e-commerce, but enterprise juggernaut. Jassy then needed to find his own successor, tapping a former colleague who helped grow AWS in its earliest days, but had since left to run Seattle software giant Tableau. His job to continue the reinvention of AWS and in turn, Amazon. Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, new AWS CEO, Adam Salipski. You worked for AWS for 11 years and then went on to become CEO of Tableau Software in 2016. Then you get a call from Amazon to come back and run AWS as CEO. Tell me about that call. Well, I was having a one-on-one at my prior company and my Apple news alerts went off like everybody else's did. It's at Jeff Bezos, who's taking on a new role and Andy Jassy's taking on the CEO role of Amazon. And of course, Andy and I worked shoulder to shoulder about 20 feet apart for 11 years. So of course, I reached out and congratulated him and we started talking and the conversation turned to some of the possibilities. And next thing I know a little while later, here I am back at Amazon, absolutely delighted and honored to be the CEO of AWS and helping to shepherd this amazing business for our customers. In that process, did you talk to Jeff as well? I had some communication, but it was principally with Andy, who of course was a new AWS business best and of course was taking on the CEO role. But yeah, there was contact as you might expect with a small handful of other people. So what did Andy tell you he wanted in the next chapter for AWS? Andy reminded me, not that I needed reminding, but that it has really still day one for AWS and for our customers. It is still so early in this business. And we shouldn't think that just because the business has grown rapidly or just because we're currently the leader in the cloud, that it's anything close to mature. And so he really reminded me that we have to stay hungry, innovate as quickly as we ever have done in the past. You're about half a year into the job. What changed while you were gone that surprised you? Well, I think that so many more customers have really adopted the cloud and really decided that they're going all in. So I mean, it was a pretty decent sized business when I left, but it's really grown and the customer base is really expanded. And so now we have very deep relationships at the CEO level, the CIO level across every country, every industry, every use case. And we're regularly interacting with the most senior people at our client organizations. So you were working at real networks in the early 2000s and I understand you were offered a job at AWS without even really knowing what it was. I guess AWS was in stealth mode.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,375,2022-10-07 03:05:55
12150," So you were working at real networks in the early 2000s and I understand you were offered a job at AWS without even really knowing what it was. I guess AWS was in stealth mode. Well, it was very secret. So it was it was it was hard that the company didn't want to talk too much about it. But of course, you know, we had to talk a certain amount about it. So the call I got went something like we have this initiative to turn the guts of Amazon inside out and expose it to other people. And it sounded intriguing, although I confess I didn't fully understand what that was all about. So I came in and started talking to Andy and a few of the other senior leaders and eventually to Jeff. And I would have to say that even by the time I took the job, I thought I mostly understand what they're talking about. And it sounds like a good idea and I'm in. But I also was like, well, you know, we'll just have to see how it goes and you know, Amazon's a big, big place. And so I think we got a lot of a lot of intent to succeed here. And that's the thing that impressed me was Amazon really had the desire and the intent and the belief that this could be a really good business. AWS comes out of stealth mode and is the first to market with a cloud infrastructure service in 2006. How important was that first start? And do you think AWS still has an advantage today because of that? I think the time to market advantage that we had, which was probably honestly five to seven years, had start before other companies really started to take this seriously was in a norm. Frankly, it was just one of the biggest things that happened to us in the early years. Because at the beginning, a lot of people didn't get it. I would get asked a lot in 2006. So what does this have to do with selling books? And I even had a slide with kind of a pile of books on it and a question mark next to it. And the answer was it has nothing to do with selling books. But the technology which enables us to sell books, being global, being at a massive scale, being secure, being low cost, being highly performant. All that technology has everything to do with offering these types of services externally. Now AWS isn't a scrappy startup anymore. And you do have big rivals, even though AWS is still the leader, Microsoft and Google are big rivals. How do you make sure that being big doesn't slow you down? It's a great question. We are currently the leader. And I mean, depending on which third party you look at, we're probably a little bit more than twice as big as number two. And it's really important to continue to act as if we're insurgents and to be insurgents. And not to start to act like incumbents. And I like to talk about actually managing the business. We want our senior leaders to be managing product and managing customers. And I think as you get bigger and you put more and more layers into your company, it's all too frequent that you start managing math. You start managing ratios and percentages and growth. And I think it's a real disease if you stray away from really focusing on a deep way on the product you're building and a deep way on what your customers are telling you. And so we try and organize both with our org structure as well as just with our culture and what we choose to focus on, on really making sure that everybody is thinking about one or both of those two things, product and customers. And if you keep even the most senior leaders engaged at that level, then all of a sudden you maintain the urgency. And you keep acting like an insurgent. We got to feel that urgency every day. So keep acting like an insurgent. That's the motto. Absolutely. And structure yourself and build a culture that allows you to. It's one thing to say it, but it's easy to say it. But it's much harder to put in place enabling mechanisms that enable you to do so. And we focus a lot of effort on those mechanisms. Now, do you think the cloud keeps getting bigger and that AWS and Microsoft and Google just get bigger pieces of an ever expanding pie? Or at some point does it become a zero sum game and that fight for market share becomes more brutal and more bloody? Well, this is a very large market segment. If you look at global IT spend, it's in the trillions of dollars. I've seen estimates like three trillion trillion dollars. It doesn't really matter how many trillions it is. It's very, very large. And we've always believed that this was too good a market segment opportunity for the really to only be one winner. And sure enough, you've seen robust competition emerge and we all compete vigorously, but it is the segment is just growing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,376,2022-10-07 03:10:14
12151," It's segment opportunity for the really to only be one winner. And sure enough, you've seen robust competition emerge, and we all compete vigorously. But it is, the segment is just growing so rapidly that I think really for us, we believe that the winning business strategy for a long time to come and I would maintain forever is to focus not on the competitors, but to focus maniacally on customers and wake up every day understanding exactly what it is that they need us to build next. And then work backwards from there, back internally to how can we build those things. And if we do the best job at building the most quickly, the things that are most important for our customers, then I'm really not worried about what the competitors will do. You worked 10 feet away from Andy Jassy in the early days. Tell us something about the Amazon CEO that no one knows, but you. You're going to get me in trouble, aren't you? Yeah. Yeah. You worked 10 feet away from Andy Jassy in the early days. Tell us something about the Amazon CEO that no one knows, but you. You're gonna get me in trouble, aren't you? We don't, you know, I grew up in Seattle and Andy coming from New York has this fascination I don't understand with New York sports teams. So I've had to endure that for a lot of years. New Yorkers, yeah. So what are you going to do? Although he's, I think, come to adopt some of the Seattle teams, particularly the New Hockey team, the Kraken here. As he should. As he should exactly. So how do you expect Andy will be different from Jeff? Or how has Andy already been different from Jeff? Well, I think we're all different as leaders. I think it's all important that we all bring our own stamp to it and operate within ourselves. I don't think I would be a very good Andy. I don't want to presume, but I would assume that Andy wouldn't be a great Jeff, because Jeff's Jeff, Andy's Andy, and I'm me. So I think that Andy was certainly bringing a great depth of experience from AWS, which is one important part of the business and we'll having operated that business for so long. And I expect that it'll also give him an opportunity, although he was involved in other parts of Amazon certainly for a number of years. We'll be able to bring a fresh perspective to the whole company just as I hope to bring to AWS. I think that fresh perspective is often helpful, I think, just the mere act of change is useful for the business, for customers, for employees, and just to shake things up a little bit. So I think just a fresh perspective. How will you be different from Andy? Well, I think that the V.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,377,2022-10-07 03:15:25
12152," and just to shake things up a little bit. So I think just a fresh perspective. How will you be different from Andy? Well, I think that the world around us is changing so much that we're going to have to be different. It doesn't matter what we did yesterday. And right after I joined, we actually added two new leadership principles, which is very exciting. One's around striving to be Earth's best employer, and the second around focusing on the fact that success and scale bring broad responsibility. And those are things about which I personally am very passionate. And so I really personally look forward to digging in and helping the company to figure out what are those things that we have to figure out? Where can we innovate to be Earth's best employer? And then also to figure out externally, what can we do to really be great citizens of our local communities, to be great citizens of our national communities, and to be great citizens of the global community? And I care a lot about those things, as a lot of other people do here, but I plan to put a good amount of energy and time and focus and hopefully help Amazon innovate in all of those areas. How closely do you work with Andy Day-to-Day? Does he regularly weigh in on AWS decisions or not? Well, he's got a pretty broad scope of things to worry about now, so he's got a pretty intense day job, I believe. So he's really focused across the company as you would expect him to be. But that being said, obviously, AWS remains an important part of Amazon. And so we touch base regularly, be it in person or via email, just on the most important things going on in the business. Does Jeff ever weigh in on AWS decisions? Yes, I mean, really from the beginning, Jeff was involved at the very, very beginning at some of the most fundamental decisions. How do you price EC2? What do you name S3? What does the detail page look like? Obviously, over time, we, the business grew, but this Jeff was always available when we needed him. And I certainly anticipate that'll be the same going forward. So is he still available now? And what do you understand that Jeff's priorities are? Sure. Well, I'll let Jeff speak to his own priorities, but certainly Jeff has been available when, for example, we've been doing our annual planning cycle as many companies have. And it's been great to have Jeff, you know, weigh in on really where we're heading for the next year and beyond and to just make sure it's easy to get focused on the details of the business. And it's great to have multiple people who can help you pick your eyes up a little bit. Now, you joined AWS in the middle of a pandemic. You came back to AWS in the middle of a pandemic. That's hopefully moving into the rear view mirror. Moderna is one of AWS's biggest customers. If it weren't for the cloud, if it weren't for AWS, would we have had a vaccine as quickly as we did? I've got to tell you, I'm used, but it's been an absolute privilege for us to work with Moderna, because what they're doing obviously is literally life-saving. And they've been so innovative and so creative. So Moderna took a drug development process to get to a vaccine candidate. That process would typically have taken them 20 months. And doing that on AWS in conjunction with all the innovation on their side, reduced that 20 months to 42 days, 42 days to get the vaccine candidate, the mRNA vaccine candidate for COVID-19. And that was really running multiple parts of Moderna on AWS. So if you look at the drug design part, they had their drug design studio running on AWS, all the way to manufacturing with the new digitized manufacturing that they call their digital manufacturing platform. So it's really end to end and the ability to use massive amounts of resources and to pick the exact type of service and capability for each part of the job and to really bring the full set of resources to bear. In addition to not having to focus on the IT and the infrastructure and the technology and rather letting Moderna focus on the all important job of drug discovery. So working in partnership, it was just magnificent to see what they accomplished. Since you joined AWS, a number of longtime AWS leaders have moved on. To Microsoft, to Stripe, to Tableau, does that concern you? Well, actually retention has been very good.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,378,2022-10-07 03:18:53
12153," have moved on to Microsoft, to Stripe, to Tableau. retention has been very good. The VP and above ranks at Amazon, the average tenure is over a decade, over ten years. So that's actually very, very strong retention. So of course, you're always going to have some level of people coming and people going. At the end of the day, that's actually healthy for the business. You want new perspectives to come in. Of course, in the right proportion. Amazon has opened an investigation after 550 employees supported a petition claiming a culture of discrimination, harassment, bullying and bias. What's the status of this? Well, we are incredibly focused and I personally believe it's incredibly important to really have a very diverse, you know, inclusive and equitable environment. And we're going to make sure that whatever it takes that we've got that. So we believe that we're really doing a lot of things to deliver on that. And we've got a lot of innovative efforts around bringing in a diverse workforce, which we have to have both because we're going to serve our customers best, they're diverse. We have to match that diversity. And also I just believe it's our responsibility and it's the right thing to do. Any time there is any possibility that things are not, something is not gone the way we wanted to. We're going to investigate it thoroughly. That's what we're doing in this case and we'll make sure that we're operating in a way that's consistent with our values and that's always the only goal. If you could rewind to the early 2000s, the earliest days of AWS. Is there anything you would have done differently to build an inclusive culture to start with a more inclusive culture to make sure that it didn't become a, you know, a boys club? Well, I don't think that's what we have. I think that we do have a really fun, exciting innovation led and inclusive culture. And that being said, these are hard problems. I think we've done a lot but we are nowhere close to where we need to be. We're going to be restless and dissatisfied with our progress on DE and I just as we are with every other part of our business. Mark Zuckerberg is making a big bet on the metaverse. How big do you think it's going to be? Such an interesting sense. The metaverse is real. AWS has the biggest trove of sensitive corporate data in the world. I'm curious how you think about the balance between data and privacy and, you know, freedom and civil liberties in the modern era. I mean, there are governments. There are nation states around the world that want that information.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,379,2022-10-07 03:23:07
12154," balance between data and privacy and freedom and civil liberties in the modern era. I mean, there are governments. There are nation states around the world that want that information. Hackers and criminals want that information. Well, we're very clear to start with that. Our first job is security. We often say security is job zero. It was on the first page of our operating plan pretty much every year that I can remember. But what about when governments request that information? So, we're speaking of that information. Sure. Well, we are very clear that our customers data is their data. So the data belongs to our customers. And not everybody operates that way. We are not going to look at customers data. We are not going to compete against our customers using their data. Their data is their data. And furthermore, we have all sorts of architectural best practices that our customers should be and are using for any sensitive data. And so a lot of that really relies around encryption. And so we build a lot of different encryption capabilities so that any sensitive data, which could leak for any reason, be it to a government, be it to a hacker, be it to anyone else, any form of security breach, that it's encrypted and useless to anybody else. Given the broad array of encryption solutions that we provide, it's actually very doable and powerful for our customers to safeguard their data that way. Mark Zuckerberg is making a big bet on the metaverse. Is AWS going to have a role in the metaverse? I think AWS already has a big role in the metaverse. So I think the cloud enables the metaverse. So if you think about all of the compute capacity, all of the storage, all of the machine learning, which is required to create, compelling and delightful end user experiences in the metaverse, a lot of that is already today running on AWS. So if you take Epic Games, for example, so Epic Runs Fortnite, massively popular game, 350 million users worldwide and Epic Runs, almost everything on AWS from the backend, servers to the analytics and everything in between. So I think that's a great example of the metaverse at work and all that's happening today on AWS. And we anticipate that's only going to grow really rapidly in the future. How big do you think it's going to be? Such an interesting sentence. The metaverse is real. And yet it's virtual at the same time. I think that if we continue to do what we've always done, which is to provide a technology platform that allows organizations to transform, then these gaming and entertainment and social media and other companies will be able to do what they do best, which is to focus on innovating on behalf of their end users. And I think that the metaverse in many other areas will be rich with inventions. So this next conversation will happen in the spheres, in the metaverse. That's where we'll next meet. That could be on me. I'll meet you in the metaverse. All right. See you there. Now I know that climate change and stopping climate change and your data center footprint is a big passion of yours. How fast will Amazon's data centers get to carbon neutral? Amazon is already the largest purchaser of renewable energy in the world. And we intend to be 100% renewable energy by the year 2025. We originally said 2030. We actually accelerated that by five years to 2025. That's part of our broad climate pledge that Amazon created, and to which we've now gotten 200 other organizations to sign on to. And the climate pledge is to be nets are a carbon by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Accord target. So we know how to do some of that. Other part are going to require invention, but we really look forward to it. And I think it's one of the most important things we can do for our generation. Amazon counts some of the biggest oil and gas producers as its customers. Isn't that a contradiction? Should you be kicking them off your platforms? Those customers are trying to get to sustainable business models which rely on new energy sources. And so many of those customers are figuring out how do they get to wind, how do they get to solar, how do they get into batteries, all new business models relying on renewable energy. And I think a population is on할 wing behind the climate pledge has our own Zero-त 퍼플,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,380,2022-10-07 03:27:40
12155," Those customers are figuring out how do they get to wind, how do they get to solar, how do they get into batteries, all new business models relying on renewable energy. And I think rather than abandoning them and having them maybe dig in more on fossil fuels, if we can enable them to move faster, to be more innovative, and to be more agile in figuring out new business models, new technical solutions, experimenting, failing fast and moving on to the next idea, then the whole world will get to the renewable energy solutions that we need. At this year's reinvent conference, it'll be the first time that Andy Chassi is not giving the keynote. You will be, give us a preview. What can we expect to hear? We're going to have a lot of really exciting announcements. So I think across our service portfolio, you'll see that. We have a lot of exciting partner announcements. Partner ecosystem still remains to this day so important to what AWS is doing. And we have some great announcements lined up for that. And then I think people are going to want to see that we're making it easier and easier for them to consume the cloud and to work with AWS. And so we're going to continue to, in addition to building more powerful basic capabilities, we're going to continue to make it easier and easier in a variety of ways to interact with AWS. Adam Salipski, CEO of AWS, thank you so much for joining us. Thanks, I hope you got saved. Bloomberg has enhanced search on the terminal to deliver what you need when you need it.

12156," Thought misinformation, terrorism, racism, and violence many clicks along the way. Lately, YouTube's biggest battles are focused on eliminating COVID and vaccine misinformation and keeping the platform safe for kids and teens. On this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, we rewind to talk about where YouTube has been and fast forward to where it's going next, with one of the longest tenured employees and women at Google, the CEO of YouTube, Susan Wigitsky. It's been five years since we last talked on camera and we have a new president. We are weathering a pandemic. The most watched video on YouTube is baby shark. Baby shark. So a lot's changed since 2016. How do you feel about YouTube 2021 versus 2016? I feel good about it. It's definitely been a while and technology things move so quickly, so a lot of things have changed since 2016. And overall, I've been really pleased that we've continued to grow and grow our ecosystem of creators. We've invested a lot in responsibility and that's been a really big focus for us. With weather through a pandemic and a lot of hard challenges, but overall, I'm feeling really good. You've been at Google for 20 plus years going all the way back to Larry and Sergey in the garage. You've been the CEO of YouTube for seven plus years. How has your job changed in that time? Since I joined being the CEO of YouTube, I would say one of the biggest things that has changed, certainly, has just been maybe the recognition of the importance of digital video. So when I first joined, actually a lot of people would say, oh, like, why did you join? I was running ads beforehand and that's been the main way Google generates revenue. And so a lot of people said, like, why did you leave that and go to YouTube? But I always believed in digital video and I believe that now we see that the world also believes we've seen a lot of adoption of digital video and the benefits that that can have. You've championed this diversification strategy at YouTube since you started. What's working and what's not working? Well, our main way of generating revenue is from advertising. But we also have really grown our subscription revenue and that has been really, really important from many different reasons. So that has enabled our users to have an experience where they can have music, YouTube music and premium. We just announced the 50 million subscribers that we were really excited about. But we also see other ways that our creators generate revenue. So our creators, for example, generate revenue with channel subscriptions. They may sell merchandise. We also have things like digital goods, so like super chat, super thanks. And so we've basically diversified the number of ways that our ecosystem is generating revenue. The original tagline for YouTube was broadcast yourself and that concept has exploded. You have ordinary people in the spotlight. When they grow up, they want to be an influencer. They want to be a YouTube star or a YouTube creator. What do you see as the future of the creator economy? I see a lot of possibility with the creator economy and because I see that many people have a lot of interest and they have a lot to offer. And beforehand, they went up and able to have shared that with the world. And so there are so many people depending upon what their talent or their interest is, whether it's a sport or cooking or gaming or hairstyles that people have come out and really been able to share that and create a lot of jobs. So we actually see, like our, we actually saw a 35% increase in the number of creators that are generating six-figure income out of YouTube. And in the last year. And so that's just an example of like how the creator economy is continuing to grow. And for years, YouTube was the only company that actually paid creators. But now a lot of companies are paying creators. Facebook, Instagram, Snap, TikTok. How do you see that competition playing out? Who wins? Well, it is a competitive landscape. And in general, competition is good. It makes everyone work harder and that's good. I mean, we look at creators and we say they're going to come to us if we do the business.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,382,2022-10-07 03:36:15
12157," I'm a competition's good, it makes everyone work harder and that's good. I mean we look at creators and we say they're gonna come to us if we do the best job and creators come to us looking basically for fame and fortune. Like how can I, I have a skill or I have a talent, something I want to share with the world like and YouTube can help that be known, can help them provide that fame, but also we can generate revenue for them. And so as long as we're doing a good job of that, creators are gonna come to us if we start to fail, then they're gonna leave us and they're gonna go to another platform. And so we just need to work really hard to make sure that we deliver that for our creators. A year ago during the Black Lives Matter protest, YouTube made big commitments to Black creators in particular. What's been the progress there and how do you see YouTube, the potential for YouTube to be used as a tool for social justice? Well so we've made an announcement that we were gonna do a hundred million dollar Black Voices Fund. And so we're continuing to develop content there. But one of the other thing, and I think there's been a lot of great content that's come out and we'll certainly see more. But because YouTube doesn't have any gatekeepers, like you can just post and become a creator, we have seen a lot of people of different backgrounds and underrepresented backgrounds. Become creators and have audiences. We never really measured it beforehand because we didn't have a way. And so one of the things that we've done is we've enabled creators to now tell us what backgrounds they affiliate with so we can have a better understanding of how they're doing on our platform. Let's talk about YouTube shorts. It seems to be a top priority. Yeah. We all know that TikTok is on the rise. Yeah. Some important are YouTube shorts to the platform, to the company. So YouTube shorts, it's very important. We see that creators and users want to watch all types of content long form short form. It turns out that the first video that was actually ever uploaded to YouTube, me at the zoo was an 18 second video. So it was a short form video. And we have lots of short form views and we've had it way before TikTok did. But what we have really been leaning into more is just enabling those to be found. And then a lot of the creation tools and so bringing a lot more mobile creation is really important for us going forward. Did you notice that viewing time was being lost to TikTok? Did you see that trend? And do you see TikTok as a sort of existential threat? I mean, we definitely see many competitors in this space. What we're just focused on are like our own metrics like do we see our users engaging? Where's our opportunity? We're always looking around and seeing what our competitors are doing and if they're doing something that we think would be good for our users and our creators, we're also going to look at how we can improve our own economy, create our economy and what's good for our users. I think a lot of people, you know, we talk about vaccine hesitancy and they blame social media. They say YouTube not doing enough. One of the big things for us is to continue to work with public health experts to get their messages across.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,383,2022-10-07 03:41:12
12158," Today's your big day are you excited? Mama is tired. They speed up hard. You have to feed your creativity. So this tree house, you guys ready for the movie? Let's see what we can do. Hey, I'm so excited. At this point, YouTube has become a hub for discovery, for information, for, you know, it satisfies our curiosities, right? That comes with a lot of inspiration, but also with misinformation. When it comes to vaccines, vaccine hesitancy, videos that cause a public health risk, where do you want to see YouTube do better? We've taken responsibility very seriously. It's been one of my top priorities. So first of all, we want to make sure that if there's information that violates our policies, we came up with 10 different policies around COVID. Then if that's a violation of policies, then that's something that will remove. We removed over a million videos associated with COVID, but we also want to make sure that we're raising up information that we think would be, that come from trusted and authoritative sources. And we've really been able to do that. I think a lot of people, you know, we talk about vaccine hesitancy and they blame social media. They say YouTube's not doing enough, you know, how do you respond to that? Yeah, I mean, I think, first of all, we're always learning. I just, just to be fair, like we're always thinking about how can we do better? We're looking at the feedback and working with public health experts across the board. And, you know, I think one of the big things for us is to continue to work with public health experts to understand, you know, what are the ways that we can partner with them to get their messages across. And I really believe that that is something that's really changed is the evolution of bringing creators, musicians, experts talking about public health. We never would have seen that before in the pandemic. How much do you internalize the criticism of YouTube's content? Do you take it personally? And how does that influence the decisions that you make as CEO? I want to be doing the right thing. And I care about that. I care about the legacy that we leave. I care about the world that we leave to our children. I care about how media is consumed by the next generation and by everyone today. And so I really have put a lot of time and effort to make sure that we are acting responsibly. And there's always a balance between the free speech and the, right, but being responsible and taking down content that we think could lead to some kind of real-world harm. And so, I mean, sure, I think whenever you're in a position like that, there's going to be a lot of criticism. But our goal is just to continue to talk to experts and evolve. And how do you make decisions in those tough moments where it's a tough call? Like how much of it is making a decision or leading by consensus and how much does it come down to you? The goal is that when we have tough decisions, they're not, we're not, they are like improvising in some way. And so we've made a concrete set of decisions beforehand. And then we're looking and saying, is this something that meets our standards? Is it a violation or not a violation? And if it seems like there's some set of issues with the content that we have on the platform, we're going to go back to experts and then reevaluate. It should be making changes to our policies. YouTube helped keep a generation of children connected, educated, entertained, distracted through the pandemic. What have you learned from that experience? What do you see as the potential future of YouTube as a tool for learning, as a tool in schools? When I meet people and they find out I'm the CEO of YouTube, almost always, they tell me about something they learned on YouTube or someone that they're something their family member learned. So I see that as being a very significant part of YouTube. And during the pandemic, we certainly saw that a lot more education went online and we had all the homeschooling. We had people who had to also just learn a lot of skills that they hadn't learned beforehand. But probably the biggest thing that we also learned was just, and that I really saw was a need for us to continue to work with educational institutions and the need for us to be able to integrate with some of the learning tools that they could...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,384,2022-10-07 03:44:54
12159," and that I really saw was a need for us to continue to work with educational institutions and the need for us to be able to integrate with some of the learning tools that the kids are all using because they are using YouTube and there's a lot more that we can do to really help educators have YouTube be a key part of the curriculum. My kids are on YouTube a lot and sometimes more than I want them to be and sometimes it's super productive and they're learning something cool and sometimes it's not productive at all. How are you innovating to make the time kids spend on YouTube more valuable and of course safe? It's very important to me as a parent to make sure that we're giving parents options about how what they want their kids to see and that's one of the reasons that pretty much as soon as I got to YouTube we started working on YouTube kids which is a separate app which is important for kids in terms of how we can control the quality and we can give parents a lot more control about what kind of content is appropriate for them and their family and you know there are many other things like we actually just came out with a supervised experience for tweens because tweens was one of the age groups that was actually hardest they usually don't want to be on the kids app but they're not 13 to be on the on the main app and so the supervised experience is something that we recently came out with. The Wall Street Journal has been doing some in-depth reporting on Facebook. The report is that Facebook knew that Instagram was toxic for teen girls and didn't do anything about it. Does YouTube look at the impact it has on teen users? The influence it might have on on someone's body image or self-esteem? First of all I think it's a it's a very important topic and we do have a panel of experts that we work with to be able to help us understand what are the different ways that our product could be used or what are how do we face some of these challenging issues to make sure that we're getting the best advice. And we certainly do see for a lot of really tough issues that YouTube can be a really valuable resource. So body positivity, mental health, we see a lot of creators actually talk about mental health and that for a lot of kids it's really it like destigmatizes and enables people to talk about what's happening and what's going on with them. The potential long-term impacts of YouTube on teens and on children whether it is toxic or whether it's addictive. Is that something that you wonder about? Is that something that you struggle with not just as a CEO but as a model? We certainly want to make sure that we are doing what we can to be responsible with kids and in every way possible and that's one of the reasons that we actually have worked hard to give parents as many options as possible for them to decide what is important for them and their family. Whether that's like limiting screen time, like limiting what is the content they actually have access to. I mean even letting parents just say these are like the 10 videos. My kid can only see these 10 videos and so that is that is really important for us to give the tools back to parents for them to decide what is best for them and their family. Are you concerned about looming regulation? There may be regulation that is well intended but actually then has a really negative impact.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,385,2022-10-07 03:49:10
12160," Music I would like to begin by addressing the heinous attack on the United States Capitol. Like all Americans, I am outraged by the violence, lawlessness, and mayhem. How much did President Trump test YouTube and how much did it test you as a leader? The question integrity is something that we see incredibly, is incredibly important, and we've leaned into in every way we possibly can. We treat all public figures and all public leaders the same as we treat any individual. And so, meaning that everybody is held to the same standards. And so we definitely held President Trump as we would hold all other presidents and all other elected officials to the same standards that we hold our creators and anyone else on YouTube. But was that difficult for you as the CEO of the company? I mean, that's kind of, that's like a big responsibility. I mean, yeah, it is difficult, but it is very important and we also are global. So we're dealing with leaders from all over the world. And there were a number of leaders that, and there continue to be a number of leaders that post or that there's content that may be a violation of our policies. But we do hold a consistent standard across everything that we do. YouTube was the last platform to ban Trump, and you have said, his channel will be reinstated when an elevated risk of violence has subsided. How and when specifically will you make that decision? Well, we'll make that decision based on a number of different factors, whether that is like events in the news, signals were seeing from the, from the government. And we'll certainly continue to evaluate that based on a large number of signals that we see. And will he ultimately be reinstated? I mean, we've stated that we will reinstate him when we believe that there is no risk to public safety or no public danger. Google just removed a voting app for Russian opposition leader Alexi Navalny. The Russian government seems to be stepping up requests to take down content. You've talked in the past about your family history, your grandparents living behind the iron curtain being concerned about censorship back then. And Russian is a huge YouTube audience. Yeah. How concerned are you about Russian government overreach? One of the things that were is important to us at YouTube is the fact that we do enable so many voices and that we do enable people to express themselves and really celebrate the freedom of speech. And we certainly, that's a core value of ours. But when we work with governments there are many things that we have to take in consideration, like whether it's like local laws or what's happening on the ground. And so there's always going to be multiple considerations that we're going to have to take into consideration. Navalny said that YouTube deleted a video, one of his videos. Was that at the request of the Russian government? We certainly get requests from governments. And we look and consider why are we getting the requests? What's actually happening on the ground? And based on a whole bunch of different factors, we make a decision. So we don't always, those are not always requests that make sense for us to honor, but in certain cases we will honor them in that country. The Biden administration seems to be targeting big tech. We've seen Mark Zuckerberg, we've seen Jack Dorsey now testify before Congress multiple times. And I've heard it said that YouTube is getting a pass. Do you think you should be up there testifying? Well, I think we do get a lot of scrutiny. I feel like there's a lot of scrutiny. And because YouTube is part of Google, Sender has testified a number of different times and answered many different questions on YouTube. So I'm just trying to reverse a certain point ofarson's share.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,386,2022-10-07 03:53:37
12161," Like, there's a lot of scrutiny. And because YouTube is part of Google, Sundar has testified a number of different times and answered many different questions on YouTube. So I do believe there's a certain amount of scrutiny. And if I were ever asked to testify, it certainly would go and testify as well. You're one of the most senior women at Google. If not the most senior woman at Google, Google has faced a lot of scrutiny for how it treats women in recent years. How much progress do you think Google has made in hiring and promoting women across the company? And how much progress do you think still needs to be made? I see a really big effort across technology as a whole to be able to be more inclusive. And I think that is really positive. I've been a big supporter of it. It's the very beginning. And I mean, I think at Google, there are many efforts. And there's a lot of work that has been done. And I'm sure there's a lot more for us to continue to do. And if you just look at the stats, you can see they're not enough women. We need more women in technology. And I think we have made a lot of progress, but it's still hard. It's harder to be a woman in technology. It's harder to be a minority of any kind. And so I think there's still a lot of work for us to do. When we last spoke five years ago, I asked you about being a mom. You have five kids. And you said something that really stuck with me. You said being a mom makes me a better leader. I prioritize better. I see something growing fast. And I run towards that. If something's growing closely, I'm like, I don't have time for that. How has that management strategy played out for you? I think it's played out really well. Thank you, Sven. I mean, rare desation is everything when you look at it, because we have a lot of opportunity. There's a lot of moving pieces, very dynamic environment. So if you can prioritize and say, these are the most important things to do, then you're going to get there faster. Larian Sargay, have no left. How long do you plan to keep running YouTube? How long do you plan to stay at Google? As long as I have a mission that I believe in, and that things that I'm excited about getting done. So I have a lot of ways that I see that YouTube can continue to grow. I have a lot of products and ideas and things that aren't yet released and things that aren't yet doing. And I'm excited about getting those done. So I think if there comes a time where I no longer have a list of projects where I feel like I don't have that much more to add, then it'll probably time to do something else. Would you throw your hat into the ring to be Alphabet's next CEO, or if the board asked you, would you step up and do that? Well, I think Sundar's doing a great job. Very, very, please. I think he's doing, I mean, it's a very challenging job. There's a lot of different constituents and a lot of product, a lot of different issues. And I mean, I'll just say I'll always do whatever would be wherever I could be most helpful to the company. Do you still talk much to Larry and Sergey? I do still see them socially, though, not workwise. Do you ever talk about work? I mean, sometimes it would be casually, but our business is very complex right now. And there's a lot of things that are happening. And so it's hard for, I mean, people may have different opinions, but to really engage it's a long conversation. What do you want your legacy to be? I am proud of the way that we've been able to enable people to have a channel, to have an audience. Like I just met with a number of three creators. And like YouTube really was able to let them shine and create audiences in a business and employ people that otherwise never would have happened. And so that's certainly one, continuing to grow that. I'd say second, it's been really important to me, too, to see a lot more women in technology that has been just a personal goal of mine is to be a role model and try to support women. And I feel very fortunate to have gotten to where I have. And I know it was due to like many different factors. And I want to support the next generation of women and see technology as like an open place where anyone can come and be successful. And then probably lastly continue to grow what we're doing with education. Susan, would you please have YouTube? Thank you. So much for having me.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,387,2022-10-07 03:57:58

12163," This is Blomick Daybreak with Lisa. Our top stories this morning. Five federal officials speak with one voice, dashing hopes of a dovish pivot. Investors now await the U.S. jobs report for any signs, a hot labor market, maybe cooling. A win for Elon Musk after a judge halts Twitter's case against him, giving the party's three weeks to close the $44 billion deal. Samsung reports its first profit drop since 2019 while AMD misses projections by more than a billion. It underscores the depths of the global PC and memory chip downturn. And U.S. President Joe Biden says he's disappointed with the surprise open-plus decision as a slash world production. There's no decision yet on how to respond. Just gone 8 AM across the Amazon, use of command to dean in Dubai. It is a jobs day. It is going to be the second most important data point of the month, of course, after the CPI inflation readings. A little bit of anxiety going into this. And as a result, we've seen choppy low volume price action on the S&P 500 mini that caution reflected with a little bit of downside, about a tenth of 1%. Interesting note out from Bank of America, they're arguing that we're going to see a year end rally for some of the loser stocks on tax loss harvesting. Holding the clients, Fed speakers remaining hawkish, Bloomberg dollar index, it says flat as a pancake and a quiet G10 FX complex, and then Brent crude, just taking a breath after what has been a ripper week. 11% of the last five trading sessions, the biggest weekly gain since about March on the OPEC plus move, how is the US going to respond just weeks ahead of the midterm elections? I want to get to this chart though and talk about the Fed. Talk about expectations in the market out there. This is a story about what the swaps are currently signaling in terms of rates in March 2023. You have Scott Minor who says the Fed is not going to stop until something breaks. But how far will the Fed go with raising rates? That is the quintessential question, it makes sense for investors to stop trying to pick up bottom. That's what Minor is writing and they should instead get positioned for the eventual capitulation. And that takes me to the fear gauge, which crossed the 30 mark as we count down to the jobs report. That is an event in itself, sure. I mean, we're so far from the 40 mark, which is considered capitulation. But there's somebody out there who has made a bet on the VIX going to 150 by next year and this is about $950,000 for 50,000 call options through a series of block trades, the most active VIX option contract on Thursday. It's gotten the attention of our global audience, one of the most red stories this morning. We'll see, of course, how accurate this bet is going to turn out to be. Let's see how some of the bets are turning out in Asia and about droolers joined us from Hong Kong and about. Thanks, you said. We're going to have a bet on the VIX there. But in terms of the setup for Asia or how we're trading as we head into the afternoon here, where we can see here, basically lower against the board. The same themes that you were talking about. You said more hawkish commentary coming through from Fed officials. You've got the moves in the VIX, of course. You've got the jobs report that's coming up later. So trading volumes are a little bit muted, but the individual markets are watching where we just have the nifty coming online in the India in the last 15 minutes or so. And then also taking a look at one sector in particular. This is what we're seeing in the chip space this morning. So taking a look at these declines for the COSDAQ and the TIEX over in Taiwan. Of course, the United, those two markets, because they're both very focused on the fate of semiconductors. And if you change on now, big earnings out this morning came from Samsung. So we did see Samsung reporting its first profit drop since 2019. And then we had another one as well out overnight in the USA, AMD or advanced micro devices. Also reporting disappointing earnings. Samsung, interestingly, is high risk we head into the afternoon session. Perhaps Yukyung can provide some more context on that in just a few minutes time. But otherwise, it certainly could be a signal perhaps to investors of what we can expect use that in the upcoming earnings season. Absolutely, Annabelle. I'd like to scroll through here. Thank you for giving us the highlights that's the Annabelle droolers there with the markets here in the next slide. Okay.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,389,2022-10-07 04:06:41
12164," upcoming earnings season. Absolutely Annabelle, a lot to scroll through here. Thank you for giving us the highlights that's the Annabelle droolers there with the markets in Asia. Now, no fewer than five top Fed officials have spoken in the last 24 hours. I mean, the roll of decks of names is just endless. And they're all sending the same message. Inflation is far too high, and a rate hike pause is a long way off. Our global economics and policy editor, Kathleen Hayes joins us now. Kathleen, so I mean, were there any dovish notes left at all in the rhetoric? And what can we look forward to in terms of the actual jobs report that are coming hours? I think all the doves have flown the Fed's nest, you said. They are flying south of the winter and Jay Powell's at the head of that, that's the V of doves. I mean, to be hawks, just heading toward another rate hike. Neil Kishgari, President of Minneapolis Fed, spoke again today. He was an ardent dove last year going into the beginning of this year. And suddenly, he became a hawk and he still is one. As today about the possibility of slowing down rate hikes, et cetera, listen to what he said. We just now need to stay the course. We said we're going to do this. We need to follow through and validate the expectations that we've set in markets. Until I see some evidence that underlying inflation has solidly peaked and is hopefully headed back down, I'm not ready to declare a pause. I think we're quite a ways away from a pause. So how about one person people thought might be a dove because she only recently joined the Fed Board of Governors. And when she was still in academia, she was talking about being cognizant of the impact of things like tight monetary policy on minority communities, on poorer communities. Lisa Cook, you can see her to the left of her screen. And her first speech today where she talked about monetary policy, you know what this possible dove said? They've got to get back to 2% and ongoing rate hikes are needed. She too is in that hawk nest now. And you can look at some others on this list. You can look at Charlie Evans, Chicago Fed. He was a dove. He's been very cautiously moving more into the hawkish camp. A boy he's there now. He says the Fed's headed to 4.5 to 4. And 3.4% at the rate they're going, they're going to get there by spring time. Loretta Mester, inflation still unexpectedly high, Fed Governor Chris Waller, no many full progress on inflation still need to do more rate hikes. And you just heard from Neil Cushkari. So basically that's the direction they're heading. I think it's interesting that Chris Waller said when asked in question from reporters today, a soft landing is still possible to get this. The landing strip is still shrinking. So quickly when we look at the jobs you said, this report is not going to change the Fed's mind. Employment payrolls expected to be mean healthy, up 250, 5,000 down from 315. But that's considered a solid gain. And employment stays near 50 year low, 3.7%. Average on earnings, that's paychecks. 5% year over year, down a little from the previous month. But that's still double what they were averaging going into the pandemic. So you said, I think the jobs report maybe interest the markets. But even a week, even a strong one, even a weaker strong CPI next week doesn't change where the Fed's going right now. They're clearly heading towards more rate hikes willing to next year. They are the message unanimous for anybody who had a little bit of doubt. I mean, that's been quashed at least for this week. Bloomberg's Kathleen Hayes in New York with a deeper analysis. Thanks a lot. I want to get to a red headline here. This is a Bloomberg scoop. One of the wealthiest people on the planet is set to be opening a family office in Singapore. And this is Asia's second wealthiest man, the reliant industries chairman Mukesh Ambani. He's going to be setting this up in Singapore. It's according to people familiar with the move. It has picked a manager to hire the staff for the entity and get it running. But of course, the Ambani's have chosen real estate. And the reliance group has not been available for a comment on this just yet. But again, this is the latest in a series of ultra-rich people to pick Singapore for their family office. We'll keep a close eye on that. I want to get to Samsung Electronics now, because they've reported their first profit drops since 2019 with that income falling 32%. Let's get the details from our Asia stocks reporter, you, King Lee. And so quite the shocker here. What is some of the thinking at the top levels of management around?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,390,2022-10-07 04:11:07
12165," The details from our Asia stocks reporter, you Kim Lee. And so quite the shocker here, what is some of the thinking at the top levels of management around how to deal with this? So this preliminary result with this Samsung haven't given the divisional breakdance, but we can see from this worst unexpected, quarterly profit draw, this that is membership business has done a lot worse than expected, despite a better performance that the display or smartphone businesses, and also despite possible currency exchange gain from the Wii Korean one. So this adds to the barrage of bad news for chip investors, which just saw that my Chrome's warning a couple of days ago and then AMD's warning about the sinking PC demand. So this is possibly it bodes ill for the more months is to come. And yet we have seen Samsung electronic share rising as much as 1% this afternoon after it has been fluctuating and down as much as 2%. And that could be some did buying by foreign investors who may be seeing a entry point to be attractive after excessive drops of Samsung share, which is down about 40% from its 2021 peak. And there can also be suppliers endorsing the view from Morgan Stanley yesterday that the bottom may be forming for Asian chips sector and more Stanley upgraded his view on the semiconductor shares including Samsung. However, does this mean a full pledge turn around for the companies that share prices as Samsung or SK high needs? Maybe not, there's still a recession risk looming and the Fed has stopped its rate hike cycles. You'll count, thank you very much for the thoughtful reflection on some of those Samsung announcements. So that's our Asia Stocks reporter, you Kyeong Lee. In Seoul, of course, we have this duo with AMD and Samsung surprising with some negative announcements. Let's get to the Delaware judge now who's halted the court case against Elon Musk over his $44 billion Twitter buyout and ordered the parties to close the abiot October 28th. That sets the clock ticking. Let's head out to Bloomberg's to Kim and for more. So can this be considered a win for Musk? A partial win and that Musk had asked for time to close the deal, but now he's got a hard deadline, three weeks from Friday and Twitter's position is show me the money. And if he can't come through with the deal, they are going back to court. Now early on Thursday, there was a flurry of paperwork, muscle layers asked for a pause in the Twitter lawsuit against him. It was set to go forward October 17th. He had been doing depositions today. He said a little delay won't hurt Twitter, Twitter slammed back. Any delay was quote an invitation of further mischief and delay. It said until Musk commits to a closed Twitter is entitled to its day in court. The ruling from the Delaware Chance Rejudge was swift. She granted Musk until October 28th to complete the deal. And if it's not done by 5 p.m. on that date, she will set a new trial date sometime in November. And our shares were up initially as much as 3.5% after hours as this decision came back. It eased and gave back those gains after about an hour or two. But if you look at the five day chart, you can see shares have shot up as Musk on October 3rd said he was reviving the deal and intended to go through. But you look at the timeline on this case, starting back to when Musk was all in on buying Twitter and then slowly began expressing doubts, trying to reneg on the deal, and then ending up in this lawsuit both sides do not trust each other. And Twitter views him as playing games. So the acrimony was clear in the filings. Musk lawyers claim Twitter won't take yes for an answer. Twitter says Musk cannot be trusted. And unless he closes, they're going to court in November. Hard deadline. Back to you. Just when we thought everything is going to be done and dusted with, you've got all these new twists and turns that she's keep popping up. So thank you very much for that.

12166," I want to check in on the first word headlines for you from around the world and get out to someone foxman. It's a moment. Good morning, you said the latest ECB minutes show some officials wanted a 50 basis point hike in September. The decision makers ultimately agreed to a 3-quarter point hike. The minutes come three weeks before the ECB nexus interest rates with momentum building for a repeat of that September hike. The central bank is fighting inflation at nearing 10% in the block while risking a booming downturn. Swedish investigators are blaming explosions for damage to the Nord Stream pipeline delivering natural gas from Russia. The Swedish Security Service says its investigation has increased suspicions of sabotage, but it did not indicate how the detonations happened or who might be responsible. The Danish and German officials are also investigating, and Nord Stream says its cooperating fully. The US has sanctioned seven Iranian officials in accuses of leading a crackdown on protests and an internet cutoff. The group includes the interior and communications ministers. The protests began last month over the death and police custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was arrested for allegedly flouting Islamic dress codes. It also reflects a push by the Biden administration to more forcefully support the protests. President Biden is also pardoning thousands of Americans convicted for possession of marijuana and ordering a review of its legal status. In a major step towards decriminalizing the plant, he's issued a blanket pardon for all prior federal charges of simple possession and will urge governors to do the same for state offenses.

The Biden administration hunkers down to plot its response to the oil production cut by Saudi Rady and its opa allies, more than with Credit Suisse later.

12167," Covers jobs day like Bloomberg. We're in this unacceptable high inflation environment and you know being able to forecast in real time the churning points you know we're all waiting for inflation to peak and then come back down that's going to be really critical for policy making. We look to me according to our reports headed for four and a half to four and three quarters per cent by sometime next year which given how fast we've been raising interest rates is likely to be the spring and time. Thank you. What kind of official speaking about the continued battle to rain in inflation? This terminal charge shows the US unemployment rate indicating that the labor market remains extremely tight and has remained robust even after the Fed began to aggressively raise rates and economic activity slow. That's bringing Ryan LeMann. He's an advisor to the Board of Directors at Securrency Capital. Ryan, welcome to the show. What kind of number are you looking for from the data later today and what is it going to take to get the Fed maybe to take a bit of a breather? Well, first of all on the unemployment side we don't expect any massive change. Americans and working are working with the American economy is firing on all cylinders and what's really striking is the number of Americans who have taken two full-time jobs at the same time. It's the all-time highs of 440,000 jobs. So basically this might be concerning because Americans are struggling to meet and meet so they need more than one job to do it but this shows you that unemployment is really strong. The Fed, you have it, they said it, stop looking for a Fed pivot. It is not happening. This is off our radar for the next three months at least. We're not looking at the Fed pivot at least for the next three months. Okay. In terms of what the market's pricing, we have a chart that tells the story about 2022, 2023 and 2024. We're pricing in rate cuts for both of these years. So one line here is for 2023 and the other one is for 2024. We're seeing the market apply change and the Fed rate. Scott Minor talks about a Fed that's not going to stop until something breaks. What if something breaks before the three months horizon that you just laid out? Would the Fed pivot in a situation like that and made its time to start positioning for that from now? Well it's not within our forecast or projections that something will break in the next three months. We do expect something to break in the next potentially 12 months. All things equal. Things are changing quite quickly and something has to break to control inflation. Inflation is the worst thing that can happen to economy. Again, I said it before, I prefer to have something broken or recession over inflation any day. Alright, with that in mind, where is something going to break? This financial accident that clearly a lot of actors in the financial markets are expecting, where in your opinion is that most likely to come through? Is it going to be in liquidity? Is it going to be in foreign exchange markets? Where is it going to be? I mean in Europe, that's what we expect. Something will break in Europe, whether it's a large Swiss bank or another financial institution or something else. Something during winter time in Europe will break and this will have implication on the US and the rest of the world. In the US we're closely looking at default rates and I've shared with you the graphs. Things are still very low, very controllable. On the funding side, things are very calm. The VIX is around 30. It's really a very slow D-Risking that we're seeing and everyone should continue D-Risking as we speak. But again, something will break in Europe. So how does that translate into positioning? Right? Because I know you haven't made any big changes, but right now what are some of the highlights from asset allocation as you go into the you know the remaining period of the year? 50% cash which has been our recommendation since April. That position has completely outperformed anything else because the majority of it is in US dollars, Swiss francs, Swedish Corona, Brazilian real and a few other currencies.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,393,2022-10-07 04:23:49

Private equity is the best inflation hedge out there nothing else hedges for inflation like private equity and then there are pockets of stock markets that we can look at one of them is around here currencies are pecked to the dollar one budgets or pluses and oil exporting energy has a price let's remember that so stocks here will outperform what about the expectations for earnings in the US versus you know the golf because on the one hand I look at what's coming through from Samsung and AMD overnight I mean those are shockers I mean AMD missing by a billion dollars that's made a bit of a flavor of what's to come are the expectations more realistic in the golf or they have also catching up to do well in Europe and the US it's mainly on the chip side on the manufacturing side because the cost of goods has increased for these suppliers so again we talked about it I think in May that we see margins compressing and we're seeing it today in the golf we do not have this issue it is not a manufacturing economy it is an energy exporting economy and everything is based on that and everything revolves around that hence we don't see any compression in earnings we could we could we will continue to see dividends paying and we do think out performance the dollar will remain strong over the next three to six months commodities short commodities X energy because again the strongest dollar will affect the eventually yeah but it's good news for the golf it's good news for the United States because they can contain inflation but it's really bad news for the rest of the world and it could break an economy or two do you think that there's enough momentum now for more countries to come together and to reach some kind of international accord especially as it sit down in New York for some of the IMF World Bank deliberations well that's why I keep saying all things equal things might change there might be an accord somewhere an agreement a political move that would change the course of things the US is in a good position the golf is in a good position emerging markets that have currency spec to the dollar who export energy are in a good position all other emerging economies are in a very bad position Ryan always a real pleasure thank you very much for stopping by that's the security capital advisor to the board of directors and a good friend of the program Ryan LeMann so much more to come on this show this is Bloomberg what do you think of when you think of a battery for most it's what we use to power devices for both work and play and maybe even your car over the past few decades they've gotten way more powerful long-lasting and affordable but all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do as we drive to a increasingly renewable power driven grid we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in it's a multi trillion dollar opportunity and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here how we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,394,2022-10-07 04:27:57

Credit Suisse is set to be seeking an outside investor for a spin-off of its advisory and investment banking businesses. So, to say that the advisory and deal-making teams, along with the leveraged finance students, are being targeted. Credit Suisse's investment bank has racked up huge losses, played a role in some of its biggest scandals. AMD fell in late trade after its preliminary third quarter sales misprojection by more than $8 billion. Revenue in the period was about $5.6 billion giving an early peak at numbers expected in the coming weeks. Like its peers, AMD blames the PC market for hurting sales, citing weaker demands and a build-up of inventory in the supply chain. Bloomberg has been told a hedge fund run by Sight Hyder, sort about 19% in September that lifts returns for the $4.3 billion high-dirt Jupiter fund to about 274% year-to-date nearly quadrupling its previous best-ever annual performance. Leverage rates trading is at the heart of the British high-dirt performance. That's quite something. And that is your Bloomberg Business Flash.

12170," Twitter's case against him, giving the party's three weeks to close the $44 billion deal. Samsung reports its first profit drop since 2019, while AMD misses projections by more than a billion, it underscores the depth of the global PC and memory chip downturn. And US President Joe Biden says he's disappointed with the surprise op-ed plus decision to slash oil production, but there is no decision yet on how exactly the US is going to respond. Let's circle back to the markets in Asia with Annable-Drulers in Hong Kong. So Annable, how has the picture evolved? Well, we're still risk of use efforts. We head into the afternoon session. This is really down to those headlines that we had from Fed officials basically reinstating this need to continue with rate hikes in the months ahead to try and tame inflation. So that's really coming across in the bond space as we head into the afternoon, given the moves that we had in treasuries, a lot of selling pressure, particularly in the 10 year. Now, what else are watching this morning? Not only we're seeing a flat dollar, but still some weakness in the currency market, but particularly weakness in the equity space as well. Not just about what we had from Fed officials, of course, the all-important jobs report coming up, but the other factor are watching as well is what we're seeing in the chip space because we had Samsung also AMD both of those chip companies reporting disappointing earnings. That's certainly a signal to investors of what we could see in corporate earnings that are just around the corner. So we're seeing the likes of the TIEX here leading the sell off down 1.2%. But overall, it has been a fairly positive week for the MSCI Asia-Pacific index. If you change on now, we can take a look at it on a 30-year basis. We actually typically see returns of just over 2% use of in the fourth quarter. And then we're seeing a big drop in Chinese EV stocks in Hong Kong. Why is that? And how could it impact the open of mainland markets on Monday? Yeah, you said. So this is actually coming through on a report that we had Lee Auto, essentially one of its models could have seen weaker than expected orders. So that's certainly sending a lot of jitters into the rest of the car makers. They've already been buffered by a range of other negative headlines. You had Warren Buffett, for instance, reducing his stake in BYD. Also, concerns around expensive valuations. So this sector was once one of the brightest spots in China's markets. But not so over the past few months, we've really seen a lot of declines for this industry in general. But you just asked about how we're setting up for the mainland open on Monday. If you change on now, it's actually been, again, quite a positive week for Chinese assets that are trading in the offshore market. You can see here, gains across the board for those that are traded in Hong Kong at the top also in New York. And then what we're seeing in the offshore, you might as well, it is looking at its biggest rally now since May, which is interesting because it does alleviate a little bit of the pressure on the PVOC. But still, there are those external factors, even though we've had some moves here to the upside. How long can it last? You said when you've got other factors that are still going on, like COVID-0, issues in the property sector, tensions with the West. Yep. A lot to keep in mind there. Thank you for helping us run through it. That's the end of our droolers there. That's certainly the energy markets. They're a big story all week. Now, as we look back, yes, crude oil is heading for its biggest weekly gains. It's March, DROPIC plus signal. It's cutting output from November. The Biden administration's top energy advisor, Al-Mos Hoekstein, says that they're working with private companies, allies, and the strategic petroleum reserve to limit the fallout. He spoke with Bloomberg about what they're doing to maintain oil supply and bring down prices. We think it was a mistake. One, it's not substantiated by energy markets, by the global economy, or by any other metric. It was unnecessary at this time. Prices are already elevated. There was no real, imminent threat of a major collapse in prices that would necessitate a cut. I understand that, you know, I've even watched OPEC for a long time. There's a difference between what they announce and what they actually do. OPEC's quotas are under producing their quotas by more than the two million barrel cut that they've announced. So, let's see if this actually has any impact whatsoever in actual production numbers. We are going to continue to work at home and with our allies. So, one, we're going to work with our U.S. companies to ensure that they continue to increase the oil supply.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,396,2022-10-07 04:37:00
12171," production numbers. We are going to continue to work at home and with our allies. So, one, we're going to work with our U.S. companies to ensure that they continue to increase production and make sure that we have the refining capacity. We're down a couple of refineries due to some accidents and maintenance to make sure that we have enough inventory along the east coast and parts of the Midwest and the west coast to make sure that we have supplies and we're going to continue to focus on bringing down prices and to that end we have still some work to do on the SPR. Okay, almost there's a lot to unpack there. So, one of the reasons that OPEC talked about doing this was in essence to incentivize spare capacity. Higher oil price now to get more oil out of the ground because if not it's going to stay in the ground and there will be a shortage. If there is some truth to that why not take that view with U.S. producers? Why go to your allies? We have oil here that we can get out. Why not pick up the phone to oil production companies and say, guys, what can we do to get you to produce more? Alex, there's an assumption based in your question that we're not doing that. For the last, even publicly, for the last several months, we have had conversations with the leadership of almost every major oil producing in the United States. Told them, what do you need to be incentivized to increase production? We've had that honest conversation. They have what they need. They do not need anything else. I've had this conversation with them. But I think, honestly, if we talk to the industry, they would point out that it's the threat of regulation down the road that's the issue. Alex, I take issue with that. I don't think that that's actually accurate. I think, in fact, if you look at where the, you know, it's always about where you put your money, capex has increased among the major producers of the United States this year. They're increasing production. They announced those increases in capex just several months ago, but it takes time for that to materialize in production. We've seen them increase production. We know that the projection is for them to increase production into 2023, first couple of quarters of 2023. They have what they need. I was almost hoaxing the special presidential coordinator for global infrastructure and energy security. Let's get more on the regional implications with Fahid Iqbal, the head of Middle East strategy at Credit Suisse. Fah, thank you for making it to the program. Actually, I mean, you're a reaction then to what happened at OPEC+. And a potential retaliation from the US? So, I think it is interesting that you've seen a larger than expected cut announced. Obviously, in reality, the cut isn't going to be that full 2 million that they announced. I mean, the underproduction means it's going to be probably less at most 1 million. And I think it's also interesting seeing the headlines this morning about our AMQ's pricing not being increased. Which I think speaks a lot of the, I guess, the aggression with which Saudi Arabia wants to stabilize the oil market. Clearly, they're providing support to oil prices. But from our perspective, their moves aren't sufficient to really drive a sustained upward rally. So, in the near term, we think oil prices, the downside is limited. They certainly scope for spikes in the oil price as we head into this winter period, primarily coming from Europe and the reaction from the potential reaction from Russia in response to EU price gaps. But there is certainly still, in our view, more downside risks to oil than there are, than there are upside. Even though there's two way risks. Yeah. Downside is for us bigger. All right, with that in mind, you look at valuations on the Saudi Delta, which is something that you spend a considerable amount of time on. And even though we've come off some of the hierarchy levels, you're saying there's still a reason to be cautious. And there's a strong correlation between Brent Crude and some of the recent price momentum, which historically hasn't always been the case. Well, that correlation really only picks up whenever you have elevated oil price volatility. That's when the correlation really picks up. And you're right, historically, there isn't generally that stronger movement in oil and to dowel. But these days, with the high levels of implied oil volatility, you are seeing that correlation begin to kick in again. And for us, we are a little bit cautious near term. I mean, as much as we love the outlook for Saudi Arabia and the GCC, especially for next year, over the next three odd months, I mean, keeping in mind that as a house view, we are underweight equities. We are taking a more cautious position.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,397,2022-10-07 04:41:19
12172," especially for next year, over the next three odd months, we are taking a more cautious positioning. We think it's better to adopt a watch and weight mode, especially with Saudi having tested some key support levels. Our technical analysts have pointed out that's a pretty critical one. We are going to significantly lower level, maybe down to about 9,400. That, for me, would really open up a more interesting valuation opportunity in Saudi Arabia. It would for us be a much better opportunity to re-enter the market. You make the point that EM institutional investors are massively underweight on the Gulf. And so for that to get re-balanced into plays like Gulf Banks, is that sort of at the top of your buying list? I think it would be focused on the large caps. So your petrochemicals and your banks, I think, would be the first port of call. And that as investors become a little bit more comfortable with the region, they'll start looking at the other names as well. But banks would definitely be high on that list, especially since I think if you compare the Gulf banking sector with other emerging markets, I think it's definitely positioned for relatively better defensiveness. I think it provides a better, you know, for one of a better, for you, safe harbor for a lot of investors versus banking sectors and other regions. I mean, that was just the fire alarm, I believe, that went off. And it went on and off, so hopefully it stays off. If it goes on again, we'll deal with that as it comes. Just in terms of your Egypt call as well, because you've done a lot of writing and research on that front, we're expecting the IMF deal to come through any moment. The reserves tell a story of relative resilience. What are we going to get from the meetings in New York? So for us, we're really looking for a couple of things to give us a better sense of comfort with the outlook of Egypt. The number one problem is really plugging the balance of payments gap that Egypt has. Things like the fiscal deficit, obviously it's on the right track, it's improving, it's manageable, it could be better. But for us, the real concern really is on balance of payments, especially the trade deficit on the non-oil side, which is deteriorated significantly. There needs to be policies addressing economic activity domestically, especially with the private sector, which has been in a pretty poor state the last three years at least. And then finally, we need to really see a sustainable framework for the Egypt image. I mean, we've talked a lot about the potential for depreciation and devaluation. We expect Egypt to settle somewhere around the 22 mark. This is by year end. This is in the next, I would say, three to six months. It's difficult to put a time frame because I think once the IMF program does come out and we would expect there to be a framework for Egypt, we suspect that will involve Egypt coming in somewhere around that level. But it needs to be a sustainable framework that allows for flexibility in the currency. Otherwise, what's the point? You're just going to find yourself another couple years down the road needing devaluation again. And then once the devaluation happens to those kinds of levels, is the carry trade going to come back to the forefront? We think that's something that's not coming back anytime soon. No, I think it certainly can come back to the forefront. I just don't think it's going to have the level of importance that it had in previous years because it became really the be all and end all in Egypt, especially as far as investments are concerned. And it was easy money. So I think that level of importance for it will fade, but certainly there should be opportunities to re-enter it again. We are waiting for the jobs data later in the day from the United States. The Fed made it very clear that at the moment they're not going to deviate from what they think they need to do to bring inflation back on the control. Where is the risk of a financial accident in the Gulf as those rates rise and as maybe the spreads come under pressure? Well, I guess the problem would be if we have a much more hawkish Fed than we anticipate. I mean, we've got about another 150 bips worth of rate hikes forecast in for the Fed, 50, 50, then 25, 25 with the next few meetings.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,398,2022-10-07 04:45:30
12173," 150 bips worth of rate hikes forecast in for the Fed, 50, 50, then 25, 25 with the next few meetings. And it's been an unusually fluid situation with regards to our forecast for the Fed. I think it has been for the street in general. But if we see a much more resilient inflation level, if we see the labor market in the US holding up much more strongly than anticipated requiring the Fed to hike a lot more, then that's something which obviously the rate hikes come in immediately into the region over here as well. That would certainly start the way on economic activity here. But fantastic to get your analysis at the end of the week. It's a 5-naked body head of Middle East strategy at Credit Suisse. Have a fantastic week, that's 5-naked body. So much more to come, this is Bloomberg. We have to be able to give our customers vehicles, you know, that are their primary vehicles that are EVs, and to be able to do that, we need to have range and infrastructure, and we need to remove the pain points. And so that's what we're doing. We have to be able to do that, we need to have range and infrastructure, and we need to remove the pain points. Turkey's president and Armenia's prime minister have held their first talks in 13 years, part of a push to mend diplomatic relations that have been sour for years. Someone foxman isn't though off a more. So Simone, what would the implications be of warming relations between these two countries? I mean, the ripple effects are going to be extensive. Right, and particularly here, we're potentially seeing an increasing role for Turkey and moderating disputes in Eastern Europe in a place where Russia has traditionally held the key roles. So this meeting, a very important, probably the most recent manifestation of years worth of efforts to try and restore diplomatic relations between the two countries at a time when we're seeing renewed fighting between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh territories. Now, traditionally, Russia has been the key mediator, and that Turkey has supported Azerbaijan. But we've been watching President Erdogan flex his diplomatic muscle. He's been on a reconciliation tour in the Gulf. Now, he may be doing it again in terms of this Armenia Azerbaijan dispute for which there are other talks ongoing, all of this, something that could aid him in his effort to be reelected in elections that have to happen by next June. And then you were sanctioned seven Iranian officials in the meantime as protests around the Islamic Republic of Raid-John. What's the latest there? Yeah, this is the latest manifestation as well of the stronger Biden administration response that we have seen. Compare this with the Obama administration response which Biden had a front seat to back in 2009 when there were green moves and there were green movement protests. That's what they were called. They were very massive protests. We're seeing a very strong line from the Biden.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,399,2022-10-07 04:50:05
12174," 8-2 back in 2009 when there were green movement protests. That's what they were called. They were very massive protests. We're seeing a very strong line from the Biden administration, including sanctioning some ministers. Also important to pay attention to, in sort of the limited information, we're getting out of Iran about how these protests are developing. The death of a 16-year-old teenager named Nika Sakharami. He burned her headscarf and then disappeared. Her body was discovered by her family identified 10 days later. Our team has done some great reporting about the role of women, young women, not just Gen Z, but also even teenagers in these protests. And I think that the death of this woman, which is increasingly fanding the flames of these protests, part of that thread that we're going to be paying a lot of attention to as these protests seem to be moving forward. And then to markets, we have new signs that the Middle East IPO boom isn't slowing down anytime soon. Just with the jingle in the background there as well, can you explain that for us? Well, I can't explain the jingle in the background. Maybe it's similar to your alarm situation, but I can't explain the ECM boom. Julia Feready crunched the numbers for us. 2022 could be the second best year for listings on a dollar basis, only second to 2019 when we had the Aramco IPO. $16 billion has been raised in the Middle East so far this year. Compare that to $18.3 billion in Europe. I'm going to come back to you, Yusuf, but I wonder whether or not the Middle East could surpass Europe in terms of the overall dollar value that it raises in IPO is what, how enormous would that be? It would be massive, Simone. Thank you very much. Simone Foxman at the Cardiff Finance Center in Doha. I don't understand what's up with all the alarms on this program today. First with a fire alarm here. Now, something else happening there in Doha. But on the note of alarms, also now a note out on the red headlines. This one from Credit Suisse, they're offering to buy back debt securities of up to three billion Swiss francs. The beleaguered Swiss lender is, of course, in focus in terms of its ongoing efforts to try and restructure the bank. The expectation was that they would come up with a new vision again by the end of the month. There was a lot of speculation about which parts of the business it would spin off. Year-to-date, the Credit Suisse talk has been absolutely pummeled. But there have been some signs of life here over the last five training sessions where up from the years lows, which are also record lows, up about 6.1%. And we'll see how the market digest this latest announcement of a buying back of debt securities of up to three billion Swiss francs. The coverage continues. This is Bloomberg.

The Sprite predictions of a lackluster holiday shopping season, the announcements suggest the online retailer expect steady demand even with shoppers back in stores and facing the highest inflation in decades. Pelleton is laying off a significant number of employees for the fourth time this year, along with other reductions and operating expenses. The fitness company is cutting its workforce by roughly 500 globally. Pelleton had already slashed more than 4,000 jobs since February as it tries to turn itself around. Netflix will deb you one of its major film releases in the US theaters a month before the movie begins streaming online. The upcoming a glass onion and knives out mystery will run in cinemas for one week and late November through major chains including AMC, Rigal and Cidemark. The deal is seen as a win for Netflix which is looking for ways to boost post-pandemic revenue. Plant enough Netflix, that's for sure. EU leaders are set to gather for the second day of their informal meeting in Prague where they're expected to clarify plans for a cap on natural gas prices. Let's get more with Leigh Ann Garen's from our London headquarters. Leigh Ann, so I mean the discussions have taken on a much more stronger tone and we've got something more tangible. What is expected today? EU leaders are continuing to hash out how they're going to implement this and on Wednesday we also heard from the European Commission President that was Ursula Bondaline once again saying that they want to put this cap on prices but she didn't give very many details on how this was actually going to go about but she did get support from President Emmanuel Macron of France and of Olaf Scholz but once again the war in Ukraine is really causing this energy crisis and as we do enter the winter months we do see a lot tighter market but the EU do all have to agree on a way to implement this plan because that's the way they'll get backing from it but we don't know that plan until October when they meet again. And then what about the UK? I mean where are the gas shortage mitigation plans? What's at stake and what is the response? Pretty dire news so the UK's got a warning from the National Grid which is our operator here and they are warning of three hour blackouts on calm cold days here in the UK and once again this is because we have a tight energy supply at the moment heading into winter they have said that even though they warning of blackouts to come that it is unlikely but they are putting these measures in place hypothetically in case something like that does happen however we did hear from Liz Trusses at this meeting in Prague she's met on the sidelines with Emmanuel Macron and the Prime Minister is insisting that we do have good energy supplies here in the UK and we can get through the winter which is good news but emergency measures could be triggered too and that could include firing up reserve cold generators that we have in this country so a lot happening here but we'll see how those plans in Prague go ahead.

12176, parents is going to be of course coming through with coverage throughout the morning. I want to get to the cross asset board briefly and get you an overview of where we stand with risk appetites is the anxiety that is still very much weighing ahead of the jobs report. We have a choppy low volume session quite a bit of pain coming through from PC and memory chip heavyweights. Let's flip the board and talk about credit suites as well. The transactions are consistent with our proactive approach of managing our over our liability composition. They're gonna buy three billion francs of its own debt. This is Bloomberg. My grandfather got into the mutual fund business because the average investor could not get a diversified stock portfolio and it was too dangerous to put you know your entire savings in it just a couple of companies. So the mutual fund was created to give a diversified expert management at a reasonable price. Today we have a phenomenon where companies are waiting much longer to go public and so in 2000 the average company went public after three years. Now companies are waiting nine to ten years because there's so much money available in the private markets. As a matter of fact there are half the number of public companies that there were in 2000 and there's five times the number of private equity back companies. So just from an investible universe you look at the private markets and it's you know significantly bigger. So the question is that return that used to be captured in the public markets is now captured in the private markets. But the problem is you know is you're really tied up for a long time when you invest in a private equity fund and so trying to figure out a way to solve the same problem my grandfather was trying to solve which is how do you bring those returns responsibly the democratization of the of the private markets to the retail investors and I describe it as a bit of like running with scissors. This is a great tool if you use it appropriately and so we're focused on trying to figure out responsibly bringing it in to the average investor. Good morning this is Bloomberg daybreak here up I'm Danny Burger in London and these are the stories that set your agenda. No pivot no ambiguity. Fed officials keep hammering the message with Mr. Waller and cash Carrey adding their voices today's job report will be key stocks are read ahead of that data disquiet in DC while the White House scrambles respond to OPEX dramatic output cut Joe Biden warns Russia's threat to use nuclear weapons is real deal or no deal Elon Musk Twitter trial is postponed paving the way for his take over the company but debt financing could scupper the deal.

12177," Child is postponed. Paving the wafer is take over the company, but debt financing could scupper the deal. We'll just moments ago, breaking lines coming from credit suites, credit suites putting out a press release saying that they are offering to buy back debt securities of up to three billion Swiss francs. So why are they doing this? Let me read to you this line coming from their release. They say the transactions are consistent with our proactive approach to managing our overall liability composition and optimizing interest expense and allowing us to take advantage of market conditions to repurchase debt at attractive price. Too long didn't read the main message of that their debt is much cheaper. They're buying it back, reducing liability at a time when folks are worried about liquidity at credit suites founded or unfounded. Otherwise, they are stepping back into this market, buying up the debt that is now cheaper. Again, as we continue to watch the concerns swirl around credit suites before their October 27th update on strategy. So that's the latest on credit suites will keep you up to date on any more breaking lines coming from them. But in the meantime, let me show you what this equity market is doing because we have had the parade of fed officials coming to crash your fed pivot party. We heard from cash. Cari, we heard from Waller, we've heard from Lisa Cook for the first time staying on message. They are hiking and they are keeping levels at restrictive rates. They are not going to undo this next year. So we are looking at equities negative this morning before a non-farm payroll that might add to this picture. The VIX it closed about 30 yesterday. Again, it had been above 30 for a couple consecutive days. It drops below it. It goes back above. One trader out there even betting that the VIX would get to 150 by March of next year. It doesn't need to get to 150 for it to pay off, but it shows some of the bearishness potential hedging around Armageddon in this S&P 500 index. European stocks, those are off this morning as well. There are some concerns in the tech sector. AMD, the US chipmaker, missing pretty heavily on their earnings by about a billion dollars of tech underperforming some Samsung news as well. We will talk to Annabelle about that. Now, when you look at a cross asset picture, this is steady this morning. Again, we are waiting for non-farm payrolls. Why would you really put on any big macro positions considering that could really move the dial? Yeah, and slightly stronger, but it is around $145.145.02. That's just inches away from that level where the last intervention was. That was at $145.90. So we're not too far from that. Brent crude hanging pretty tight. The call is $400 a barrel are stacking up after that OPEC cut. What would that mean? Not just for these oil markets, but for inflation as a whole if oil goes back to $100.00 the barrel. All right, let's get to our other top stories. Anna reporters from around the world. Simon Flint's going to join us for a US jobs preview. That important data that hits at 1.30 pm UK time. For our Biden-Russia update, we have Rebecca Chung Wilkins and Annabelle Jullars is going to look at the action in Asia markets and chip stocks. So let's start with that hotly anticipated US jobs reported. It's due out later today. It certainly has the potential to tip the scales towards another jumbo fed rate hike this month. The economy is expected to have added 255,000 jobs in September while the average hourly earnings are expected to rise by 0.3% month over month and 5.1% from a year ago. Let's get to Bloomberg. Simon Flint on this. So Simon, I mean, we typically see folks getting job numbers wildly wrong. That's what we've seen over the past two years. What are we expecting from this report? Well, I'm sure I'll be wide, widely wrong as well. If I had to guess, I think it would come in a bit softer than consensus. So something closer to 200,000. Now, the reason for that is that we've seen some fairly weak business surveys recently on employment plus there's some kind of residual seasonality in September. So I think it will be slightly soft and that should be somewhat positive both for equities and bonds. Yeah, it does seem like equities are just waiting for there to be cracks in this jobs market in order to rally. Simon, I was really struck by cash Cari speaking yesterday about this idea that yeah, we might see failures in the global economy, but that's capitalism. We don't exist here at the Fed to help bail out the American economy. I mean, these are really stark words from man who not too long ago was one of the biggest doves. Are there any doves left at the Fed?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,403,2022-10-07 05:07:19
12178," the American economy. I mean, these are really stark words from man who not too long ago was one of the biggest doves. Are there any doves left at the Fed? I guess the short answer is no. There were some glimmers of light last week. We saw Williams talking about how a domestic demand had already started to slow. Brainards said that at some stage at least there would be two way risks. But you're right. Other than that, the Fed is absolutely laser focused on bringing down inflation. So there are very, very few doves cause to kind of to pull on to for the markets to hope. And actually, it was one of the reasons why even if the jobs market data comes in a little bit soft, the impact on the market probably won't be that significant. Okay, Simon. Thank you very much. Yeah, that drum beat continues. Bloomberg, Simon Flint, giving us the latest on all the US eco stories. Now, speaking of the US, Joe Biden has said that the country is worried that Russian president Vladimir Putin's threats to use nuclear weapons are real and could lead to Armageddon. Let's dive deeper into the story and bring in Bloomberg's Rebecca Chung Wilkins. Rebecca, is this the US shifting its position on on the risk of Putin turning to nuclear weapons? Well, we have seen these quite strident remarks from Biden really underscoring the reality that Putin might turn to chemical, biological, even nuclear weapons in Ukraine. And it is a contrast with the comments that we heard from Jake Sullivan, the National Security Advisor just last week that stressed that these comments and remarks from Putin were really in a line of other similar threats that we've seen. And so there is a bit of a sort of difference there. And of course, we know that Biden historically has made some rhetorical gaps. However, saying that we are seeing a real risk that Putin may turn to increasingly extreme or desperate measures, of course, it's a nearly daily pressure in losses and defeats for the Russian side and the war with Ukraine. We've started to see some criticism for progress of the war in state media coming through. And of course, 300,000 men trying to flee, can possibly be called up to join the Russian army. And so there is increasing pressure for Putin to take action. There's a really remarkable story about those Russians trying to seek asylum in that remote island off of Alaska. Rebecca, we'll have you later in the show. Thank you so much. Bloomberg's Rebecca Chung Wilkins, keeping us up to date there. Now, let's turn to the latest in the twist in terms of the Twitter saga. And there was a partial victory for Elon Musk. The billionaire's court case against Twitter, it was delayed by the Delaware judge until October 28th. So this gives both parties more time to contemplate a deal that, of course, after Elon Musk revived his $44 billion offer. Renewed hope of a deal is pushing Twitter shares higher. You can see, they're at $49, not quite at that $54.20 level that the deal would happen at. So still skepticism that it would happen. And that really just reinforced by debt financing being one of the biggest nagging points, Elon Musk's lawyers, of course, writing to Twitter saying that this deal is contingent on debt financing being available. We know some folks have pulled out to follow no longer as one of the people who would provide financing. And it's a very difficult market right now. So again, Elon Musk saying that this all is contingent on debt financing, Bloomberg reporting that this is one of the biggest sticking points on whether this deal can go ahead. Now, let's turn to Asia stocks. They're dropping for the first time in four days. Let's bring in Annabelle Jules and Hong Kong. Annabelle, what's driving the moves today? Well, I mean, all those factors you were just talking about at the top of Danny, really down to what we're hearing from the Fed officials that are coming through reinforcing that we must continue this fight to reign in inflation and stick with the path of tightening. So you're seeing that really reflected in the moves that we have in the treasury space or the bond space rather given those moves that we did have in the treasury throughout the session. currency space. We're seeing the dollar looking a little bit flat, but also seeing a lot of moves across the equities picture. We've just had tie one going into the break. And that's where we're also seeing another sector very much in focus today. A lot of moves down to the results that we had Danny from Samsung and then also AMD.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,404,2022-10-07 05:11:34
12179," and that's where we're also seeing another sector very much in focus today. A lot of moves down to the results that we had Danny from Samsung and then also AMD overnight. Okay, Annabelle, thank you very much. Annabelle, Julia's there in Hong Kong. And yeah, those AMD moves really fascinating. We also saw Samsung as well taking some pain after a miss of the chip sector of the tech story really under threat at this moment. Well, coming up in the program, we're going to get more on how the Fed's hawkish stance is turning markets. We hear from speaker after speaker saying, not, uh, they ain't going to ease next year. We'll discuss that next. This is Bloomberg. A digital first approach for the future work is where the industry is going to be. And all companies will be heading. What's the future work not be at home or in the office, but in the metaverse instead? There's that word metaverse. Good. Well, how are you doing? When I think about the metaverse, I think about immersive experiences that have a sense of actor presence. Wow, look at this. This is me. The metaverse is projected to become over a trillion dollar market by the end of this decade. And whether you know it or not, you'll probably be working there in the future. We're moving into a world where we're going to be interacting with computers with our bodies. This is definitely trippy. I think the adoption curve is going to be slow. It's weird, a real floaty thing right now. Oh, look at you. You have no legs. It's kind of a fun world. And we're just at the very beginning of a very long journey.

With a music plays on, BSO season sponsor Bank of America. Now that pivot narrative for the Fed, it's quickly morphed from a Fed that stops because inflation is vanquished to a Fed that stops because financial stability is at risk. It's a model that might look something along the lines of the Bank of England's intervention last month to stop the guilt chaos. Scott Miner, he's just the latest to put this forward. This idea yesterday, the chief investment officer over at Guggenheim saying that the end of Fed tightening will come when something breaks and cracks are forming. But already, the officials are pushing back on this version of the pivot narrative. I believe we have tools in place to address any financial stability concerns. And we should not be looking to monetary policy for this purpose. The focus of monetary policy needs to be on one day fighting inflation. I fully expect that there are going to be some losses and there are going to be some failures around the global economy as we transition to a higher interest rate environment. And that's the nature of capitalism. Joining us now is Nika Guggen, a research director at Wisdom Tree and Nika, thanks so much for joining. Hi, guys, Shadani. I mean, those lines from CashGarri. This is a man who used to be one of the biggest doves over at the Fed, basically saying if something breaks, that's just capitalism. What do you make about this? Well, you know, we've seen this week turn out to be the case of bad news becoming good news. And that's really building the case of a Fed pivot. But, you know, the messaging that we've got from the Fed overnight clearly is echoing a set of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,405,2022-10-07 05:15:43
12180, case of bad news becoming good news and that's really building the case of a fed pivot. But you know the messaging that we've got from the fed overnight clearly is echoing a sense of the very very hawkish stance on monetary policy. So you know it looks like nothing is going to give and today's jobs data alongside you know the CPI we're going to get next week I think is going to provide a more definitive path on where we are headed in monetary policy. Do you trade on those things though for example if jobs that say comes in a little bit weaker is that a reason to buy equities let's say? Well I think it would be a very it would you know try to it would fuel a more bullish stance for equities and obviously along that alongside if we do get a weaker inflation print that would again be another case for a revival. But you know for now I think the key thing is you've got this tug of war between the markets not believing the fed and the fed pushing aggressively to try and convince the markets that we are sticking to our stance so it's going to be interesting to see. Yeah I mean it feels like a strange time to try to be bullish in this equity market because you are fighting the fed and the mantra of course used to be don't fight the fed. So what's going to happen if at the moment markets now see a cut coming next year what's going to happen if all the sudden markets need to price that out what will that look like? What's going to be interesting Danny because we're also being we're also entering Q3 earnings season so I think that's going to be a very important catalyst for markets and obviously the way we look at it is earnings expectations right now are extremely high versus where they should be. You know if you take a ballpark quick calculation of the last three times we were in the run up to a recession in 2008 2001 and even 2020 you're looking at an average decline of about 49 percent you know over that time period yet earnings expectations are really high for example in the US you're looking at about $225 when if you take the average of that it should be at about $150 at this point in time. So I think you've got a much more hawkish fed that the market is trying to push back against you've got earnings that are too high that do need to correct so I think you still have a few headwinds that equities are likely to face. This is the thing if we're saying look equities of sold off valuations are good now for using $115 for next year's earnings price to forward earnings it's still very richly priced in that scenario. Absolutely absolutely and you know that's despite the correction that we've seen which has been you know in the mid teens for global equity markets so there is there is a lot of volatility ahead especially for Q3 as we enter the season. And how will all of this change if a cut from OPEC results in a hundred dollar barrel oil how does your outlook change? Well you know they definitely spoke the markets with the decision of two million barrels per day when we were actually anticipating something in the range of up to a million barrels but the important thing to bear in mind is Danny to the two million barrel cut is not from today's levels the two million barrels per day to cut is from the August target production levels. So that's a very important factor the second is as we all know you know most of the members in OPEC have barely been able to reach capacity you know I have barely been able to reach their quotas right now and there are very few that have extra spare capacity such as Saudi you know Russia and the UAE so you're looking at only three members and none of them are willing to pump additional oil despite the pleas from the U.S. And you know the key thing is if you look at positioning positioning net speculative positioning according to CFTC data is one standard deviation below where we were you know in the run up to the oil price crash so we do have significant room to cover up and you know bring prices back up to where they should be. So does that mean that the calls for a hundred barrels a dollar or more Goldman Sachs is higher than that is that overdoing it then? No I wouldn't say so I think I think it's very reasonable to look at prices from there especially for Brent we're around the 90 level Mark so looking at shorts being at an all time high you could get that squeeze and longs have a significant room to actually recover from where they are. No I really love what you write about this you say we might might find ninety dollars a barrel ninety dollars a barrel becoming the new sixty dollars a barrel of course that sixty being what we thought was equilibrium how long then does that last how long is ninety dollars the equilibrium for? No.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,406,2022-10-07 05:20:16
12181," $60 a barrel becoming the new $60 a barrel. Of course, that's 60 being what we thought was equilibrium. How long then does that last? How long is $90 the equilibrium for? Well, for now, Danny, we have a significant amount of under-investment taking place in the oil sector. So you've got this, you know, in this very difficult position where you have this transition happening into, you know, energy into the new energy transition. Yet you have under-investment taking place in fossil fuel, in the fossil fuel industry. You've got OPEC, which controls nearly 45% of the market, not willing to relieve, you know, the significant tightness that we're seeing. So I think it's very difficult right now to see prices going lower from here. I think they are headed higher from this point. How do you factor in a White House that has the midterms to contend with and will likely force them to tap even more the strategic reserves? That is very likely, you know, so far we're just waiting for more information on whether they will continue with, you know, releasing the strategic reserves. But, yeah, that is not going to do enough to relieve the oil price pressure. I think the big thing for oil prices to look at it from the other point of view would be if we do see demand slowing in a very big way going to recession concerns, but that still is going to be very hard to tip over the balance when you're looking at such a strong supply deficit in the market. Well, let's macro this out because I said this to you in the break that Goldman Sachs had put out a piece saying it's OPEC versus the Fed. If the Fed is contending with higher oil prices, does it change their trajectory? Do they need to hike even more for even longer? Well, for the US it's a bit different, right? Because for the US, they aren't that reliant on OPEC's decision and they aren't facing an energy crisis like we are in Europe. So for the US, it's more a case of their own domestic factors that are fueling their internal inflation story, such as the housing industry, such as rents, such as wages. Now, clearly the Fed is onto that narrative where they're trying to tame that demand and that rise of inflation stemming from these factors. So I think from the macro story for Europe, yes, the inflation story gets a lot worse, but as far as the Fed is concerned, they will still be later focused on these tricky factors that are fueling inflation in the US. And you already thought so on the European banking sector? I mean, perhaps not, but every day we get a credit. Sweden's headline, everyone's panic to me. Sure. So you like European banks as a whole? Well, if you look at the European banking sector, since the financial crisis, if you look at their liquidity conditions, they're in a much better situation. I think what we saw over the weekend in the run up to this week was just complete panic on credit Swiss. Specifically on Twitter, too. Especially. I think it just got out of control. And you saw how the week turned out. It was a complete opposite of the way we previously expected and anticipated. So I believe there is still quite a bit of opportunity in the banking sector. But I think the key focus is, if Europe is facing a recession, that is going to impact the banking sector. So from a liquidity standpoint, I don't see much of a concern. But you are going to see the banks being faced with a much more difficult position with a slowdown in growth. Yet at the same time, they do have the advantage of rising yields, which should put their net interest margins in a much more comfortable position. I do wonder if there's, because I do sort of feel like this language around credit Swiss is a symptom of the wider panic about liquidity, market stability. How worried are you about market stability? Again, beyond credit Swiss to the European banking sector, which has a far better liquidity position, are you worried that there's somewhere that we're not really conscious of, kind of like UK pensions that might crack, might have a more significant issue? Yeah, that's a very difficult one. And that is what is fueling that volatility in the markets. What is the next thing that could break? That's what the markets are trying to anticipate.

12182," in the UK having facing this difficult situation with the sudden rise in yields. But I think where we are more focused on these liquidity traps or these possible problems for resurfacing is in Europe. Because Europe is faced with one of the toughest situations where you have weaker growth, a lot higher inflation and a big energy gap to fill. Okay, Enneke, I'm afraid we're gonna have to end it there. Really great catching up with you today. That's Enneke, go to a research director at Wisdom Tree. Now, Samsung reports its first drop since 2019, we're gonna bring you the nerves surrounding the chip sector next. It's Bloomberg.. There is an epic saying in Italy when it comes to family generations that the first generation creates, the second generation expands and the third generation destroys. And that's almost what happened in the Gucci story. So, Hating a Love, you're good. Now I have a much more experience about those who say that love you and tend to stray you. The Gucci family was the strength but also the weakness of the label. The situation became dire with Gucci's finances. They were not able to pay salaries, they were not able to pay suppliers. Gucci's really teetering on the brink of the stage. We have to be able to give our customers vehicles that are their primary vehicles that are EVs and to be able to do that we need to have range and infrastructure and we need to remove the pain points. And so that's what we're doing. Welcome back to Bloomberg Day break here up. Now Samsung has reported its first drop in profits since 2019 on the back of memory chip makers fleecing sharp declines in orders. So, Annabelle, kick it off with Samsung, what did the results look like? Nockle once said Danny it was the first drop in 2019. So operating profit down around $7.7 billion to that missed estimates in the three months ending September and then we also had net rather, yes, operating profit also dropping. But as I said, this is the preliminary results so that's something to take care of or take note of as well because we will actually get the net income and also the details of the divisional performance that will come later in the month but certainly not a great outlook from Samsung and it did follow what we had from AMD overnight as well advanced micro devices that also missed estimates in the third quarter sales to the tune of around $1 billion. So generally this is a broader industry trend, this chip downturn that we hear micron technology kioxia, they're all cutting output to really try and rebalance supply and avert a price crash and it does really underscore the depth of the slowdown if you bring up this terminal chart if we can see it but basically nowhere is this more evident than what we see in a South Korean market which is home to two of the biggest chip makers in the world. This is of course Samsung and SK Heinix and so both of these are really battling this record drop in output.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,408,2022-10-07 05:28:44
12183," the biggest chipmakers in the world. This is of course Samsung and SK Hynix. And so both of these are really battling this record drop in output. Yeah, Annabelle, I'm distracted by two things. One is the video of all the cats and dogs we were just saying, which we don't have to get into that. But the other thing is as you were talking, Samsung moving higher, what's up with this market reaction? Yeah, this is an interesting one because obviously it wasn't great results today. But it does also play into what we're seeing in the Korean one because it is actually a little bit weaker today. We had seen rising over the past few sessions given this expectation possibly of some sort of fed pivot. Of course, that's been quashed. But a high correlation between what we see in the Korean one and the cost be selling. And so that could be a possible move today why we're still seeing those games. But broadly as you can see or you did see, we are still seeing losses across the board and that chart there just showing what I was talking about before that South Korea did report a decline in chip output in August for the first time in more than four years. All right, Annabelle. Thank you very much. Annabelle Joolers there in Hong Kong. And yeah, Samsung might be heading higher but certainly seems some negativity in US text stocks. Of course, AMD missed as well. Coming up, we're going to talk Twitter and the takeover saga continues. This is Bloomberg. There's more activity in the fusion world than ever. And not just in government research labs. There's also an emerging private fusion industry that attracted billions of dollars in capital in recent years. Governments and private investors alike realize that we've got to find a solution that's going to allow us to get to net zero targets. This is one of the hardest but most rewarding problems that humanity could work on. Ultimately, we all want the same thing. We want someone to put electricity on the grid from a fusion power station as quickly as possible. Frankly, the scale of the challenge, 3,000 gigawatts are a fossil fuel to replace. There's not many things that can do that. In fact, there may only be fusion. They can really do that. And while many in the scientific community predict fusion power will take decades, some in the private fusion space, believe we'll get there in just a few years as soon as the 2030s. This is Bloomberg Daybreak with Lake. That's Bloomberg Ray. Welcome to Daybreak Australia. This is Bloomberg Technology. Welcome to Bloomberg The lineup. MUSIC This is Bloomberg Daybreak, here up. I'm Danny Berger in London with the stories. That's at your agenda. No pivot, no ambiguity. Fed officials keep hammering the message with Mr. Waller and Cash Carry adding their voices. Today's job report will be key. Stock spread ahead of that data. Disquiet in DC, while the White House scrambled to respond to OPEX dramatic output cut, Joe Biden warns Russia's threat to use nuclear weapons is real. Debt deal, Credit Suisse offers to repurchase three billion Swiss francs of its own securities, just weeks away from announcing a strategic overhaul. Well, it is Fed Speaker after Fed Speaker this week saying, we are not pausing. We're going to hike rates and we're going to keep them at a restrictive level. Even going so far as Waller, for example, saying that they are not worried about financial stability or rather not that they're not worried about it, but they have other tools to use in order to combat it. It is not going to be the reason that they back off of rate hike. So batting down this idea that inflation is.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,409,2022-10-07 05:33:06
12184," about it, but they have other tools to use in order to combat it. It is not going to be the reason that they back off of rate hike. So batting down this idea that inflation is vanquished and batting down this idea, that liquidity issues will get them to blank. So what are we seeing? We're seeing an equity market that is struggling to find its footing. It really is off the back or really in front of a jobs report that could be the game changer could be moving markets. It is an equity market that really wants to see losses cracks in this labor market in order to rally. We also saw the VIX close above 30. Someone out there is betting on 150 VIX on that could easily just be a hedge, but it's through options that expire in March. Nasak, that's weaker, some issues in the chip sector with AMD and Samsung missing on earnings. Stocks 50 futures, those also weaker as well. Looking cross asset, really pretty steady, not too much going on when it comes to the dollar, when it comes to treasuries. Again, perhaps we're just sort of doing some tables setting ahead of the NFP, non-farm payrolls report. Yeah, and that's pretty steady as well, but it is pretty close to that intervention level 145. 90 was the level at which they last intervened. Brent crude slightly weaker as well. That's down the third of a percent, but it's rallied its most in this week since 2020 after an OPEC that decided to cut by two million barrels a day. So that's the big macro story. The micro story, which everyone is transfixed by, is of course Twitter. Let's get into it because Twitter's court case against Elon Musk. It has been halted by a Delaware judge until October 28th. The idea here is it gives both parties time to complete a deal after must revive to his $44 billion dollar offer. Now, any deal is said to stick on debt financing. Now, our next guest is someone who knows this market very well, and he's been mostly bearish on corporate bonds, but says the market is now cheap. Joining us is Geistier, head of fixed income and credit research at SoftGent. So, Guy, I got about $13 billion in junk and leverage loans to sell you from Elon Musk. What say you? Well, I think it's not now as the right answer. As you said, we are, we have been bearish for most this year since October. I am probably more bullish now that I have been for the last eight months because the market is significantly cheaper, but I do think we have one more leg of widening, and I'm afraid that the Twitter deal will probably be amongst other things, one of the things to push us a little wider over the next four to five weeks. But we've even seen banks really struggling to bring these debt packages to market, LBO debt, whether it be the Citrix debt, whether it be that Apollo back debt that banks ended up shelving. We have Scott Minor talking about the idea that this is one of the cracks showing up in this market. Banks being loaded up with this debt unable to offload it rather. Are you concerned that this is a symptom of a wider problem of wider market fragility? I think it's definitely a symptom of wider market fragility, but the odd thing is that the high-yield market, for example, and to some extent the leverage loan market, but particularly high yield is still relatively expensive in comparison to investment grade. If you think of what we've done since October, it's all been about rates. And early on your program you were talking about rates and what the Fed has been saying, and this year has all been dominated by rates. I think what we're going to see in the next phase is much more concerns about defaults with a slowing economy, and it's the high-yield market which is really going to push wider. So while investment grade is beginning to look attractive, I think high yield certainly has some months of widening ahead of it. How bad does it get then for high-yield guy? Well, one of the basic indicators to think about is the ratio of high yield to investment grade. At the moment that's at around three. Typically three is near the bottom end of the range. Normally when we see the peak of spreads over the cycle, that ratio will be around four. So I think we have probably at least another 200 basis points of widening in terms of high-yield indices. So at around 700 basis points over benchmarks at the moment in Europe, I think we have it yeah, about another 200 basis points of widening to go. See this is the thing that interests me about why anyone would be a track would want to go into high yield debt right now. If triple B is going to be offering me 6% yield, we're, hey, you know, back in June, the highest.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,410,2022-10-07 05:37:34
12185," Why anyone would be a track? Would want to go into high yield debt right now. If triple B is going to be offering me 6% yields, we're, hey, you know, back in June, the highest rated junk bonds, that's what they were yielding. Is there any area of this high yield market that does interest you? Or is it just all about the flight to quality right now? Well, if I were forced to buy triple Bs, I would say that the kind of double B plus area, the crossover would be the most attractive area of the market right now. And I would particularly say shorter dated issues, somewhere in the three to four year area, that's where you're going to have the lowest losses. But I do think that if you look across the investment grade, if you look across the corporate bond markets in Europe, particularly in Europe, it's a single A area which really offers good value at the moment. And we may have seen spreads peak actually in that area already. Hmm. Guy, at what point does it go from just struggles of issuance, slower issuance to a complete freezing of the market? Is that in the horizon at all? I think the real thing you have to worry about is the default forecast which are baked into market expectations. Not so much spreads, but when you have conversations with people about where a default level is going to be, they're typically talking about three to four percent in the cycle. We're twice as high as that in terms of our default forecast. By the end of next year, we think we could be in Europe at default of around 9%. The reason is because you mentioned earlier in your program Samsung and some of the weaker earnings that are coming through, that's going to be a big focus in the Q3 earnings. We're going to start to see companies generating negative operating cash flow. It's going to be true in Q3, Q4. It's going to continue on into next year. And then people are going to be a lot more worried about default. So I think that's really going to be the next trigger in terms of the market coming under pressure. This is so interesting to me, Guy, because we have seen the market kind of just skip over the default cycle and COVID these companies were propped up. Prior default cycles, it was led by energy. Energy is doing okay now. Is there any historical corollary to what you think we're about to see with 9% as you say, default rates in Europe? Well, sure. We haven't, we've only really had two cycles, two default cycles in Europe since the creation of the euro. The first was 2001, 2002. The second was 2007, 2008. Since then, we really have not had a default cycle in Europe as you've been talking about Danny. But the combination of relatively high levels of leverage, a shift in the market towards lower rated credits, particularly in European high yield, and expectations, particularly the profits slow down over the course of 2023. Those are our expectations. These are going to be the pieces which come together to provoke that default cycle. Let's talk about sectors. Where are you most worried? You mentioned tech, you mentioned chip stocks. Where's the stress going to be, Guy? Well, in the European credit markets, there isn't too much tech. So I think where the valuations are most vulnerable at the moment is particularly in the industrial sector. These are cyclical sectors. These are sectors which are going to be more vulnerable to higher energy prices. You've talked about that already on your program. But in a sense, European companies and companies across the world have been isolated or insulated, I should say, from those problems, because their hedges are typically somewhere between four and six quarters. But now they're going to be facing higher prices as hedges roll off from the Q3 earnings figures. So I think this is where we're going to see some of the cracks appearing in terms of the sectors. Are they cracks? Do you think that would be enough to cause the ECB to stop hiking? That's a really good question. I think the reality is, is the ECB probably is going to continue to have to hike in terms of the inflation cycle. But then they're going to be in a little bit of a tricky situation like the Bank of England, which is what do you do in terms of injecting some calm into various parts of the market? But I do think that the hiking cycle is going to have to continue. OK, then what happens if we start to get a default cycle and the hiking cycle is going on, Guy? Well, there's turmoil, particularly in the high-yield market. I mean, I think that the right way to think about it is, you do want to be invested in much more defensive sectors.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,411,2022-10-07 05:42:02
12186," Well, there's turmoil, particularly in the high-yield market. I mean, I think that the right way to think about it is you do want to be invested in much more defensive sectors of the market. You do want to be invested in, again, single-aid credits. We've already talked about that in terms of the European investment, in terms of European markets. I think some of the non-cyclicals offer good value as well. For example, the utility sector, which is widened out a lot on supply this year, to my mind, this is actually one of the sectors, which is a better defensive area. Financials as well, which have been rather higher beta than we would have expected, probably are a relatively good defensive area. So I do think, yes, in the near term, the markets are going to be difficult, particularly investment grade over the next four to five weeks, and then looking further out in terms of high yield. But there will be probably a period within the next, as I say, in high yield, even within the next three to four months, where the valuations are going to start looking really attractive. Okay, Guy, thank you very much. Guy Steer, there had a fixed income and credit research at Sock Jen, great catch-up with you. Enjoy the weekend. All right, now let's get over to the first word news with that is Simone Foxman. Hi, Simone. Hi, Danny. Swedish investigators say evidence points to recent ruptures of Nord Stream gas pipelines being caused by a deliberate act. The Swedish Security Service says its investigation has increased suspicions of sabotage, but did not indicate how the detonations happened, or who might be responsible.

Coming up on the program, EU leaders grapple with the energy crisis they're preparing for talks as a box weigh as whether it imposes a price cap on gas or live in Prague next. British applauding. What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most it's what we use to power devices for both work and play and maybe even your car. To the past few decades they've gotten way more powerful, long-lasting and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in.

12187," is that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity, and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. EU leaders are set to hold talks on the second day of a European summit being held in the shadows of the war in Ukraine. Thursday saw the first ever gathering of the European political community. It's a new forum that includes non-EU countries such as Turkey, the UK, and today the focus returns to energy with European leaders grappling with the price cap on gas. For more, let's get to Bloomberg's Maria today, who's in Prague. She's been covering this summit. Maria, this European political community is, it's a new format for international debate and cooperation. So has this new format achieved anything? Well, Danny, to some extent, the fact that we're here with four to four heads of states and that they were able to gather around the table to talk about the big issues. Russia, Ukraine, security, food, that is already a win, because remember, this is a new concept and this was a trial run. So the optics of this already, you could argue on the diplomatic scene are a win. And by the way, we hear this first edition, the trial run, in fact, will continue in the next country to host this new community. We'll be Moldova now in terms of the action behind the scenes. It also served to get MNMacon and Liss Trust to clarify some issues. Yesterday, the UK Prime Minister, who stayed here for the summit yesterday, she said that Macon is a friend of the UK, that the two countries agreed that the only foe for Europe is Vladimir Putin. And in fact, they also announced the next year they will hold a UK French bilateral summit to talk about a renewed shared agendas. And some extent that was already, well, a cooling down of tensions between the two for both the UK and the French. That is already a win to some extent. Maria, of course, the other issue gripping Europe is the energy problems. Has there been any progress made on a potential solution on potential price caps on gas? Yes, and Danny, that is a question today. Remember, yesterday was about the politics. Today, we go back to the EU27. So this is now a European, European Union format. And this is the only question that really matters. Now, they all agree they want to see prices go down, but they still have not found or gotten to the magic formula. And in fact, yesterday, when I spoke to the Dutch Prime Minister, Mart Ruta, he said, we want a solution. It's not going to come today, but it could come in the near future. So that means potentially in weeks, let's take a look. But you feel here is that there is an overriding willingness to make that happen. That, of course, we will discuss that further between the 27. That will probably lead to decisions not tomorrow, but in the very near future. Of course, we have already done a lot, but we will discuss issues like good price cap work, is the Iberia model something we could replicate? How could we work on joint purchasing? All these issues will be discussed. And that was the Dutch Prime Minister. Of course, Mark Ruta, yesterday speaking to reporters and Prague. And Danny, you know, I think he laid it out very well. We're not going to get a magic solution today, but it could come in the short future. And I think fundamentally he goes to the core issue here, which is what does a price cap look like? There's at least five possible options that I could lay out really on the table, the model, the formula behind this, but they cannot agree for the time being on that magic formula.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,413,2022-10-07 05:50:25
12188," look like there's at least five possible options that I could lay out really on the table, the model, the formula behind this, but they cannot agree for the time being on that magic formula that will work for all of the E27. But to me, it was quite telling yesterday that Mark Ruta said it could come in the short future. That means technically we could be moving closer to a solution by the end of the month because European leaders will meet again now for a formal summit in Brussels at the end of October. Maria, what I'm hearing from you is that there is likely a vigorous debate that will unfold in Prague today behind the scenes of where you are. Maria, great reporting as always. To be a fly in the world today. To be a fly in the organic. Maria, you will be our fly in the wild. I am positive you will get us some lines out of there. All right. Maria, today, oh, there in Prague. She'll be back, of course, throughout programming on the Prague Summit. Now coming up, the Biden administration is hunkering down on its plot to its response or rather it is plotting to respond to the oil production cut by Saudi Arabia and its OPEC plus allies. This is Bloomberg. A digital first approach to the future work is where the industry and all companies will be heading. Click the future work not be at home or in the office but in the metaverse instead. There's that word, metaverse. Good well. How are you doing? When I think about the metaverse, I think about immersive experiences that have a sense of active presence. Wow, look at this. This is me. The metaverse is projected to become over a trillion dollar market by the end of this decade and whether you know it or not, you'll probably be working there in the future. We're moving into a world where we're going to be interacting with computers with our bodies. This is definitely trippy. I think the adoption curve is going to be slow. It's weird, a real floaty thing right now. Oh, look at you. You have no legs. It's kind of a fun world and we're just at the very beginning of a very long journey. It's Bloomberg Daybreak Europe. Now to the US, where Joe Biden has said that he's worried that Russian President Vladimir Putin's threats to use nuclear weapons are real and could lead to Armageddon. Let's dig into this. Joining us now is Bloomberg's Rebecca Chung Wilkins. Rebecca, I mean, we've heard previously the US saying some skepticism as to whether these threats are real. So is this a shifting stance? Yes, we have seen some quite strident remarks for President Biden that really underscoring the likelihood or the possibility, the very real possibility that Putin made her not just a nuclear weapons but possibly chemical or biological weapons. And it is a contrast with comments from Jake Sullivan that we heard just last week, which really placed these threats to use nuclear weapons in the line of the string of other remarks that Putin has made. On the one hand, of course, we do know that President Biden has historically made some rhetorical but-rubs of gaffes in the past. But on the other hand, it is clear that Putin himself is underneath daily",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,414,2022-10-07 05:54:36
12189," As historically made some sort of rhetorical butterabs of gaffes in the past. But on the other hand, it is clear that Putin himself is under a daily rising pressure over defeats in Russia's war in Ukraine. We see, for example, more criticism over how the war is progressing in state media. Of course, there are 300,000 men who have fled Russia trying to escape possibly being called up to serve for the military there. And Ukraine enforces themselves saying that they are increasingly taking back land that has been annexed by Russia. So, Rebecca elsewhere in DC, you also have a Biden administration that, as Bloomberg puts it, has been seething over this OPEC cut. What does it mean for Biden and the White House and the Democrats as we get to the midterms? Absolutely, quite a big week for Biden. Certainly, seems there is some level of bewilderment. Biden himself coming out of that meeting saying he is disappointed, he is looking for alternatives. And the top security, the top energy adviser also saying they were surprised with the outcome. Now, congressional Democrats have sort of posited that potentially a re-ad was trying to time this announcement to create confusion and chaos ahead of the midterms. But the most powerful sort of tool in Biden's arsenal to combat this type of behavior from OPEC is the so-called NOPEC bill. But it's been around for a long time. We hear there aren't plans so far to actually sort of table this to return. And it is a bit of a can of worms. But we could see more discussion of that again going forward. Okay, Rebecca, thank you very much. Turning to China now, our President Xi Jinping is all but certain to secure a third term in power at the Communist Party's Congress this month. Observers will be looking for any indication China might move away from its COVID-0 policy. As well as signs she will continue with this common prosperity drive to narrow the wealth gap. That prosperity, of course, that aim there has roiled the tech in education sectors. Let's bring in Bloomberg's greater China editor, Jenny Marsh. So Jenny, what are we expecting heading into the people's party Congress? You know, I think there's been this idea that in the lead up to the Congress Xi Jinping has been reluctant to make any big changes. So that's meant that China has stuck with common prosperity. But also it's kind of calibrated back a little bit from the common prosperity drive that was really markets last year. So a lot of the Wall Street banks now are projecting that once the Congress has passed, Xi Jinping and his government will have a free hand to take some bolder steps to sort of shore up the economy on an officer in sort of a better investing environment. However, I've run out of the investors who have been burned in China over the past year. It's sort of very reluctant and hesitant to take this advice too much to heart because we haven't had any clear signs from Xi or his government that that is in fact the case. Okay, Jenny, thank you very much. Bloomberg's greater China editor there, Jenny Marsh. Let's go over some of these lines that we got about an hour ago on Credit Suisse. Credit Suisse is offering to buy back their debt securities up to three billions with Frank. It says it's doing so after the sell off in that debt, so being coming more attractive to buy and at the same time trying to shore up its finances, trying to reduce its leverage levels, this comes ahead of a planned October 27th unveiling of new strategy. So getting their ducks in a row, Credit Suisse offering to buy three billion Swiss francs of its own debt just weeks away from that strategic reserve or strategic review. Sorry, I have strategic reserves on the brain. OPEC Plus, it's out there. It's one of the stories. Anyway, we're going to continue the conversation. Coming up as Bloomberg markets Europe.

12190,". Apple's delaying its next major iPad software update, iPadOS 16, by about a month from September to October. Apple made the decision for a number of reasons, including a still buggy stage manager multitasking interface and an order to link the launch closer to the more similar Mac OS Ventura. Still, it's an unusual move. Since shifting the launches to the fall in 2011, Apple has released its new iPhone and iPad software updates simultaneously each year around September. By staggering the releases, users may find some issues around compatibility with cross-device features like retracting and editing messages in iMessage, the new shared iCloud photo library, and the new feature for transferring FaceTime calls between iPhones and iPads. It will also make it a bit harder for developers to launch apps that run on both the iPad and iPhone that require new APIs and features down to cross iPadOS 16 and iOS 16. Regardless, it was still of course the right move. Stage manager on iPadOS 16 is still quite buggy, I don't find it particularly intuitive, and it's not compatible with most iPads and many third party apps on the app store. The feature clearly needs some more polish. It complaints from consumers about stage manager will now no longer probably overshadow the earlier launch of the iPhone 14.

Listen up, Fed officials keep hammering the message that there's no pivot in sight. Today's payroll report will be key. Chipping away, semiconductor makers weigh on Asia stock futures as Samsung and AMD results disappoint. Plus, disquiet in DC, while the White House scrambles to respond to OPEX dramatic output cut, Joe Biden warns Russia's threat to use nuclear weapons is real. Well, we're just under an hour away from the sort of cash equity trading in Europe. We are looking at a lot of table setting ahead of the non-farm payrolls report, but it is a negative session. We continue to see Fed Speaker. After Fed Speaker really trying to emphasize this message that they are not pivoting, that they are going to hike and they are going to keep rates at restrictive territory. Currently something not helping, we are getting some industrial production figures from Germany for August, rising 2.1 percent year over year. That is a miss. 2.3 percent was the estimate. So some cracks potentially showing up in this European economy with an ECB whose accounts yesterday I should say continue to say that they are going to hike rates as well. They're also hawkish. As is the Bank of Canada. As is basically everyone is they try to contend with a Fed that continues to hike. We are pretty late away from the two freezing highs around the world.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,416,2022-10-07 06:03:59
12191," say that they are going to hike rates as well. They're also hawkish. As is the bank of Canada. As is basically everyone is they try to contend with a Fed that continues to hike. So S&P 500 futures, US futures, they showed a similar story as well. Some deepening sell-offs adding to yesterday is more than 1% sell-off, adding to a VIX that closed above 30 yesterday. There was someone out there, a trader who built bet nearly $1 million that we would get a VIX at 150 by March. Not to say that those options pay off if we get to 150, but it could just be a hedge. In other words, there are some very bearish folks out there. Nasdaq futures, those also down three tens of 1% some stress in tech. In the chip sector, we'll get into that later in the show. But basically AMD and Samsung hurting in their earnings. Let's flip it over. Let's look at the GMM. Not a ton of action cross market. Again, it's this idea kind of shuffling things around ahead of the non-farm payrolls. You probably don't want to take on too much risk ahead of such an event that could really alter things. It really does seem like there needs to be cracks in this labor market to get risk assets really rallying to get them excited that perhaps the Fed pivot story is real despite, of course, Fed officials. You keep saying we are not going to pivot. So a lot of these markets, a lot of the equity markets internationally, they are falling. You are looking at a South Korean one, a little bit weaker. Commodities, that's an interesting one. We're seeing oil, that's moving a bit higher. Not gas though, that is falling. Of course, we're in Prague where the European community there, that new forum, they are debating the energy story. We are looking at oil in general, basically flat today, as those calls grow for $100 a barrel post-OPEC. So let's turn back to that US story, because it is the dominant theme that pivot party getting crashed on by Fed speakers. And it's been a drum beat of support for rising US rates. It is continuing as federal officials stress the need to quash inflation, neither market, volatility, nor an economic downturn will deter them from their goal. I'd like to reach a point where policy is moderately restrictive. I see us as raising to a level that we believe is restrictive enough. Somewhere between four and a 4.5% by the end of this year. And then hold at that level. Heated for four and a half to four and three quarters per cent. By sometime next year. Holding it there until we see inflation truly get close to 2%. Until we are confident. You have to understand the limitations of your data. You have to understand the limitations of your models. But you still need to use them to face your policy decisions on. I think we're quite a ways away from a pause. I anticipate additional rate hikes into early next year. Joining us now is Shannon Mooe, head of market analysis at RBC, Brewing, Delfin, Janet Gray. To see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining. I mean, it really just has been Fed official after Fed official this week hasn't it saying we're not going to pivot. We're not going to cut rates next year. We're going to keep hold. So what do you do in a market where everyone's just grabbing onto this narrative and risk assets rally every time we get a whiff of, oh, perhaps they'll pivot. Hi, good morning, Danny. Thanks for having me. We're still cautious on the need for outlook for equities. We think that the next leg of the bear market will be driven by earnings estimate revision. Because obviously those are still relatively optimistic. And as we foresee, you know, there is likely to be a recession. Sometimes, next year in the US, we do think that these earnings as we have to come down and corporate earnings will be negatively hit. So that's why we actually are cautious. But equally, we are not overly batterished at the moment because given that the main markets have fallen for quite a bit already from pick to trough. And we think that even if we get a recession, it's probably not going to be a very bad one. It's going to be a mild one. So we do see that a lot of bad news is already reflected in these prices. So it is just some of the equity story that needs to be priced in. To what degree, how much further away are we from saying, okay, that recession and earnings recession is reflected in this equity market? Yeah, I mean, that could still be some more downside risk to equities because, as you mentioned, the Fed is unlikely to pivot anytime soon. But equally, I think there is a lot of rate increases being priced in already by financial markets. It's difficult for us to see even more aggressive rate heights being priced in by markets at this stage for the US. So that's why on that front, we do see that inflation is going to come down. That's maybe not the exactly the level that the Fed is happy to see. But...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,417,2022-10-07 06:08:11
12192," So that's why on that front we do see that inflation is going to come down. That's maybe not not the exactly the level that the Fed is happy to see, but we do see that peak bond use will be coming soon. Okay. And I think that could be quite supportive. But we're not saying that yet. Yeah, it's going to say what level are you comfortable to jump in and start buying bonds again? Yeah, so basically we have actually turned last bearish on bonds overall speaking. In particular, we have actually closed out our underweight position in UK gives. And that's really because we think that UK gives our medium term oversold at the moment given, you know, the chaotic market movement we have seen in the UK market. And we do think that, you know, the government is unlikely to press on with further physical easing at this stage given the market reaction. And we do think that going forward, you know, with the energy price carries that inflation in the UK is going to come down. Are you worried though that the bond vigilance users are just going to retest this bank of England, just going to retest the guilt market considering the bank of England backstop is set to end next Friday? Yeah, I mean, that could be a possibility, but we think that basically the market has already priced in a lot of rate increases in the UK, for example, even more extreme. So in the UK market, for example, peak interest rate in the UK is back to the be some about five and a half percentage point. So we don't see how the bank rate is going to raise that interest rate to that kind of extent. And, you know, even, okay, there may be a bit more upward movement in the bond use in the UK gives, but, you know, we came from almost zero to now at this stage with the current yield level, the sensitivity of bond prices to you going further is just going to be less because of the complexity of the bond market. So that's why we're closing the underworld. We're not going over the back, you know, we're not bullish. Right, you're not just going to do that. You're not going to be loaded away because we have been under way for a long period of time. I see. So it's more tactical then, but what about just this concern? Yes, perhaps the UK government, they've scrapped doing away with the 45 percent tax bracket, but they still have an issue of a current account deficit. They have twin deficits. There's this concern of reliability in the UK government. Is this not more of a longer, thematic story that will keep folks away from this guilt market? Yeah, yeah. I think there is concern indeed with net insurance of GILS is going to come up and we will have QT in the UK going forward. So I mean, we are closing out our under way because we see that at current levels of the guilt yields is rather attractive. And we do think that after the chaos that we have seen, the government is likely to be more cautious going forward and they are going to publish alongside the Office of Budget Responsibility, more detail forecast and I think they will try to be more fiscal irresponsible given what they have experience from the market. Right, right. Okay, Janet, stick around with us more to cover. Janet Mooy, their head of market analysis at RBC, Brewin Dolphin. Let's get to the Bloomberg first word news now with Alice Adkins. Good morning, Alice. Morning, Danny. Italy, Greece, Poland and Belgium have proposed limiting natural gas costs by introducing a cap on prices at Europe's biggest trading hubs. EU leaders are continuing to discuss measures at a summit in Prague. Several countries have previously expressed support for a cap but disagreements remain. The Thai Prime Minister will visit the scene of the country's worst mass killing today after ordering an urgent investigation into the tragedy. A 34-year-old former police sergeant killed at least 38 people, most of them children, in a rampage which began at a daycare centre in the country's north. After fleeing the scene, the assailant drove back to his house and killed his family before taking his own life. A US judge has halted the court case against Elon Musk over his $44 billion Twitter buyout, giving the parties until October 28 to complete the deal. The ruling is a win for Musk who had accused Twitter of, quote, not taking yes for an answer after he revived his bid. Twitter had objected to the request to pause the case saying Musk should close the deal next week. That's your brainberg business flash, Danny. Our thanks so much, our sadkins here in London. Coming up, President Biden has a busy 24 hours taking OPEC plus attacks over their production cuts. Morning Russia's threats to use nuclear weapons could lead to Armageddon.

12193," Morning Russia's threat to use nuclear weapons could lead to Armageddon. We've got all the details for you. First up next, though, some of you conduct your stocks away, chip away rather. We'll pun their own chips. They're chipping away at four days of gains for Asian equities after disappointing results. We're going to get more on that. Plus more thoughts from Janet Moody of RBC Brewing Dolphin. If you have any questions for Janet, any of our guests, please send them to us. I B plus TV Go is where you want to head on your terminal. This is Blueburg. There is an epic saying in Italy when it comes to family generations. The first generation creates the second generation expands and the third generation destroys. That's almost what happened in the Gucci story. So, Hating a Love, Good. Now I would have had much more experience about those who say that love you and tend to trade you. The Gucci family was the strength but also the weakness of the label. The situation became dire with Gucci's finances. They were not able to pay salaries. They were not able to pay suppliers. Gucci is really teetering on the brink at this stage. We have to be able to give our customers vehicles that are their primary vehicles that are EVs and to be able to do that, we need to have range and infrastructure and we need to remove the pain points. And so, that's what we're doing. Welcome back to Bloomberg Market. It's here. It's less than 50 minutes away from your equity cash open. Negativity, but not too bad. We are fighting for any sort of direction here on some of these regional benchmarks, but the Euro sucks 50 futures. Those are down about a third of 1 percent ahead of non-farm payrolls. Not a lot of willingness to put risk on the table ahead of what could be a volatile reaction to those figures. Now the chips are down. It's after years of record capital spending. Chip makers are warning on almost a weekly basis that demand is sputtering. AMD and Samsung both posted a miss within hours of each other. That's still fears of the tech downturn may run deeper and last longer than feared. For more on what we're watching, we're joined by Annabelle Jouler's in Hong Kong. So Annabelle, talk us through these results from both Samsung and AMD of course. Yeah, we really set the tone there, Danny, because it wasn't a great set of results. So we had, okay, get off with what we saw from Samsung. So the first profit dropped for that company since 2019. So operating profit down by $7.7 billion for the three months ending September. Sales, they also miss estimates as well. These are the preliminary figures. Do need to say that. So we will get the net income and the details of the divisional performance they'll come later at the end of the month. So not a great set of results. And as you said, it did follow what we had from advanced micro devices or AMD. Also missing their third quarter sales figures. And $1 billion shy of its own forecast. So significant miss again, these are early numbers. We'll get the full results in a few weeks. But like it's peers, AMD also putting the blame on this at the PC market. That's what they say is really hurting their sales there. We could demand and a build up of inventory. Now, how are companies responding to this? This has been a huge focus.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,419,2022-10-07 06:16:25
12194," At the PC market, that's what they say is really hurting their sales there. Weak a demand and a build up of inventory. Now, how are companies responding to this? Because this has been a huge focus. We've been tracking this over the last few months. And we are seeing a lot of companies really in a push now to try and save their balance sheets. And Nvidia intel their shaving billions off their projections. They also need to burn through stockpiles. Micron, Kyoxia, these are other companies also cutting their output, Danny. What's been the reaction in markets to all this? Yeah, if you take a look at the movers that we have in Asia today, it's a little bit mixed. It's actually sort of interesting the moves that we have in Samsung because the company has actually been a little bit higher in the session. There could be a little few factors playing into this. We're seeing more weakness coming back into the one. So that's one factor that can help encourage some dip buying. And then you've also got that follow on of the Morgan Stanley report that we had earlier in the week. Because they're actually seeing the sector recovering in the second half of next year. You can see those names there. But the likes of TSMC, which is down 2.9% does also point to the broader issues that are facing the sector because most of them are a lot lower today. And it really does point to yes, we did have that positivity from the Morgan Stanley report. But on the flip side of that and perhaps something that didn't come through in that Morgan Stanley report is what we're getting from other analysts like Midas International asset management over in Seoul. And they're saying that geopolitical factors, they also play into this because you have those ongoing tensions between the US and China. And that is something that could really change the demand dynamics going forward. Okay, Annabelle. Thank you very much. Annabelle Drullers there in Hong Kong. So with us here in London, this Janet Moody, head of market analysis at RBC, Brewin Dolphin, so perhaps some nerves around the chip sector. We see nerves around tech in general. NASDAQ, it's lost about a third of its value so far this year. How are you thinking about tech? Yeah, Danny. So we heard the report, I think as we head into a recession, possibly globally, demands for chips is going to come down. It's about a cycle, right? We have seen huge search and demand for these and there wasn't enough stock around. So we're seeing a cycle and we do believe that the prices fall. We have seen it's reflected a lot of pessimism already. And for example, some of these chip companies in the video that picked to trough were down like 50%. So we do think that valuations are attractive and investors could be picking up bargain despite the near-term uncertainty. And for a long-term investors like us, we stay the long course, right? And we believe that chips production, these chips company will be a very good position for the transition to a more digitally-based economy, upgrade to artificial intelligence, et cetera, et cetera. So we will be focusing on, of course, good quality chips company and tech companies in general that would generate that long-term growth story. And of course, before we let you go, Janet, we have to bring it back around to pay roles. Do you think that this report will start to show some cracks in this labor market? Perhaps not yet. So far, we've seen on a weekly basis, the initial jobless claims are pretty decent. Although we do believe that the labor market will be on a course for general slowdown, but not acute one. As we see from some of the leading indicators of the employment survey, their weakening, and of course, with the rate heights, et cetera, the economy is going to get a bit tougher. So we do expect some softness, but not to extend that it will be acute slowdown. Do labor markets do they need to get soft in order for equities to rally? Yeah, that's a very tricky question. So I think if we do see a bit of softening in the data as in the payroll, and we get a higher participation rate, and we get some moderation in wage growth, I think that could be slightly more positive. But ultimately, I think as we have discussed, the Fed is unlikely to pivot no matter what the recent trend in the data. So I think the market will still be cautious, but I think it would just a very acute slowdown in the payroll. I think markets will be concerned in thinking more about the recession risks and the earnings downgrade, et cetera. So it is very difficult. We're not in a Goldilocks scenario anymore. Certainly not Goldilocks. Janet, thank you so much. We'll have to leave it there. Janet, we head of market analysis at RBC, Brew and Dolphin. Coming up on the program, the European Union explores the idea of a cap on gas prices with EU leaders.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,420,2022-10-07 06:20:59
12195," the drum beat of continued hawkishness from the Fed. And of course, it's not just the Fed. We also had those ECB accounts, which continued to emphasize the need to hike rates, given the inflationary backdrop of an ever worsening energy crisis in Europe. Well, let's take a look at some of the events that are going to be shaping up your agenda today. We have Bank of England governor, deputy governor, rather David Ramston. He'll be speaking at a securities industry conference. That'll be 11 o'clock. Focus then shifts across the Atlantic afternoon when we have double jobs data out of North America. So 130 PM, that will be the big one. We're going to get non-farm payrolls data from the US. Any cracks there might help to force an equity market rally. Then we're also going to have, and of course, that will help the Fed in their quest to rein it in inflation and wage-price spiral inflation. You can read a story from yesterday on your terminal that suggests the Fed has a very poor record of forecasting joblessness around downturns. Now, we're also going to get jobs data out of Canada at the same time, painting a picture of employment across the continent. Well, let's turn back to Europe where EU leaders are meeting today in Prague for a second day of talks with discussions set to focus on the feasibility of a price cap on natural gas. Thursday's opening saw the first gathering ever of the European political community. It's a new forum that includes non-EU countries, such as Turkey and the UK. For more, we're joined by Bloomberg's Maria Todaye, who's in Prague, who's been covering this for us. For some, Maria, can anything get done in Prague when it's just so cold there? I say it wrong. Well, my hands, Danny, I just don't even feel them. But in terms of the actual content yesterday, look, I think it merits... If you look at this new format, these are 44 countries, EU countries, non-EU countries. Essentially, the entire European continent was represented here, except for Russian Belarus yesterday for obvious reasons. Not a lot, perhaps, accomplished in terms of the big, marquee announcements, but just the fact it happened is already a win to some extent for diplomacy. And that was a lot of the narrative yesterday, just the optics, the fact that 44 heads of states gathered here to talk around the table debate, big ideas. Now, the one area, perhaps, where we did see a cooling down of tensions is the UK and France. Remember, a few weeks ago, well, this trust was asked, whether Emma Newton-McCone was a friend or a foe of the UK. Yesterday, she made it clear. He is a friend to the UK and the two countries agree the only foe for Europe right now is Vladimir Putin. By the way, both the French and the UK said they will hold a bilateral summit in the country next year. And they hope to, well, renew a shared agenda, so perhaps given the rocky nature of this relationship, that's already good enough. And Maria, look, I know we're joking about how cold it is there in Prague, but this is kind of part of the problem, isn't it? If Europe has a really cold winter and, of course, Russia cutting off energy supply, I mean, what about Europe's energy problems? How is that going to be tackled at this summit? Absolutely, and if you're in the market, what you need right now is probably a meteorologist who's going to help you figure out whether this is going to be cold winter or not. And it is a very serious issue. The weather, of course, can help or make problems worse. But overall, they agree European leaders at least that will meet today as the EU27, the prices have to come down even further. And yesterday, that's exactly what the Dutch Prime Minister Mark Routes told us who said, don't expect a big announcement today, but the conversation is moving. Let's take a look. But you feel here is that there is an overriding willingness to make that happen, that, of course, with the stress that fell between the 27, that will probably lead to decisions not tomorrow, but in the very near future. Of course, we have already done a lot, but we will discuss issues like, could the price cap work? Is the Iberia model something we would replicate? How could we work on during purchasing? All these issues will be discussed. And that was the Dutch Prime Minister, Mark Routes, speaking to us reporters yesterday in Prague, now that idea about the timing that he floated, it's interesting. And we should keep it in mind. He said, do not expect an announcement today, but it could come in a short future. And that means potentially Danny, or remember, European leaders will meet at the end.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,421,2022-10-07 06:28:18
12196," We should keep it in mind. He said, do not expect an announcement today, but it could come in a short future. And that means potentially, Danny, or remember, European leaders will meet at the end of, well, the month in Brussels, perhaps, that will see a breakthrough in terms of the magic formula that can get the 27 to agree around a price cap. I mean, Maria, there's so many possibilities here with how the price cap takes shape. I mean, we only got about 30 seconds here, but I mean, this is going to be a pretty rigorous debate, isn't it? Yeah, and then Danny, I can think of at least twice. You know, is this a cap on Russian gas, which only by the way accounts now for 7% of imports? Is this about all imported gas into the EU? Do you want to separate electricity from gas? There's a lot of options, not consensus. OK, Maria, thank you very much. Bloomberg's Maria today, oh, they're in Prague. Now coming up on the program, four full force ahead. The drumbeat for more rate rises, continues, fed officials stressing the need to quash inflation. We'll discuss that and the job support today. Nice visit, Bloomberg. These floating flowers are made of 92,000 solar panels. They can generate 41 megawatts, which is enough to power 20,000 homes. It's one of the biggest floating solar plants in the world. Floating solar rays have been gaining traction in Asia, including countries like Singapore and Thailand. Floating projects typically benefit from an easier connection to the power grid. They can also restrict algae blooms while keeping the solar panels cool. This one in particular has healthy local economy. When the power plant was first proposed, residents were given the chance to invest. Some locals were also offered jobs during construction. In fact, it was the community that requested the panels to be shaped as flowers to look more appealing. South Korea relies heavily on imported fossil fuels, but will need to change that to reach its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050. Solar plants like this one may help the country reach its net zero goals. Welcome back to Bloomberg Market, Europe, about 30 minutes ago until the start of cash equity trading. Here are your top stories. Listen up, federal officials keep hammering the message that there's no policy pivot in sight.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,422,2022-10-07 06:32:25
12197," Up, Fed officials keep hammering the message that there's no policy pivot in sight. Today's Payrolls report will be key. Chipping away semiconductor makers way on Asia stocks in futures, a Samsung and AMD results disappoint. Plus, disquiet in DC, while the White House scrambles to respond to OPEX dramatic output cut, Joe Biden warns Russia's threat to use nuclear weapons is real. Well, we continue to see futures deteriorate as we get closer to the European open. It's a lot of reshuffling of things around after one of the best starts to in October since 1930, but ahead of a Payrolls report, the backdrop of which is a Fed that continues to say their job fighting inflation, it is not done, they are going to continue to hike rates. So we're looking at European futures, those are down across the board as much as 6, 10 to 1% when it comes to DAX futures. We also had some industrial data missing for Germany as well. We also had ECB accounts, those came out, they're going to continue to be hawkish, but again, we are looking at US futures, those are slipping further into the red this morning too, but again, we're all really going to be on ice. We're all just looking out for that non-Farm Payrolls report out later today. All right, let's get to some of our other top stories with the Bloomberg Business Flash as Alice Advkins. Hi, Alice. Hi, Danny. A US judge has halted the court case against Elon Musk over his $44 billion Twitter buyout, giving the parties until October 28 to complete the deal. The ruling is a win for Musk, who had accused Twitter of, quote, not taking yes for an answer after he revived his bid. Twitter had objected to the request to pause the case, saying Musk should close a deal next week. Samsung has reported its first profit drops since 2019. Operating profit fell 32 per cent to $7.7 billion for the quarter ending in September. The data underscores the depth of a global PC and memory chip downturn. Sales also missed estimates. AMD's sell-in late trade after its preliminary third quarter sales misprojections by more than $1 billion. Revenue at the US chip giant was about $5.6 billion, giving an early peak at numbers expected in the coming weeks. Like its peers, AMD is flagging weaker demand for PCs and a build-up of inventory in the supply chain. That's your Bloomberg business flash, Danny. Alice, thanks so much, Alice Adkins here in London. Well, it's the question we're going to be asking all day today. Is the hot labor market finally turning around? We have the September jobs port report today and markets have gotten very excited about some signs of the US labor market loosening. Our markets editor, Valerie Taitel, is here to take us through the charts, showing the glimpses of the hoops and the arguments against it. Valerie, take it away. Thanks, Danny. Today's number is a big number. We heard from Powell at the September EpoMC meeting, reiterating that it's not really growth that's going to impact the outlook for inflation. It's the tightness of this labor market. Today's number is going to be huge. I wish everyone luck trading through this. I don't want to be in your seat. Okay, now let's take a step back and look at the signs of loosening that the market's gotten so excited about this week. The first one was Tuesday's Joltz data, where we saw the ratio of job openings to unemployed persons falling from two to 1.7. This was something that Powell specifically mentioned in his testimony and in his questions, this number of two and on Tuesday when we saw it fall, the market got very excited. We saw a huge risk rally. But analysts say you have to take a step step back and look at the last six months of this number. It's been highly elevated. This chart shows it perfectly. These numbers were talking about whether it's two or 1.7. Those are especially elevated and it's going to be a push onto wage growth in the few months coming forward. As we know, that wage growth is still sitting at around 5% year on year. Let me take you to another chart. Another sign of maybe, maybe not, are we are we loosening? Jobless claims. Yesterday, jobless claims came in above expectations for the first time in nine weeks. As this chart clearly shows, you can see these blue boxes have been coming in below expectations for a while. The number was above the 200k handle at 219. Again, is this another sign of a crack? Yeah, you can read a lot into that, but you have to take a step back and realize jobless claims at a four week moving average at around 4.5.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,423,2022-10-07 06:36:48
12198," Again, is this another sign of a crack? Yeah, you can read a lot into that, but you have to take a step back and realize jobless claims at a four week moving average at around 200K is especially strong. Into the last two recessions, we saw Prince 353.75 before the gross slowdown started to happen. One more chart, which is putting the big headline number into perspective, the estimates today are for 255. However, look back at the last five months, the survey has top to estimates. It's the resiliency of the labor market has, again and again, surprised us, surprised Powell. And look, the whole world is waiting for these cracks in the US labor market to start. We, the financial system is straining at, at the more aggressive and aggressive the Fed is going to be. We heard from Dali last week saying that the bar is high for us to pivot. It's not just going to take one month of a soft print, but it's going to take multiple. And hey, we look forward to next Thursday CPI print. Again, core CPI is expected to tick up from 6.3 to 6.5. I just really think the market is getting way too excited about this loosening that they can be reading through. And they really need to take a step back. Look at where we're coming from. We have a long way to go. It's so true, right? It just feels like a market that any tiny sign of softness is willing to jump on it. But as you so rightly laid out, Valerie, it's more complicated than that. Our markets editor, Valerie Titell, they're walking us through the jobs charts. Let's continue the conversation. Joining us now is Raphaela Tancone, Chief Economist at Wood & Co. And Raphaela, are we seeing any cracks and any signs of softness in this labor market or is the little bits we're getting here and they're just a head fake? Good morning, Danny. Yes, we've seen signs that the labor market peaked, actually in the US already in March or April. And what I mean by that is that when the availability, the total compensation and the actual job gains were at best all together. Since then, I think availability and compensation has been cooling a little bit. This is what we get from the household surveys. And in the last employment print, we also saw that workers with lower education actually lost jobs. But in the aggregate, the total employment was still up because jobs for higher educated, which are the ones that are structurally gaining from the digitalization of the economy, were up significantly. So I think you need to be patient. We need to see actual consumer demand really slowing down so that will increase, unfortunately, the pain for less skilled workers and will also turn around or at least put on hold some of the hiring for the higher educated. Well, what I'm hearing from you, Raphaela, there are some areas in this labor market, which are very sticky. It's going to take some time to see some softness actually filtered through. Then does that mean there is a risk with a Fed who continues to see strength in this labor market that they overdo it, that they go too far, they raise rates too much too fast. Well, I have to say that it's the job of the central bank to overdo it. It's horrible, socially very tricky, but this is what they need to do. And I think the message of Powell has changed in the last, since the last meeting, the new strategy is we will kill the economy. Fed funds are going to rise aggressively, may go as high as six. You're looking at a recession of the scale of 2008 with the social complexity of 2020. Wow, on the scale of 2008, Raphaela, does the political pressure of an economy like that not cause the Fed to blink? Well, they will blink next year, but I think they want to make sure you believe they will go that high and they will stay that high for as long as necessary. I think the labor market will crack by the end of the year and by spring or late, you know, late spring next year, they will begin to cut and they will cut not to zero, but they will go to neutral rate. But unfortunately, right now, I think the plan is extremely aggressive.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,424,2022-10-07 06:41:06
12199," next year they will begin to cut and they will cut not to zero but they will go to neutral rate. But unfortunately right now I think the plan is extremely aggressive. I think it's complicated by the geopolitical tensions because unfortunately we have to acknowledge that evaporating demand is going to help solve the energy crisis. The rest of the world, this is what fascinates me about this Rafaella. As you mentioned because the aggressiveness of the Fed is really amping up the pressure on economies, on central banks who either need to hike aggressively to keep up with the Fed or need to jump in to defend their currencies. If the Fed is willing to push it to something that looks like 2008, how vulnerable is the rest of the world in that scenario? It's going to unfortunately have to fall it. There are no options. So sorry when you say fall away you mean continue to hike as well. Yes so they will have to fall it in the sense that they will have to endure severe recession even though that was probably not the favorite strategy of many. In terms of following the strategy look history says that periods of high inflation really need positive real rates to stabilize the effects, the effects volatility which is a very big part of this puzzle. I think not every central bank will follow the strategy but will follow the effects will suffer the effects but we begin to see in Europe for example there are different central banks decide to follow different strategy. All of them in any case are pushed to raise nominal rates well above neutral rate and they may need to endure such a high level of interest rates for very long time to cushion the effects volatility that they will suffer. In some cases like in Turkey they decide to follow completely the opposite effect unfortunately that will bring very significant inflation and effects cost to it. Okay Rafael I'm afraid we're out of time. Thanks so much for joining us. Warnings there of something on the scale of 2008 Rafael Attencone, Chief Economist at Wood and Co.

For most it's what we use to power devices for both work and play and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades they've gotten way more powerful long lasting and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi trillion dollar opportunity and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,425,2022-10-07 06:45:03
12200," We will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never. Welcome back to Bloomberg markets, Europe nearly 15 minutes away from the cash equity open stocks continued to fall down half a percent on the DAX Eurostock 50 futures as a hold down 710s of 1% were awaiting the jobs report. We had a lot of hawkish Fed speakers some issues and techs are overall a very bearish mix to start the equity trading day today. Let's now get to the Bloomberg first news with that is ours. Hi Danny, Italy, Greece, Poland and Belgium have proposed limiting natural gas costs by introducing a cap on prices at Europe's biggest trading hubs. EU leaders are continuing to discuss the measures at a summit in Prague. Several countries have previously expressed support for a cap but disagreements remain. The Thai Prime Minister is visiting the scene of the country's worst mass killing today after ordering an urgent investigation into the tragedy. A 34 year old former police sergeant killed at least 38 people, most of them children, in a rampage which began at a day care centre in the country's north. After fleeing the scene, the assailant returned home and killed his family before taking his own life. Swedish investigators say evidence points to recent ruptures of Nord Stream gas pipelines being caused by a deliberate act. The Swedish Security Service says its investigation has increased suspicions of sabotage but did not indicate how the detonations happened or who might be responsible. And President Biden is pardoning thousands of Americans convicted for possession of marijuana and ordering a review of its legal status. In a major step towards decriminalisation, he's issued a blanket pardon for all prior federal charges of simple possession and will urge governors to do the same for state offenses. The biggest ETF investing in US cannabis companies surge 34% in an hour on the news. Global news 20,000 a day, on air and on Bloomberg, quick take par by more than 2700 journalists and analysts and more than 120 countries. This is Bloomberg, Danny. Thank you so much. We have had these quite strident remarks from President Biden really underscoring the very real possibility that Putin may turn to not just New clear weapons but also biological and chemical weapons. It is quite a shift from the comments we had from Jake Sullivan, Security Advisor, just last week that took Putin's threat to use nuclear weapons as part of the string of remarks that Putin has made over the war in Ukraine. Of course, on the one hand, we know that President Biden in the past has made some of these rhetorical gaps that he's had to then walk back or at least the White House has walked back on. On the other hand, it is also clear that Russia's Putin is facing a daily amounts of pressure when it comes to Ukraine. And there is a rising risk that he may move to take more desperate measures to try and combat that. We see, for example, more criticism in state media. We see the 300,000 men at least that have fleed Russia at risk of possibly being conscripted to the military there.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,426,2022-10-07 06:49:31
12201," We see the 300,000 men at least that have fleed, rushed at risk of possibly being conscripted to the military there. So, Putin is also potentially a bit more of a risk. Also a risk potentially, I mean perhaps not to the same scale or definitely not to the same scale, but a risk in terms of the midterms of political crises for the White House, that OPEC+. What does it mean for Biden? Absolutely, sort of juggling one thing after another, I think, in the last 24 hours. I mean the White House, peace to be quite bewildered by this decision. President Biden said he was disappointed that he's looking for alternatives, and the White House's top energy adviser also saying he was surprised, given the meeting that he had two weeks ago. Now congressional Democrats have been quite vocal in their criticism of ReAD. They've posited that the timing of this decision was deliberately initiated to interfere with the process of the midterms, and they are trying to pressure some kind of retaliation. That could be something like the NOPEC bill, which essentially allows the US to sue OPEC countries under anti-trust law. However, that sort of bill has been around for quite some time, and there is a bit of a sort of geopolitical Pandora's box. So far, a source telling us there are no plans to actually initiate that. Okay, Rebecca, thank you very much. Bloomberg's Rebecca Chung Wilkins there. Now, coming up on the program, we're going to take a look at some of your stocks to watch.

12202," down the pipe. This September jobs report Friday on Bloomberg Television and Radio. Welcome back to Bloomberg markets Europe about seven minutes to go until the start of cash equity trading. It is a negative day after a really strong start to the week. But of course, the pivot party getting pricked, getting crashed on by Fed speakers who continue to talk about hawkishness. losses of up to a third for FTSE 100 futures. The overall benchmark futures stocks 50 index is down more than half a percent at the same time. We also have some negativity in US futures to someone out there put on a 150 Vicks bet yesterday. Of course, close above 30 yesterday. Let's dig underneath the surface. Get some of your stocks to watch. Joining us now is Joe Easton from our equities team. And Joe, every day a credit squeeze headline with the latest. That's right. So more news on credit Swiss today. They are saying they're going to buy back around three billion dollars worth of securities. This will kind of give some confidence into investors that are obviously concerned about this company's balance sheet. It's around three weeks or so away from a review of the company's assets. And they're essentially going to trim down their investment bank and focus more on the wealth unit. There's been a lot said around how secure this bank is. I think the main thing is that the whole sector is much more secure than it was back in the financial crisis. So perhaps some of those issues were a bit overblown in the media, particularly last weekend. There was the interesting report yesterday saying they're looking to sell a hotel in Zurich, the Savoy hotel, which kind of maybe raises questions about how much they do need to raise cash. But this looks like a positive one. And that stock is a little bit higher in some of the pre-market trading. Yeah, that Twitter stuff over the weekend was pretty bananas about credit Swiss. All right, you're also looking at chipmakers. Some earnings coming through that might flow to Europe. That's right. So we had some negative reports. One from Samsung, obviously in Asia and also AMD in the US. Those earnings report really missed expectations. There was a positive one from TSMC, though, in Taiwan. Their sales were better than expected. So a bit mixed on the sector. But I do think that overall negative today, however, I would note that I was speaking to one asset manager yesterday and he was talking about how undervalued a lot of these stocks are, particularly in Europe. And a lot of that is due to the fact that they have so much exposure to the electric vehicle industry. And he thinks that once we get through this big interest rate adjustment, and investors will focus, again, on the clean energy potential. And he's looking at stocks like ASML, Siltronic and SoyTech in Europe. Those stocks could be weaker today, but I think some investors seem some value there now. Love a good fundamental story, Joe. All right. You're wrapping it up with weather spoons. What's the latest there? That's right. So weather spoons today reporting a bigger than expected operating loss. It's a negative one for the company. I think what's happened there is that they haven't managed to bring back those older customers that they had pre-pandemic. They kind of got in use to not drinking so much in the pubs. There was an interesting report from one broker recently saying that the weather spoons pubs that do best at the moment are the ones with music. And what analysts are saying is that this is saying that it's the younger clientele that are coming out of students, they're coming in and getting their drinks on the cheap. The positive in the report today is that the last few weeks has actually been a bit of an uptick in trading. So I would expect weather spoons overall to be a bit negative. And you know, it's one of those all-weather businesses. If people are feeling bummed, if they've lost jobs, if they're sad, there's always a weather spoon surge. Some pub around the corner. Joe, thank you so much. As always, Joe Easton there from our stocks team. All right. The open coming up in just a few minutes with futures pointing down as we wait non-farm payrolls.

We have to be able to give our customers vehicles, you know, that are their primary vehicles that are EVs and to be able to do that we need to have range and infrastructure and we need to remove the pain points and so that's what we're doing. Welcome to the European market open everyone. A minute to go into the start of cash equity trading in front of the Lackwai here in London and these are your top stories. No pivot, no doubt, no dilemma. Fed officials hammer home the message that tightening will continue today's jobs reports may prove key. Oval Office angst while the White House scrambles to respond to OPEX dramatic output caught. President Biden warns Russia's threat to use nuclear weapons is also real. Plus chipping away Samsung profit sinks by a third as semiconductor firms warn of a breathtaking drop in demand. So let's take a look at the futures. Remember this will all move depending on what we get in terms of data out today. Actually three things that we need to watch out for. There is a Fed official speaking a little bit later. There's of course that employment report all important to give us an indication what the Fed couldn't can't do and then here in the UK we have also Mr. Ramzan of the Bank of England talking so that will move markets no doubt for the moment a bit of pressure on the downside half a percent lower. Again, there's a bit of some due trading ahead of this pivotal US monthly jobs report. Also disappointing earnings from chip makers are weighing on this broader investor sentiment. I always look at commodities because why not especially when we have this fall outs or the White House and President Biden being paid against OPEC Brent crude 93.96. The rest is also a play for Haven Ibex and FTSE actually down some four tens of 8 percent or seven tens of 8 percent at the open. Let's go to cross asset because the one thing we need to talk about also is a treasury. So a treasury on dollar we really need to look at every ten minutes.

12204," We're going to cross-asset because the one thing we need to talk about also is a treasury. So a treasury on dollar, we really need to look at every 10 minutes. We decided to go for the Bloomberg US dollar index, $1337, and you can see that US 10-year yield at $384.28. So the drum beat of support for rising US rates continues as federal officials stressed the need to quash inflation. Neither market volatility nor an economic downturn will deter them from their goal. I'd like to reach a point where policy is moderately restrictive. I see us as raising to a level that we believe is restrictive enough. Somewhere between 4 and a 4.5 percent by the end of this year, and then hold at that level. Heated for 4.5 to 4.3 quarters per cent by sometime next year. Holding it there until we see inflation truly get close to 2 percent. Until we are confident. You have to understand the limitations of your data. You have to understand the limitations of your models, but you still need to use them to base your policy decisions on. I think we're quite a ways away from the polls. I anticipate additional rate hikes into early next year. Well, joining us now is Bloomberg's Christina Keen on Scott Theal Chief. Fixed income stretch is at BlackRock Scott. I have like a million and one questions, but first it feels like trading is a little bit subdued because actually this is probably one of the most important or pivotal US jobs numbers. I think it is the word all the time. No, that's absolutely very frenzy. I mean, obviously the question of course this week was what is the Fed going to pivot or getting closer to that pivotal moment as you say? We've heard from officials pushing back against that notion markets got very excited about the prospect earlier this week, but I think now they're starting to realize, well, hang on. For one, I don't think a pivot isn't necessarily going to come anytime soon or even part of the discussion just yet. But also too, a pivot doesn't necessarily mean that the Fed will start raising rates. And I think this realization, finally markets are kind of coming to it. And so we're coming into jobs day to day, really going to be again, a pivotal moment for many reasons. Is there a worries cut? And I know their data dependent, but it does feel like they're chasing their tails. If it's, you know, month by month that they look at the data, they still need to analyze and what happens the next six months. No, I think that's right. And I think that, you know, the comments about the rate market is basically leading everything else, right? I mean, look at the correlations across assets extraordinary. How correlated stocks and bonds have been, in fact, probably the most correlated been in last 15 or 20 years. And that's because investors are so hung up on the kind of the, what we would call the pause point, not the pivot point to underscore your point that we don't think they're going to embark on an easing cycle immediately after this, but more of a pause. And so I think it's, you know, we're in this period where every miss or hit or, or, or, you know, every economic information becomes so important. And obviously the jobs market and the inflation market are going to be really important data points. So today, again, you know, could be really important, particularly if the number misses or hits the consensus. But Scott, where's the biggest dislocation actually in Treasury? So if you believe what Fed officials say, and I know again, it's stated dependent, then it should treasuries be at 5%. What's interesting, I think, yeah, I think there's two things in treasuries. I would say one is I think long, long term rates should be higher, right? They're being driven by monetary policy expectations, not by term premium, right? So not by concerns about fiscal issuance, about higher volatility. And we've seen that come to play in the UK, and we'll talk about the UK in a little while, I hope. We will. Yeah, we will. But that's, you know, that's kind of a great vignette or a small picture of what could happen in the broader market. So I don't think there's enough term premiums. So higher yields in the long end. The second is that, you know, break even inflation rates are around two and a quarter in the US, right? They're all the way back to where we were before. And if you believe that the supply constraint US-China trade tensions are going to leave us at an inflation level that's higher going forward, that seems to be an opportunity to me as well. So inflation and higher longer rates. Yeah, and this is what we're expecting in terms of US jobs. I think our value put together a great chart and also look at our start. I mean, there's so many different metrics and we will get some of those charts up. I know you, something that caught your eye, Christine, it's also bill gross, I think, on bonds. Absolutely, Francie. I mean, it's quite interesting, a moment where a lot of the bond bulls are kind of coming out of the woodwork and saying, you know what, this might be the peak in terms of treasury yields, especially because of-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,430,2022-10-07 07:07:22
12205," It's quite interesting, a moment where a lot of the bond bulls are kind of coming out of the woodwork and saying, you know what, this might be to peak in terms of treasury yields, especially because of what we've heard from the Fed so far in terms of the pushback. But if you're somebody who believes that there is going to be a hard landing or recession that follows this hiking cycle, then it would make sense to pile into bonds at this particular juncture just because of the yields that we're getting now much, much more attractive than, say, even just earlier this year or a year ago. But then at the same time, the danger with that, of course, if the Fed is still very much insisting on continuing on this tightening cycle, say, for the next six months until we get to that peak pricing or what the peak is priced currently in March 2023, then that's potentially six months of getting it wrong before it becomes ripe. OK, so the Fed is interesting. I mean, the UK is a whole other story. One of our most red stories, today's God is basically you have pension funds still selling billions of pounds worth of assets to try and raise cash before the Bank of England removes that critical support. You know, I think I mean, obviously the UK is a very good example where the government introduced a kind of an unfunded additional spending into a situation that's already very, very tight. So they are, in fact, adding to the kind of longer term inflationary impulse in the UK that the Bank of England isn't trying to control. And the bank, as you know, is one of the central banks that's acknowledged a trade off between higher inflation and lower growth themselves predicting contraction in the UK economy. Was that useful or not? Well, I mean, I think it's realistic, right? I mean, markets want central bankers to be kind of realistic. And I think if they sense that the central bank recognizes the risk of recession, then rates are not just about inflation. They're about this longer term balance, right? And that's in the US, we haven't seen the recognition of the UK in your area we haven't. One of the things that's incredible to me, though, is the volatility in some of these fixed income assets in the UK. And I would just highlight one bond in particular, the 50-year bond, which has a 1 in 5,8 coupon in the UK, traded at a low of $41 price, Francine. 41. This is the developed market government bond. This is the developed market triplated at a $41 price right before the bank intervened. The next day, it traded at 56. So you've got almost a 50% return on a fixed income bond over a one-day period. I mean, it's extraordinary. So the volatility that has come into these markets is, I mean, I know that we talk about, I'm pressing it and we say that word. I think that's an overplayed word. But the reality is kind of the great moderation of this kind of period of subdued inflation, subdued policy markets is clearly in the rear of your mirror. And we have actually a deep dive also into why the bank of England was forced to step in. And so Bloomberg UK today, and Phil Aldrich and David Goodman have this great story talking about the nightmare scenario. How much is there a liquidity problem? Well, you know, so far, you know, we haven't seen, we've seen, let's say, bid offers kind of expand, maybe two to three times their normal level for UK Gelsen normal size. So there's obviously been an increase in the cost of doing business. And you would expect that right, given the, just a sheer volatility. But obviously, the bank is addressing the kind of, the concerns about stability risk, right? And so they are calming everything down. It's exactly what they're supposed to do. And so yes, you could say it counters the QT program, it counters the tightening of monetary policy, but it's what they're supposed to do. And so it's understandable. And it has obviously had its impact, although recently, in the last, I mean, recently, the last day, right, rates have started to creep higher again in the long end and the pound has been weaker. But it certainly had that kind of, when you have a systemic issue, that's exactly what the banks be exactly. But there are so many questions, Christina, on whether now they should just, you know, it post-bunk QT even further. Yeah, Francine, I mean, it really does put the bank in such a difficult position. Because again, on the one hand, they really wanted to get a hold of inflation and finally get that tightening cycle up and running, especially because they have been a little bit behind of the Fed. Part of the reason why the pound has been so weak this year, for instance. But then you have the systemic acute issue that kind of crops up and the bank has to step in. And then suddenly it's adding cash to the financial system to promote stability. But then on the other hand, also trying to raise rates to contain inflation. And it's kind of taking from one hand.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,431,2022-10-07 07:11:45
12206," financial system to promote stability, but then on the other hand, also trying to raise rates to contain inflation. And it's kind of taking from one hand and then giving it to the other in a lot of ways. And so, a lot of questions, again, what they're going to be doing about QT, definitely part of the discussion, especially because, as Scott mentioned, that volatility in the long end is really not what you want to be seeing for our central bank that's about to pull back on his bond purchases. And even, I would say, not for G7 country. Thank you both. Of course, Christina, you know, they're from our M-life team and staying with us. Scott deal, he is at BlackRock. Now, this is the picture overall for Credit Suisse announcing a cash debt buyback with some three billions with Frank. It's a show of financial strength. Some of the people at the top have been saying after market volatility early in the week on concern about the bank's solidity. So for the moment, the share price gaining 3%. Coming up the European Union explores the idea of a cap on gas prices as leaders gather for a second day of talks in Prague. So we'll be live in Prague. Shortly, this is Blueberg. There's more activity in the fusion world than ever. In not just in government research labs, there's also an emerging private fusion industry that attracted billions of dollars in capital in recent years. The government and private investors alike realize that we've got to find a solution that's going to allow us to get to net zero targets. This is one of the hardest but most rewarding problems that humanity could work on. Ultimately, we all want the same thing. We want someone to put electricity on the grid from a fusion power station as quickly as possible. Frankly, the scale of the challenge, 3000 gigawatts of fossil fuel to replace. There's not many things that can do that. In fact, there may only be fusion that can really do that. And while many in the scientific community predict fusion power will take decades, some in the private fusion space, believe we'll get there in just a few years as soon as the 2030s. No one covers the world like Blueberg. We have to get interest rates higher and bring inflation back to our target. 23 million people have been affected by this flooding and the mozuma. Disruption is the whole point of a strike. With unmatched reach and resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Blueberg, you are global business authority.

Stocks and US futures are actually falling. This is the head of the US payroll. So actually, if you look at the kind of risk aversion out there, I think there's a bit of some due trading ahead of this pivotal number. Disappointing earnings also from chip makers weighing on sentiment overall. And so that's weighing on a broader investor sentiment. It is key that Chops data out in the US will be pivotal. Not only for stocks, bonds, but also dollar trading slightly higher against major currencies.

12207," You're trading slightly higher against major currencies. Now EU leaders are set to hold talks on the second day of the European summit, being held in the shadows of the Warnu Kray. The European Energy Crisis will dominate the meeting in Prague with the block weighing up whether to impose a cap on the price of natural gas. What you feel here is that there is an overriding willingness to make that happen, that of course with the stress that fell between the 27, that will probably lead to decisions not too moral, but in the very near future. Of course we have already done a lot, but we will discuss issues like could the price cap work? Is the Arberia model something we could replicate? How could we work on joint purchasing? All these issues will be discussed. Now for more on all of this, we're joined by Bloomberg's Maria today, who's covering the summit in Prague. Good morning, Maria. I know you have very long nights. Well, short nights and very long days. The focus is on a gas price cap. What can we expect from this meeting today? Well, friends, yesterday was about the politics, and today really is all about the energy. At the moment you have 15 countries that say they want to see this price cap two more that say they could be in favor, so overall 17 out of 27. So this is moving. Now the issue, and this is the way that I was described, this meeting would take place today. I'm going to talk about a stage where this is about the brainstorming. There's a number of options when we talk about a price cap. I can think of at least five. Now today is about figuring out what can fly and what European leaders will have to ditch if they want this conversation to move forward. But the number of countries now saying we need this has risen. Now the other thing today, Emma and my co-founder, French president in a local media interview suggesting that this is not about the price cap itself. We also want to see joint purchases. He believe if the European Union goes into the market and buys as a single unit, they will buy at a better price. So Maria, there's a lot of urgency on this action. Of course, to bring down gas prices, when could we actually see it happen for real? Yes, and Francine is a very good point because it feels the urgency is now, but this is moving in slow motion. And Mark Ruder yesterday kind of signaled the timeline going on from here. And a lot of brainstorming today, then energy ministers will meet next week. And now it does seem that the focus point crunch time perhaps will be the European leaders summit that is planned to take place on October, in Brussels, the 21st, 22nd of October. That is seen and I'm being told will be a key date for this discussion. Maria, thanks so much, Maria, today. They're in Prague for us. Now we're back with the BlackRock Chief Fixing Comes Dragiscop, the old Scott. Are you surprised that actually Fixing Comes in general hasn't moved more because of what we saw from OPEC because you could argue that either they saw something ugly happening, right? So certain parts of the economy that are actually going to collapse, or that they're just going to feel inflation. It's very interesting, right? Because if you look at, let's say, German break evens, we don't talk about that very often. We should. We should. They've settled in around 2%, but they're actually down quite a lot from their highs, let's say, about a month ago. And so despite kind of what the debate about the energy caps going on, I think the market is expecting them to reach some kind of agreement. And see your opinion, so the process is the process, right? It takes a while. Yeah, it's painful, but it does what it does. But I think what's what the longer dated kind of inflation expectations in Germany are telling you is that there is still this concern about the impact of recession in the market, right? And that trumps to some degree this near term volatility that we've seen in, and continue to evolve, so we've seen an energy crisis, right? So basically the long dated inflation expectations are going down because the market is concerned, like in the US, I think, about the possibility of recession, which obviously we have forecast now in Europe. But is that wrong? Because you think central banks will step up? I mean, I know we were having a discussion, right, off there, which we should have on air. Which is the market interpretation of actually, you know, you have data in the past. They used to be markets three steps ahead of what this means for central banks. And now it's actually much more bifurcated. I think that's right. I mean, you know, our view is that the ECB will continue to tighten and then recognize, particularly because of the energy situation, the kind of the recession environment that's ahead of them. We have the policy pathway peaking lower than the market pricing on that very idea. But I think, you know, today will be very important, right, Francine? Because we're going to get a look at the employment data in the US. And as we talked about just a minute ago.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,433,2022-10-07 07:20:19
12208," market pricing on that very idea. But I think today will be very important, right, Francine, because we're going to get a look at the employment data in the US. And as we talked about just a minute ago, the correlation between the monetary policy peak and stocks or risk assets or ecurrencies has been very, very high. And so if we get a miss or hit on this number, and there's a divergence in stocks and bonds, that may tell us something about how the market views are recession. In other words, we miss on the employment number. You would say, oh gosh, well, stocks will rally, because rate expectations will come down. But if they sell off, that's the recession being priced in. I think there's a really critical moment. As a fixed income we get, do you just assume that stocks are wrong? Well, no, I mean, we like credit over stocks for this idea that we don't think stock markets, as we just discussed, are priced in the recession. Exactly. But you know, US investment grade credit, you get 5%, good mix between spread and rate, gives you a hedge if the, in terms of the rate component, investment grade companies have solid balance sheets. I like that trade. But I know this maybe a little bit too, like philosophical, but are the markets not able to price things because of the loss of 10 years that we've had, or just because there's still no real alternatives? That there's just so much money out there that it has to go somewhere, even if there's no real conviction. I mean, I think markets are a little bit like children. They can only come focus on one or two things at a time. My mind can only go one. Or me. Or 50 a second real man. But the idea being that they're focused on the inflation and they're focused on the policy response. But again, I think that's why I think this number is really important, or the big number is so inflation, unemployment, because it gives us an insight if the market can focus on two things at once. What's your conviction trade in Europe if you have one? Do you have one? No, you know, in Europe, we're pretty neutral. I have to say because of the kind of the confluence of the uncertainty of the energy prices and the central bank. And again, if anything, you know, we watch Italian bond spreads very closely, they're not attractive enough for us to go into them at the moment. But you know, 200, 300 range, I think is still right. I mean, it's always like, it's just me up nicely for the weekend when I have a viewer, I'd be questioned for Scott Thiel. So thank you so much, Mr. and Mrs. Viewer, for sending that in. What's more in focus, this is a question to you, Scott. The headline payrolls are average early earnings and or the participation rate. Yes, I think it's a very interesting question. And I'm going to take the slightly kind of dodgy answer, which is to say it's actually a combination of the unemployment rate and the participation rate. Right, the participation rate has been so critical in the idea of drawing workers back into the workforce to alleviate the supply constraint that we've had in the labor market. And so I actually think it's a combination of both the employment rate and the participation rate and how those move together. All right, great. And thank you so much for those questions. Just if your viewer's just send them in, Scott, is more than happy to answer anything. Scott Thiel, they're a black rock. Chiefics, them income strategists.

12209," We drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid. We also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. This is a significant focus. For the intersection of Wall Street and Washington, nobody covers politics like Bloomberg. The message of power has changed in the last meeting. The new strategy is we will kill the economy.

What in code chief economist Rafael Lattincone they're saying the Fed has changed course and is now planning to kill the economy. Now let's get straight to Bloomberg business flash. Here's Alessadkins. Hi, Aless. Hi, Francine. Credit Suisse has announced a cash debt buyback worth some three billion Swiss francs, a show of financial strength after market volatility earlier in the week. The offer includes euro and pound sterling debt securities worth up to a billion euros and a separate offer for US dollar securities up to $2 billion. The bank shares having lost more than half their value this year after a series of scandals. A US judge has halted the court case against Elon Musk over his $44 billion dollar Twitter buyout giving the parties until October 28th to complete the deal. The ruling is a win for Musk who had accused Twitter of quote, not taking yes for an answer after he revived his bid. Twitter had objected to the request to pause the case saying Musk should close the deal next week. Samsung has reported its first profit drops in 2019. Operating profit fell 32% to $7.7 billion for the quarter ending in September. The data underscores the depth of a global PC and membership downturn. Sales also missed estimates. AMD fell in late trade after its preliminary third quarter sales misprojections by more than $1 billion. Revenue at the US chip giant was about $5.6 billion giving an early peak at numbers expected in the coming weeks. Like its peers, AMD is flagging weaker demand for PCs and a build up of inventory in the supply chain. Italy, Greece, Poland and Belgium have proposed limiting natural gas costs by introducing a cap on prices at Europe's biggest trading hubs.

12210," Music Music Music Music AI is the chance of humankind to really understand itself. How much of that is true? How confident? Did you actually over-achieve? Did you, you know, back then realize that we would be using AI in many different jobs? Was it slower or faster than you thought at the time? I think if I had a 35 or 40-year prediction task, I would have been more or less on track as to where we are today, but I would have predicted steady linear increase over time. But instead, the field had very minimal improvements until the last five or ten years. Then it really took off. I think we ended up in the right place, but I was very wrong about the trajectory. To this day, we still know very little about how the brain works, but these machines are getting ever more powerful. And I feel in some sense, we did end up learning how what human intelligence is by learning what it is not. And if we exclude all the things machines can do better than us as what makes us unique in our human intelligence, then now we can rule out many, many things because AI or machine learning has become so good as so many things that what's left must be the key aspects of human intelligence.

But the dollar trading slightly higher against major currencies offshore, you want slipping. Also, we had news from China saying its foreign exchange reserves fell to the lowest since 2017. So, the Biden administration will take a multitude of steps with the private sector, allies and strategic petroleum reserves to address oil production issues. Well, that's according to Amos Hawks' time. The U.S. senior adviser for global energy security. Now, he spoke to Bloomberg, but OPEC plus his decision to cut output. We think it was a mistake. One, it's not substantiated by energy markets, by the global economy or by any other metric. It was unnecessary at this time. Prices are already elevated. There was no real imminent threat of a major collapse in prices that would necessitate a cut. I understand that, you know, I've even watched OPEC for a long time. There's a difference to what they announce and what they actually do. OPEC's quotas are under-producing their quotas by more than the two million barrel cut that they've announced. So, let's see if this actually has any impact whatsoever in actual production numbers. We are going to continue to work at home and with our allies. One, we're going to work with our U.S. companies to ensure that they continue to increase production and make sure that we have the refining capacity. We're down a couple of refineries due to some accidents and maintenance, to make sure that we have enough inventory along the East Coast and parts of the Midwest and the West Coast to make sure that we have supplies. And we're going to continue to focus on bringing down prices. And to that end, we have still some work to do on the SBR. Okay. Amos has a lot to unpack there. So one of the reasons that OPEC talked about doing this was in essence to incentivize spare capacity. Higher oil price now to get more oil out of the ground because if not, it's going to stay in the ground and there will be a shortage. If there is some truth to that, why not take that view with U.S. producers? Why go to your allies? We have oil here that we can get out. Why not pick up the phone to oil production companies and say, guys, what can we do to get you to produce more? Alex, there's an assumption based in your question that we're not doing that. Even publicly, for the last several months, we have had conversations with the leadership of almost every major oil producing in the United States. Told them, what do you need to be incentivized to increase production? We've had that honest conversation. They have what they need. They do not need anything else. I've had this conversation with them. I think, on this, if we talk to the industry, they would point out that it's the threat of regulation down the road that's the issue. I take issue with that. I don't think that that's actually accurate. I think, in fact, if you look at where the, it's always about where you put your money. CapEx has increased among the major producers of the United States this year. They're increasing production. They announced those increases in CapEx just several months ago, but it takes time for that to materialize in production. We've seen them increase production. We know that the projection is for them to increase production into 2023, at first, a couple of quarters of 2023. They have what they need. Emma's Hawksign, they're the US senior adviser for global energy security, reacting to OPEC Plus's decision. Now, let's get straight to the Bloomberg. First, we're news with Alice Atkins. Hi, Alice.

Good говорят. A digital first approach to the future work is where the industry and all companies will be heading. Click the future work not be at home or in the office but in the metaverse instead. There's that word, metaverse. Good, well, how are you doing? When I think about the metaverse, I think about immersive experiences that have a sense of active presence. Wow, look at this. This is me. The metaverse is projected to become over a trillion dollar market by the end of this decade. And whether you know it or not, you'll probably be working there in the future.

But look, a lot of pressure because we're just waiting for that all-important U.S. jobs numbers. So that could be really pivotal. So when you look at some of the betting on the markets, I'm looking at U.S. futures declining, but again, so do trading because everybody wants to know what the Fed does next. We did have disappointing earnings from chip makers, and that's weighing on a broader investor investment sentiment. Now my next guest is a leading property investor, Jonathan Goldstein. He co-founded the real estate investment firm, Kane International, which has more than $14 billion in assets under management. Now the company is not making a push into luxury hotels along with the Saudi public investment fund. Kane is investing $900 million in Swiss hospitality firm, Amin Grouple. I'm very pleased to say Jonathan is also joining us for his first major UK interview since he became co-owner of Chelsea Football Club, here in London. So I have to say I'm not neutral on Chelsea. So we will also talk about Chelsea. But first of all, Jonathan, thank you so much for joining us when you look at real estate across the world. I mean, there's all these like, you know, spooks markets about recession, inflation. How tough is it out there? Well, I think it's broad, you know, it's been a very tough world for the last 12 to 18 months. I mean, the American world is clearly very fragile. We've got a rising interest rate environment across the world. But I think the American economy has the robustness to drive itself through these difficult times and find itself to the other side. And also America being the size it is, it has pockets of great growth. So we've been very fortunate that we invested very significantly in Miami in 2016. One of the hubs actually, we've had an unbelievable growth spurt during the post-the pandemic. We have a new office tower opening in the new year, 830 brickle, 640,000 square feet, fully leased, pre-completion. With great companies like Citadel, like Tom Abram, like Microsoft, all my great in down to Miami. So I do think in every environment you have to try and be lucky, find the right pockets of investment. But I think the situation is very tough and I'm very concerned about the United Kingdom. I think when you look on a global basis, if you're looking where you wish to place your bets at this point in time, which is what we investors do, the United Kingdom looks a bit unsure at the moment. It's a bit unclear. Because of the government policy or a big up? Yeah, I think we live in an extraordinary world where we now have a government which is conservative, which believes in unfunded tax cuts. So we've lived in a situation where a conservative chancellor has stood up and spooked the market to the extent to which the Bangalve England has had to provide up to 65 billion pounds of short-term liquidity to shore up the market. Can they get back on track? I think they really need to take a step back. I think my concern about the current conservative government is that each time since David Cameron, the mandates got narrower and narrower. And now we have Liz Truss, who herself has been in government for 10 years. She's been part of the cabinet and the government that she's trashing on a daily basis. Now believing that we need to go hell for leather for growth. We all believe in growth. We all want growth. But in order to have growth, you need to satisfy the markets and the investors that you've got a stable environment. They haven't yet done that. So what does it take for investors to go back here? I mean, we have a deep dive into the Bangalve England, dealing with their worst case scenario. It's like a bit of a nightmare for the Bangalve England. You have inflation going on. You have people freezing higher. Like, what's the way forward? We've clearly got significant challenges in inflation and energy. But I think the chancellor needs to step back and to set out very, very clearly his spending priorities, where his money, how he's going to fund the short-term medium term and give confidence to the marketplace that they know what they're doing. They haven't yet done that. They didn't do that during their conference. They need to do that. And what they also need to do, that we own Preso, the Italian pizza and pasta chain around the country, 150 stores. We employ over nearly 3,500 people. We have 10% vacancies around the place. We can't find people since the pandemic. People have gone into different industries. I'm not going to use the word Brexit, but people have migrated out of the country. We need to create opportunities. We need to show that we're a country that attracts talent, that rewards talent, that wants people amongst us. Because we need to have a growth economy and we're not yet hitting the right notes. But what would make your life easier? You're going to have a growth economy. You're going to have a growth economy. You're going to have a growth economy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,439,2022-10-07 07:46:21
12214," that rewards talent that wants people amongst us, because we need to have a growth economy, and we're not yet hitting the right notes. But what would make your life easier? So is it visas for people to come back from Europe? Because there's always a timeline problem. You need these people now. We need visas. We need the world opened up for people, but we also need training. We also need training. We need proper education. We need well-funded education. We need to ensure that we're not suddenly going to a narrative against people going into further education, which is what we're hearing from the current government as well. We need training. We need investment. We need migration. We need people to be working in our industries. We need to make sure that we have an environment where growth is really fostered and fulfilled. But should the fight against inflation take precedence? So as a businessman, inflation is killing your returns. It's more difficult to build things. It's also getting more difficult to source, for example. Inflation has come up against us very quickly. There are a number of factors where that's happened, but clearly the dreadful war in Ukraine has not been one of them. I think that most predictions believe that by the coming of next summer, inflation will have tapered off to quite some considerable degree. And I do think that we need to not just fight inflation. We need to look across the economic board. We need to ensure that we're not just focusing on one item. We need to ensure that we have the right environment across the United Kingdom to ensure that we have growth, to ensure that we have the right employment opportunities, and to ensure that we have the right investment in situations. So you're surrounded by Chelsea logos. Can you tell the newsroom was a little bit excited that we'd be speaking to you? Chelsea Football Club, one of the most glamorous franchises in the world of sports. After almost two decades of enormous successes under Russian oligarch Rolmanov-Bramovitch, the billionaire put the club up for sale after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Now, he was sanctioned by the UK government shortly afterwards. Now, the successful bidder was a consortium. We all know it, led by U.S. investor Todd Bowley. His investments span everything from top basketball teams to insurance firms and songwrites, including Bruce Springsteen. Now, the idea of a European super lead could also be the big money spinner, but the concept is extremely controversial amongst the fans. Here's what Kona Todd Bowley said when asked by our Eric Schatzger, if he still supported the idea. Because people want to know, is that a hard no? I never say hard no. I think he's options alive. But, you know, obviously, it's not something that we're talking about at all. Well, we're back with Jonathan Goldstein. He's the Chief Executive Officer of Kane International and Co. and Chelsea Football Club. I'm interested, because I'm also a Chelsea Football fan. There are so many fans that say, what will this club become? Well, first of all, let me say that we as a group are thrilled and so proud to be involved and to be leading Chelsea Football Club. And really, the people sitting here should be Todd Bowley and Badad Eggbarley and Jose Feliciano of Clear Lake. And together, they've led the new consortium, and continued to work daily to ensure that Chelsea is a winning environment. We've inherited a very strong platform, and we're looking to build upon that. You're not a fan or you originally weren't a fan. So is it really pure business? No, I think that I'm a lambda, not. I'm a huge lover of soccer. I'm a huge lover of football. And this is an opportunity that comes around once in a lifetime. So you are, you know, hugely excited to be part with Todd and Badad of the adventure. And really the challenge of ensuring that one of the great clubs in the world maximizes its potential. And that's what we're here to do. We're here to ensure that Chelsea maximizes its potential. It continues the great winning tradition that the previous ownership, you know, instilled in it over the previous 20 years. And we're working hard every day to try and achieve that. I know that you certainly created waves by the change in management, right at the top with the manager. Was that a good idea? Well, obviously it's a decision that we made as a group, that we felt was in the best long-term interest of the club. Ultimately, you knew to ensure that there's complete harmony between the management and the ownership group. And we felt that that wasn't right. And we're thrilled that Grand Potters now leading. You had a great win in the Champions League just the other night. And we're sure that he would take the club onto greater heights. But let's not forget, also Emma Hayes, the leader of our women's team, which one of the great women's teams in the world. Emma's been at Chelsea now for over 10 years. She leads it with great distinction. And she really is a great force in the women's game. Do you think the Super League will be back? I remember actually being...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,440,2022-10-07 07:50:39
12215," In the world, Emma's been at Chelsea now for over 10 years. She leads it with great distinction, and she really is a great force in the woman's game. Do you think the Super League will be back? I remember actually being... I don't think it's a problem. I don't think anybody is talking about the Super League. We've just got our feet under the table. We're really focused on ensuring that Chelsea is competitive, wins and maximises its potential. Every other issue is a side issue. You're the real estate guy. So what are you going to do with the stadium? Well, it's one of the great questions that everybody's always asking. And I think that the fact that people need to be aware of is that there is no existing planning permission on the site. There was a planning permission, it's lapsed. So we have to start again. So we're at the beginning of that process. And obviously there's two alternatives. You either redevelop the existing stadium or you take it down and build a new one on the site. We're very tight to stand for bridge, the Chelsea pitch owners are part of that process. So we're going through our own education process. We will then consult with fans, consult with local authorities. I know I would hope over the next 12 months, you'll invite me back and I'll be able to tell you how intense it is. So deal, we can shake on that. Another exclusive interview. When you look at, so that there's no talk about moving it to Earl's court or Battersea, this part. Currently we're really focused on understanding their locality, understanding what we've got at Stanford Bridge and trying to maximise the opportunity and the excitement for the fans. Is it fun, like, you know, dealing with it with football? It's very enjoyable. Are you still alert to running a business? Obviously, it's very high profile. And obviously, you can't open a newspaper without seeing Todd or Baudad in that newspaper. That's a very different aspect to our lives that we hadn't had before. But ultimately, it's about people. And if you enjoy interacting with people and you enjoy interacting with the really wonderful quality people that we've found at Chelsea at all levels of the organisation through the football side to the non-future side, then yeah, it becomes like every other business. But you need to ensure, because it's so high profile, that you do it well. Do you get more calls when you ask for money for a cane? Because they say, yeah, only if you answer this about Chelsea football. I think it's early days, still, let's see. Jonathan, thank you so much for joining us today. Jonathan Goldstein, they're the chief executive officer of Cain International and co-owner of course of Chelsea Football Club. And we will get Jonathan back to also talk about some of the money plowed into luxury hotels and get an update, of course, on the stadium. Coming up after more market turmoil, the Credit Suisse offers to buy back debt securities for cash worth approximately three billion Swiss francs. We'll have plenty more on that. This is Bloomberg. When you think space, you probably think... What's the most important thing that you can do? What's the most important thing that you can do? One space agency that travels under the radar is ESA. Which is surprising considering what the European space agency has achieved and how vital it is to the global space industry. But ESA wants to be a leading force in furthering humanity's mission into space.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,441,2022-10-07 07:54:42

If we want to have successful human missions to Mars, we are going to have to learn to live a work off-world in a different way. The place where we are going to learn to do that is on the move. Can ESA help humanity take its next giant leap? Welcome back to the Open. There is one story in town and that is what the Fed does next. I will have the US jobs report later. We will have to wait for the jobs report to see whether they will continue to keep an eye on inflation or keep inflation down. On to corporate stories, Credit Suisse is offering to buy back debt securities for cash worth approximately 3 billion swiss francs. Just as it puts the finishing touches on a planned overhaul. Let's bring in Bloomberg's finance editor, Tom Mettkath. Great to have you on the program. I think for me it is the message that Credit Suisse is trying to send. It is not a small change. It seems to me the bank is going out. They are a bit like Deutsche Bank did maybe five or six years ago and saying, hey look, we are financially stable, we have plenty of money and we can do. We see an opportunity to buy back our debt on the cheap as we perceive it. This is a message intended to reassure shareholders. Tom, is it possible to discern what the strategy will be going forward? It has been fascinating. It has been an absolute rush of news. We are hearing lots of bits and bobs of it. Obviously all eyes are on the cq3 at the end of this month where the bank has said, hey this is when we will announce what we are doing. From the report and so far it seems pretty clear. The investment bank will look very different whether that is a spin off of parts of it or perhaps try and bring in some outside investors. It is all sort of here inch by inch but for now the bank is sort of holding fast to this. I believe it is October 27th when they are sort of layered all out for us. Tom, in terms of timeline, what more are we expecting from the board in coming days? It was interesting. Last week of news was kind of kicked off by that memo. Late Friday sent by the CEO. I think probably most sort of credits for shareholders are hoping there is no sort of own goals like that in terms of perhaps slightly loose communication which is a bit more important. So I think that the communication which kicks off as sort of fire is almost speculation. So I think everyone across the board is probably expecting the news to abate for a bit as these final discussions go forward. Thank you so much. Our Tom Metcalfe, there are Bloomberg's finance editor. Now that is it for the European market open surveillance. Early edition is up next. So focus firmly on the Fed, the focus is also on chipmaker. So if we get a board up for you to have a look at what we are seeing overall, we have I think a cross asset track. Now the dollar trading slightly higher against major currencies. Offshore one sleeping after China said its foreign exchange reserves fell to the lowest since 2017. Now the end. Earlier weekend against the dollar towards levels that triggered direct market intervention last month. Again markets and traders are trying to test in Japan the authorities tolerance for currency depreciation. If you look at stocks here in Europe and of course futures in the US, they are declined. They are declining but this is in some dude trading ahead of a pivotal US monthly payrolls report. So we also had disappointing earnings from chip makers.

And that's almost what happened in the Gucci story. So, hating and love together. Now I would have had much more experience about those who say that love you and then they'll trade you. The Gucci family was the strength but also the weakness of the label. The situation became dire with Gucci's finances. They were not able to pay salaries. They were not able to pay suppliers. Which is really teetering on the brink at this stage. You've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. They have. I've been in and seen it. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloomberg. Lots of Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? It means they have a Bloomberg. This is Bloomberg's early edition with Francine Markwell. Good morning everyone and welcome to Bloomberg's surveillance early edition. I'm Francine Lackle here in London. Here's what's coming up on today's program. No pivot, no doubt, no dilemma. Fed officials, hammer home the message that tightening will continue. Today's jobs report may prove key. The Oval Office angst the White House, scrambles to respond to opix dramatic output caught by the Warns Russia's threats to use nuclear weapons is real. Plus, chipping away Samsung profits, saying, by a third, as some conductor firms warn of a breathtaking drop in demand. Now first thing is first let's check in on the markets. This is a picture overall. U.S. equity futures actually pointing to a lower start. I'm also looking at European stocks, down some two tens of eight percent. Of course, the picture and the only game in town is what we see with the U.S. jobs report, although we also had some semiconductor earnings that missed estimates. That's putting a bit of a concern on future expectations for avoiding a recession. Crudeau, 88.75 yesterday, we had opix, commons, cranny, with some really terrific market moving interviews in the U.S. 10 year yield, 384828. The other story we need to watch out for. I think we have charts throughout the days. Actually, what's happening in the guilds markets, we also have a deep dive in Bloomberg UK as we get onto the European map from our David Goodman.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,443,2022-10-07 08:03:43
12218," I think we have charts throughout the day is actually what's happening in the guilt market. We also have a deep dive in Bloomberg UK as we get on to the European map from our David Goodman and Phil Aldrich about how the BOE is still dealing with their nightmare scenario. Now, this is a picture across the board. You can see the FTSE may have been hit to the E down one tenth of 8%, so it's a similar loss to what we're seeing here in the FTSE. The CAC 40 actually, the DAX, down four tenths of 8%, and three tenths of 8%. So the drumbeat of support for rising US rates continues as fed officials stress the need to question inflation. Neither market volatility, volatility, nor an economic downturn will deter them from their goal. I'd like to reach a point where policy is moderately restrictive. I see us as raising to a level that we believe is restrictive enough. Somewhere between four and a four and a half percent by the end of this year, and then hold at that level. It's headed for four and a half to four and three quarters per cent by sometime next year. Holding it there until we see inflation truly get close to two percent. Until we are confident. You have to understand the limitation of your data. You have to understand the limitations of your models, but you still need to use them to face your policy decisions on. I think we're quite a ways away from a pause. I anticipate additional rate hikes into early next year. Well, we're now joined by Riches Aldana, Portfolio Manager for Global Equity Income at the EVA investors and Christina Kino from our markets team. So thank you both for joining us. Christina, just set up the scene for us. So the market is kind of like, yeah, okay. Let's just wait to see what the US jobs report. I mean, that changes everything. Absolutely, Francine. I mean, we saw the earlier optimism in the prospects of a fed pivot, which was very quickly quashed again by the chorus of policy makers from the US, really hammering home the point that they really are not done yet. And so we've really seen a lot of the optimism fizzling out into the day's closest to the jobs report. And now it really does feel like a holding pattern. And a lot really rise on the fact that this jobs report could be kind of what spells the difference between that pivot narrative saying alive or being just completely dead at this point. Yeah, this Richard kind of goes to the conundrum, but also it's so before we talk about US jobs, is there a concern that the it's just, you know, difficult to read. What these big moves, even from OPEC or, you know, the jobs report mean for markets that we kind of have this volatility on like equities up and then down and how do you navigate that today? Yeah, it's a really good question. And look, you know, everyone's eyes will be on this jobs report later. And it sort of feels like right now the sort of current market psyche is bad news is good news, right? So it seems like people are hoping for a relatively weak number. Now, look, having said that, anyone expecting a fed pivot in rates any time soon, frankly, you think is misguided. Look, the fight against inflation remains the main priority. And the reality is until we see concrete signs of inflation peaking and the likelihood is that means not just one, but a series of data points for CPI and particularly core inflation trending lower, then I think markets are going to continue to remain under pressure. I mean, I think that highlights really the fed officials that you showed said it all, right? It's very clear to us that central banks, you know, their primary focus is getting inflation on the control and secondary is economic growth, frankly. So look, you know, for us, that means, you know, given equity markets right now, it almost feels like the rate market is actually guiding, guiding the equity market. And we think that will continue to be the case. But the key for equity markets in our view is longer term yields. And that's really where you want to be focusing. So yes, you can see, you know, short term red expectations continue to trend higher, but the key for us is the 10 year yield. Right? You think back to the rally that we had, you know, mid-June to mid-August and gosh, doesn't have to feel like a long time ago now, that was primarily driven by that move lower in 10 years. So for us, focus on the 10 year yield is the key for the equity market. But Richard, so if you believe that actually central banks will stop at nothing, right, to keep inflation to control, should treasuries be at 5 percent? Well, look, I think again, short term, they can continue to push higher. There's no doubt about that. But I think that long end of the curve is where we will be watching closely right now in terms of, you know, the moves there. And I think that is really where you want to be focusing on right now. So we expect the fat narrative to sort of continue to remain hawkish, right? I know given where inflation is sitting right now, given the continuing pressures we're seeing, you know, whether it be geopolitically, whether it be currently in terms of supply chance, et cetera.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,444,2022-10-07 08:08:00
12219," continue to remain hawkish, right? I know given where inflation is sitting right now, given the continuing pressures we're seeing, you know, whether it be geopolitically, whether it be currently in terms of supply chains, et cetera, that are really continuing to pressure inflation right now. I think that hawkish narrative is here to stay for the time being, but I think, you know, focus on that long end and see how that behaves to really give you a sense of, I think, how equity markets will behave on the back of this. And Christine, whatever our most red story is on the Bloomberg terminal and the website is basically what Bill Gross is doing and what Pimco is doing. Absolutely, Francine, it's the return of the bond goals. Go figure. I mean, it's really interesting, right? Because we are at these levels of treasure yields where it finally is giving something back to investors after years, decades really of very, very low rates and really not getting anything for your bond investments. But it's an interesting time, though, that this trade is coming through because it contrasts very well with the fact that, you know, again, the Fed seems like it really will stop nothing at the moment to get to really get inflation under control. And so, you know, if you're somebody who believes that there is a recession coming just around a corner after the peak of the Fed cycle, then being a bond will make sense. But when will that trade start making money? Probably not until we see that peak and that peak is currently priced for the first quarter of next year. I feel like it's bell bottoms. They always come back. I mean, it's cycles. I believe it's got it. It is cyclical. Reaching the bonds in bell bottoms. There you go. I'm sure there's an index tracking here, maybe two standard deviation. I'm sure that I'm sure there is. Yes. Richard, is there a chart, actually, where you look at to see something turning? And I don't know whether it's housing. I know we used to look at the consumer all the time, but housing is under so much pressure in various economies of the G7. Is that almost more telling than what the consumer does? Yeah, look, housing is absolutely indicator. And like we've seen in the US, you know, a significant home pricing increases over the past years. And you know, understandably, we think that's going to cool down. Now having said that in the US, when you think about the market dynamics, there's still a significant, you know, on the supply side, you know, significant shortage right now. So we think actually that will provide some element of support to us housing for homeowners, you know, already that are sort of sitting on a pretty decent amount of appreciation in that asset. We think, you know, we think that'll still remain. Now that's kind of why you've seen, I think, the US consumer has remained relatively robust, but look, our focus is always on company fundamentals. And our view is still, there's quite a significant dislocation right now between, you know, underlying company fundamentals and share prices. So, you know, whilst we're, you know, it feels like we're in the eye of the storm right now in terms of that market volatility. The reality is, I think you can find some resilience right now. And I think some value, you know, we reference some of the companies in the tech sector like Savalfa, Bet, Microsoft, FISA. These companies are still generating plenty of cash. Balance sheets are really strong and many cases net cash on the balance sheet. And these companies have, you know, sustained pricing power. So again, if your belief is the inflation remains elevated and certainly, you know, that feels like the case short term, we think, you know, these companies actually have pricing power to deal with that. And, you know, when Q3 earnings comes through, I think that's one key element we will be focusing on is that pricing power of companies. Richard, thanks so much, Richard Saldana.

First word news, here is Leigh Ann Garenza. Hi, Leigh Ann. Hi, Francine. The Thai Prime Minister is visiting the scene of the country's worst mass killing today after ordering an urgent investigation into the tragedy. A 34-year-old former police sergeant killed at least 38 people, most of them children in a rampage, which began at a daycare centre in the country's north. After fleeing the scene, the assailant returned home and killed his family before taking his own life. Now, a US judge has halted the court case against Elon Musk over his $44 billion Twitter buyout, giving the parties until October the 28 to complete the deal. The ruling is a wind for Musk, who had accused Twitter of, quote, not taking yes for an answer after he revived his bid. Twitter had objected to that request to pause the case, saying Musk should close the deal next week. Swedish investigators say evidence points to recent ruptures of Nord Stream gas pipelines being caused by a deliberate act.

This really security service says its investigation has increased suspicions of sabotage, but did not indicate how the detonations actually happened or who might be responsible. And President Joe Biden is pardoning thousands of Americans convicted for possession of marijuana and ordering a review of its legal status in a major step towards decriminalization.

We are so much now coming up. The European Union explores the idea of a cap on gas prices as leaders make them proud. We'll go there live next and this is Bloomberg. There's more activity in the fusion world than ever. In not just in government research labs, there's also an emerging private fusion industry that attracted billions of dollars in capital in recent years. Governments and private investors alike realize that we've got to find a solution that's going to allow us to get to net zero targets. This is one of the hardest but most rewarding problems that humanity could work on. Ultimately we all want the same thing. We want someone to put electricity on the grid from a fusion power station as quickly as possible. Frankly the scale of the challenge, 3000 gigawatts of fossil fuel to replace. There's not many things they can do that. In fact there may only be fusion that can really do that. And while many in the scientific community predict fusion power will take decades, some in the private fusion space, believe we'll get there in just a few years as soon as the 2030s.

Now you leaders are arriving for talks on the second day of a European summit being held in the shadows of the war in Ukraine. Europe's energy crisis is set to dominate the median Prague, while speaking last night, the Dutch Prime Minister Mark Krutte indicated that the EU could strike a deal on a gas price cap in the near future. But you feel here is that there is an overriding willingness to make that happen, that of course with the discussed that's further between the 27, that will probably lead to decisions not tomorrow but in the very near future. Of course we have already done a lot, but we will discuss issues like could the price cap work, is the Arberia model something we would replicate, how could we work on joint purchasing, all these issues will be discussed.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,446,2022-10-07 08:16:15
12221," how could we work on joint purchasing? All these issues will be discussed. The focus on gas price camp, what can we expect from the meeting? Yes, I have, Francine, and to add out to the comments by the Dutch Prime Minister yesterday saying, do not expect a big decision, but a lot of brainstorming today, I spoke with the Greek Prime Minister, it was very tough on the commission. He said, we've already lost a lot of time, we need to see drastic, temporary, but drastic intervention in the energy market, prices needs to go down, and he said, the deadline by now is clear, there needs to be a proposal, something specific, and a decision to be made by the next European Council, which as you know will happen in Brussels, on the 20th and 21st of October. So that is in two weeks time, the Greek Prime Minister is saying, the way I see it, that's our deadline, we cannot waste more time, quote, we've already lost a lot of time. So Maria, there's a lot of urgency on this action to bring down gas prices, when could we actually see it happen for real? Yes, and Francine, that has been the back and forth, and we've talked about this since the end of August, remember prices were rocketing at that time, there has been some sliding in terms of the prices, but for a lot of companies, in particular households, that is not enough. So this summit in two weeks time is shaping it to be when you listen to some of the conversations behind the scenes, is really the crunch moment for the European Union. Now there is an energy ministers meeting that will happen next week, perhaps I can iron out some of the technicalities, but the feeling that we get is that a decision, some type of decision on this press cap needs to be taken before the end of the month. And of course, then that means before November, and that is really on the winter season, the heating season for a lot of households really truly begins. Maria, thank you so much, Maria today, they're on the tough winter months ahead, she's covering, of course, that priceless summit for us. Richard Saldana, portfolio manager for Global Equity and Climate Viva Investors, still with us. Richard, when you look at the winter months, what does it mean, and we go into the earnings season, what does it mean for a lot of companies? I know the smaller companies are at least 20% of, for example, companies here in the UK say they may not survive the winter if it gets much, much worse. Yeah, you're absolutely right. I mean, the sort of winter situation, I think, is going to be very key right now, and look at Svesa, the current energy shortages that we're seeing in Europe, you know, are going to mean increased focus, particularly on companies in terms of energy costs, etc. But we think actually there is an opportunity in terms of the sort of pivot that we're going to see to more renewable sources of power, right? And that's going to mean significant investment into networks, electricity grids. And so, you know, there are companies that I think that can offer solutions in, or you think about the likes of National Grid in the UK on the transmission distribution side. You think even to the wider European industrial complex, you know, you've got companies such as Schneider, Zeeman's that offer products to help, you know, manage electricity consumption and buildings, digitalization of electricity grid. So there are companies that I think will also have a key role to play if you're like in terms of helping deal with the challenges of the coming winter, and also just the sort of continued focus on the energy transition that's going to take place. Yes, certainly is going to be a challenge, but we also think will be an opportunity as well for some companies. So Richard, overall, where do you see, I mean, you know, the earnings season, we, I guess, got a warning shot from semiconductors and some of the chip makers. Where do you see value as we get into the earnings season? Yeah, look, you know, going into the earnings season, you know, we actually expect earnings to remain relatively resilient. And you know, that might sound, you know, given the sort of challenges we're seeing from the macro perspective, a little hard to sort of understand, but look, the theme so far this year has been, you know, companies have delivered pretty strong top line growth and, you know, demand underlying demands to remain as well to be strong across, you know, a broad range of industries. But you're sort of continuing to see that margin squeeze play out and that's really impact to the bottom line. Now, we think that's going to continue to remain the case. We don't expect, you know, large sways of cuts to, you know, fully a guidance for this year, but I think companies are certainly going to get questioned a lot more on their outlook for next year. And I think there's certainly some element of risk, if you like, to to earnings there. But just just to take your question, just on the semi's complex right now, and I think this is really interesting.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,447,2022-10-07 08:20:59
12222," They're out look for next year and I think there's certainly some element of risk if you like to to earnings there But just just to take your question just on the semi's complex right now And I think this is a really interesting area because you know, it's clear to us that actually that there's quite a Dislocation going on right now here, right? So you think about areas such as PC smartphone markets and and you can see Demand there is weeping some elements of you know saturation we do on the smartphone side But actually if you look at demand for auto chips and dust your chips that remains relatively strong So what that's saying to us is that actually you know within semi's if you're selective you can also find find opportunities there Richard, thanks so much Richard Salda and other portfolio manager for global equity income at Aviva investors now coming up Surging synced stocks.

12223," MD and Samsung have heard the chip sector and in the SIN stock space, cannabis companies rose on President Biden's pardon of marijuana possession. Now, the US President is also ordering a review of the drug's legal status. Now, for more on all of this, we're doing by Joe Euston from our equity team. First of all, Joe is cannabis. I mean, so first of all, the cannabis announcement is moving market. So let's just think about that for one second, but is it still even a SIN stock? Well, that's the big debate, isn't it? Yeah, obviously he could change now, given that he's announced, potentially, this review, and it might not even be illegal anymore. So, yeah, maybe we'll have to move it out of the SIN stock category. Maybe we move it into ESG, you don't know. But, yeah, there's obviously a few stocks moving higher in the US in pre-market, TILRAY, Canopy companies like that, some of them are listed in Canada as well, obviously. And there was a good story our colleagues did on an ETF that sort about 40% immediately after this news. So, as you said, it's interesting to see the weed stocks being pushed higher today. I mean, how many weed stocks are there? I see, you know, promotion, I don't know why they've targeted me, but there's always the CBD like gummy is that I keep on getting harassed by a lot better. Yeah, that's right. So, in the US and Canada, there's quite a lot. So, well, there's probably around 10 or so, and then a few ETFs as well, a few different ETFs. In Europe, there's barely any, and that's because the laws are much stricter and much far behind in terms of changes in regulation. There's a few penny stocks listed on AIM, where the regulations are a lot lighter and they're all up around 10% today, but it's mainly US. Okay, so from SINS got stocks, TILRAY, SKEERCITY stocks, what's happening with chip makers? So, chip makers, three reports out. Two were negative. One was good. So, Samsung and AMD in the US, they were negative. Samsung, obviously, in Asia. And TILRAY, one semi, was actually a bit better, their sales better and expected. So, it's kind of played into the news that we've had recently, where we had some cautious commentary around Apple's production. Obviously, one of the biggest customers for those firms being Apple with the iPhone production. But I think the most interesting thing is the clean energy space and the demand that's coming for the semi is there. I think, if you speak to investors, they think that that's probably undervalued. There's a bit of value there, I think. I mean, I used to have the Glencourt, you'd always say, look out for a car bolt. We need cobalt. Hey, we're going to transition to it. Yeah, those strange metals that get used, and nobody really knows what they're for. But get stopped, don't do it. Thanks so much. Joe Houston there, from our equities TILRAY.

And so that's what we're doing. Over all office angst, well, the White House scrambles to respond to OPEX dramatic output cut, President Biden warns Russia's threats to use nuclear weapons. Israel plus chipping away. Samson profits, sings by a third, as semiconductor firms warn of a breathtaking drop in demand. Well, good morning, everyone. And welcome to Bloomberg's surveillance early edition of front scene Laquah here in London. Now, the hotly anticipated US jobs report you out later today has a potential to tip the scales towards another jump of federated hike next month. The economies expected have added 250,000 jobs in September. While average hourly earnings are projected to rise by 0.3% month over months and 5.1% from a year ago. Now, for more, we're joined by Marcus Ashworth from Bloomberg, opinion Marcus. This is hard for me, because I just really want to talk to you about the UK. I'm kidding. The jobs report in the US, what are you expecting from it? Well, I think the interesting thing is that 250,000 is still quite a big number. So it's not actually in recent terms that big. I mean, it's probably going to be the weakest or lowest since April 2021. Nonetheless, it's likely to still lower that unemployment rate down from 3.6%, perhaps by a notch. And the key, I think, for the Fed is just this labor market. It's just so strong that cannot be seen dependent despite the world trying to push them, and even Treasury Secretary Yellen, puts a little bit of shade on J-Power by saying that people will think about the outside world, which is clearly suffering from the super strong dollar. But the labor-top participation rate is going up. The unemployment rates go probably going down. That is just super hot. Your people coming back into the market and still unemployment is super low. So it's very difficult. I mean, you saw yesterday for a lot of Fed heads saying, we've got to stick with it more rate heights, to no pivot yet. Don't talk about rate cuts until 2023 at all. And I think they have to keep this up for as long as they possibly can. So something really does break in the US. How's the market clearly showing the first signs of that? So are there any doves left at the Fed? Should there be? Do they just need to make sure that they get the message to the markets that they mean business? They've been very impressive at Fed and sticking tight ranks unlike Prince Stepan Kavinkov, or even the ECB. They've done a pretty good job. Even people like Cash Carrey, Daily, have been very clear that they are sticking with a line. The only one perhaps to move away from that slightly was Leo Brainard, who raised similar concepts to what Yan and I mentioned earlier said that there are issues about what's",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,450,2022-10-07 08:34:04
12225," The only one perhaps to move away from that slightly was Leo Brainard, who raised similar concepts to what Jan and I mentioned earlier said that there are issues about what's going on the rest of the world and that will come back and fight US hard at some point. But for the moment I think they're sticking together, they're going to go on a sure 75 basis point on the second. Unless this payroll number is heavily negative and there's lots of other stuff over provisions, I suspect the overall picture is just particularly the labour market is so strong and they've got to keep the fire and inflation going apart. All right, Marcus, thanks so much. Marcus Ashworth there was a nice little roundup of what we can expect from the US jobs and then when you speak to of course a lot of people about what they're looking for the US jobs report is how the market interprets it. So there's two things. First of all you see whether the economy is strong enough to withhold what the Fed does next but of course the main question which is also after we have that huge news from OPEC plus is how the market interprets it. So one thinking is of course the economy is down so they'll high glass. The other is saying inflation is the only thing that the Fed cares about. So it's the little nuances that may make a huge difference. If you look at US equity futures for the moment they're seeing a bit of pressure. Investors again awaiting that latest pay rolls report. It's a similar picture. I think we can have a board out looking at some of the markets out there. It's a similar picture actually for European stocks. A Federal Reserve officials dousing expectations for a quick call to rate hikes European stocks opening lower. Now let's get straight to your Bloomberg business flash here's Leigh Ann Gertz. Hi Leigh Ann. Hi Francine. Credit Suisse has announced a cash debt buyback worth some 3 billion Swiss francs a show of financial strength after market volatility earlier in the week. The offer includes euro and pound sterling debt securities worth up to a billion euros and a separate offer for US dollar securities up to $2 billion. The bank shares have lost more than half they valued this year after a series of scandals. Now a US judge has halted the court case against Elon Musk over his $44 billion dollar Twitter buyout giving the parties until October the 28th to complete the deal. The ruling is a wind for Musk who had accused Twitter of quote not taking guess for an answer after he revived his bid. Twitter had objected to the request to pause the case saying Musk should close the deal next week. Samsung has reported its first profit drops since 2019 operating profit fell 32 percent to $7.7 billion for the quarter ending September. That data underscores the depth of a global PC and memory chip downturn sales also missed estimates. And that's your Bloomberg business flash Francine. Thank you so much. The UN's latest snapshot of global food prices show a slight drop which has been the case every month since it hit a record back in March. Food inflation is still elevated and threats to crops remain in the wake of Russia's war in Ukraine. We're joining us now as Megan Dresden, Albert R. E. M. A. Agricultural Report. So Megan, what does the latest from the UN food price index actually mean for global inflation? Sure. So the data today from the UN says that food prices dropped for a sixth month in September. So that's quite a prolonged slump. It was in a dramatic decrease only about 1 percent lower but it brings the gauge now to its lowest since January. That's overall good news for food inflation. It means that eventually this could trickle through to supermarkets. But obviously there's a lot of other factors that affect food prices as well. Things like energy costs, labor costs, transport costs which have all been elevated as you know. And one key thing we're still watching is that you know Ukraine crop exports have been picking up these past month or two after the deal had been struck for them to resume seaborn trade. But that deal is due to expire in November. So a lot is going to hinge on whether officials can agree to extend it. If Ukrainian agricultural stripments will continue in the months ahead. So Megan, what factors will influence food inflation in the weeks ahead? Sure. So as I mentioned, you know, the situation in Ukraine is pretty vital for food prices going forward there. A major exporter. You know.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,451,2022-10-07 08:38:12
12226," I mentioned, you know, the situation in Ukraine is pretty vital for food prices going forward there. A major exporter, as you know, of wheat, of corn, of vegetable oil. Often we're also watching, you know, where demand stands. Given that inflation has been buffeting consumers on all fronts, well things like meat sales or dairy sales decline, some of those more higher price food options. And as always, the weather is a key thing to watch. You know, we're in for another year of the Nina and all eyes are going to be shifting to how crops are fearing in South America in the coming months. So those are some of the watch points where we're all keeping track of here on the food price front. Megan, thanks so much. I'm going to get yours in Albury. There are EMEA agricultural reporter now coming up our exclusive conversation with the Pakistani climate minister Sherry Wemman, who discussed COP and the humanitarian crisis in Pakistan following catastrophic flooding. We're coming up next and this is Bloomberg. There is an epic saying in Italy when it comes to family generations that the first generation creates the second generation expands and the third generation destroys. And that's almost what happened in the Gucci story. So, Hating and Love again. Now I would have a much more experience about those who say that I love you and then they trade you. The Gucci family was the strength but also the weakness of the label. The situation became dire with Gucci's finances. They were not able to pay salaries. Gucci is really teetering on the brink of the stage. The president has made it very clear that this is a significant focus. For the intersection of Wall Street and Washington, nobody covers politics like Bloomberg. Economics, finance, politics, this is Bloomberg surveillance early edition. I'm Francie Mackle here in London. Now we're just getting a bit of breaking news out of the ECB stepping up on press run banks to exercise caution on bonuses. Now this I'm sure is in direct retaliation or certainly a slapping of the risks to the UK and to this government that decided just a couple of weeks ago to no longer have that bonus cap. So we'll see where it ends up by the ECB who of course is the oversight regulatory body for a lot of the banks in Europe saying that they should step up press run banks to exercise caution on bonuses. Now climate change has been more visible than ever this year. Summertime rains, super charged by rising temperatures, flooded a third of Pakistan. Estimates of the damage have tripled to $30 billion since the end of August. Now the toll of destruction is hard to fathom. 33 million people affected with at least 2 million homes wrecked or damaged. Now the number of dead stands at around 1,700.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,452,2022-10-07 08:42:13
12227," Now, the toll of destruction is hard to fathom. 33 million people affected, with at least 2 million homes wrecked or damaged. Now, the number of dead stands at around 1,700, and that's before counting those lost to malaria, dysentery and typhoid, plus alluming food crisis caused by ruined croplans. Joining us now to talk about the devastation is Pakistan's Minister of Climate Change, Sherry Remont. Thank you so much, Minister, for coming on Bloomberg to talk about this. What exactly is the current situation on the flooding today? Thank you very much. The current situation is as you noted, 33 million affected, which is the meta climate event of the century. We know of no other country that has been ripped apart like this by climate-induced events. Now, we are home to floods or monsoons. It is nothing like this. We now have 20.6 million people in acute need. Still, we have service 33 million, as you are saying. We are trying and struggling to do that. But just for perspective, 33 million is 7 million more than a big country like Australia's entire population. And it is a very large number of absolutely service. We are trying, as you mentioned, a health emergency looming to get doctors into the crisis-prone areas, to bring to the table services to the 70 percent women and children that have been affected, that are 70 percent of the 33 million affected. And 4 percent of the affected population is actually pregnant and giving birth in under tarpones with a not necessarily hygienic. So, yes, the malaria, the other one diseases is the next big crisis. But still in the life-saving phase, after 17 hard weeks. So, how will you fund some of these damages? Minister, do you feel like you have been supporting the term of money being sent to Pakistan? Yes, we have been, I have just returned from Geneva where we were co-authoring or co-sponsoring to the second flash appeal that the UN was kind enough to put out with us. And yes, that has been a hub for international donations to come in. Many countries have stepped up both in kind and in resources. They are transferring. But you see, my ask is very simple. It is that climate affected countries who's carbon footprint is less than 1 percent of global GHG emissions should not be having to bear the burden of other people's contributions. And here we are afflicted with an event, catastrophe that nobody has seen before in living memory. And we are bearing the burden of it pretty much on our own with some help from friends. And yes, people have wiped their eyes and felt very bad for the victims. Because they're real people with futures that have just been exterminated overnight. We have a sustaining exogenous shocks to our economy, to our crops, to our livelihoods. And there's a real worry as to how we will just even finish the relief effort for 33 million, let alone rehabilitate and reconstruct that is climate resilient. But so Minister, how will the government make some of the mitigation projects, for example, given the tight financing that you laid out just now? Yes, the mitigation is one of our concerns. It's a goal that we've declared a contribution we've made at our nationally determined contributions, NDCs. And we are on course with that. But let me just also just say that a mitigation has costs associated with it. It is more about a just energy transition than anything else. And just energy transition has costed at $101 billion just very clearly without us changing from fossil fuels to totally going renewable. This doesn't even include the costs of transmission lines. We are, however, on course to renewables because that just to help with our own import.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,453,2022-10-07 08:46:42
12228," even include the costs of transmission lines. We are, however, on costs to renewables because that just to help with our own import bills for energy right now with supply chains being so affected all over the heart of Eurasia. But really adaptation needs to be at the core of even the COP27's agenda because this is what societies, developing societies are facing on the ground. And adaptation fund exists but it had never been capitalized. No, are we, minutes, access, you know, access financing that responds to climate disasters with agility or the kind of speed and scale we need. So, Minister, what do you need from, you know, COP concretely and how will you manage to convince some of the countries that could give funding that this money will go specifically into climate projects where, for example, there's a stoppage of leakage. Well, look, first of all, the entire COP conferences are now the last ones, the last few are premised on a bargain between what is known as the global south and the global north. That bargain has to factor in the most important thing right now, which is the survival of countries that are in the front line of climate change. I refuse to answer questions that are only on the agenda of richer countries that have gotten wealthy on the back of fossil fuel developments. And I will not be hectic and lectured about our other goals. Right now, it's a fight for survival for many countries when the front line were exposed in multiple calamities to global warming, to the way Greece is global warming. So adaptation has to be front and center as does loss and damage. It can't be a talking point as it used to be. It is a very real issue. As I said, it's a fight for survival, even for the island countries, the small islands. We, however, want to be not, we don't want to be adversarial. We want to be part of the solution, not the problem. And we are the leaders of the group of 77 plus China at this conference. We'll be sharing that, our Prime Minister, our Foreign Minister. Everyone will be here to make a strong case for climate justice, which is, as I said, the pivot of all negotiations at the last two or three cops. That's what it's based on. And it must take account both medication, adaptation, as well as loss and damage. Thank you so much, Sherry Raman. There, Pakistan's Minister of Climate Change was a very, very important conversation. And I know Minister will speak many times before and after COP27. Now, coming up, could the U.S. jobs report push the Fed to another jumbo hike? It's just a few hours away, so we'll keep you up today. This is Bloomberg. There's more activity in the fusion world than ever. And not just in government research labs. There's also an emerging private fusion industry that's attracted billions of dollars in capital in recent years. And government and private investors.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,454,2022-10-07 08:50:58
12229," Last in government research labs, there's also an emerging private fusion industry that attracted billions of dollars in capital in recent years. Governments and private investors alike realize that we've got to find a solution that's going to allow us to get to net zero targets. This is one of the hardest but most rewarding problems that humanity could work on. Ultimately, we all want the same thing. We want someone to put Lexus Cionner, grade from a fusion power station as quickly as possible. Frankly, the scale of the challenge, 3000 gigawatts of fossil fuel to replace. There's not many things they can do that. In fact, there may only be fusion that can really do that. And while many in the scientific community predict fusion power will take decades, some in the private fusion space, believe we'll get there in just a few years as soon as the thing conference starts. What we do is a mistake. One, it's not... it's not substantiated by energy markets, by the global economy, or by any other metric. It was unnecessary at this time. Prices are already elevated. There was no real imminent threat of a... of a major collapse in prices that would necessitate a... a cut. I understand that, you know, I've been watched OPEC for a long time. There's a difference to what they announce, and what they actually do. OPEC's quotas are... they're producing their quotas by more than the two billion... barrel cut that they've announced. So, let's see if this actually has any impact... whatsoever in actual production numbers. Right. We are going to continue to work at home and with our allies. So... we're going to work with our U.S. companies to ensure that they continue to increase production. And make sure that we have the refining capacity. We're down a couple of refineries due to some accidents... maintenance, to make sure that we have enough inventory... along the East Coast and parts of the Midwest. And the West Coast to make sure that we have supplies. And we're going to continue to focus on bringing down prices. And to that end, we have still some work to do on the SBR. Okay, almost there's a lot to unpack there. So, one of the reasons that OPEC talked about doing this was in essence to incentivize spare capacity. Higher oil price now to get more oil out of the ground. Because if not, it's going to stay in the ground. And there will be a shortage. If there is some truth to that, why not take that view with U.S. producers? Why go to your allies? We have oil here that we can get out. Why not pick up the phone to oil production companies and say, guys, what can we do to get you to produce more? Alex, there's an assumption based in your question that we're not doing that. For the last... Even publicly, for the last several months, we have had conversations with the leadership of almost every major oil-producing in the United States. Told them, what do you need to be incentivized to increase production? We've had that honest conversation. They have what they need. They do not need anything else. I've had this conversation with them. But I think, honestly, if we talk to the industry, they would point out that it's the threat of regulation down the road. That's the issue. Alex, I take issue with that. Okay. I don't think that that's actually accurate. I think, in fact, if you look at where the... It's always about where you put your money. CapEx has increased among the major producers of the United States this year. They're increasing production. They announced those increases in CapEx just several months ago, but it takes time for that to materialize in production. We've seen them increase production. We know that the projection is for them to increase production into 2023. We have first a couple of quarters of 2023.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,455,2022-10-07 08:56:40
12230," Materializing production. We've seen them increase production. We know that the projection is for them to increase production into 2023. First couple of quarters of 2023. They have what they need. Well, that was Amos Hawks' time, the US senior advisor for global energy security reacting to OPEC plus decision. Now, investors laser focus today on that key US jobs, print you at 1.30 p.m. London time. So, it's more, well, on more, on what I can't get my words that I'm so excited about the jobs report. Let's bring in young Patrick Barnard for analysis on what to expect. So, JP, just give us a quick wrap of the action so far this morning. First of all. Yeah, you're absolutely right. I'm excited as well on this. Dross report. It's the next big data point that we are getting. And the market is a little bit sideline right now as everybody is keen to see that number and what it means going forward. We saw several people laying out a little bit of a wish list for the rally to continue and the jobs report is certainly on it. So, as we said before, we want to see like this Goldilocks number that shows us the economy is cooling, that the job market is cooling. But it can't be too bad. So, we avoid a hard landing in the market. In other things, we have chip makers presenting us earnings that were like breathtaking missing expectations. So, we see chip stocks in Europe falling this morning. And of course, we have the wheat story, the cannabis story. It's already rising yesterday on plans of the US administration to treat the drug differently in terms of legal or law enforcement. So, what does the market want to see from that job report? Because they've been, you know, flipping a little bit when we've had these big data as it's unclear what that would do to Fed calls. Yeah, absolutely. And the sentiment right now or the consensus out there among the strategies and the investors that I talk to is still that everybody is on the sideline on that latest rally, saying it's driven by technical factors and mechanical buying and not really like in due to a change of fundamentals. We have the oil story, which is not helping at the moment. So, we want to see the job number and more importantly, the inflation number next week as a helpful indicator that the economy is cooling. JP, thanks so much, Jan Patrick Burner. They're joining us from Frankfurt with the latest on the markets. Now Bloomberg's surveillance early edition continues the next hour. Matt Miller, Katie Lines in New York and Edwards here in London. And this is Bloomberg. My grandfather got into the mutual fund business because the average investor could not get a diversified stock portfolio. And it was too dangerous to put, you know, your entire savings in it just a couple of companies. So, the mutual fund was created to give a diversified expert management at a reasonable price. Today, we have a phenomenon where companies are waiting much longer to go public. And so, in 2000, the average company went public after three years. Now, companies are waiting nine to ten years because there's so much money available in the private markets. As a matter of fact, there are half the number of public companies that there were in 2000. And there's five times the number of private...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,456,2022-10-07 08:59:51
12231," number of public companies that there were in 2000 and there's five times the number of private equity back companies. So just from an investible universe, you look at the private markets and it's, you know, significantly bigger. So the question is that return that used to be captured in the public markets is now captured in the private markets. But the problem is you know is you're really tied up for a long time when you invest in a private equity fund. And so trying to figure out a way to solve the same problem my grandfather was trying to solve which is how do you bring those returns responsibly, the democratization of the private markets to the retail investors. And I describe it as a bit of like running the scissors. This is a great tool if you use it appropriately. And so we're focused on trying to figure out responsibly bringing it in to the average investor. So you've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. They have been in and seen it. Lots of Bloombergs. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. What does it mean? What does it mean? It means they have a Bloomberg. We got to look at where the situations are fragile where the higher for longer story could potentially break things. The economy structurally is also changing at the same time that we might see some downturn dynamics driven by monetary policy. If the volatility increases and you see a dramatic shift either because the economy is much worse than we expect or because of other factors we don't know. If we have some positive surprises, the market's looking for good news. I think it'll be out. We do expect that the jobs numbers will be something for everyone really. This is Bloomberg surveillance, early edition with Anna Edwards, Matt Miller and Kayleigh Lyons. It's 10 a.m. in London, 5 a.m. in New York and 5 p.m. in Hong Kong. Our top stories today. Weeding for a hot U.S. labor market to cool off. Investors in the Federal Reserve will be looking at today's September jobs report closely. Raising fears of an Armageddon, President Biden warns that Vladimir Putin's threats to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine are real and wonders if there's an off-ramp. And Credit Suits show some financial muscle after a tough week. The Swiss Bank is offering a $3 billion cash debt by back. Welcome to Bloomberg's surveillance, early edition. I'm Danny Burger in London and for Anna Edwards, Matt Miller and Kayleigh Lyons are in New York and Kayleigh. Let me bring you the first to wish you not just a happy Friday, but a happy jobs day. Indeed, and happy jobs day to you as well. Danny, 3.5 hours to go until that key payrolls report here in the U.S. We are all waiting and watching for it. Of course, in Asia, they had to trade before they got those figures. And it was broadly a down day when it comes to equities. The MSCI Asia Pacific index is a whole down about 1.1%. Some real underperformance coming through from technology stocks. The Hangseung tech index, for example, down more than three percentage points. And part of that problem has to do with the chip makers after AMD here in the U.S. yesterday after the bell gave a third quarter preliminary view on revenue that mis-expectations by more than a billion dollars. So it fuels concerns about a demand slowdown in the chip space. And you saw that evident in Samsung's results as well. It reported a 32% drop in operating profit. Big decline there. What's interesting is you didn't see a big decline for the stock. It was down as much as 2% at one point in the Korean session, but ended the day lower by just about 2.10% of 1%. And of course, finally, as we await that crucial economic data that jobs report here in the U.S., you are seeing some upward pressure on yields around the world. And that was definitely true in Australia where the 10-year yield rose by seven bases.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,457,2022-10-07 09:04:11
12232," Crucial economic data that jobs report here in the US, you are seeing some upward pressure on yields around the world and that was definitely true in Australia where the 10-year yield rose by seven basis points met. All right here in US futures we see a little bit of a drop but really not much movement after the drop we saw yesterday about 1% on the cash trades of 37, 44 on the S&P 500. The 10-year yield coming up even higher now 383, 47 so those high yields persist that could be a good thing for some investors who want return. It could be a problem for the stock market which may be why we see some headwinds into futures this morning. The Bloomberg Dollar Index coming down a little bit 1334 still to relatively high level but I think I saw some gains on the pound for example earlier today all the way up to a dollar 12. Who's going to pay a dollar 12 for a pound and then 9x crude. Coming up to 88, 86 still not a huge move considering the 2 million barrel a day cut but of course everyone says it's only going to be a million barrels a day and there are still those concerns about demand in a recession. Danny? Matt you asked who's going to pay for a dollar 12 a pound. I mean me I got to my life is split between the UK and the US. Anyway that's besides it's okay it's we all mourn for this. Anyway besides the point we are looking at European stocks off the lows. A lot of these regional benchmarks little change are going to might be this sort of idea that we're just waiting for the jobs report starting the day out negative. We do have some of the Nordic regions for those who can see the map. It's some of these up here they are negative it's a lot where the tech sector lives so again it's off that story Kaylee you were mentioning some of the chip stocks doing poorly but yes we do see strength in some of these European currencies be at the pound be at the euro itself but we're back in this environment where it's just about the dollar really dominated by that and it's trading in somewhat of a tight range today just considering we are waiting for that jobs report. Elsewhere the gain in yields it's not just happening in the US it's happening in Europe as well. We can't forget we have those ECB accounts yesterday where they talked about the need to continue to hike. There's also an ECB study out saying that it's the demand side that's increasingly contributing to inflation which reinforces this need for hawkishness from the ECB. So German 10 year yields 5 basis points UK 10 year yields up 3 basis points Goldman Sachs also warning that we might continue to see losses from UK 10 year yields the worst is an over despite the fact that the BO we stepped into the market of course those operations and next week and finally Nat gas down 50% from its highs of course that debate going on in Prague right now Matt. Okay blah blah blah blah blah. All anyone cares about for the next few hours is the US jobs data. Maybe backing the case for more Fed hikes maybe traders will see a pivot in it Mike McKee Bloomberg International Economics Policy correspondent joins us now for more on what to expect Mike. It's nice to be wanted you know for at least a few hours. We're likely to see some numbers that as one of the people said at the top of the show has something for everyone. The forecast is for 255,000 jobs that's the consensus of economists pulled by Bloomberg which would be a sequential drop but not a drop of a cliff 3.7% is your unemployment rate no change average hourly earnings drop a little bit which would make the Fed happy. The participation rates interesting because the Fed's kind of given up on that getting a whole lot bigger with so many people having retired and or having long COVID. The question is what matters most to the Fed today and that is going to be the jobs numbers. Last five months in a row the jobs numbers have come in stronger than consensus and if that happens again today you could see a reaction in the markets. There's a lot of fear about what happens if the Fed has to go for longer and higher. But the line that you see that if you were looking at the at the bar chart that I'm showing on TV and you're not if you're on radio but anyway we have been seeing we've been seeing a sequential decline a decline almost every month of those last five months and that's what the Fed wants to see. They don't want to see jobs dropping tremendously quickly but they do want to see them coming down a little bit and then it starts to get real because we have CPI next week we have the third quarter GDP at the end of the month and then the Fed meeting on November 2nd what are they going to do and that's one week before election day.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,458,2022-10-07 09:08:38
12233," CPI next week, we have the third quarter GDP at the end of the month and then the Fed meeting on November 2nd. What are they going to do? And that's one week before Election Day. So a lot of things coming together towards the end of this month and this is the kickoff for that. Well, Mike, as you alluded to, the Fed would like to see some softening. They would like to see slack in the labor market. What is the line between slack that's good and slack that's not so good and maybe causes them to blink? Well, they're going to blink now. It's not going to be because it's slack. It's going to be because things get tighter. If we had a significantly higher jobs number, maybe over 300,000, then that would worry the Fed a little bit, worry the markets a lot. The Fed though thinks that it's going to take time to bring the numbers down and it's going to take even longer for the unemployment rate to go up. So they're hoping that we just see a continual progress that shows their medicine is starting to work. All right. Yeah, let's hope it is, and so the medicine doesn't get much worse from here. Michael, thank you so much. Bloomberg's Mike McKee there who will help lead our coverage of jobs. They were going to hear from U.S. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh following that report. 9.40 AM, New York Times, when you can expect that 9.40 PM in London. President Biden is worried that Vladimir Putin's threats to use tactical nuclear weapons are real and could lead to quote, Armageddon. At a fundraiser in New York, the president said the U.S. is trying to figure out the Russian leaders off ramp. Maria, today, Bloomberg's European correspondent joins us now from Prague, where EU leaders are gathering for a two-day summit. So Maria, these comments from Biden, how widely shared are they amid the European leaders that you've been speaking to there? Well, Danny, to me, I'm very telling that they didn't really want to comment on this. For a lot of Europeans, this nuclear subject is something that you don't just casually drop in a conversation. But again, this is going back to initial comments that were made by Vladimir Putin a few weeks ago when he said, if the Russian integrity, the territorial integrity of our country, is compromised. We have weapons that we could use, of course, alluding to nuclear. And he suggested this is not a bluff, this is not a joke. Then, of course, the president of the United States today will yesterday hinting that this is something you have to take seriously, not a lot of reaction from the French, not a lot of reaction from the Germans. But yes, there is reaction from some of the Eastern European countries who say, and they view this slightly different, they say that this is something that Vladimir Putin will always bring up, that this is bait. And if you take the bait, it is a sign of weakness. So when I spoke to the Lithuanian president, what he told me is, let's focus on deterrence, deterrence, deterrence. Let's make it very clear to the Kremlin that they do not want to test the limits to our response. All right. Bloomberg's Maria today. Today, I was scary stuff. Thank you so much for your reporting. Meanwhile, we have some breaking news we want to bring you out of Oslo, Norway. The Nobel Peace Prize announcement has been made. And there are three winners for the prize in 2022, the first being Alice, Alice Baylatsky from Belarus, a human rights advocate there. The other winners are two organizations, the Russian human rights organization Memorial, as well as the Ukrainian human rights organization, the Center for Civil Liberties. All three have won this year's Nobel Peace Prize match. All right. Very interesting stuff, indeed. Let's get back to some company news now, a show of financial strength for credit suites. After days of concerns about the bank's solidity, the Swiss lender announced a cash debt by the back worth about $3 billion. It comes just weeks away from the announcement of a major strategic review, but maybe more importantly, just days after the stock hit an all-time low. Bloomberg's Charlie Wells joins us now for more. So Charlie, what is Credit Suisse trying to accomplish with this debt buyback, their echoes of Deutsche Bank here? You know, Matt, this is Credit Suisse, effectively trying to tell the markets, calm down guys. We've got cash. Now, as you say, it has really been a week of superlatives for Credit Suisse, that share price lowest ever, credit defaults, wafes on its debt, highest ever. This seems like an attempt to turn that story around, but we hear this figure, $3 billion of Frank's, $3 billion. How significant is that? Well, it's actually relatively modest. What that seems to indicate is that the bank could be trying to preserve some of its liquidity, which we should note is healthy liquidity for that potentially expensive and potentially extensive restructuring later this month.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,459,2022-10-07 09:13:03
12234," that the bank could be trying to preserve some of its liquidity, which we should note is healthy liquidity for that potentially expensive and potentially extensive restructuring later this month. Yeah, it's what we've heard from analysts that look their liquidity position. It is okay. So perhaps enforcing it, but they still have this deadline. They've set up. Are they going to be able to calm markets? Is this plan going to work for them in the meantime? Look, it's got to work better than that memo from exactly a week ago, in which the CEO said, hey, we're in a healthy position on liquidity. What happened? You know, share price tanked. Credit default swaps go up. So this seems to be executives putting cash where their mouth is. Now, what investors will really want though is more of an indication of that October 27th plan, right? In market terms, we're on what the seventh of October that is 20 days away. In market years, that is late years away. All right, Charlie. Thanks very much. Charlie Wells, keeping us up to date on the latest in the credit suites. Saga will continue obviously to follow this until October 27th and beyond. Let's get to another big story that I've been watching really closely. President Biden has taken his first major steps towards decriminalizing marijuana on a federal level. The president pardoned thousands of Americans convicted of possession of the plant. He also ordered a review of its legal status. The pardons could affect more than 6,500 people charged with simple marijuana possession. And as a result, pot stocks shot up on the news as well as the ETF series, the till rate up 12% in the free market. Yeah, definitely a big mover, Matt. And another big mover we're watching this morning is draft kicks. It is surging by about 8.5% in pre market trading after a report that ESPN is close to a new partnership with the sports betting firm. Bloomberg has learned the deal would pave the way for the media giant to capitalize on the growing wave of legalized sports betting. ESPN has already invested heavily in sports gambling, but it has steered clear of actually taking bets. Now, of course, the growth of sports betting and all of the latest odds you need to know are what is being discussed in our very unbetting program here on Bloomberg. The lineup is hosted by me and Damien Sassour and that will be airing tonight at 7 p.m. New York time and 11 p.m. New York time and again on Saturday morning. So if you plan on betting this weekend, make sure to check that out, Matt. Absolutely cool. Can't wait to see the show, Kayleigh. Coming up on jobs Friday and Tuan Bouvet, ING senior rate strategist and Ryan Wang, HSBC, US economist, give us their take on what to expect at 8.30 a.m. This is Bloomberg. MUSIC You did not get stronger that moment that you're lifting the barbell. You get stronger as your body is making repairs, making recovery. Recovery is a win and how you get fitter faster stronger. Recovery technology includes everything from massage guns and foam rollers to compression boots, hyperbaric chambers, cryo chambers, infrared sonas and even infrared pajamas. And athletes are partnering to become investors to take those products mainstream. When you look at tech and sports right now it's completely innovating the way training's going, completely changing the way recovery's going. I think sky's the limit as far as where it can go. But while some of these products can feel amazing, it can be difficult to differentiate between what really helps the body and what just tricks the mind.

12235," Need to catch up. This is Bloomberg Wall Street week. I'm David Weston. We've got the information and insights. We think that's the next secular shift. From business's most influential and instrumental. It's knocking it out the bullfrog. It's a challenging dynamic. This is a level of uncertainty that we haven't had to deal with. Bloomberg Wall Street week live tonight with replays all weekend on Bloomberg Television and Radio. Welcome back to Bloomberg's surveillance. Early edition, I'm Matt Miller in New York at Kaley Lines. Danny Berger with us out of London. Anna Edwards is off today. We are looking at, of course, we're looking ahead to the jobs number, right? But all that means are all we need that for is to try and figure out what the Fed is going to do. Right now, the market is pricing in a 71% chance of a 75 basis point hike in November. Joining us now is Kristi and the keynote. Bloomberg Managing Editor for markets and Kristi. And this seems to be the only driver of US markets. What economic figures, what the macro picture tells us about what the Fed is going to do? Absolutely, Matt. All roads lead to what the Fed is going to do in November and really for the next few months here. And I think this is really a very interesting kind of dynamic that we're seeing with the Fed debate, particularly this week because as you recall, we saw that toll pivot narrative emerge at the start of this week, which is why socks had their best two-day gain in quite some time. But that was very quickly quashed by what we've since heard from Fed policy makers. And that is the message is loud and clear. It is very, very hawkish. They're not going to be stopping anytime soon and the priority is inflation. And really what the job's numbers today will probably do is affirm that conviction in this tiny cycle so long as it is not drastically disappointing. So the Fed might be clear, but you still have Bill Gross, who likes bonds, his former colleagues over at PIMCO, like bonds. I mean, there are people who feel like they're fighting the Fed to some degree. Absolutely, Danny. It's very interesting, the economy that we're seeing now. I mean, just looking at the state of the bond market, it does make sense that you now have these bond bulls emerging and regaining their voice just because we're treasure yields are right now. Very much a different picture from say a year ago, right? And so it makes sense for bond bulls to start saying, maybe it's a good time to be buying now, they're cheap. And especially if you're thinking that a recession is just around the corner after the Fed rate peaks, then it makes sense as a trade. The problem is that with the Fed saying that they're not really going to be stopping any time soon and markets expecting that peak to not come until perhaps March of 2023, there's really not a trade that's going to be making money for the next six months. So, you know, if you're a bond bull right now, I think you're going to have to be patient and wait for those returns after that peak. Christine, we've talked a lot in the last week or so about whether or not something is breaking or something is about to break. And ultimately, if that is going to cause the Fed to change its course of action, Scott Minard was talking about from where he sits, cracks are starting to form. Where will the cracks matter? What needs to break for the Fed to actually pay attention? Well, Kaylee, as we know, of course, the Fed's mandate is a dual one, right? It's about inflation, but it's also about the jobs market. And that's definitely the first port of coal, especially when we start seeing those hiring numbers, perhaps some revisions to the downside coming through over the next few months. There's also, of course, the question of the level of wages in the labor market and whether that's showing signs of a peak. The other thing that I would personally want to keep an eye on is the state of the housing market as well. We know that it's a very important store of wealth for a lot of consumers, particularly in the U.S., but even elsewhere, especially here in the U.K., I would say is the same case. And so, you know, any signs of turning there would be very consequential just for the state of the U.S. consumer and where that story is going to go over the next. I hate to bring it away from macro, but we do have a lot of individual company news today out of the chip sector. Samsung had, I think, its first reduction in earnings since 2019. We had AMD pulling sales down or releasing sales that were more than a billion less than the streets estimate. and so it never reduced.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,461,2022-10-07 09:21:53
12236," in earning since 2019 we had AMD pulling sales down or releasing sales that were more than a billion less than the streets estimate. Is the PC shortage in the chip sector a real problem? Well, we can make this macro to you if you like, but I mean it does seem like it is a continuation of the shortage issues, but I would say it's also a reflection of just the worrying state of consumer demand at this point. I mean particularly, you know, some of the companies that you mentioned very much rooted and leveried to the Chinese economy, we still don't really have a lot of visibility in terms of the potential recovery there. There are some signs that some of the very bad data we got over the summer may be moderating, but no were really near the level of resurgence that you would want to see from the world's second largest economy. And that has very real impact for the chip sector, both in terms of the demand levels there, but also in terms of the supply chain issues as you highlighted. Yeah, Christine, thanks so much for joining us. Great having you today. Christine, Nekino, on to talk about the markets for us. Of course, I didn't mean chips, a PC shortage. I meant PC overage really, shortage in demand. There are too many PCs, chip makers can't get a bid really for their PC chips, and that's the big problem.

Today's CFOs are reshaping the C-suite, positioning companies to meet the next generation of challenges, breaking out of traditional roles to become chief future officer, like Merriots, Lenio Berg, one of the most important things is looking around the corner. Adrian Mitchell from Macy's. We have to let go of the traditional legacy department store. And Lucas, they're a mella at Mondalees. We tend to believe that all consumers are equal they are not. Look for chief future officer on Bloomberg. We make it very transparent to the shopper before they accept an order. What the order is going to look like. How much work on a pays them and how much consumer is paying them. And so they can decide whether they take an order or whether they refuse it. And that's a kind of flexibility. That's our shoppers really value and the kind of transparency that they want. Are you seeing a labor shortage right now? And what are you doing to combat that? It's different in different places. Our demographic of shoppers is completely different from food delivery and our right sharing. We're 20% women and half of them are moms. And that's because a lot of the job at Instacart is very different than just being in a car with strangers. It's about like going to the store, doing a good job of customer service of really picking the right products for the consumer.

12237," Peace be out! If you want more videos like this,agues. Those are my friends, my macamelf... And more cooking and fun!product with Midwest tongue, I'm con this is Bloomberg surveillance early edition on Galey lines with Matt Miller in New York and Danny burger in London and Edwards is out today now keeping you up to date with news from around the world here's the first word. China is showing its cloud on the world stage. The United Nations blocked a debate on China's human rights abuses in Xinjiang just weeks after publishing a report on the matter. The US proposed draft resolution at the UN Human Rights Council was narrowly blocked. China has rejected allegations that it abuses Uyghurs and other Muslims. Bloomberg has learned that talks between Elon Musk and Twitter on his $44 billion takeover are stuck on debt financing. In a letter to the SEC, Musk's lawyer say the deal is contingent on receiving the proceeds of a $13 billion debt sale according to an April filing seven banks under wrote the debt portion of the financing. And it's a sad day for three restaurants here in New York City. They have lost their stars in the Michelin rankings. Carbone, Maria and Peter Luther have defined New York's power dining scene over the last few decades. Still, the city has 73 Michelin star restaurants compared to 68 a year ago. And admittedly Matt, the only one of those three advent to is Carbone, but it was really good in a not overhyped way. So I'm pretty shocked. Yeah. Well, I mean, I also love Carbone and especially love Peter Lugers. And the only takeaway I have from this is that hopefully fewer people will want to make reservations so we can more easily get a table there. Well, also the comment thread in this is that they're all steak restaurants. And is someone with the last name burger I am highly offended. Just as for red meat. That's all I got. I don't even know how to follow that. I like it. That was stupid. There's nothing cool about the last name lines really. It's quite cool. I mean, in other ways, coming up Antoine Bouvet is the senior rate strategist, I N G going to get his take on what we're going to hear about jobs today and what that means for the Fed. This is Bloomberg. Apple has identified its next big business bringing advertisements to more parts of your iPhone. Today Apple pushes ads in three places, the App Store, Apple News and the Stocks App. In the News and Stocks apps, Apple shows display advertisements. That means that third party companies like car dealerships or mortgage lenders can showcase their advertisements just like they can on a website. On the App Store, the situation is different. There, Apple has search ads. This allows developers to buy their way to showing a buyer on search results. For instance, an App Store developer can bid for the term car racing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,463,2022-10-07 09:30:06
12238," as search apps. This allows developers to buy their way and dishoeing a buyer on search results. For instance, an App Store developer can bid for the term car racing or basketball, so their apps would surface above competing apps in the list of results. Apple's pushing to ads is a little ironic, given that its ATT or app tracking transparency privacy feature limits the ability for meta, snack, and even smaller developers to generate as much revenue as possible from advertising. That's because the feature allows users to choose if they want their data collected and tracked across third-party apps and websites. Still, Apple's hoping to expand its own ads business and is planning to add search ads to its Maps app. Other areas where ads could eventually appear are in Apple Books and Apple podcasts, along, maybe one day, with an ad supported tier of Apple TV Plus to compete with new offerings from Netflix and other streaming video providers.

You will get insight into limitless possibilities. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. This is Bloomberg's surveillance early edition. Here's what you need to know. Waiting for a hot U.S. labor market to cool off, investors and the Federal Reserve will be looking at today's September jobs report closely. Raising fears of an Armageddon. President Biden warns that bottom-ear Putin's threats to use nuclear weapons and Ukraine are real and wonders if there's an off-ramp. And Credit Suisse shows some financial muscle after a tough week. The Swiss Bank is offering a $3 billion cash debt buyback. I'm Danny Burger, in London with Matt Miller and Kaley lines in New York. Anna Edwards is off today and Matt, in your own words, blah, blah, blah, blah. All we care about is jobs at 830. That's right. I mean, everyone is looking forward to the jobs report. I will be glued to surveillance when it comes out. We are expecting, I think, 255,000 jobs is the survey. The whisper number is 258,000. So if you go on WHIS go, you can see that in place to your own bet, make your own forecast. Futures doing a whole lot of nothing right now after a 1% drop in the cash trade. Yesterday, we're down to 3744 on the S&P in the cash trade. So I guess that will drive where we go today, right? In fact, jobs numbers, Valerie Tytel, I believe, is going to join us in a few minutes and talk about the fact that these jobs releases, whether they come from ADP or Jolts or ISM, are what have been driving the market lately. The 10-year yield-up 1.5 basis points to 383, 384 right now. So a relatively high level and a little bit of a tailwind. Sorry, a headwind for stocks. Maybe good if you're an investor who wants return. You're finally getting some juiciness there. And the dollar index at 1333 down just a little bit so off against some of the other major currencies. Now I'm excruited, 88, 88. That should be good luck. But the problem is there was a 2 million barrel a day cut by OPEC. Maybe it's only a million, but there could be a recession which would drop demand for gasoline. Or that's the theory, right? We haven't really seen a drop in demand, even amid the higher prices. So we'll see what exactly comes out there. Kelly, what do you see in terms of pre-market movers today? Well, let's talk about pot-mat. Because of course we got the news late in the session. Yesterday, that President Biden was going to pardon thousands of Americans for possession of marijuana and order to review of its legal status. So that is leading to some hope about decriminalization of the drug here in the U.S. And as a result, you are seeing big, big moves for some of those pot stocks. One of them being Tilray, which is up about 2.5% in pre-market trading and MJ, which is a very aptly named ETF that tracks or ticker eyes rather than named. That tracks cannabis names is higher by about 7.9% in early hours. As for other big movers out there, one of them is draft kings after a report late yesterday. That ESPN is looking at a big partnership with the sports betting company really shows the gains in sports betting that is being made here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,464,2022-10-07 09:34:40
12239," After a report late yesterday that ESPN is looking at a big partnership with the sports betting company really shows the gains in sports betting that is being made here in the U.S. That is just massively exploding market. And of course when I talk about on the lineup here on Bloomberg, but draft Kings is up about 8.3%. One move over to the downside and dragging other names with it is AMD, the chip maker here in the U.S. giving a preliminary third quarter figures sales coming in a billion dollars under expectations speaks to the slowdown we are seeing for demand in the chip space. So AMD is down about 5% and taking a lot of other related stocks down with it Danny. Well, same thing happening in Europe for sure. European tech stocks, the worst performing sector, but on a headline basis, we've just seen the Euro's stock 600 flip into green. It's up one tenth of one percent, but we're just kind of floating along today, similar to what's happening in the S&P 500 futures session. Not a lot to do until we get that job number, perhaps just moving some things around some window dressing. One thing potentially, eating stocks, allowing them to move slightly higher. We are looking at some of the losses today in the European bond market. They've paired ever so slightly, still seeing yields push higher, German tenure yields, those up five basis points, UK tenure yields. Those are up four basis points. The drama and focus, of course, has been on the U.S., it's been on the Fed, but look, Germany tenure yields, those are up about 50 basis points this week. We have an ECB who had accounts out yesterday saying that yes, they need to keep hiking. So that aggression isn't going anywhere, but still when it comes to the Euro, really just trading off the dollar, Kaley. So weaker dollar, stronger Euro, stronger sterling as well. And of course, it all comes back to Federal Reserve policy, which today's jobs report will likely have some bearing on. Let's get a take now from Antoine Bouvet, ING, senior race strategist. Antoine, we've heard from a lot of Fed speakers this week, and they all pretty much reiterate the same message. The idea that they're going to climb up quickly to the terminal rate, and they're going to stay there for a while. And yet, the market is still pricing in a cut next year. You also are on team cut in 2023. Why aren't you buying them? Well, the Fed is saying today is based on the data that we have today, and the Fed has been very explicit that they are backward looking. They based themselves on realized inflation data, realized job market data. And so they can't possibly tell us what they will be doing in the second half of 2023 if they use backward looking data from 2022. It's as simple as that. That's the reason why we're still in team cut. Now, is that relevant for fixed income markets? Not really. When you have a period of very high volatility that we have now, no one really has an investment horizon of over a year, very few people can just buy trades now and say, well, 4%. It's going to be a really good level when I look at it. When it's done the line in the meantime, you have to see through a lot of volatility and what really matters in the near term is that Fed rate already just talked about that upside in years and perhaps even a better entry point, even if you have a long term buying a horizon as a judgment. So do you not believe we've seen the peak in the old yet? No, probably not. I think we're going to touch over 4% soon. Probably go over that 1% to 1% completely possible for 10 years. For the time being, this Fed rate rate is just as strong and consistent as it can be. The only thing that could really prevent us from touching that 4% level again would be a catastrophic fall in jobs. But for now, the news flow on the economic front has been mixed to slightly positive, even I would say. You know, I recently showed a chart 2440. I was just looking for the number and if the control room wants to pull it up, sorry for the short notice. But 2440 is a chart that shows financing costs have just absolutely soared, Antoine. This is in Europe, but of course the same is true around the world. How does this position businesses? How does this position consumers? What does this mean for the kind of recession that we're likely to see? It's not good news. That's fair to say. Clearly, you know, we always talk about the long and variable lag between monetary policy tightening and the impact on the economy. And so this will take a time, a long time, to feed into corporate balance sheet, into household balance sheet. And ultimately, we're going to see a recession. And so what success? Not. I canแleb. We'll don't...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,465,2022-10-07 09:39:12
12240," into household balance sheet. And ultimately, we're going to see a recession. The sort of recession that not economists in an official definition of recession, but what most people would define as one, which is an increase in unemployment rate and job losses. And the definition of recession is that we can define where they start when an unemployment start rising. It's very difficult to know when they stop, because these economic processes have a tendency to be self-fulfilling consumption cuts. Therefore, people lose their job, people lose their job consumption, falls, and so on and so forth. So it's very hard to describe to the view that this is going to be a soft landing, that only the adjustment or the loosening of the job market will be done only via a fall in job openings. I think this is a very optimistic take. And in most likelihood, we'll see a recession in 2023. I mean, I think that's so. The Fed will be in a positive critical rate. The problem is kind of with the metaphor, right? Because we're not exactly flying high right now. So it's difficult to imagine a hard landing, so to speak, nonetheless, we could dip low, much lower than sea level here. If we get unemployment at 5%, at 5 and a half, at 6%, when does the Fed flinch? What do you think pushes them? It's a job market. I mean, we've talked about this already a bunch only, but ultimately, as much as the targeting inflation, power-channering is in a vocal, all these references to the 70s. Only one thing is that the Fed is not concerned with inflation holding with the recession. They are concerned with inflation jumping back as soon as the recession's over. So the key to that dynamic is, of course, the unemployment rate and the job market more broadly. We need to see the unemployment rate rise to 5% or perhaps even higher, as you just mentioned, the Fed to be convinced that the fall in unemployment rate is sustainable. And so then, only then, will it be in a position to cut rates? That, we think, is in the middle of 2023, but it could take longer. And, Tuan, I want to rock things up with the ECB, because we had, of course, a count yesterday in the middle of all the noise around the Fed and Fed officials speak. I wonder what you make of an ECB that sounded perhaps more comfortable with 50 basis points, but is really ready to start that QT debate. Well, to be honest, and I don't want to discredit the ECB here, but they've looked at what the Fed's done. They see that it's working. The market's assigning credibility to the Fed. If you look at the volatility in dollar rates compared to the volatility in Euro or sterling rates clearly, there is a reward for central banks who have stepped into the plate to be high, aggressively, at least until the neutral rate. And the ECB is nowhere near the neutral rate. We might be at that level in December, it's probably 100 to 150 basis points higher. And now they're basically on the autopilot. That debate on quantitative tightening, I don't know how long you have. We can say a lot of things about it. I'm just going to summarize it this way. It's a mistake. I think quantitative tightening would help at the margin with inflation, but it would pose a much greater risk to the fight against inflation in the sense that it poses financial stability risk as we've seen in the UK. So, you know, the tradeoff is not very good. It helps a little bit with inflation, but it poses financial stability risk. Ultimately, this financial stability risk could prevent the ECB from tightening as much as they want, as much as they should to fight inflation. All right, we're going to talk about financial stability risk as well later on the program. Antoine, thanks so much for joining us. Great to get your insight on this ahead of the jobs number.

You just... even though that voice in your head is saying, oh god, I'm so tired, I don't want to do this. You've got to show up. You've got to be charmingly relentless. You have to build emotional endurance because there's no straight line of success at the kind of all over place and you have to just be able to work through those things.

There are not many jobs you can have as a young individual. You're always, always learning. Music This is Bloomberg's surveillance early edition. I'm Matt Miller at Kaley Lines in New York and Danny Berger in London. Now as the world holds its breath, waiting to see 4% U.S. unemployment. So the fed's aggressive hiking can moderate. At least that's the narrative. Markets have gotten very excited about some early signs of the U.S. labor market slowing. Bloomberg's Valerie Taitel is here to take us through the charts showing the glimpses of hope and hurt for a fed pivot as the arguments against it sort of rise and fall. That's all we got. Thanks Matt. Yes, we heard time and time again from FOMC members and especially Powell at the last meeting that a tight labor market is the key fundamental driver for this late cycle inflation we're seeing. And we need to see cracks before the inflation narrative will turn. The market was so keen to jump on two themes this week that jumped out that showed there might be some cracks. The first was the Jolt Stato we got out to say that drove a huge bounce in Riss Asquits. The ratio of job openings per unemployed individual dropped from two to 1.7. This two number was specifically mentioned by Powell in his testimony and his questioning. So there was a bit of relief in risk assets when we saw this fall the 1.7. But analysts on the street notes that, hey, yes, it's gone lower. But look at the six month average. We are still way, way, way elevated to history. This is going to keep pressure on wage growth as we know it's expected to be 5% today. This will continue to drive wage gains into year end. Second chart was on jobless claims. Yesterday they came in above estimates for the first time in nine weeks at 219 K. But analysts would say again, look jobless claims four week average of around 200 K with wage growth at 5% that is not a recipe to get inflation down to 2%. We still have a long way to go in terms of seeing cracks in this labor market to give any reason for the Fed to pivot. All right. Bloomberg's Valerie Taitel. Great work. Thank you so much. Joining us now for more on today's jobs report is Ryan Wang US economist at HSBC who is up early for us in New York this morning. Ryan, we appreciate it. Thank you so much. Consensus has 255,000 on payrolls. Europe at 275,000 for today's report. Why are you there? And what do you think the Fed's going to make of a number like that? Thanks. Pleasure to be here. Well, 275,000. That would be a little bit of a slowdown in employment growth compared with what we've been averaging so far this year. But it's really not.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,467,2022-10-07 09:47:32
12242," Well, 275,000, that would be a little bit of a slowdown in employment growth compared with what we've been averaging so far this year, but it's really not slow enough to achieve what the Fed is forecasting over the year ahead. The Fed, we learned, is looking for the unemployment rate to rise to 4.4% by the end of 2023, and for that, we need a job slowdown below the 100,000 per month threshold. So 275,000, that would suggest that maybe there's been a little bit of cooling, but the Fed wants to see more. It wants to see those jobs gain slow. It wants to see some of these wage pressures that are running through the labor market begin to lessen. Well, Ryan, Valerie was just talking about the Jolt's data that everybody really clung onto as a sign that maybe there is some slack building in the labor market. Do you think it's more likely that people are having more success hiring? Therefore, there's not as many openings or they're just abandoning their attempts to hire? I would put it a little bit differently. The high level of openings, even though there's that tentative signs that it's coming down a little bit shows that businesses still have extremely high demand for labor. So actually, if you think about it in those terms, they're not having that much success hiring as a proportion of how much demand for labor they have. At the same time, the demand is so strong that that's why we're still getting these job gains that are several hundred thousand per month. So it's really a combination of forces. The Fed is trying to slow down that labor demand. It is trying to reduce those wage pressures. And so, for example, we can look at the 4% number, which is going to be key for two of the other numbers that are coming out in today's report. Wage gains, I think the Federal Reserve would like to see much closer to 4% rather than the 5% type of annual growth rates that we've been seeing recently. And the unemployment rate, as I mentioned, we already know the Fed is targeting non-employment rate that would rise above 4% into 2023. So if that pivot narrative, if we're so far from that, Ryan, it does feel like the new pivot narrative we've coalesced around is because of risk to financial stability. And we had Guggenheim Scott-Minerd saying that he thinks the Fed will press ahead with rate increases until something breaks. And he says that he's already starting to see cracks forming. Now, at the same time, we had Fed Governor Christopher Waller who said that there are additional rate hikes into next year. But, Ryan, I want you to take a listen to what he said specifically around financial stability at an event at the University of Kentucky yesterday. I believe we have tools in place to address any financial stability concerns. And we should not be looking to monetary policy for this purpose. The focus of monetary policy needs to be on one day fighting inflation. So, Ryan, I got to wonder, do you take this as the Fed saying, uh-uh, even if something breaks, we're still going ahead. Well, again, I wouldn't put it quite like that. What I think Governor Waller's speech made clear was that the Fed is intending to press along with rate hikes, at least for the next several meetings into early 2023. And his comments also make it clear the Fed is watching financial conditions and the markets. Of course, the central bank object has an objective to protect the functioning of markets. But at the same time, it's also about the transmission mechanism to the broader economy through business and household expectations and business and household borrowing. If the markets are disrupted to a point where corporate borrowing becomes impaired, that inevitably will have knock on effects on the economy. And that's the type of development that could eventually lead to a change in how the Fed is is talking about its monetary policy stance. But what Governor Waller is saying is that we just haven't reached that point yet. It's not that the Fed wants something to break. It's that they're watching closely. And at the same time, the primary focus right now is still on inflation and economic conditions. You know, Danielle D Martino booth at Quill Intelligence down in Dallas has has suggested that maybe the Fed, maybe Jerome Powell does want to break this idea that there's always going to be a Fed put. Maybe the Fed wants to convince markets they're not always going to be there when we see a huge drop in risk assets. Does that make sense to you? Well, again, I think the focus is really going to be on the labor market. Markets are very uncomfortable with this situation because I can't actually remember a time, at least not in the past two decades, where the Fed has explicitly said it's looking for a cooling off.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,468,2022-10-07 09:52:04
12243," It's a very uncomfortable with this situation because I can't actually remember a time, at least not in the past two decades, where the Fed has explicitly said it's looking for a cooling off in jobs growth. That by itself is something remarkable. And like I said, we may see some early evidence of that, but at the same time, 200, 300,000 jobs per month, that's not going to put the upward pressure on the unemployment rate. On the contrary, those types of numbers would still mean the unemployment rate is falling. So until we see a change in what's happening in the labor market, I think markets are a little bit premature and expecting a pivot, certainly to rate cuts. That's not really what we should be talking about at this point. The Fed needs to see a little bit of progress on both inflation pressure and in terms of wages, to get to that point where it's comfortable holding the policy rate steady. That's what the Fed is looking to accomplish, and that's what markets are probably hoping for as well. Ryan, great to get your thoughts. Love to have you back on. Thanks so much for joining us. Ryan Wang, their HSBC US economist, talking to us about the jobs number and the situation with the Fed and markets. Coming up later, we're going to speak to US Labor Secretary Marty Wall, that's at 9.40 AM New York time, 240 PM London time. So just about an hour and 10 minutes after the jobs release, this is Bloomberg. [♪ OUTK Bennet tylko MARSEFORE Shapes ""... We will never break, we will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never break, have a wide horizon and the mountains shake. All of who will remain, we will never know. We will never know.

They have been in and seen it. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloombergs. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. What does it mean? What does it mean?

Now let's take a look at what is ahead on this Friday. Russian CPI data will be coming out at 12 p.m. All right. Start reading your notes. Switch my volume on thechat fucking teilweise. It's good. Do you have that wisdom?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,469,2022-10-07 09:56:25
12244," Matt Miller in New York and Danny Burger in London and Edwards is out today. Now let's take a look at what is ahead on this Friday. Russian CPI data will be coming out at 12 p.m. New York time. President Biden will travel to Haggar's town, Maryland. Will he will deliver remarks on building the economy from the bottom up and middle out? We'll also hear from even more Fed speakers as if we haven't gotten enough this week, including New York Fed President John Williams, Minneapolis Fed President Neal Cashkari, as well. And of course, they will have to be reflecting on the U.S. jobs report that is released at 8.30 a.m. Eastern time. So just about two and a half hours to go. And ahead of that, we are going nowhere across asset classes, Matt. Not even a basis point move on the 10-year yield. The dollar is essentially unchanged. Futures essentially unchanged. This is a market waiting for payrolls to give it direction. Yeah, absolutely. And I mean, we say this every month, but a lot of times around these big releases, around Fed decisions or non-farm payrolls, you know, traders will actually turn off the computers that supposedly do all of the work in these markets and actually wait until humans have a look at the decisions or the data that comes out. So that's why you won't see a lot of volume and you won't see a lot of volatility, Danny, as I understand it, around these big releases. Yeah, maybe turning off their computers, but hopefully not their TVs. We have a great continuation coverage of jobs day. But you know, it's really, I think, a very fun fact. And maybe telling fact for this jobs day, this is Dan Curtis told me this. So all credit goes to him. The spread between the highest and lowest estimate for jobs at the moment is 190,000. Kaley, that's the tightest spread since the start of the pandemic. So maybe we've finally got it together or maybe the tail risk is really big for this one. Well, the fact that that is the narrow is spread. We've seen in some time and it's still close to 200,000 is remarkable. And it's just supposed to show you how hard it has been to forecast this economy, considering it was a recession, unlike anything we've ever had. A recovery unlike anything we've had. And of course, monetary policy that we haven't seen in quite some time is a result of that. All right. Well, we're all waiting for the 30 release. Stay tuned to surveillance for all the details and all the commentary that you need. This is Bloomberg. Should we anticipate that you will have regulations clarifying what the SEC is going to do on crypto currencies and related kinds of things in the near future? It's pretty clear that many of these tokens may be securities. What we've asked the trading platforms, the lending platforms, the other various venues to come in, to work with us, to get registered under the securities laws. Because of a platform has 50 or some of them 500 tokens on their platform. Probabilities are they're not all non-securities. Now, there's another issue that's as arisen, which is called gamification, which is to say people are making a game out of trying to buy stocks. Are you worried about this phenomenon? We live in the 2020s in a new digital age where applications on our phones can use massive amount of data and then predict our behavior. What do we do when they do?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,470,2022-10-07 10:00:34
12245," which where applications on our phones can use massive amount of data and then predict our behavior. What do we do when the digital algorithms are maximizing for the company's revenues rather than our returns? And so we're trying to think that through. It's not just gamification, it's a little bit more than that. It's whether there's a conflict between the app and our investment returns. The market has been on a super high over the last few days. We see volatility across all asset markets. We might see some downturn dynamics driven by monetary policy. We're going to look at a higher for longer story and not necessarily a disinertive action entertaining cuts next year. The Fed's really going to struggle to convince markets that it needs to do a total 125 basis points in those last two meetings of the year. This is Bloomberg's surveillance with Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow, and Lisa Abramowitz. It is Petty Rolls Friday, live from New York City for our audience worldwide. Good morning, good morning. This is Bloomberg's surveillance on Ttheon Radio. Alongside Lisa Abramowitz, I'm Jonathan Farrow, which features unchanged on the S&P, Pramo, the number, a few as a way. And people are expecting it to be in the mid 200,000s. How much does it actually move the needle? What actually has to happen for people to change the narrative around a Federal Reserve that seems dead set on racing rates regardless of what happens? Did you see the governor Walla push back yesterday afternoon? Literally, they're saying every possible scenario for you to be bullish, throw it out. Nope. Nope. That's the entirety of it. We're going to hear from Williams a little bit later as well. Lisa will go through the Fed speaking just a moment. The data, bad news, good news. Are we going to push back against that today? That's basically what the Fed officials are saying. They're saying that honestly, there's no scenario that they can foresee that's going to cause them to reverse course the near term. That's basically what each and every one of them, even the former doves are going to hang out and saying. And they're saying it again and again and it's consistent. Is this market getting the message or is this market pricing that in? Clearly, this is what the Fed wants to signal. I take issue with the bad news. It's good news story. I think if you can have a positive supply side story, then that is overwhelmingly good news. If you have a story that is just demand get inhabited by a Federal Reserve high-kin rates and you don't get a supply side response, for me, bad news is bad news. But is that a labor market story? And this is a question that we've been asking this week, which is people are pointing to the labor market as the trigger point for the Federal Reserve to change course to possibly not raise rates as quickly. But is that the correct one or is that a lagging indicator at a time when perhaps it is these less controllable factors like supply chains coming back online that could reduce some of the inflationary pressure? And just for the record, I'm not here to argue with how the market is trading goal of this because obviously if we do get a bad number today, we've seen how that's traded a week. The ISM, the orders component of the ISM, jobless claims, take your pickle through the week. It's been an example after example of a market training on bad news as if it's good news. OK, I'm not going to let you get away with this. You come out and you're saying you're basically, I'm going to reject this bad news as good news, good news can be good news. Then you're saying, but I'm not going to fight back because that's how the market's going to trade. So I understand that. And that's going to be a good thing. Give me a couple of seconds. Carry out. Technically, I can understand how bad news brings the ultimate peak in a terminal rate down. If that happens, I can see why the equity market in the short term trades positively risk on. Got all of that. I just mean in the long term, if you have bad news after bad news, bad print after bad print and you see a recession, and this Fed follows through in the way they're telling us, which essentially is no rate cuts in a recession, then I think that's problematic. That's questionable. I think that's more questionable than just saying, yeah, bad news is good news. They're going to back away. Bye, bye, bye. There's a new one here that I think is really important that you're getting at, which is, we're all tracking the labor market, but maybe it's the wrong indicator. And maybe we're going to see a shift in the Federal Reserve as they look to some of these year-over-year comparison numbers and how quickly the deceleration of inflation is. What do we see now?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,471,2022-10-07 10:05:17
12246," Okay, but maybe it's the wrong indicator. And maybe we're gonna see a shift in the Federal Reserve as they look to some of these year-over-year comparison numbers and how quickly the deceleration of inflation is. And maybe next week when we get CPI, that will be a key figure that might provide more insights in even the labor market. Now once we get CPI, you can forget all the other data points. Exactly, that's my point. That's gonna hijack the whole story. Exactly. Next week, features right now unchanged on ESMP 500. TK had begun nuts right now, wouldn't it? You've got, oh my god, our star, I can do take it. Enough. Equities unchanged in the equity market. We got nowhere on the ESMP 500 up on the wheat by more than 4%. So a decent week so far. You ought to look a little something like this hired by a single basis point at a 10-year, 383, 67, Eurodollar, just a little bit firmer. The kind of price action you'd associate with a payrolls Friday morning, Lisa, we're going nowhere. Yeah, which basically people don't know. Bad news, good news, good news, bad news. They reject the premise, but they accept the market reaction. Anyway, 8.30 a.m. we get a sense of what the actual number is of September, US non-farm payrolls comes out. The highest from JP Morgan Asset Management, David Kelly, 389,000, the low, 199,000 from South Bay research will make a difference. If it comes in on the low end, will that actually be a tradable issue past today, past the first few hours? I don't know the answer to that. Did you see what Danny Berger said? Really tight range. I eyeballed the same thing, 190,000, tightest range on high to low on the payrolls report in the guesses that we've seen since the pandemic started. What do you make of that? Are some of my people getting more conviction or they realize that they don't know? It's the might as well go for a round number to sort of... The guesses used to be so wild from 100 K all the way out to about 750. It used to be nuts. Yeah, so now I guess people see more stability or perhaps they just don't want to be stand out as they get it wrong. Also, today we're getting the US administration to the response to the Labour Market report. I hear there's a press conference with Marty Walsh on your property on Bloomberg television at 9.40 a.m. How exciting for that. I think it'll be interesting to see how he dovetails. A good report being somehow bad and how he addresses this. Also, President Biden will be discussing that. And today, on the Daily Fed show, we have, Trump roll, please, New York Fed President John Williams, Minneapolis Fed President, you know, Kashkari, Atlanta Fed President, Raphael Bostic, and John, to your point earlier, we have just talked consistently about how they have all been on the same page. They all keep talking about how they want to hike rates, they want to keep them at about 4.5% or even higher, and they're not going to budge even in the face of pretty extreme weakness. Did my tweet of the morning, tweet of the last 24 hours, we'll catch up with Bloomberg's AMH, down in DC, in about 10 minutes time. This came from Deva Hazarika, and I hope that I've pronounced that right, Adelaide Twitter, when the history books are written, will OPEC get the credit it deserves for legalizing marijuana in America? Thank you. Like that line. Operation Mitter. That's fantastic. Operation Mitter. So in case somebody doesn't understand, this comes as President Biden yesterday, said that nobody should be in jail for possessing or using marijuana. And basically abolishing that. Sure. Basically somehow they got a free pass. Wow, that's awesome. Do you like that? I do like that. That's very clever. OK, Johnny is now as David Baillam. We'll save that for maybe in 10 minutes time with that, David. CIO and Global Head of Investments, the city global, Wavth. David, let me just start the payrolls number a little bit later this morning, and what you and the team are looking for. Well, we think it's going to be in the high 200,000s. We're looking around 275,000 as an expectation. But I love what you both were talking about, because the fact is it really almost doesn't matter. You know, monthly data, when we look back on it, of course, is revised all of the time. And so what we actually see today is, is in many cases, sort of a head fake, which is what's actually happening. David, I was going through your notes, and it just screamed, be patient. Wait, what are the preconditions before you add equity risk? What are you waiting for? Well, you know, when we take a look at the history of the Fed and its ability to keep rates high, we typically see that, you know, after a couple of months of actual unemployment, the Fed will bring rates down. So that's sort of the pivot point that's out in the future. But what we're actually, what it comes to thinking about what they're doing, right? They're raising rates extremely quickly in order to find inflation, which is by definition, a slow number to actually come down, you know, because it's looked out over 12 months and it's looked at backwards. And so I think what we're looking on to take equity risk is a situation where we have the ability to see, right? What ultimately, what earnings will be next year, right? And there's a huge variation as to what people expect as the earbuds are biasw easy to develop,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,472,2022-10-07 10:09:51
12247," equity risk is a situation where we have the ability to see, right? What ultimately what earnings will be next year, right? And there's a huge variation as to what people expect earnings to come through at. And once we have a line of sight on earnings, and I think we have a line of sight on the fact that the Fed is or is there at near rates, we are going to be adding equity risk in a whole variety of places. And frankly, you know, at that point, you'll have the ability to see the dollar peaking and lots of things that suggests we have much more risk in our portfolios. But right now, you know, you've been talking about it. The fact is that the Fed is on a one way freight chain and they're moving very quickly. So David, it sounds like you're unhold and I'm wondering how many of your colleagues are also kind of unhold and just sort of sitting sitting on the sidelines and watching this drama of good news and bad news and people kind of winding themselves up into a tizzy from a distance. Well, you know, we're never unhold because clients are always invested in the market and we don't want clients to market time. This past week, just as an example, we saw a 6% update in Hong Kong. And those big days batter so much to portfolios to equity investors that they have to have equities in their portfolio right in order to make those profits over time. And so we don't want people to market time what we've done is make our portfolios exceedingly defensive in terms of what we actually have them exposed to. So we're obviously dominantly in the United States. We're dominantly with your shares that are dividend oriented with places with extremely reliable earnings, regardless of what happens in the economy and things like that. And while it doesn't prevent the downside at all that we've seen, it does actually provide a cushion to it and allows you to be in the market as it turns. How defensive are long duration US government bonds? They're pretty defensive right and you know I look back just you know eight months ago right and I think to myself, you know, those bonds were worthless in a portfolio when they had extremely low yield. But if you were to take a look at a you know, even a 10 year bond and you take a look at the inflation expectations that are baked into tips. So the long term inflation expectations in the bottom market today are 2.4 to 2.5%. So you can actually get positive carry right on those bonds if you've got if you've got a 10 year view. And so right now we're not recommending that our clients actually extend duration because they're being paid so handsomely you know in the earlier the short report of the curve. And that actually is another good play that's coming ahead of us. You know the Fed is only able to keep their rates in place right for a period of seven months near peak on average going back over the last 40 years. So you know every all of the forward expectations on the curve suggest higher for longer they're going to be able to keep it that way for you know for much of next year and the fact of the matter is that there's not a lot of history to suggest that once we have real data that indicates we are heading into a recession. And that probability has risen mightily over the last three months. I think the federal actually will end. David Banglin of city global wealth David you are not the only one that believes that thank you sir. Lisa you've been saying this all week haven't you the difference between what the Fed speakers want to signal and what market participants think they'll actually do. Oh my god. I absolutely love this discussion. I'm looking right now at the Fed funds projections and there still is rate cuts priced in for next year even though Fed officials basically not basically they are coming out and they're saying we're not going to cut right next year. Repeatedly and governor Waller and yesterday I think you're right to point this out. He basically said everyone worried about financial stability concerns. I'm not not at all. It's not going to be a problem for us. Monetary policy should be focused on bringing down inflation period full stop. Do you think the Bank of England money the waters or actually do you think the Bank of England almost highlighted that by saying this was a financial stability decision will do this with bond bank. The monetary policy committee has to make a separate decision about bringing down inflation. The Bank of England arguably is a predecessor to what other banks are going to do and this is what David Bailin is talking about that when it actually comes to the moment they're going to have a hard time not responding to a financial stability issue that brings everything to a halt or causes a run on funds. And I think that's the reason why people still are baking in rate cuts are still baking in a much more dovish Fed in the rhetoric might otherwise imply. What is it leaf Qt. Well, I actually looked yesterday. Yeah, it was the biggest monthly decline in or weekly. I should say in the balance sheet going back to September of 2021. It's finally happening coming up on this program. The president holding a fundraiser in New York City just yesterday. We're trying to figure out what is Putin's off ramp. Where does he get off?

This is Bloomberg. Keeping you up to date with news from around the world with the first word, I'm Lisa Mateo. President Biden is worried that Vladimir Putin's threats to use tactical nuclear weapons are real and could lead to quote, Armageddon. At a fundraiser in New York, the president said the US is trying to figure out the Russian leaders off ramp. Putin renewed his nuclear threats when he announced the annexation of territory in Ukraine. The Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to human rights activists from Ukraine, Russia and Belarus. They were cited for documenting war crimes, human rights abuses and abusive power. At the same time, the chair of the Nobel committee criticized Vladimir Putin and the government in Belarus for suppressing activists. Investors and the Fed will be watching today's monthly US jobs report very closely. It's forecast a show that employers added 255,000 jobs in September. And that would be the smallest number, smallest number since a decline in late 2020. Still, it would be an indication that the labor market is strong. The report comes out at 8.30 New York time. It's a show of financial strength for credit suites. After days of concern about the bank's solidity, the Swiss lender announced a cash debt buyback worth about the rebellion. Credit Suisse remains locked in turmoil just weeks away from the announcement of a major strategic review. The bank shares have lost more than half their value this year.

What was your favorite project to do? The Reichstag does stand out because, first of all, it's an energy manifesto. So it transforms something that was dependent on fossil fuels that uses all the technology to produce something which is essentially carbon neutral and there's a public building, that's a statement. It's a symbol of a city, a symbol of a nation. It incorporates works of art. It's recycling and existing building which, as I mentioned earlier, is the ultimate in sustainability if you can, if you can give a new life to a building. It also creates public space at the roof level. It's the most visited parliament in the world, so it puts the public above the politicians who are answerable to them.

This is me just building. It's pretty much full service shadow banking with nobody in charge. I said things that were indefensible. Need to catch up. This is Bloomberg Wall Street week. I'm David Weston. We've got the information and insights. We think that's the next second of our shift. From businesses most influential and instrumental. It's knocking it out the bullfrog. It's a challenging dynamic. This is a level of uncertainty that we haven't had to deal with. Bloomberg Wall Street week. Live tonight with Replays all weekend on Bloomberg television and radio. August jobs were right on target. Pretty much in line with what Wall Street expected at Goldilocks Job Support. Today the surveillance team brings you the crucial jobs data and expert analysis at Terminal Speed. Does this imply that central banks will blink? They want to see a little bit more slack in this labor market. I don't think they'd want to see unhappy people. There is a lot of monetary contraction and austerity coming down the pipe. This is Timber Jobs report. Today on Bloomberg television and radio. We're going to work with our U.S. companies to ensure that they continue to increase production and make sure that we have the refining capacity. We're down a couple of binaries to make sure that we have enough inventory along East Coast and parts of the Midwest and the West Coast to make sure that we have supplies. We're going to continue to focus on bringing down prices. Fantastic conversation yesterday with Amos Halkstein, the senior advisor for Energy Security at the U.S. State Department, led by Amory Houghton and Alex Steele. From New York City this morning, good morning with the Lisa Bramford and Jonathan Farrow. Futures look like this on ESMP with down about a tenth of 1%. Going into payrolls, looking for something like 255,000. This conversation about the Fed not wanting to make people unhappy. Can we just revisit the speech? I went back to the speech from Jackson Hole again last night to reread what Powell had to say. This word pain, while higher interest rates, slower growth and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation. They will also bring some pain to households and businesses. I would argue the goal is to make people upset. Just not as upset as they would be if inflation continued because it included those remarks by saying these are the unfortunate cost of reducing inflation, but if failure to restore price stability would mean that greater pain. And Mary Daly, who is on the more dovish or used to be on the more dovish camp, came out just as aggressively and really reiterated this that every conversation she had was about inflation and what's that doing to your paycheck, not necessarily how tough it is to get a job because right now it's not. We'll get the White House response to this a little bit later. We need to pick up on the comments from the President of the United States in the last 12 hours or so. The President of the United States warning of nuclear armageddon. Let's get to the team coverage right now with Bloomberg. Mary Tadew in Prague, Amory, Dan and DC. AMH, what we through those comments from the President of the United States? Clearly this is on his mind, Jonathan. He's really upping the ante what we heard from a administration officials like Jake Sullivan saying this has always been something that Putin has brandished this nuclear threat. But now at the President coming out and talking about one that they're trying to find an off ramp because they want to make sure he does not use tactical nuclear weapons.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,475,2022-10-07 10:22:09
12250," This should, this nuclear threat. But now, at the President coming out and talking about one, that they're trying to find an off-ramp, because they want to make sure he does not use tactical nuclear weapons. Then the President says, where does he find a position, himself in a position that he does not, not only lose face, but lose significant power in Russia. He is not joking. This is the President of the United States saying, when he talks about potential use of tactical nuclear weapons or biological and chemical weapons, because his military is, you might say, significantly underperforming. And then he talks about how this would end up in Armageddon. And I just want to pick up quickly on that point about his military significantly underperforming. What is going out right now in Russia, and what you could see across Russian state TV, is more pushback and criticism of the military. Nothing happens on Russian state TV without the blessing of the Kremlin, which means they are allowing this criticism of the military. And a question is, is this leaving the door open for the public opinion to say, well, in order to win this, Putin needs to do something bigger. Maria, have the Europeans respond it to this? Well, to me in this meeting, what you see is this very clear West and East divide at times. For Western leaders, we did not get any reaction from the French President. Remember, I'm in my corner, always says that when you talk nuclear, this is not something that you can casually mention. In fact, at times when he gets asked, he doesn't even use the word nuclear. No comment either from the Germans, but the Eastern Europeans, they have a different take on this when you speak to the Lithuanians, Estonia. These are right next to Russia, Baltic countries. They say, let's not take the bait. We know the Vladimir Putin wherever he feels he's in trouble whenever he's pushed back in the corner. He will always bring up the nuclear threats. You should not take the bait, because I will only encourage him to get a more powerful and more force for in that extent. And then when it comes to how can you offer him a way out, well, the Finnish Prime Minister Santa Matting, she said the only way out of this is for Russia to leave Ukraine. They've got to go. Well, and Maria, this really raises a question about why there seems to be a dissonance between Jake Sullivan and President Biden, because Jake Sullivan has really shrugged off some of this as threats, like Eastern European nations. They're raising the concern, but Western European nations not so much. Why President Biden had such fiery rhetoric last night? That's a question we just do not know. One, is it potentially that the President is seeing more intel, more recently? Is it the fact that the President is being a bit more forthright with the press? Remember in the past, the President is the one who has said things that the White House continuously walks back. I remember that press conference when it was a Bloomberg reporter who talked to what asked, what would the repercussions be if Russia invaded? And remember what the President's answer was. He depends how much was. How much are we talking about Russia going in, and the White House had to come back and say a single tank over that line, there would be a swift severe response. The President often says things out loud that other officials are a little bit more conservative when it comes to that. The second, of course, is that, listen, I'm not going to say all domestics are politics. I don't think individuals should use foreign policy as a domestic policy, but if this is something the President could be using to make sure that he is telling these, at these fundraisers, we need to make sure that we are keeping the right individuals in the right places to make sure we have this Western front against Russia. And there could be no qualms about the aid we're sending, et cetera. And we should stay the status quo in terms of Democrats in power because of foreign policy concerns. You see this all over the world, right? When there's domestic issues, a lot of times you see leaders point to foreign affairs. Just quickly, Hymnria, in Prague, as all of the EU energy ministers meet, how much is there a discussion about never relying on Russia again for natural gas? Or how much is that sort of looming out there still as this existential question? Oh, no. This is out of the question. Everyone that I talk to will say this is done. Russia has a great energy supplier to the European Union, has a great energy power to the – well, to Europe. In general, this is over. As long as Vladimir Putin is the president of the Russian Federation, by the way, when you look at imports, there were 40 percent of all gas imports were coming from Russia. Now it's about 7 percent. I think overall what they want to see, however, are prices going down. They're looking at countries like Norway, like Algeria, hoping.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,476,2022-10-07 10:26:50
12251," We're coming from Russia. Now it's about 7 percent. I think overall what they want to see, however, our prices going down. And they're looking at countries like Norway, like Algeria, hoping to renegotiate some of the contracts of the prices come down. There is no consensus for the time being. But, Lisa, there is now a timeline. I did speak with the Greek Prime Minister, Karyakos Misotakis, and he said in two weeks' time. So, at the end of October, we need to have something on paper and make a decision with regards to the price cap and how we implemented. Maria, thank you. Maria, today they're on the latest from Prague, AMH down in DC. I'm Marie, thank you. Tough week for the White House on the international stage. That's for sure. I'm thinking more so with OPEC plus early this week. And how humiliating that was and how much of a lack of response they really have to it. Other than just saying, they haven't used up the entire strategic petroleum reserve. They have more to go. I think they've used about 155 million barrels versus 180 million barrels that they said that they would sell, and so they can sell more heading into the midterm elections. But aside from that, it's a huge snub, especially after that fist bump. We caught up with Francisco Blanchard, Bank of America yesterday. I saw that. About the unintended negative consequences associated with politicizing the SPR. Basically, we haven't had the all crisis yet. He's not saying we're going to get one, but he says we haven't had it yet. If we have one, and the SPR is exhausted, we've got an even bigger problem. From New York City this morning, good morning. Pay rolls just around a corner, Sarah House of Wells Fargo coming right up. You did not get stronger that moment that you're lifting the barbell. You get stronger as your body is making repairs, making recovery. Recovery is a win and how you get fit or faster stronger. Recovery technology includes everything from massage guns and foam rollers to compression boots, hyperbaric chambers, cryo chambers, infrared sonas. Even infrared pajamas. And athletes are partnering to become investors to take those products mainstream. When you look at tech and sports right now, it's completely innovating the way training is going, completely changing the way recovery is going. I think sky's the limit as far as where it can go. But while some of these products can feel amazing, it can be difficult to differentiate between what really helps the body and what just tricks the mind.

12252," Every time you're chasing the latest greatest newest tool, you're probably chasing a morade. Today's CFOs are reshaping the C-suite, positioning companies to meet the next generation of challenges, breaking out of traditional roles to become chief future officer, like Maryott's Lenealberg. One of the most important things is looking around the corner. Adrian Mitchell from Macy's. We have to let go of the traditional legacy department store. And Lucas Iramela at Mondalees. We tend to believe that all consumers are equal, they are not. Look for chief future officer on Bloomberg. Live from New York City. Good morning to you on this payrolls Friday. The median estimate of the Bloomberg survey, 255,000, the price action going into that number two as a way looks a little something like this on the S&P. S&P 500 futures negative about a tenth of 1% on the NASDAQ 100, we're down about a half of 1%. We have had a very, very wippy week, but we're still up on the week by about 4.5% on the S&P 500. Energy names up every single day. Monday through Thursday, those names as a group on the S&P are almost 15% in just four days. And you can thank the commodity market for that. Of course, WTI and Brent look a little something like this this morning, Brent crude at 9539 up more than 1% on WTI 8938. More than 1% also through Thursday, Lisa, up around 12% on WTI crude. And we add some more weight to that rally this morning. I thought you were going to say thank you to OPEC plus because they seem to really help the energy to them as well. Pretty well. I think it's interesting when you look at earnings expectations, people back out energy companies every single time. And they say, you know, earnings actually are expected to be up. And they have been up. And wow, look at all these positive earning surprises. And then they're saying, actually if you strip out energy companies, that's so much better. It doesn't matter if the inflation story, the last 18 months, they've stripped this out, stripped that out, everything's okay. Pretty much. So it's a tiny, round story. Exactly. And that's what we're seeing. And how much is that really what we see with each data point, pick the data point you want, craft a narrative, trade accordingly, and then get burned the next week. Let's pick up on the bomb market. I like that. That was great. Did you rehearse that? OK, 2010s and 30s. Look a little something like this. Two ads away from a jobs report just around a corner, your bomb market trading as follows, a 10-year yield on my terminal right now looks like this. A 10-year at about 385, a two-year at 427, yields up just a little bit, up a couple of basis points on two, later on 10s, up a couple of basis points also. So they've been all over the place, right? I mean, talk about the volatility in a benchmark yield is been incredible. Real yields, however, are actually at the highest level going back to 2011 on the 30-year bond. I find this interesting. Real yields, inflation adjusted or at least adjusted for the expectation implied by markets for inflation. I'm characterizing something to get a lot of hate now, saying that's not the inflation rate. It's not 3%, 2.5%. But anyway, that you're seeing that continue to climb with this feeling that the Fed's not going to be as accommodative going into the future. Generally, weeks we've been climbing higher on a 10-year yield, 10. Wow. This will be the 10th week. We're up about two basis points on the week, but this will be week number 10, a yield just climbing higher. It doesn't feel though like a steady climb, considering how wippy to use your word the action has been. We were 4% last week, back away from that level on Wednesday, but still on the week, the close things up on Friday. That's what we are right now. A couple of basis points to 385. Jobs number not too far away. Let's get there with Sarah House, Senior Economist of Wells Fargo. She's going to guide us through the details. Sarah, I've got a lot of notes. And a lot of notes really emphasize the participation right in the labor market. Is that going to be a key one for you? A little bit later this morning. It's a huge element. So participation is really the key to the Fed being able to pull off that soft landing. So getting more workers back, allowing more individuals to collect a paycheck, but at the same time, reducing some of those wage pressures and therefore the broader inflationary pressures. So I think the participation rate will, once again, be a huge focal point of today's report. The focal point this week was job openings. Job openings in America, the jobs report dropping by more than a million. Sarah, we're having the conversation around the desk.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,478,2022-10-07 10:35:37
12253," the huge focal point of today's report. The focal point this week was job openings. Job openings in America, the jobs report, drop in by more than a million. Sarah, we were having a conversation around a desk whether that was just a result of people taking jobs away or those jobs being filled. What's your read on that? So I think it's probably a combination, but I'd lean perhaps more towards some of those jobs being taken away if you look at the direction of what we've seen in other signals of labor demand. So for example, things like hiring plans from the NFIB, that's been trending lower since the start of the year. We see even consumers own perceptions of job availability measured by the labor differential from the conference board come down. So I think directionally it's a sign that labor demand is weakening, but to the extent you do have more people coming back into the labor force, I think that could still help us put up some pretty decent jobs numbers in terms of that net gain and payrolls here over the next couple of months. How important are hourly earnings when you take a look at the wage inflation, the wage spiral, the stickiness that the Fed is concerned about, but is also necessary or enough is necessary to keep the economy from completely tanking. Right, so we need to see average hourly earnings growth slow if we're going to be consistent with 2% inflation over time, unless we get a massive surge in productivity, which based on the latest data, even if you smooth through some of the volatility, we're just not seeing. And so I think while it does suggest that households are in for a pretty tough environment here, where it's likely that average hourly earnings will still continue to trail inflation here in the near term, it's unfortunately necessary in part of bringing down inflation, restoring that price stability side of the Fed's mandate. Sarah, we were just talking about the pain. And John was referencing the Jackson Hole speech and how Jay Powell was talking about how there was pain required to get inflation down. We have heard from some people saying, well, the Fed doesn't really want too much pain. They don't want people to lose their jobs. It becomes politically fraught. What is the appropriate amount of pain? And this is such a painful way to ask this question to use the same word over and over again, what's the appropriate amount to achieve what the Fed is looking for? So I don't think we are the Fed knows at this point. And so I think there is still an element of inflation that has been caused by just the distortions of the pandemic. So even though transitory has become unfashionable and kind of a dirty word, I think there is still some distortions that can be worked out, which could help the Fed. But I think it goes back to your previous question on wages and how there's still so much inflationary pressure coming out of the labor market that we can get some help on things like usados, car prices, goods prices more generally to bring inflation down. But with wages still running close to 5% annualized, you will need to see some weakness in the labor market to get inflation back down to 2% for the long haul. But there has been a bigger conversation over the last week, primarily because of the developments in the UK that this Fed could back off on financial stability concerns and that we would hit those financial stability concerns before ultimately they'd be able to achieve the set of conditions they want to see to bring inflation back towards target. Governor Waller said this yesterday, along with the improved regulatory framework, I believe we have the tools in place to address any financial stability concerns and should not be looking to monetary policy for this purpose. The focus of monetary policy needs to be fighting inflation. Sarah, are you on the same side as that? Do you believe that's what the Fed will ultimately do? Allow the regulators to take care of financial stability and let monetary policy have the exclusive goal of bringing inflation back down. So I think policymakers will still put first and foremost the Fed funds rate and the goal of bringing down inflation as will remain their focal point. But I think when we look at the financial stability concerns aspect of that, I think we really need to see a lot more break and a lot more go wrong before the Fed begins to encompass that in their policy setting goal. So I think if you did see enough turmoil and enough weakness then that could filter into the outlook for the broader economy when we think about household wealth, businesses, hiring and investment intentions if they see so much volatility in markets. But I think for now the Fed's going to remain just focused on inflation and not deal with the financial stability side of things until they really, really have to. When it comes to the United Kingdom with financial stability we were talking about the guilt market, we were talking about bonds and currency.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,479,2022-10-07 10:39:51
12254," deal with the financial stability side of things until they really, really have to. When it comes to the United Kingdom with financial stability, we were talking about the guilt market. We were talking about bonds and currency. In the United States, there's more discussion around the housing market and whether there could actually be some issue with financial stability. They're not because there's leverage akin to what we saw in the lead up to the financial crisis in 2008. But simply from the household wealth standpoint and this question of how sustainable are mortgage rates near 7%, was your view on how the Fed is looking at that other than great? Maybe they'll get the price down. So I think ultimately you're still seeing households in very strong financial position. There is probably some more weakness to come out of housing and home prices. But that has been one of the frothy parts of the market of the broader economy and therefore contributing to that inflation perspective. So this was really a segment that the Fed was calling out early on as an area of concern. And so I think more of that just reflects some of that correction that we're seeing. And I think it's something that the Fed is ultimately looking at, but it's just a piece of the puzzle when they're thinking about the broader outlook and what it's going to take to bring inflation down. So we're just final question. We went for the estimates this morning in the Bloomberg survey. 255 is the median. And all the estimates, the range is really compressed this month. Serrett, does anything explain that? Through the pandemic and over the last two years you've seen these massive ranges from economists, the low being maybe 100, the high being maybe 600, 700,000. What do you think explains the tightening gap of estimates on Wall Street? Well, I think part of it has to do with the fact that we are getting further into this cycle and the pandemic did throw a lot of distortions around the labor market from everything from to what extent supply comes back to some of the seasonal factors. And so I think as the cycle matures and that we're seeing those estimates get compressed as presumably there's less one way or one way or the other, but it's payrolls. You never fully know. So we'll see what happens here in a few hours. Serrett, thank you. As always, Westfago Bank looked at 275,000. Serra House there. The Bank of England's Dave Ramston speaking at the moment, a range of headlines. And I'm going to pick up one because we're talking about financial instability there. And giving them bond purchases designed to buy time. Yeah, by time for who? And that's a good question. Is it by time for the trust administration or by time for the central bank to understand the inflation that they're looking at and how much they're going to have to hike rates? What I find interesting is that they actually didn't buy bonds for several days in order. The Bank of England refrained from buying bonds, both on Tuesday and on Wednesday. And in those days yields surged. You saw a complete reversal. And so you wonder how much October 14th really is an epivital moment, even though they say, what we haven't used all of our firepower is just the presence in the market. A huge stabilizer that perhaps people are under appreciating. The 30 years up, 53 basis points this week in a guilt market. It's quite a move. And this is going to cause a lot of problems for a lot of households. And so how do you deal with that if you're a central bank trying to fight inflation? But also, where does this stability come into play? Do you think not being massively active is them drawing a distinction between addressing a bond market that was raising financial stability concerns and not doing yield curve control? Isn't that the effort here? It's a very narrow distinction. And you're still hearing concerns about the LDI portfolio is about some of these pension funds and what they're doing with the guilt. So this hasn't gone away. Where does financial stability begin and where does just normal functioning leave off? I like getting the feedback on the terminal because everyone else with a Bloomberg is smarter than I am. And me? So I said, by time for who and someone message me immediately and said, by time for the LDI schemes, we need to reposition, which ultimately is the story, right? And that's clearly they haven't fully repositioned quite yet. From New York City this morning, payroll is just around a corner, 730 AM east and time. So not too long from now, we're going to catch up with Anna and Zennett of Morgan Stanley looking forward to that from New York. This is Blaineback. Keeping you up to date with news from around the world with the first word, I'm Lisa Mateo. Less than two hours from now, we'll see if the hot US labor market has started to cool off.

12255," They take an order or they refuse it. And that's a kind of flexibility. That's what shoppers really value and the kind of transparency that they want. Are you seeing a labor shortage right now? And what are you doing to combat that? It's different in different places. Or demographic of shoppers is completely different from food delivery and right sharing where 70% women and half of them are moms. And that's because a lot of the job at Instacart is very different and just being in a car with strangers. It's about like going to the store, doing a good job of customer service of really picking the right products for the consumer. And we are seeing that being very appealing to women. And we are seeing that being very appealing to women. As you're online home for weekly Boston Symphony Orchestra and Boston Pops performances, I want to be a real man when I grow up. I've got a lot of plans. You've got to be charmingly relentless. You have to build emotional endurance because there's no straight line of success at the kind of all over place and you have to just be able to work through those things. And then I think one of the things that I do every week is I try to create serendipity. We just now need to stay the course. We said we're going to do this. We need to follow through and validate the expectations that we've set in markets. Until I see some evidence that underlying inflation has solidly peaked and is hopefully headed back down, I'm not ready to declare a pause. I think we're quite a ways away from a pause. Neil Kashkary, the Minneapolis Fed president making his message loud and clear repeatedly. Yes, I think he spoke twice, didn't he, Lisa? Yes, I think so. OK, I think we'll hear from him again before the next Fed decision. No doubt. Like from New York City this morning, good morning. Payroll is just around a corner. 255 is the median estimate. Jeffries it 350 a whole bunch of banks at 300k. Then another group at around 250,000 Goldman Sachs down at the bottom down near the bottom at 200,000. Yield to higher by about a basis point 383, 88. Equities go nowhere on the S&P 500. Lisa pretty much dead flat unchanged on everything with the exception of crude. And we've had a big rally through the last four, five days. I people don't understand just what the decline in demand actually is going to be versus the decline in the market. And I think that's big question mark versus some response from the White House. I mean, this sort of sea of uncertainty as the reason why David Baylen, not just in the crude market, but just more broadly, there's not a lot of conviction out there. What you think the next giveaway from the White House will be if this is a bad jobs report. So you can go OPEC plus doesn't go well and then they come out with a big announcement on legalizing marijuana. I don't know. You know, this is for you. You can you can elaborate. What do you think? I'm not going to tell you what I think. That's for Anne Marie. I'm not going to join us a little bit later and I want you to snatch it. It's actually a few economists for Bloomberg and a fantastic. I have you with us in studio. Bloomberg economics has a really big call for next year. You think Fed funds is going to go to about five. I think that's about something like 40 basis points above market pricing right now. What separates you from everyone else? Why do you think we can achieve that 5% Fed funds rate? Well, we have been holding that position since July. I think that's the first on Wall Street.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,481,2022-10-07 10:52:19
12256," I think right now what separates you from everyone else? Why do you think we can achieve that 5% Fed funds rate? Well, we have been holding that position since July. We were the first on Wall Street 2 and make that call. And the reason why was because we perceived change in the reaction function of Fed or Reserve that I suspect that the U-star is higher than 4%. So the U-star is the Nehru basically and based on the dot plot I see that it's actually they think that it's about 4.4% right now and still think that that's a pretty optimistic assumption based on job matching data and how difficult it is to hire based on what we heard from surveys. It just sounds like the U-star is more likely to be in the range of 4.5% which would mean that if you plug that number into any standard policy reaction function that would imply a Fed funds rate 5 or higher actually. The pushback we get and I'm sure as the pushback you get to is that some achieve a bull you will find out you're going to experience financial stability concerns long before you get there. How do you answer that one? So as Governor Waller said very clearly monetary policy tools are not designed for financial stability management. So the Fed has put out lots of report on that. The more appropriate tools is actually macro-predential and micro-predential policies such as tightening the bank capital regulations. And monetary policy really is designed for stabilizing macroeconomic outcome. And to think that they would lower interest rate or just pause to preempt financial risk that they're not sure will happen at the expense of perhaps higher inflation to them it's a very costly bet. So that said there are probably a number of studies being done by the Federal Reserve and by a number of others about how high rates could go before it does present a problem to the trillions of dollars of debt that have been issued during a time of incredibly low interest rates. Do you have some estimate of where things get a little problematic considering the debt profile and the interest rates that people have currently and where they would have to refinance that? Right. I think so that sort of test would be done in the supervision section which would be running some stress test. But I don't think that's a primary concern for the FOMC committee. Just because, you know, to be frank, raising rates to this level will break something. There will be an increase in defaults. I mean, in the 1994 Mexico went into default because of a FETS raising rates. That will happen and they will, but their eyes are laser focused on inflation. How is this time different than in previous decades because the fiscal response is not possible in the same way that it has been in the past? There is the inability to borrow at the cheap rates that people have gotten accustomed to and we're already seeing that pushback in Europe. We're already seeing that pushback in England. How much does that factor into your expectation of growth over the longer term? Yeah. I think what market has underpriced right now is the death of this recession. I think that given that the fiscal response, as you said, is limited because we are already at a very high trajectory of fiscal debt given our pandemic response. This recession could last longer, not only because the FEDS decide not to ease, but also because there's not much countercyclical fiscal policy to have. But although I will say that one silver lining on the fiscal front is the state and local government. And Powell actually said this during the press conference that there's still a lot of buffer at the state and local government level. I mean, the pandemic stimulus provided about $1 trillion to state and local government. And their coffers have been swelling with revenues due to higher property, higher tax revenues from capital income gains over the last two years. So they actually have been given checks. I mean, I live in Virginia. I just got a $500 check. People who live in California. Do you want me to move to Virginia? It's a fundraising. Why are we not getting free money? I mean, for what?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,482,2022-10-07 10:56:37
12257," Virginia, I just got a $500 check. People who live in California. Do you want me to move to Virginia? It's a condor. Why are we not getting free money? It's still good. I mean, for what? Just because they have a lot of money in the, in the coffer and California people are getting a thousand, like, a thousand dollar check and, and, you know, they're not the only states like Connecticut, you know, they're giving out gas holiday of OPEC drive, drive oil price up to $100. I'm pretty sure given the fiscal, you know, buffers of the state and local government, we are going to see gas holidays provided by states. This sounded super bearish until the end. Thank you, Anna. This is what has come down to, hasn't it? There's a couple of conversations going on here. We've had the soft landing versus half landing conversation a million times. The other one is they will break something. They won't break something. They'll risk breaking something. They won't even go there. And that separates the balls and the bears right now. And it's called a market too. And what Anna is saying is that inflation is very real. The potential for breaking something isn't real enough to really scare them away from doing this. And that's what's being reiterated from a federal official after federal official. So at what point does the market understand that and reprise accordingly, right? So when does the next question go to the Mike Wilson issue of what does the market, what should it look like if you discount any potential for removing some of the hawkishness simply because of the possibility of something breaking? A number one difficulty, Anna touched on it. Where does the counter cyclical circuit break a come from? For the equity market bulls in a way that we saw it play out in the pandemic and pretty much every other crisis over the last several decades. What does it come from? We just heard from state and local governments giving a $500 check and giving you a $1,000 gas holiday. I mean, how much is this really going to be the future until it runs out? Doesn't that make you more concerned about inflation? Completely. Not less. I mean, this shows the whole issue with the United Kingdom. I'm going to counter to what the central bank wants to achieve. Right. That basically the UK coming out with a plan to cap energy costs with no discussion of capping demand. This becomes the problem. That's the politics, right? That's the politics. And that's why policy at the moment in a lot of places is increasingly in conflict. Premier's was going to join us shortly from TD looking forward to that just an absolutely brilliant call from her earlier this year on yield curve inversion. Your yields right now up to basis points on a 10 year 384 49 your jobs report just around the corner on payrolls Friday. This is blowing back. So is there more pressure when you're trying to win a basketball championship than when you're trying to please investors? Where's the greater pressure? Oh, I think it's definitely trying to win a championship. It's hard because a lot of like when you invest and you know this when you're investing you can control a lot more things when you know in a basketball court you can't control whether somebody's going to make a shot you've got to get lucky. And what's the greater pleasure making five times your money on a distressed debt investment or winning the NBA championship? They're both fabulous. I wish I could do one each year that would be great. But I think there's a great feeling in being right on an investment that you've done a tremendous amount of work and you've made money for your clients which I think is great. I think winning a championship is...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,483,2022-10-07 11:01:22
12258," that you've done a tremendous amount of work and you've made money for your clients, which I think is great. I think winning a championship is... it's a very surreal feeling because there's a whole city or state that is actually behind you. You know, we had 70,000 people at the finals and we had them all outside. It's 17,000 in stands and then literally like 60,000 people outside. And when we won, like just the joy that you had brought to the city was phenomenal. For a young person who now booking in a career, would you recommend a Wall Street career today? There are not many jobs you can have as a young individual, but you're always, always learning. We will never break, we will never break, build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never. The Morgan has been on a super high over the last few days. We've seen volatility across all asset markets. We might see some downturn dynamics driven by monetary policy. We're going to look at a higher for longer story and not necessarily a disinert word, central bank share, interpining cuts next year. The Fed's really going to struggle to convince markets that it needs to do a total 125 versus points in those last two meetings of the year. This is Bloomberg's Evalence with Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow and Lisa Abramowitz. Payrolls 90 minutes away, live from New York City this morning, good morning, good morning for our audience worldwide on TV and radio. Alongside Lisa Abramowitz, I'm Jonathan Farrow. This is Bloomberg's Evalence, your payrolls report. Not too far away, Lisa. We're looking for 255K. And what difference will it make? I'm sorry to sound extra sensitive. Sure, now I'm with you. But in all honesty, how big do the numbers have to really be to really change the narrative on Wall Street? The Fed is going to go hard that this economy is doing okay, that there is signs of slowing, but it's not enough to really cause sort of a circuit breaker for the Federal Reserve. Changes the story going into the weekend, whatever the number might be, and then it gets hijacked by CPI next week. It's all about inflation. They're saying to us, they're looking at the totality of the data. I've said this repeating and you've said it too. There's one number that's a little bit bigger than all the rest. It's inflation. That's the one that matters. And that's what they're targeting more aggressively than anything else. They keep repeating it. They're willing to accept weakening in the jobs market. They're willing to accept weakening in many other metrics in order to get that inflation down. Remember when we cared about University of Michigan sentiment? For five minutes for one print. And then it went away. And then we cared about Joltz, perhaps for five minutes. And then that's going to go away. And then CPI will come out. And we'll care about that. But people will be looking at core. How are they data dependent? If the data is shifting in terms of its importance, really a real-time read on this economy. Answer your own question, didn't you? They just make it up as they go along. One week is this data point. The next meeting is another data point. Inflation still run and get 8%. I mean, come on. It gets ridiculous sometimes. We're going to look at the participation rate. The jobs report a little bit later this morning. If that starts to rise, get excited about a supply side solution, maybe. Inflation still at 8%. Can they back off with CPI with an eight handle? Can they really? Well, they can't, right? But David Bailey, Bailey was really highlighting this issue that you see in markets, which is people believe that the Fed will raise rates significantly. But they don't believe they will have to hold them there for that long. Even as the Fed comes out and says, yes, we will. Yes, we will. Yeah, no, no, we really will. And everyone says, no. And we're seeing that consistently in the pricing. And at what point does the Fed have the credibility to actually go through with what they're saying to actually convince markets to move in that direction? A word on Governor Waller yesterday afternoon.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,484,2022-10-07 11:05:20
12259," point is the Fed have the credibility to actually go through with what they're saying to actually convince markets to move in that direction. A word on Governor Waller yesterday afternoon. What do you make of that? Basically, he went through point by point every argument for the bulls and just said you're wrong. Cold water. Freezing. Freezing. Just basically, if you're worried about financial stability and you think that we're going to pause rate hikes because of financial stability concerns, you're wrong. That's basically what he said. He went through each argument and just absolutely tried to dash it. At what point could it get more clear than that? You know, the bulls were saying back, no, you're wrong. You're wrong. That's the conversation right now, right? It's not just soft landing versus hard landing in the economy. It's about whether they respond to financial instability risk or not. Do you think that the Federal Reserve has really regained credibility given that we're having this discussion with the market challenging its premise? The amount they're talking, the idea that they're all on the same page, I think they don't think themselves they've regained that credibility yet, which speaks to why they're all singing from the same hymn shit repeatedly, repeatedly. And you saw that from cash Gary yesterday. And to your point, for Governor Waller to go through point by point by point, everything, equity bulls would like to see and just push back. I think that tells you everything you need to know. They're listening to markets and they're saying, you guys are wrong. We have conviction. We're on the same page. And I think you said it really well, which is the fact that they're all speaking and speaking twice a day, three times a day to say the same thing to go through each point that's being talked about in markets. So it's quite a bit. You know what the bulls and bears all agree on? They just want that to start. They think you're right about that. They really do. Here's the price action this Friday morning. Good morning to you. We shape up as follows in the equity market, going into payrolls, looking for something in and around 255k, according to our survey. That's the median estimate so far. Futures unchanged on the S&P yields up just a little bit up by a couple of basis points, 384 49 on a US 10 year. And Euro, don't do much in 97 97. I tell you something that's done a lot this week. It's crude up another one percentage point W T I Lisa 8937. What a muddle there. I just want to offer you this. Chris Web on Twitter says that we still do care about University of Michigan sentiment because of the vibes. So there are some people who still care. 830 AM. We get the September US non farm payrolls report. The high number from JPMorgan asset management, David Kelly 389,000. The low of 199,000. How much will actually make a difference at a time when average hourly earnings are still rising at an estimated 5% year over year, marginally much more in certain areas. And frankly, as every single Fed official comes out and says, you know what, we are going to continue raising rates. Even if something breaks, we will hold them there. Today we also hear from the administration on what the response is to the Labor Market report. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh on with our very own Jonathan Farrow on Bloomberg Television at 940 AM and President Biden speaking later in the day. How do they spin this? Right? I mean, how do they talk about a good labor market as a positive thing when you have a Federal Reserve pushing back and saying, actually, this is a problem based on where we need inflation to be and we cannot have a stable labor market given that inflation is above eight or nine percent. And we'll get the spin because we do have a daily Fed show and that Fed show today in consists of New York Fed President John Williams, Minneapolis Fed President Neil Cushkari, again, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, again. How many times they have to come out, John, and really just reiterate, we're going to stay the course. And if you guys are pushing back, that's going to be on you when you get, you know, basically your Facebook stuff. What are the vibes? What does that mean? The vibes. How are you feeling? How are you feeling today? Like the vibes of the economy? Yeah. Okay. How's it going? That's very sensitivity. You're talking about the vibes of the bond market from TD securities. Pretty great to catch up. We keep celebrating your wonderful call on yield curve inversion. You said negative 40, maybe negative 50 long before we got anywhere near those kind of levels. Right now, Tuesday's negative 43. Pretty, you've got the crystal ball. What's driving this? Oh, I don't have the crystal ball. There's still a lot of uncertainty out there. But the reason for that inversion, which I have to say our up-air forecast sort of argues for more inversion or the inversion persisting is this idea that economy responds to a lag with a lag to high interest rates. And the labor market's still tight. So we're looking for a 300,000 payrolls, another strong report. It's going to keep the Fed very much on their mission that they're going to continue to raise rates.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,485,2022-10-07 11:10:01
12260," trades and the labor market is still tight. So we're looking for a 300,000 payrolls, another strong report. It's going to keep the Fed very much on their mission that they're going to continue to raise rates. You know, I think the front end is pretty fairly price. We're looking for 5% terminal. The market's price for 4.6. I mean, between 4.6 or 5, what's 40 base points among friends? So that's largely, I think, well priced. It's the long end. I think what's happened is as the market's reprised the front end, it's also taken long end rates higher. And that's what I struggled with. I think the Fed's forecast of 4.4 on the unemployment rate by the end of next year looks very, very optimistic. I think if they're going to tighten and they're all telling us all of them that they're going to tighten, they've also got QT tightening, that's going to start to slow things down significantly and they may want to keep rates on hold higher for longer. But if the economy slows down meaningfully at some point, and this is what I'll stress, maybe it's not the end of 23. Maybe it's a 24 story. But the 10 years pricing in a view over a long time, the Fed's going to have to cut a lot more than what's priced in because they need to take rates into accommodative territory. We're talking well into the future, but that's what the 10 years pricing in. So I think that 10 year feels unsustainable at 4%. So, you know, it's not so much now a front end call. My flat-knuckle is much more that the long end is going to rally because we're going to see the growth slowing and we're going to hear from a pretty tone-deaf Fed that they're going to continue to raise rates. Priya, that's exactly where I wanted to go. You call the Fed tone-deaf. How is the Fed being tone-deaf right now? Well, I should clarify, they're not being tone-deaf on inflation. I think they've recognized that there's an inflation problem. It's much too high. They want to keep expectations anchored. Where they're tone-deaf is the tightening and financial conditions and the slowing in the economy. I actually think it's the intended consequence of tightening where they're going to sound tone-deaf is as the economy slows down and we're used to affect that response. We used to remember the preemptive cuts in 2019 where things started to slow down and the Fed said, you know what, let's cut a few times to be preemptive. I think the inflation picture just reduces that policy space for the Fed to sound preemptive at all. In fact, I'm going to argue they're going to be late. They're going to want the data to tell them to start to cut and the data is going to slow down slowly because a lot of the data that they're looking at, CPI, labor market, these are highly lagging indicators. So by the time they slow down, we'll be well into a recession, which is why I think they'll have to cut more. But they are going to be tone-deaf to slowing in the economy, which the equity market is going to keep tantruming about. You said something that I really want to pick up on about the 10-year treasury yields, going much lower in the future and people are discounting how much the Fed's going to have to lower rates. When we do get that kind of downturn, what seems fair value? How do you push back against people who say we are entering a higher inflationary regime with a Fed that cannot afford to be as accommodative as it was over the past few decades? Sure. So I would separate that 10-year into real rates and inflation expectations. Now, if you believe and we're sort of in that candidate inflation will come down. There's base effects next year, you know, commodity prices are already lower, notwithstanding, oh, what a pick did. But, you know, if inflation gets down to say 3% by the end of next year or 2024, then it's really the question of real rates. Can the economy handle higher real rates? And there is this narrative building that we are entering some new normal, or maybe we're going back to the old normal, that the economy can handle higher interest rates. I know leverage is not as much of an issue, but I don't think productivity or the potential output for the economy of potential growth is that much higher. I don't think we can handle much higher real rates. So, 10-year real rates, well north of 1%, that's going to slow the interest sensitive sectors first, that's going to spill out further. So, you know, if you're nervous about inflation or you think inflation might stay high for longer, buy those real rates, because I think the economy's ability to withstand higher real rates has not changed. I think there's a lot of evidence that our star or really equilibrium real rates is lower. And so, maybe, you know, you can you can decompose your view on the 10-year and just have more faith in that real rate component, which is where we come out, that those real rates are much too high. They won't be able to be sustained for that long. Priya, I've got 20 seconds. Just some very, very quick short, snappy scenario analysis. Yields up, yield down. If we get a big up size surprise, 400 K, you tell me if it's yield up, yield down, and the same with 100 K, a little bit later.

Later how does this play out in the bomb market? Well depends on which yields I think if it's front end. Absolutely higher because the feds gonna keep going']ai not stopping the long and I think will also move above hire. But that's what I would look to you know start to go long. Hundred Kevin? I think I mean it should be lower 100K is not going to deter them from going 125 this year in terms of heights or continuing heights next year. So I think it's which part of the curve but 100K certainly bullish for that long end and really I you know I will say equity is a negative in either scenario because either you have a hawkish Fed or a slowing economy. It sounds like you'll buy a 10s in either scenario too. Ultimately Priya, wonderful to catch up. Thank you. Priya Misra of TD, your jobs report isn't too far away 830 eastern time.

Putin renewed his nuclear threats when he announced the annexation of territory in Ukraine. The Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to human rights activists from Ukraine, Russia and Belarus. It was cited for documenting war crimes, human rights abuses and abusive power. At the same time the chair of the Nobel Committee criticized Vladimir Putin and the government in Belarus for suppressing activists. Researchers on the Fed will be watching today's monthly U.S. jobs report closely. It's forecast to show that employers added 255,000 jobs in September.

There, Apple has search ads. This allows developers to buy their way and dishoeing a buyer on search results.

12262," Apple's push into ads is a little ironic, given that its ATT or app tracking transparency privacy feature limits the ability for meta, snack, and even smaller developers to generate as much revenue as possible for matter-attizing. That's because the feature allows users to choose if they want their data collected and tracked across third-party apps and websites. Still, Apple's hoping to expand its own ads business and is planning to add search ads to its maps app. Other areas where ads could eventually appear are an Apple books and Apple podcasts, along maybe one day with an ad supported tier of Apple TV Plus to compete with new offerings from Netflix and other streaming video providers.

Can you make sense of this, Lisa? You know, I keep going back to Gary Evans. Take your pick. And they're the most hawkish among the group and we have James Bullard who might end up being dovish later on because he doesn't necessarily see the need to continue hiking rates as dramatically. How much though does this really highlight that the pain is being felt by inflation and what that's doing to household budgets not by the potential unemployment and not by the potential weakness in an economy that has not even realized?

Is this a skeptical face? No, just like when you're going like this. Come on. So I asked Francisco Blanchard, Bank of America about this, about the unintended negative consequences that come from the politicization of SPR. Take a listen to this. We have had no oil crisis yet. And the keyword here is, yet. If you lose your ability to temper price appreciation, because there is an actual physical disruption of molecules in cruel oil, you're going to, you have those barrels in store. That's, I think, a big problem releasing the SPR right now. Fridge, team coverage starts right now with Maria today in Prague and Amory Hauden in Washington, DC. M.H. is day two of OPEC plus fallout. What's the latest? Well, latest is that Jonathan. What you're hearing on Capitol Hill is more of this idea, at least from lawmakers, even though they're back campaigning for the midterms, what they are talking about is Saudi Arabia. And they're talking about NOPEC, this idea and this legislation that for really 20 years has kicked around, but no president would really ever sign this, right? Because the repercussions. And this would basically give the Justice Department the leeway to go out and sue some of these countries a part of OPEC. Now, right now, even though this is potentially just an idea, you have Senator Chuck Grassley saying that he wants to put it as an amendment to the defense spending bill. His inbox, yesterday, what I got from him, was my bipartisan NOPEC that would crack down on these tactics by the foreign oil cartel. And what's interesting is I asked Amos Hockstein Biden's top energy adviser about this. That statement from Jake Sullivan and Brian Deese was this a nod to NOPEC. And he said, I'll let you read the tea leaves. So the administration is definitely sending a warning shot. And we should say that even just the mention of NOPEC, this would give some golf officials nightmares. Although they're kind of pushing back. And Maria, I'd love you to weigh in on this. We heard from them that the oil price caps for Russia, that Europe is currently talking about, was part of the reason for their wanting to cut production because of the insecurity, the extra uncertainty introduced by this. Do you understand what these price caps are and how they're factoring into this political decision? Well, I think a lot of people are still trying to understand exactly how the... Oh, go ahead. Go ahead, Maria. Take it up. Go for it, Emory. All right, I'll quickly say my thoughts on the price cap and I'll hand it over to Maria because obviously, this is a huge issue for Europe. US officials want this to happen. But it's the Europeans that are really going to have to be the ones to implement it because they're the ones that have sanctioned that Russian oil. And also, it's the Greeks and the Cypriots who really have the transactions for this in terms of the shipbuildings. But from the OPEC side, what they don't like, a lot of producers is the fact that they think this would send and set a very bad precedent. The fact that the United States could decide what a producer is selling their oil at. Maria, what's your view? I think it's estimated that it's still one-foot-side. Well, I would say it's day two of a summit. It is one-thirty by my standards and 30 minutes it's time to break up for lunch. And European leaders are still locked up in a room trying to figure out what they want to do with energy prices. Now, to me, what is striking is that effort nothing here. This is not a conversation, the oil at all. And again, this goes back to the fundamental issue. This is something that is incredible. The political is domestic agenda in the US. But when you look at the domestic agenda for the Europeans or focus at this point, I would say almost exclusively is on gas. They're still debating this price cap. Again, I can tell you there's five different options on the table that is part of the problem. They can't agree on a solution because they still haven't figured out which of the options could actually fly. The other thing today that is being debated, and this is potentially new, is the European Union saying, perhaps we should revisit some of the tactics that we used in the pandemic. That means that we buy gas as one single unit. So you don't have European countries that essentially go out on the market and outbid each other. Now, this was something that the French President floated. He said, perhaps it could be a good idea. And now we buy not as individuals.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,489,2022-10-07 11:27:17

Now we buy not as individuals, but as an EU. The question is, however, who decides who gets what? And if you're Germany, what you care about is having a lot of reserves as winter. The two of you, so polite to each other, written out in Prague and in May, down in DC. You see that? Just refuse to step on each other. Oh, yeah, you know, some people. It's a bit like surveillance. It's about to say, home of cutting people off. I was going to say, when do we get to another level? But this is one reason why too, some of the Zoom communication and the delays were really problematic during the pandemic. I will just say because you start talking and then it's like this awkward. Well, do you let the other person go? I get it. Come on. This wasn't this like one of the big sort of things. I hate to do in pandemic. I'm home and radio. Oh, it was brutal, right? Drive me insane. So I'm just, I give them, I give them credit because it's not easy. There were moments where everything would go silent. And I had no idea if we were in commercial break or not. So I would just stare down the barrel of the camera and talk for five minutes on my own. My children would be eating breakfast on the couch. Right. And they would be really quiet, but they would, you know, be kind of creeping over to the sink. And I just like, oh, come on. Come on. There's no reminiscing at that time. All right. Pety Rose and Arrowway, we're looking for 255K throughout the whole pandemic in the last couple of years. The range has been so wide and all of a sudden it's really, really tight. And I wonder what that tells you. I mean, honestly, maybe it's that nobody really wants to take a real big wild gas. Maybe it's just because things are chugging along. And when do we hit that press piss where we see a real shift that really changes the discussion where we start to care a little bit more about jobs before because it is important, but it's not really going to move the needle. Which ones the high JP Morgan asset management? Yep. We got a nine. Really nine. Goldman near the low at about 200K. The jobs number 60 minutes away. We'll catch up with Alan Santor and Morgan Stanley as well in just a moment. Looking forward to that. In studio here in New York, live from New York, this is Bloomberg. Music. Music. Music. Music.

So that's the connection between the commodity market and equities this morning and through the week. Let's talk about the bond market too. The 10 year coming very close to grinding out another weekly gain on the yield for a 10th consecutive week. Yields higher by two basis points on a 10 year. Right now Lisa at about 384.49. And the moment real yields really we cannot over state how significant that is and prior was talking about how that really does shift some of the expectations for risk asset pricing based just on that and how sustainable that is. I want to take a look at a couple single names in particular in the semiconductor space because AMD reported earnings last night and they actually said that their third quarter sales projections missed expectations by more than a billion dollars. They said that things are moving very quickly. Those shares are down more than 5% in pre market trading. But this echoes what we've heard from Samsung. This echoes what we've heard from Intel and Nvidia and all of those shares down very sharply year to date. If you take a look, you're seeing more than 50% declines for AMD and for Nvidia Intel shares down nearly that much. John, you wonder at what point this is a signal for something broader than just a rapidly shifting cycle where people are buying personal devices. They built up infinitories. And now they're not seeing the same orders. Right? Is it that kind of stop and go in that specific sector? Or is it a broader statement that's going to hit Apple? That's going to hit the other big tech names in a fundamental way aside from just valuation because of real yields because of some of the changes in monetary policy. Apple reporting around Apple in the last week suggesting there's a bit of a demand issue. The demand is faltering with the iPhone. Chris Alfioff, who has Fargo, remember the original Chris Court, which is wait for the weakness that will come the first half of 2023 is saying in the earnings it's going to come much, much quicker now and his views changed in the last couple of weeks. And if AMD, if Samsung, if Intel, if all of these chip makers are any indication of a broader economic slowdown, particularly in the chip sector, particularly in some of the electronic devices that people bought feverishly during the pandemic, then this is setting a pretty bearish signal. What we see some of that data in the labor market and police say that John, it gets around the table and in Zener, the chief US economist of Morgan Stanley, and good morning. Great to have you with us. Morning. Went through the preview note, went through a couple of the numbers. And again, I said this to say.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,492,2022-10-07 11:38:07
12266," to say that you want to get around the table. And in Zena, the chief US economist of Morgan Stanley and in good morning. Great to have you with us. Morning. Went through the preview note. Went through a couple of the numbers. And again, I said this to Sarah House of Wells Fargo. It's interesting. A lot of you are highlighting what you expect in participation. Yeah. How important is that going to be in 60 minutes time? It's really important. I think headlining is what markets are going to be focused on here because the Fed needs to see substantial slowdown in job gains. But participation from a medium-term standpoint, we need to see more flows back into the labor market. And immediately we look at primage labor force participation. So you strip out. Those are less than 25 years old. You strip out those that are older than 54 years old. And we call that the primage participation. We want to see those flows continue to come back into the labor market. Because regardless of how many job gains you've got, that's what's going to help you take pressure off of wages. And that's a problem for the Fed. When inflation is that high. That's the ultimate bullish solution for people in this equity market. We get this positive evolution on the supply side. What do you think the job openings, what do you think the message is from the job openings decline that we got earlier this week, when it comes to the story of getting a supply side response? Yeah. So I think of job openings as missed. So what we've been hearing from companies since the summer, and this comes from our equity analysts, we do these department huddles with our equity analysts. And companies have been telling us, look, we hired the need to fill positions. We've had these nice to have positions that have just been open for a long time. And we've not been able to fill them. So guess what? They're going to go away into the mist. That's the drop in job openings that we're seeing now. Now that typically leads slower hiring or slower payroll gains. So that's actually encouraging to us that we are going to be right. And you're going to see a more substantial slowdown in job gains. It sounds terrible. Economists are the worst. We get so excited at bad data. But that's what the Fed needs to see for them to be comfortable that they're really dinging the real economy. The fact that we haven't seen worse data, talking about sort of the perverse inclination right now of economists that want to see inflation slow. The fact that we have not seen that weakening, how far away are we from the possibility of soft lending? How much further are we than we were, say, three months ago? Well, it is the case that all year, right, every vision's been going higher for inflation, lower for growth. Inflation has now moved into the very sticky parts of the economy. I think it's going to be very hard to get a substantial slowing in rental prices, which is the biggest component that Fed is concerned with. You've just got to get the unemployment rate higher. And so I think as we're moving into next year, you are going to see more evidence of the trend in inflation softening, right? Not a big drop, but softening at the same time that you've got a real drawdown in these job gains. So that sort of sluggish global economy, sluggish US economy, with the evidence of that, right? Would tell you, okay, we can be more certain that this trend is going to continue. That's one reason why, you know, when we talk about the Fed pivot, what does that mean? All right, does it mean they go from hiking to cutting, hiking to stopping? To me, the first pivot is hiking to slowing those hikes. And I think that's when markets and risk assets really grab onto that message, because that's the beginning of the end of the hiking cycle. As soon as you indicate you're comfortable to even slow the pace. And that's what we're waiting for. Is it appropriate, though, at that point to really feel bullish on risk assets, based on the fact that then you have seen the weakness that will necessarily lead to weaker profits, perhaps a persistently higher unemployment rate, if you believe the stickiness that a lot of people speak about once people lose their jobs? Yeah, so I think this is the biggest debate that economists are having with the strategist, right? Because, and one sense you're saying, okay, I'm really encouraged that we're getting to the end of this hiking cycle. But if you're getting to the end of the hiking cycle because things are really bad, then can that be a real bullish sign? And so you've got to have some signs that the economy is slowing, but isn't going to be disaster, right? And we have GDP growing half a percent next year. Now, statistically speaking, that's no different than putting a negative sign in front of it. So it is a very, we are walking a knife's edge difference between the soft and the hard landing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,492,2022-10-07 11:40:33
12267," Now statistically speaking, that's no different than putting a negative sign in front of it. So it is a very, we are walking a knife-sedge difference between the soft and the hard landing. Some banks have a negative sign. Bank for America is one might gap and call up at least for an eye earlier this week. And he told us that he's expecting the first three quarters to be negative growth next year. And we asked him if the Federal Reserve would be cutting with that backdrop and he said, no, if they're going to cut, it's going to start at the end. December 23 is that we said something like that. Kevin, do you foresee a scenario that could play out where we get a recession and they don't cut interest rates? Well, they will cut interest rates and it will be recession in Gapensview, right? But the Fed is lagged, right? Because they have to wait for the body of evidence of the data to come in. And it can be quite lagged when you get evidence of negative straight quarters. It all comes down to financial markets at that point. You can be in recession with still high inflation, but our markets in disarray is liquidity hampered. Our credit conditions really deteriorating. That then is why the Fed would then need to respond. If a recession is coming with that, I mean, think about it. We got negative growth in the first half of this year and they didn't cut rates, right? So we also have the Fed cutting in December 2023. That's later than the market expects because inflation is still going to be quite high, even with growth as weak as we have it. What does this mean for longer term expectations of growth given that this economy is based predicated on rates that are incredibly low, on debt that's been issued at near zero rates or benchmark rates, and that suddenly we're talking about protracted periods of time with north of 4% Fed funds rate. How much slower will growth have to be in the world's biggest economy over the next five years? So I would think of it as separating a cyclical from a longer-run view. If you think about longer-run dynamics that affect potential growth in the economy, nothing's really changed, right? The demographic backdrop is the same. Productivity, metrics are the same and expected to be about the same. And so it's one reason why you don't see the Fed really revise their estimates for longer run potential growth in the economy. Sickly though, we've got to digest higher rates than we've had in quite some time. Now, what matters is the shape of the debt that you're carrying. So households are locked in at low fixed rates. 97% of mortgages outstanding today are being held at a 30-year fixed rate, and the effective yield on all of that is about 3.4%. So as the Fed is raising interest rates, the bulk of the household balance sheet, those interest expenses are not changing. For corporates, right? We hit COVID rates zero, and they refied. And so now that wall of debt that was coming, do has now been pushed out to about 2028. So you're talking about the next three, four years, right? And because of the composition of the balance sheet of households and corporates, it's not as big of a problem as you would think in terms of growth. It sounds like all roads lead to a higher terminal rate. Given everything you've just said, do we have to push it higher to slow this economy down? Yeah. And there's a near-term neutral rate, and you hear the Fed talking about that. Inflation is high, labor market is tight, so they've got to go much further. They don't know how much further. That's the problem. None of us do, right? Longer run, again, the dynamics haven't really changed. So at some point, in a beautiful world, and their forecasts are always in a beautiful world, you start to normalize policy back toward that 2.5% neutral rate that they think the economy should be running at. Why are they full-conciled ways in a beautiful world? Why use that? That's the modeling. The model's always looked to return you to this beautiful, you know, it's hell-ent-beauty in these forecasts. Right? So over time, as they stretch their forecasts on further and further, they're forecasting out to 2025. If any economist tells you they're accurate more than two quarters out, they're just lying. I mean, guaranteed you will be wrong. You can get the narrative right, but guaranteed you the numbers will be wrong. But the longer you go, right, these models are just going to return you back to this beautiful equilibrium.

Less than an hour from now, we'll see if the hot US labor market has started to cool off. Today's jobs report is forecast to show employers added 255,000 workers in September. That would be the fewest in a month since it declined in late 2020. Even if that happens, it's not expected to convince the Fed to stop raising interest rates. President Biden has taken his first major steps toward decriminalizing marijuana. The president parted in thousands of Americans convicted a possession of the drug. He also ordered a review of its legal status. Meanwhile, the president's actions have given marijuana stocks in the US, or Jolt, they are rising in pre-market. China is showing its cloud on the world stage. The United Nations blocked the debate on China's human rights abuses in Jingjing. Just weeks after publishing a report on the matter, the US proposed draft resolution at the UN Human Rights Council was narrowly blocked. China has rejected allegations that it abuses Uyghurs and other Muslims. And it was Bank of America's last remaining legal hold out from the financial crisis.

12269," Bye. Today's CFOs are reshaping the C-suite, positioning companies to meet the next generation of challenges, breaking out of traditional roles to become chief future officer, like Maryoth's Lenealberg. One of the most important things is looking around the corner. Adrian Mitchell from Macy's. We have to let go of the traditional legacy department store. And Lucas Iramela at Mondelese. We tend to believe that all consumers are equal, they are not. Look for chief future officer on Bloomberg. We will never break. We will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never. We make it very transparent to the shopper before they accept an order. What the order is going to look like, how much work on a pays them and how much the consumer is paying them. And so they can decide whether they take an order or whether they refuse it. And that's the kind of flexibility that our shoppers really value and the kind of transparency that they want. Are you seeing a labor shortage right now and what are you doing to combat that? It's different in different places or demographic of shoppers is completely different from food delivery and right sharing, where 70% women and half of them are moms. And that's because a lot of the job at Instacart is very different than just being in a car with strangers. It's about like going to the store, doing a good job of customer service of really picking the right product for the consumer. And we are seeing that being very appealing to women. We have tools in place to address any financial stability concerns and we should not be looking to monetary policy for this purpose. The focus of monetary policy needs to be on one thing, fighting inflation. Chris, for Waller there, the Federal Reserve, Galvan, are pushing back hard, I'd say. The least against those that think this Fed is going to pause over financial stability concerns. How much do they read the analysts notes on Wall Street and go through a point by point and decide, okay, no, no. I mean, I keep going back to this. You think that's how that speech was put together? I mean, otherwise, what are they responding to? Is it other Fed officials that are saying what about financial stability concerns? Is it Andrew Bailey coming out and being like guys, you have to think about this. What happens if you're LDI, oh wait a second, you guys don't have the same kinds of schemes. Well, the bank of England started it, right? Yes, exactly. They started the conversation a bit away. Did you get the note from Steve Englander? I did. Transit treat disinflation yet again. And when I read that, I had to check the date to make sure that it was actually dated October 6th and not October 6th 12 months ago. All these dirty words now, disinflation, transitory, put together. Take your pick. Yeah. I think that the standard chart at Steve, that's a read it twice. Transit treat disinflation yet again, really? Well, what I meant was that, you know, you know, people who are fans of a strong dollar because they say it leads to disinflation. We've had strong dollars, episodes of very strong dollars before and unless you think it's going to last forever, the dollar comes back and you give it back. You give back to disinflation. So, you know, to me, it's not a particularly compelling argument. I mean, the backbone of inflation has been goods inflation through most of this period. That's what should have been affected by the dollar. It didn't have that much of an impact. And yet, what we're seeing is that the dollar is causing a lot of problems globally in emerging markets and elsewhere. So it was a case to be made that if you think that you're getting benefits from the strong dollar that this reverse currency war is kind of, you know, playing your way that you're probably fooling yourself. Okay. So basically, just to simplify this, strong dollar for longer? Well, it could be strong for longer. It doesn't mean it's desirable that it's strong for longer. I mean, it, you know, obviously depends, you know, on how risk appetite goes. Well, there's been very much propelled by...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,495,2022-10-07 11:53:04
12270," It's desirable that'd be strong for longer. I mean, it obviously depends on how risk appetite goes. Dollars have been very much propelled by risk aversion and it depends on rate differentials and how the US economy goes. And that's what we're waiting on at the, you know, for paroles this morning. We were talking about Chris Waller and really sort of shedding some cold water on this idea that financial stability concerns could cause the Federal Reserve to really back away from any of their rate-hiking plans and I think the strong dollar very much falls into that question, especially as people talk about financial stability concerns outside of the US. At what point, based on how much strengthening we've already seen versus major currencies, at what point, from your vantage point, does it really create something of a destabilizing effect on the rest of the world? Well, I think when you begin to see, you know, CDS below out, when you begin to see spreads widened and, you know, from the point of view of the Fed, when you, if you begin to see domestic financial institutions under pressure because there's some exposure or broad that, you know, they weren't aware of and the market wasn't aware of just beginning to come out. They think it does become material. You know, saying that you're never going to react to this is like, you know, telling your kid, you're never going to, you know, bail him out to feel, overspend this allowance. You know, there's a point at which you, you kind of throw in the towel. They don't want to do it clearly, but there is a point at which they will. Well, Steve, you've nailed it then. It's about signaling something. And there's a difference between what they want to signal and what they'll actually do. Steve, I want to talk about the signal that you would take from a Fed that starts delivering some kind of desanurating rate highs from 75 to 50 to 25. And they start to lay the groundwork for that. How you think the dollar responds to it? Well, I think the dollar would fall. And I think, you know, that would be a good thing. I think it would be sensible, even though our forecast is that they do 75 at the next meeting, I think it would be sensible to decelerate to 50 and kind of say, look, you know, 50 is a big chunk. If it turns out that that's not enough, we can add a hike in or two in 2023 to, you know, bring things where we want them to be. But there are enough signs that the economy is slowing down that I don't think you have to have your foot kind of jamming on the brakes at the stage to the same degree that we've had the last couple of meetings. Steve, within G10, how would you like to position for that? Is it against the Japanese? Yeah, what would you do? I think the two currencies that have a real chance of appreciating if there's a pivot, one is the yen because it's been super sensitive to rate differentials. And I think an improvement in risk appetite, everybody hates the commodity currencies. Now, Aussies really, really cheap. I think that there's some room there for it to, you know, under 65, there's rooms there for it to pick up on any kind of good news. So it's kind of a barbell view. Steve, just on the Aussies, is that a commodity story for you or the fact the RBA is back in a way? What matters more? I think it's a risk appetite story. Everybody is so down on where activity is going and where risk appetite is going. And it's playing out, you know, not particularly through the commodity side, but it's just the beta that Aussie has. How difficult is it to go along the end proactively in case there is some sort of shift from the Federal Reserve? Well, actually, I don't think it's that hard. You know, we put out a piece earlier this week arguing that the Japanese intervention had been reasonably successful, not a home run, but maybe a ground-rolled double or something. They spent 20 billion and, you know, for, you know, a week or two without doing anything, you can see material impact in terms of the way the yen was trading, even when other currencies were selling off. So I think that if, you know, they can successfully put an impose of ceiling, and if they were more aggressive and if they gave some hints that they were, you know, eventually going to back out of yield curve control, I think they'd be very successful in strengthening the yen. Steve, awesome to hear from you, sir. Steve Englander, I've standard-charted. Then we're all waiting to see what happens at a bank to Japan once Governor Corota steps aside, aren't we? There's a yield curve control go with him. There's a theory that that's what they're waiting for. He leaves. He's got what? 6 months, 5 months? Something like that. And that what he leaves, then they'll allow it to go away, but he's not going to let it go away under his watch because it's basically his flagship program. He did this. And so he's going to keep it in place. Just a bond market look like. We still wonder what the bond market looks like that morning if they step away from you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,496,2022-10-07 11:57:47
12271," because it's basically his flagship program. He did this, and so he's going to keep it in place. Just a bond market looks like. I still wonder what the bond market looks like that morning if they step away from yield curve control. It cannot be just ripping the banded off because the dislocations, at least based on valuations right now, would be so dramatic. When people talk about the yen, they say the bigger problem is in the Japanese bond market that is not a market. It does not trade. It does not have active bids and asks. It doesn't have people who are accustomed to finding market pricing. I would necessarily express that in the JGB market, but I'd be itching to do something somewhere else. It's sort of highly liquid government bond markets elsewhere that you'd expect yields to shift a whole lot higher off the back of that decision from Japan. What I suspect you're referring to is longer term US treasury yields and that is what a lot of people are saying and will happen. Actually, that is the bare case for longer term treasuries is if there is some removal of yield curve control in Japan, the ripple effects through the US markets will be significant. That was Steve Inlander of Standard Chartered. They're looking for 250k other banks are as well. Just a long list of sort of, they're all tightened packed up around 300k to 50, 200. Yeah, and you made the point. It's a good point. I honestly don't know what to make of it. Which is a reason why I've had nothing particularly intelligent say on it. But when you said, why is it that for so long? I'm just wondering. I have no clue. But you know, I've ran for ages. And then now it's a tight range and I really have no answer. But people are as far as I'm concerned. It doesn't matter in about 35 minutes you get the real deal. The job's numbers going to drop. The meat and estimate in our survey so far about 255k, the number's going to drop in about 34 minutes. And just the moment we'll catch up with Nadia Lovell of UBS looking forward to it from New York. This is Blaineback. Should we anticipate that you will have regulations clarifying what the SEC is going to do on crypto currencies and related kinds of things in the near future? It's pretty clear that many of these tokens may be securities. What we've asked the trading platforms, the lending platforms, the other various venues to come in, to work with us, to get registered under the securities laws. Because of a platform has 50 or some of them 500 tokens on their platform. Probabilities are not all non-securities. Now there's another issue that's written which is called gamification, which is to say people are making a game out of trying to buy stocks. Are you worried about this phenomenon? We live in the 2020s in a new digital age where applications on our phones can use massive amount of data and then predict our behavior. What do we do when the digital algorithms are maximizing for the companies, revenues, rather than our returns? And so we're trying to think that through. It's not just gamification, it's a little bit more than that. It's whether there's a conflict between the app and our investment returns.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,497,2022-10-07 12:01:24

Before you change the world, Bloomberg. The young person who now booking a career, would you recommend a Wall Street career today? There are not many jobs you can have as a young individual. With your always, always learning. What's driving inflation is low pay, low wage, low skill jobs. They want to see some moderation in the labor market, as well as some better inflation numbers. We have to look at where the situation is fragile, where the higher for longer story could potentially break things. I certainly think we can live with interest rates being much higher. If we have some positive surprises, the market is looking for good news. I think it will be out. This is Bloomberg's surveillance with Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow, and Lisa Abramowitz. Payrolls 30 minutes away, live from New York City this morning from our audience worldwide. Good morning, good morning. This is Bloomberg's surveillance on TV and radio. Alongside Lisa Abramowitz, Jonathan Farrow, counting her down to payrolls Friday, 30 minutes away. Bramow futures totally unchanged. So exciting. Everyone's really excited for this data point. It's going to be the most important data point. It's so caustic. Next week. It's going to be important to see how the labor market is progressing. But I think that right now to understand that this is going to have any determining effect on the Fed's path or the narrative around it is a bit of a stretch. So then where does the marginal trading come from? How do we interpret whether this is closer to a soft landing or whether this is closer to the Fed going harder with respect to read high. So let's take a bank that's had some big calls for big hikes this year. City, the team led by Andrew Hollenhorst, they just published a downside to price the pay rolls. That would be 100 K all below for him and the team following the 1.1 million plunge in job openings with service.

This speaks to a Bruce Kasman over at JP Morgan was saying that several months of 100,000 or 100,000 jobs being created consecutively would cause some sort of pause, some sort of reassessment by the Federal Reserve. Will they signal that though because they need the markets to remain tight? I mean, really this is an honest question because they've been coming out and they really have been basically watching the markets and saying, guys, stop with the hope. Just quit it. If they start to signal that we're going to go from 75 to 50 to 25, you've got a decent idea of how people think this market responds to that. And then we also know at the same time this Fed wants to keep financial conditions tight, tight, tight. It's kind of bizarre, isn't it? But all these Fed speakers are out there basically doing something that Cash Gary talked about a few weeks ago. No one's touched since they're trying to cap financial conditions and make sure that the market doesn't run away. They are very concerned about inflation. They want all the help that they can get. And what we're grappling with right now is that monetary policy does not have that many levers to play to push and pull. So the one that they have is making sure that markets appropriately tighten that it is difficult for you to be able to raise money at the same kind of pace. And so they're going to go with that at the same time that people are wondering whether the labor market is not perhaps the appropriate place to be looking for what's to come. And you said it when we get to the CPI report next week, we'll even be talking about the data point that drops in 27 minutes time. I'm going to go ahead and say that that will depend on whether it's coherent with the narrative that the CPI print highlights. So here then yes it will still matter if it's.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,498,2022-10-07 12:07:02
12273," I'm going to go ahead and say that that will depend on whether it's coherent with the narrative that the CPI print highlights. If it is coherent, then yes, it will still matter. If it's not, the CPI will take precedence. Okay. Well done. Nice to be framed. Future's unchanged on ESMP. The jobs report 27 minutes away. Our after that, the opening bell market set up as follows. Yields going nowhere on a 10 year, 383, 27. Eurodollar not doing much. Either 97, 93 unchanged there. So you've got unchanged futures, unchanged Eurodollar, unchanged 10 year. The thing that does change is crude this week. Crude has been absolutely flying over the last week, both the commodity and the energy names on the S&P 500. The commodity through Thursday by around about 12%. The energy names on the S&P Lisa, Bramow, a 15% move in four days. And this is because of OPEC+. Coming out saying that they're going to cut production by two million barrels, although the actual cut won't actually be that much because they haven't hit their production targets. This really raises an issue though. Of first of all spare capacity and how much higher, longer term oil prices could really go. And I know you were speaking with Francisco Blancher about this over a bank of America. And this really feeds the narrative. It's going to be a tough winter. Yes, some concerns about how we're using the SPR. He does. How it's been politicized in the risk that we could perhaps come across next year. If we have a real crisis in the crude market, he was keen to point out we haven't had one yet. And so if you end up with some of the lowest levels in the strategic petroleum reserve, still they're going back to early 1980s. What kind of ability do you have to really offset some of those prices? And people raised the issue of going into the winter. Some of the diesel prices have actually increased quite dramatically. So how do they offset that at a time when that's going to be a bigger concern? Operation midterms. We've talked about it how many times have the last week operation midterms? Is this the final job report before the next midterms? Before the midterms election or we get one more? No, I just wonder about a wonder about the timeline going into the midterms. And whether this administration can get there, the Democrats can get there before we start to see the cracks in the labor market. I'm pretty sure that we have one more, but it comes after the Fed meeting, right? It comes at the same time between sandwiched in between. So some really interesting moments that I wonder what that Fed meeting is going to be like. Canada's fascinating over the next month. It really is. Johnius Namplister says, Nadia Lovell, senior U.S. equity strategist at UBS Global Wath Management. Nadia, wonderful to catch up with you this morning. Those decelerating rate hikes from 75 to 50 to 25 that everyone's hoping praying for. If the bullish that is, is that sufficient to add to equities here? I think so, but we do expect the market to remain volatile. You know, these rallies that we're seeing, we continue to expect them to fade. I mean, the Fed remains determined to bring down inflation and they have been clear to us that they will not blink nor even wink. And so even at the expense of growth. So it all depends on what the damage is to the economy at the end of the day. But we remain cautious in this environment. And we're more focused on the areas of the markets where we think that earnings are likely to be more durable in the face in any sort of economic slowdown. So areas like healthcare as well as consumer staples. And John, just quickly, November 4th is the next visit. What's the point for what a week is right? And it raises some issues about how quickly this market is moving. And Nadia, I would love for you to weigh in on that. I mean, do you have a sense that the circumstances are moving faster than the lagging indicators of a previous month's jobs report can really give us at a time of such change? Yes, you know, the Fed has been aggressive and so it hasn't had time to really stop and see like what's happening in the economy. We are seen signs of practices slowdowns. And you know, this earlier this week, we saw a decline in the number of job openings were seeing slowdowns in areas like semis were seeing more people announced hiring freezes. We're also seeing some cracks in the housing market. I mean, look where the mortgage market is. And so by the time we get to the end of the year, though, we think that that's when the Fed is going to stop and pause and sort of look around and assess this situation. We're all looking for 75 basis points, hiking in November meeting, but we admit that, you know, the fact is that dots were really close in the last September dots between 125 basis points and 100 points by the end of the year. But we think that we get to two and a quarter, excuse me, for the quarter to 4.5% by the end of the year. And then after that, we think the federal main on hold to sort of assess the lag that monetary policy tends to have on the economy. Nadia, just moments ago, John was talking about some of the price action really fascinating price action. It's not today. It's pretty pretty dull in all.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,499,2022-10-07 12:10:45
12274," I started policy tends to have on the economy. Nadia, just moments ago, John was talking about some of the price action, really fascinating price action. It's not today. It's pretty dull in a lot of the asset classes, but not in oil, not in crude. And we have seen that this week, this real incredible rally on the heels of what happened with OPEC Plus. How has the recent sort of machinations and political backdrop affected your view on the energy sector at a time when, at one point, people were saying it's overbid heading into a downturn? I would tell you, Lisa, we have been positive on energy for almost two years now. We remain positive. I mean, the rallying energy has resumed. And it's really one of the few sectors that's sort of been this uptrend and where we aren't really concerned about the earnings outlook. I would really continue to believe that oil prices, Brent, is going to move above $110, around $110 by year and remain that way above that level into 2023. And obviously, the continued uppour pressure on oil will come from likely end of the SPR. We also will see the Steve Warren ban on Russian oil later this year. And then also, there's going to be the switching dynamic happening, increasing demand away from natural gas, given the uppour pressure, and there in substitution for oil. So profits remain very healthy in this sector. And so we continue to remain very positive on the energy set and see opportunities. And we redefining how we play defense in a downturn. Yes, I mean, it's sort of like traditionally, you would, you would lean into all of the defensive sector. We have two of those defensive sector as I noted, health care and consumer safety. But energy usually has been a more cyclical sector. But we think that there's opportunities there because we're less concerned about the demand picture on that, even than a downturn because the supply market remain so tight. So you sort of perhaps have a balance in this, in this sort of new environment, you can't all be traditional defensive sectors. What about the banks? How do they fit into that thing? The banks, we've been neutral on financial just given the macro uncertainty and market volatility and capital markets. But yes, we had it to the earnings season of banks, you saw that next year, the banks might actually have a decent setup. They should be able to benefit from net interest income side, given just the fact that we've had this increase in interest rates and also pick up in long growth, particularly on the commercial and industrial and consumer side. But that might be able to offset some of the pressures on the fee side. But like I said, we've been neutral on banks. While carbon banks remain provision for low loss and there might be some need for them to build a preserve, depending on each individual banks views on the economics sold out and the potential to dip into recession. So near term, banks are okay set up, but as we head into 2023, there's some uncertainty. Nadia, thank you. As always, Nadia, love of the UBS Global, we're going to go into the jobs report 20 minutes away, redefining defense in the equity market, talking about energy going into recession, crude briefly on WTI, $90 a barrel. Other people agree with her and you're starting to see that. And when we talked about earnings, people back out energy companies because they're leading the charge. I want to pick up on our point about banks and building some reserves. There was a report out just theoretically about banks that may have committed theoretical report. They may have committed to financing. Elon Musk's bid for Twitter and how much they would stand to lose and some estimates have it be $500 million based on where they price things out in April and where things are certainly currently trading. If they sell all of the debt that they promised to finance. When's JP Morgan? Next Friday. Look forward to that. Morgan's down to two. How do we have another bank? I don't think you can. I think we've got to discuss it. Haven't we? We'll do that next week. The government was on with me yesterday and was talking about perhaps the defense you could play or rather a couple of days ago. The defense you could play in the European banks. There'd be more defensive than perhaps some people think. Did you see the story from the ECB this morning? The European Central Bank ratched and got pressure on some banks to keep 22 bonuses in check and midfares about the darkening economic outlook. That's the ECB and what they think of banks going to a doubt. Well, Credit Suisse is buying back some bonds. So maybe they're trying to put a high balance sheet ahead of, you know, whatever's going to happen. Affessing a thing. 18 minutes away from payrolls. Randy Krozener is going to join us.

Coming up in just a few minutes, we'll get a look at the monthly US jobs report. Now, it's forecast to show that employers added 255,000 jobs in September. That would be the smallest number since the decline in late 2020. Now, still, it would be an indication that the labor market remains strong and that could have an impact on what the Fed does next. The Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to human rights activists from Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus. They were cited for documenting war crimes, human rights abuses, and abuse of power. At the same time, the chair of the Nobel Committee criticized Vladimir Putin and the government to Belarus for suppressing activists. President Biden has taken his first major steps toward decriminalizing marijuana. The president pardoned thousands of Americans, convicted a possession of the drug. Now, he also ordered a review of its legal status. Meanwhile, the president's actions have given marijuana stocks in the US, a jolt. They're rising in pre-market. Tesla's all-electric truck will roll out before the end of the year. In a tweet, Elon Musk said production had begun and the first deliveries will head to PepsiCo December 1.

I don't know if I'm asking you to choose amongst your children, but some of the most recognizable buildings by you, of course, the Millennium Bridge, London City Hall, the Reichstag and the Great Court British Museum. What was your favorite project to do? The Reichstag does stand out because, first of all, it's an energy manifesto. So it transforms something that was dependent on fossil fuels. It uses all the technology to produce something which is essentially carbon neutral and there's a public building, that's a statement. It's a symbol of a city. It's a symbol of a nation. It incorporates works of art. It's recycling and existing building, which, as I mentioned earlier, is the ultimate in sustainability if you can give a new life to a building. It also creates public space at the roof level. It's the most visited parliament in the world, so it puts the public above the politicians who are answerable to them. And that, of course, was made possible by the politicians. So it's a demonstration of democracy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,501,2022-10-07 12:18:39

With inflation running well above our 2% goal, restoring price stability likely will require ongoing rate hikes and then keeping policy restrictive for some time until we are confident that inflation is firmly on the path toward our 2% goal. Lisa Cook, the Federal Reserve Governor at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, her first address as Fed Governor. Very cool. Congratulations to her. Life from New York City this morning. Good morning to you all. County are down to pay rolls. The number, the data 12 minutes away. Equity shaping up as follows. Not doing much at all in the equity market. We're up about a tenth of 1% on the S&P. Yeal to high by almost the basis point at $383. Euro dollar going absolutely nowhere. At 97. 92. Unchanged, unchanged, unchanged Lisa. Go on into this one. Except for one figure. Crude. Yes. And we're seeing that increase pretty substantially at 1.6% following a week of gains that really has been extraordinary, especially given the downturn that people are talking about. Not only now, but over the next six months with what the Fed is going to do. We're going to get things set for you. Mike McKee is going to enter the building any moment now. He's going to sit around this table. Randy Croson is going to help us break down this number to he joined just the economics professor at the University of Chicago and former Fed Governor. Many great to catch up with you, sir. The number about 1112 minutes away. Walk us through what you'll look for. First of all. The key thing is want to see if the labor market is beginning to weaken. I mean, as I've said from University of Chicago, I'll invoke Bill DeFeedman's famous phrase from 60 years ago that monetary policy has impact with long and variable lags. And that's just as true today as it was then that monetary policy typically think of as having an impact in six to 18 months. And it's about six months now since the Fed started tightening cycles. So I think we're going to start to see some weakening the labor market. Randy, given the fact that you were once a Fed governor not so long ago, can you translate for us what we can understand from Chris Waller's discussion of basically point by point, taking apart all of the bullish equity strategists out there, every argument that they have and saying, nope, we're not going to stop our hiking because of that, not because of this, not because of financial stability, not because of a slowdown in other non-employment figures. Yeah, what happened was that after the the late July meeting, I thought, Jay Powell is very clear. I thought everyone was very clear about what they were going to do, but the market just wouldn't accept it. So everyone started coming out saying, we're going to do it. We're going to keep at it. And then Jay at the Jackson Hole ripped up the speech and said, I'm going to say one thing eight times, which is we're going to keep at it. And I think what's now happened is the Fed has kind of entrenched themselves and kind of like no matter what happens, we're going to do it, which I think is the right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,502,2022-10-07 12:24:26
12277," What's now happened is the fed is kind of entrenched themselves and kind of like no matter what happens, we're going to do it. Which I think is the right, broadly the right message to be sending, but they should still be thinking with a little bit more nuance about what the data will say, etc, etc. But I think they've kind of gotten themselves, painted themselves into a corner, which probably is a good corner to be in because they really do have to execute on this. But I think they got there in a way because the market just wouldn't believe what they were saying earlier on. Okay, but you still have people who are kind of questioning it right here. I mean, you just heard Steve at England or on this show basically saying it's like a parent saying if you spend all of your allowance money, I'm not going to give you any money for lunch and then they run on that they're allowance money. And you say, okay, just kidding. I'll give you some, but don't ever do it again. And basically the market is saying that that's what the Fed is doing as well. I mean, are you saying the same thing, but it's important for them to stick with this message. Well, actually, I think they are, it's not only the message, but I think maybe they really are saying, okay, we're not actually going to be as nuanced about the data because you don't hear them saying we're going to be data dependent. You hear them saying we're going to keep at it until inflation is down. So that's a different way of approaching it. And so I think they're going to be pretty pretty brutal going forward. I think they're going to get to low for relatively soon. And then I think they're going to stick there and they want to make people clear that they're going to stick there. Now, of course, you know, Mr Putin could do some things that that up and everything, but I think they're pretty strongly committed to this. And they're not going to keep hiking until they get down to 2%. They've basically told us that they've told us that they're waiting to see a convincing string of evidence that we're heading in that direction. Where do you think inflation needs to be on headline to come to that conclusion? I think it's not just exactly where it needs to be on headline. So they prefer they focus on the personal consumption expenditure index, the PC rather than the CPI. That's running at a much lower level than the CPI is since that's born. So the 5 to 5, 6 or so range. It needs to be coming down so they need to 1 to give the direction. And then to see that I would say probably they wouldn't start moving down until certainly it's under 4, perhaps even under 3. So that's a problem. Randy, you're going to stick with that. Sure. What's that? Sorry, Randy? That CPI's PCE is lower. Yeah, no, so are you saying we'd have to be at 4 PCE or 4 CPI? Because I was talking about headline right now is at 8. Oh, no, well, they focus on PCE. No, I get that. That's their. Yeah, I mean, the relationship between CPI and PCE sometimes they're closely related, sometimes they're not so closely related. CPI is going to be above that. I'm not quite sure, but they're not focused on CPI. So I don't really have a view on that. They changed their mind every month on that, Randy. Is you well know? One minute. It's cool. It's you mentioned. I think that's a little unfair. I think they've been focusing on PCE for a while. They do talk about all of the other pieces because of course that affects people's cost of living. And so it has has an important impact. But I think for their their crime decision making, it's going to be PCE and headline, but primarily core because core really tells you gives you more information about where things are going. It's always best to make policy in the front view mirror rather than the rear view mirror running frozen. They're going to stick with us. Go and insipi rose, which is about six minutes away. Way more diplomatic than either of us. Which is the reason why he was on the Federal Reserve Governor Board. And either of us are not the only reason, but my point. I think is that you know he is though making an interesting point, which is originally it was about sentiment, which is a reason why we cared about the University of Michigan sentiment survey so much. And the idea of inflation expectations becoming unmoored as inflation goes down. Do they. Sorry to use this word pivot. I like it felt myself kind of hesitating back to the PCE the core PCE kind of metric to determine when to really take the pedal off the break. I like to give my the final word. Gunnets pay rose the print about five minutes away might's going to break it down might your number one thing you're looking for. But job growth because the Fed is looking for sort of a sequential slowdown.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,503,2022-10-07 12:27:50
12278," Rose, the print about five minutes away, might's gonna break it down. Mike, your number one thing you're looking for? Job growth, because the Fed is looking for sort of a sequential slowdown. We could look at the unemployment rate and the participation rate, but the Fed's kind of gotten to the point where they don't think the participation rate's gonna go up a whole lot more. So let's look at the headline number. But one thing Mary Daly said the other day, what did she say? We are data dependent and data is a plural word. So they're not just looking at PCE, they're looking at every other inflation measure and they're looking at their labor measures and you miss, they want to, what was the word totality? The totality of the data. Yeah, yeah, okay, that's helpful. Mike, looking forward to you breaking down the numbers. Jeff Rosen, vocal black cross, gonna be with us to Randy Kroes and the bank with us as well to break down that number in about four and a half minutes time. Going into it, here's how the stage is set for you. The equity market doing not much at all, all morning on stocks, on bonds, at foreign exchange as well. We're looking for 255,000, the previous number, 315, unemployment, the meat and estimate, 3.7% in line with the previous month as well. Wages and focus on their participation rate as well. Futures up by about a tenth of 1%, the jobs number up next. Okay, we're gonna start the stage. The lot's happening on Wall Street. Aiding J-Powell said things that were indefensible.

What should somebody do to get into the talent agency business or the business you're in? Well, it's hopefully what I've taught my kids. You've got to be intellectually curious. You've got to be...

12279," Today's CFOs are reshaping the C-suite, positioning companies to meet the next generation of challenges, breaking out of traditional roles to become Chief Future Officer, like Maryott's Lineal Berg. One of the most important things is looking around the corner. Adrian Mitchell from Macy's. We have to let go of the traditional legacy department store. And Lucas Eramella at Mondalees. We tend to believe that all consumers are equal, they are not. Look for Chief Future Officer on Bloomberg. 10 seconds away from the payrolls report in the United States of America. Might Macy around the table ready to break that down for your futures. Toe to the unchanged on the S&P 500. A little bit firmer now up 3 or 4 tenths of 1% with the number. Here's might Macy. Well, we come in almost bang on, John. If you're looking for 263,000, you've won. The Fed might be looking for a number about that level. That's the change in non-farm payrolls from the month before. Private payrolls up by 288,000. The forecast was for 255 on the headline 275 on private. So we come in very close to what the consensus was. The unemployment rate drops to 3.5%. I guess there is that we had fewer people who were looking for work. We'll take a look at that in just a second. Average hourly earnings up 3 tenths on the month. And that pushes the year over year number down to 5%, which was what was expected. The labor force participation rate drops a tick to 62.3. So that's probably why we're seeing the unemployment rate do what it did. The change in private payrolls last month was revised down from 308 to 275. So it looks like we're getting some little bit weaker numbers. This is the kind of drop a sequential fall that the Fed would be looking for to suggest that their medicine is kind of working, starting to at least. I've got caught out too many times coming up with nice little narratives around the payrolls report and the market action mic. And then I've got whipsawed by the price action several hours later. But I can give you the knee jerk reaction right now. Futures down by 3.4% on ESMP. Positive by about a third of 1% going into the print coming out of it. We are negative. Year to higher of the front end by 7 or 8 basis points on a 2 year to 4. 33 on a 10 year up by 5 basis points to 387. Mike, if wonder if we're picking up on the upside surprise on the pay rolls report, just initially anyway, and that downside surprise and unemployment and participation coming down to. Put it all together for us. The downside surprise and unemployment in my mind is what's doing it because the number, the number in exceeding the forecast isn't that great. It's 13,000 higher. We saw 11,000 higher for July revised up, but August isn't changed at 315. So they were market strength is about what it was getting a little bit weaker. But then it becomes a question of who's getting the jobs and how many people are in and out of work. And I'm just looking here at the employment and unemployment numbers. The labor force falls by 57,000. Remember it rose by 768,000 the month before. So that's going to account for why we're seeing the unemployment rate drop. The number of employed rises by 80,000 and the number of unemployed. Rises by 204,000 number of unemployed falls by 251. In some ways on the margins, not an extraordinary move one way or another, but on the margins, this is exactly what the Fed does not want to say. Because what you're seeing is a shift away from the perfect landing of seeing more people coming into the labor force and creating a bit more slack to potentially loosen some of the price pressures that you're seeing. How would you interpret this using the other data points as Mayor and Mary daily point it because it's a multitude of points in terms of how much further they are away from their goal? It's hard to say that they're necessarily far away from their goal because we didn't see the Joltz numbers come down and the number of job openings are falling. And Mary daily, the San Francisco Fed president was in here the other day and she was suggesting that",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,505,2022-10-07 12:36:26
12280," from their goal because we did see the Joltz numbers come down and the number of job openings are falling. And Mary Daley, the San Francisco Fed president, was in here the other day. And she was suggesting that the unemployment rate would trail other indicators because there are a lot of jobs available, even if they have come down. And so the number of people who lose jobs would fall as people could take jobs that were out there. So it may not be as bad as it looks. There are some Steve Stanley at Amherst Peerpont who thinks we'll get to 3.4% by the end of the year because of that. We're going to see a tighter labor market in the unemployment side, the household side. But we are seeing a drop in wages and we're seeing a drop in the number of people who are getting jobs. So overall a reasonable number for the Fed. Should we do the totality of the data? So to speak this week. You have 75 now, don't you? Yeah. Well, 75 is the bar. And it's going to be hard to bring that bar down for the Fed. And this number would tell you that 75 is what you want to do because the labor market is still strong enough. I don't think CPI is going to fall enough that we get down to 50. And I think you're going to stay at 75 at this point because that makes sense. We often describe payrolls, guesses, leaser as throwing a dartboard with a blindfold on. City won that game this week. I think they went with 265. We ended up with 263. So congrats Andrew Hollenhorst to the team. Congrats to Andrew Hollenhorst, but really everyone deserves a congratulations because it was so. I'm not going to go there. But the participation drove it. Exactly. We're just patient rates going down. We got to get more people involved. But honestly, there is this feeling that the range was really tight. People got this correct in terms of where we were in terms of the labor market, which is a surprise because it's been a different. If we can get some medal, just down a half of 1% on ESPN. That's a joke. A joke. That's what messages start. It's just a joke. This is for humour. Mike McKee. Thank you. Ranny Crowe's the joins us now. Economics professor at the University of Chicago at Booth School, former Fed governor. Ranny would love your reaction to this. Future's down just a little bit. We're off 4.10% of 1%. Your thoughts on this report? I think exactly as you were describing, it's going to keep the Fed on track for 75 basis point move at the next meeting. It's broadly within the parameters of what they were expecting. As you said, if they were hoping that they'd still see a little bit more uptick in labor force participation, but they didn't get that. They do. I think they are expecting the unemployment rate. We'll start to move up a bit. Something that will be heartening is that we didn't see an acceleration in wage growth. That isn't taking off. That would be the most problematic thing for them because I would suggest inflation expectations or inflation really becoming quite entrenched. I think that's the other key thing to be looking at going forward. Where is wage growth going? So far, that at 5%. Obviously, that's much higher than it has been, but certainly lower than pretty much any measure of headline inflation. Randy, I want to stick on participation rate for just a minute. We haven't gotten back to the pre-pandemic levels. A lot of people were hoping for a soft landing or you have more people come into the labor market who were sort of sitting out during the pandemic in the direct aftermath. How does this rejigger the expectations of the Federal Reserve, of this labor market and how much it's been transformed post-pandemic? Well, I don't think this one report is really changing that, but I think they're gradually coming to realize that a lot of people are just not coming back in. For example, older workers, labor force participation had been quite high before the pandemic, and now it's significantly lower. People, older workers, a lot of people that they knew didn't make it through COVID. They want to be able to spend time with their families. I think they're much less likely to come back in. That's a challenge for the labor market because those are the most skilled workers. This is one of the challenges that we're seeing now. This skill mismatch that there are a lot of openings, but there aren't people who have the right skills for those jobs. Randy, I just have to point out this tweet from Ivan the K on Twitter. Reminder, be sure to fit today's labor market report into your narrative, even if you need to use shoehorn. How does the narrative change? What should...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,506,2022-10-07 12:40:59
12281," into your narrative even if you need to use shoehorn. How does the narrative change? Or what should the narrative be heading into year end as we look at the multitude, the totality of data and try to understand where we are in this economic cycle? Well, I mean, we're fortunate that we still have a very strong labor market and so people have a lot of job opportunities despite the Fed having moved, interested to rates up so much and so quickly. But as I had said before, monetary policy has impact with long and variable lags. So typically it starts having impact about six months or so and we're getting to that point. So I do think that we're going to start to see the labor market weaken through the rest of the year. But the Fed's going to keep at it. There's nothing in this report that is going to suggest to them that they need to pull back. They're going to continue full bore towards four plus by the end of the year. And then somewhere in the mid fours or so, they'll or close to five, they will stop. But that will then depend on the data and how things are evolving next year. And also the uncertainties of what Mr. Putin might do. I'm Randy. We appreciate your time today, sir. As always, looking forward to next month's conversation. Randy Krozeno there at the University of Chicago. He just down off the back of this by six or seven tenths of 1% yielded up at the front end of the curve. That's the response to the number we got just moments ago. Rup six basis points on a two year to 431. Call it 432 on a 10 year yields up by five to three. ATA coming up in the next hour, catching up with Rick Reed, Rob Blackrock, and a Stasia Amaro, Survive Capital Network. P. Jim's Mike Collins and at 940, the reaction from the White House. Lisa, looking forward to catching up with Secretary Woffsch in the next hour. Something for everyone in this jobs report, right? I just I really enjoy that that Twitter post where basically people are saying you can find anything you want. Take your narrative. You're wearing a stick in there. That's basically what's been happening. However, one thing that is quite clear, this labor market is still pretty resilient. You are seeing that resilience in the economy, which is the reason why some people are arguing that the soft landing scenario looks further and further away simply because they're going to have to do more to stop this ship. If you ask people in America right now, what are they more concerned about? Losing their job or high inflation? I wonder if the same answer that they would give you is the same answer you'd get from the Federal Reserve right now. I suspect it might be. And for that reason, this Fed has probably got more work to do, right? I think that that's basically what Mary Dayley was saying. And that was what she told Mike. Exactly what she was saying. And it comes at a time when people are seeing a punitive level of inflation that's hurting the lower income brackets. I'm going to run Lisa. Have a great fun. It was a great fun. You too have a great one. We can post pandemic start on the Thursday afternoon. She knows this, right? And I guess on payrolls Friday, they started about 840, but stick around for a bit like Romeo's little bit lighter to make it laugh. Not that you're bitter or anything. No, sure. Thank you for that. And honestly, I'm really looking forward to hear what Marty Walsh has had to say, Mike, we keep before we get on to our next guest. I'd love your take. You've been parsing through the data. What have you discovered in terms of some of the nuances underneath? Well, we looked at what happened with the unemployment rate. But the interesting thing about employment is that we did see a seasonal effect. It looks like in education, state and local education lost 21,000 jobs, which is going to be seasonal. Because in September, everybody comes in. So they didn't hire quite as many people as they thought the seasonals pushed that down. And so we probably would have had a little bit bigger number. But we did have a big gain in August. And maybe some of the school districts have moved their business to August, moved the start of school year to August. So we're seeing some numbers come in there. And then retail sales, retailers, gained only 1,000 jobs. Even though service-producing jobs were up 264,000, most of it comes in temporary help and business services. So maybe companies are doing the opposite of what they do when the economy is getting better and they hire people temporarily until they know they really need them. Maybe now they're beginning to think, well, maybe we don't need as many people, but we still have business to do, so we'll use some temps. And the retailers have been in a tough spot. Levi Strauss actually just reporting some negative earnings in those shares, Plunging, which is a story we've seen. And how much do we start to see the negative earnings revisions on the heels of some of this weakness and expectation of that?

12282," this week this and expectation of that. Jeff Rosenberg joins us now following the labor market report that we got pretty much bang on for the expectations. BlackRock portfolio manager of the systemic multi-strategy fund, Jeff, your take on this particular jobs report. Yeah, Lisa, I think you hit it on the head earlier in your reaction to the unemployment rate and the labor force participation rate. I think that's why you're seeing, you know, a little bit of negative reaction in the front end of bond curves, a little bit of negative reaction in interest rate, sorry, in equity futures. You know, I think this is a slight disappointment relative to hopes that, you know, this report would give a piece of evidence in favor of the camp that there's a slowdown and a pivot underway. And I think that's going to be disappointed in this report. It's one report. It's probably not even the most important report. Next week, we'll get the most important report, which is the CPI report. But I think in total, that's really the numbers that sort of stand out to me is the failure to see an increase in the participation rate. And that's really about the forward looking view on wage pressures. So yes, the wage pressures didn't go up, but they're still exceedingly high. And while they stay high, that is the source of the other camps view, which is that we're in a wage price spiral. So I think it's a little bit disappointing to the, to the dovish camp, a little bit reinforcing to the hawkish camp, minor on both sides of the, of the argument, but, but definitely tilting that way. And that's why you're getting the market reaction you are today. So we get a lot of fun managers on the show and they always say, we're not trading every day. We're not an algo. And they say, you know, we have a certain approach and we kind of move along. How has your approach shifted as you get the multitude of data that we're getting? And how much are you looking to change it heading into your end? Well, so it's a great question, Lisa. And the issue is, is the degree of uncertainty here with regards to the inflation outlook. And it's, it's very hard to forecast. So we have a little saying, if you, if you don't have a good forecast, then observe. It's sort of what the Fed is saying in terms of being data dependent. They don't know what the trajectory of inflation is going to be. And so they're going to observe. So it's very hard to kind of trade every little change and turn in the data. We take a step back and we look at the overall trend. And as I just highlighted, this is one piece of information that's a little bit in the camp of the hawkish camp that the Fed needs to do more. But no one really knows where inflation is going to go. And we have expectations, however, in the bond market and the consensus view of a relatively benign amount of impact to the economy for a dramatic increase, or sorry, dramatic decrease in the amount of inflation. And I think the, the, the weight of the proof of that being the correct view is on that side of the argument. And so I think it's, it's highly uncertain. And today is a little bit on the hawker side. We can't trade every little data point, you say. But yesterday we saw jobless claims up just a little bit, still very, very low. And markets turned around. When do they going to get the message that the Fed is sending? And just kind of sit back and let the economy go because the Fed isn't going to change its mind? Well, you know, the Fed is sending mixed messages, right? If you look at the distribution of the out years, SAP, median Fed funds expectations, they're all over the map. And they represent basically the, it's time to slow and we want to avoid the over tightening camp to the, we need to get inflation down. And that's job number one. On top of that is a very strong history of central bank, central banks reacting to financial stability concerns. Right now, with a strong labor market, this is the relatively easy part of the Fed's tightening cycle. And I think they're trying to get as much as they can under their belt while labor markets are strong. When you start to see significant financial stability concerns and when you start to see the slow down that they're holding.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,508,2022-10-07 12:49:33
12283," much as they can under their belt while labor markets are strong. When you start to see significant financial stability concerns and when you start to see the slowdown that they're hoping for and anticipating in the economy and in the labor market, the job is going to get that much difficult, more difficult, both for the Fed as well as for us and financial market participants. Jeff, how comfortable are you right now with market pricing that we're going to get rate cuts as soon as late next year? Well, that was really what I was kind of referring to is that we've got the rate cards priced into the market. We've got a slow but steady decline in inflation forecast and consensus forecast, back down to 2 percent, back down to the pre-COVID environment, without a tremendous amount of tightening required. And I think that that remains a challenged view as we see how the data develops. Today's a little bit in favor of that view. We haven't seen the significant tightening yet. Yes, monetary policy operates with a lag. So we're waiting on those lags. But the real disappointment and the real issue for markets will come next week because we haven't seen the slowdown in core CPI. And that's the bigger concern and it weighs into the argument that some errors in the case of firmament are making that the market is off, the Fed is off with respect to their forecast of how much tightening is required and that there's going to require a lot more tightening before we see the decline in inflation that is in market expectations. So I think those declines in the second half of next year, that very much remains to be seen. We're a little bit cautious on adopting that view right now. Jeff Rosenberg, portfolio manager of the systematic multi-strategy fund at BlackRock. Thank you so much. And Mike, I'm really struck by this, this discussion of the fact that we're going to have to get to a much higher terminal rate in order to slow inflation. And all right, this labor market report pretty much in line with what we were expecting doesn't matter anymore. Now it's CPI. It is CPI and it's always been CPI inflation put it that way because the Fed does, as you were discussing earlier, follow the PCE numbers. But CPI is the proxy and CPI gives us the biggest breakdown of where inflation is. So next week's number is going to be very important. In a sense, the Fed has said 75. So unless inflation absolutely collapsed, they're going to do 75 won't change their mind there. But what they would like to see is some progress in bringing down some of these prices. And we were speaking with Anna Wong of Bloomberg Intelligence earlier and she was talking about how she could see a 5% Fed funds rate that that's ultimately where they're going to get to. How divergent is that from the rest of Wall Street? It's not as well. From Wall Street, it's higher than Wall Street wants it to be. So it's higher than most of the forecast. It's not that divergent from where the Fed is because most of them have marked up their numbers. They're between four and a half and five. So if inflation proves sticky, you'll see those numbers go a little bit higher, maybe over five. Given where we are now, they think that if you get to between four and four and a half and five, that's going to be enough to put the breaks on inflation and the economy. But we won't know for some time. As we look right now, we're looking at a two-year yield of 4.32 percent. Touching earlier, the highest levels going back to 2007, just off some of the initial highs. But nonetheless, a knee jerk reaction that this will give the Fed more rope to continue to hike rates aggressively into year end and potentially beyond. Ira Jersey, Chief U.S. Interest, Strategist for Bloomberg Intelligence joining us right now. Ira, your take on this Labor Market report. Yeah, so I think I agree with some of the former gas, basically saying that you can find anything if you're hawkish or dovish in this report. I think generally speaking, it was middle of the road enough that it will keep the Federal Reserve on the hiking trend. I agree with Mike McKee that the Fed is likely to go 75 basis points in November. There's nothing in this report that should change that outlook. I think it was something that's interesting that we've seen just in the market, post the initial knee jerk reaction, was that the yield curve is actually steepened a little bit. We were flatter going into the number. The two's tens curve was a couple of basis points flatter. Now we're about a basis point steeper on the day. That might reflect just some of the forward uncertainty that some of the incoming data certainly were.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,509,2022-10-07 12:53:55
12284," Now we're about a basis point steeper on the day. And that might reflect just some of the forward uncertainty that some of the incoming data certainly represents. And when we look at the Fed funds futures about the terminal rate pricing, we are starting to price finally for the Fed to stay at its terminal rate a little bit above 4.5% for most of 2023 now. So before we were talking about early cuts, now the market's only pricing may be one cut in 2023. So I think that that's a significant change since over the last couple of weeks since the last Fed meeting. All right, I'd love your take on what Jeff Rosenberg was just talking about that perhaps some of this data is really highlighting the point that was put out by Larry Summers and a number of others where they're talking about the Fed funds rate needing to be much higher than people previously expected because of the stickiness of inflation. And perhaps we'll get that with CPI. Certainly with the labor market, it is holding in much more than people thought. Are you sympathetic to that view that the terminal rate is something closer to that 5% level of your colleague, Anna Wong? Yeah, so we've been above at 4.5% or a little bit higher than that since May. So we're now pricing for our forecast. I think the Federal Reserve can hike to around somewhere in that 4.5 to 5% range call it 4.3 quarters on the upper band, which is exactly what the market's pricing right now, but by the way, and then hold it there for a while, right? Because the Fed at some point is going to say, look, the long and variable legs point of view where once we get to that level, we can hold it there for a long time. Now from a market dynamics standpoint, if that's what happens and the market starts to expect the Fed to be unhold for say the better part of a year, year and a half at, say, 4.3 quarters on the upper band, that means something like two-year notes can probably, can probably sell off a little bit more, but not much given where they're currently priced. The question then is, what does the long end do? Does the 10 year and the 30 year, do they expect a re-acceleration of inflation and the Fed to reserve that to hike more? In which case, you probably get a steeper curve or less inverted curve than what you have right now. But if the market is thinking that, hey, we're going to go into a recession, which I think is still more or less the consensus that then you can wind up with even a flatter yield curve and you can see 10 year yields rally a lot more and see maybe three and a quarter percent 10 year yields next year where you still have this relatively high two-year note yield. So I think it's really the curve dynamics that are going to be interesting. And I think some sectors like the financial sectors, for example, like banks, that can seriously affect some of the earnings potential outlook in some of those sectors. I'm Rachel Z. of Bloomberg Intelligence. Thank you so much for your insights. As always, Mike, what do you make of this whole discussion of a fully employed recession of something where we don't necessarily see the labor market participate in something of a downturn that is I was saying is sort of turning into a base case? Well, employment is lagging, first of all, so from history, you know that it's going to take a while to come down. This has also been a very unusual economic recession and recovery. A lot of supply issues, we shut down the whole economy, reopened it, and a lot of people dropped out of labor force. So it's kind of hard to get a good read on all of that. But I think the bottom line from all of this is that what's going to happen is going to take time. It's not going to be an immediate collapse in inflation. It's not going to be an immediate collapse in the economy. Atlanta Fed GDP, now 2.7%. We'll see what it is after today for the third quarter. So a big rebound in growth at a time when the Fed is raising interest rates. It's just going to take time for this to play out and the people on the Wall Street trading desk. They're going to have to have more patience than perhaps they do. And perhaps it's going to be a little bit more immediate when it comes to corporate profits. And we've seen that from a number of companies. Gina Martin Adams has been tracking it. And she joins us now. Chief Equity Stragist for Bloomberg Intelligence, Gina, in your examination of some of the recent earnings reports and guidance that we've gotten out how much and how quickly is the mood shifting in corporate executive C-sweets rather than just looking at these sort of broad macroeconomic data points. Yeah, I think the mood has shifted quite materially, frankly, over the course of this year. We've seen companies migrate from their primary concern to their regarding women taking their male higher andgariacs to simply transform and muscle",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,510,2022-10-07 12:58:36
12285," points. Yeah, I think the mood has shifted quite quite materially, frankly, over the course of this year. We've seen companies migrate from their primary concern being inflation to their primary concern being a combination of the extreme currency volatility that has been recorded over the course of 2022 and a recessionary likes lowdown in growth conditions. We've definitely seen this start to show up and consensus estimates as well. As far back as June of this year, analysts were forecasting 10% growth in earnings for the third quarter earnings season, which we're about to go into. Now analysts are anticipating 3%. Certainly, the market itself also has started a forecast in earnings recession emerging. Our model would suggest that at our September lows provided an assumption that the bond market had the outlook for rates correct. The market was pricing for a 15% correction in earnings over the course of the next 12 months. Even if you get more aggressive on the rates forecast, you suggest that ultimately that terminal rate does get to 5% and reflecting that the two-year yield needs to get to 5% over the course of the next 12 months as well. Our markets were already pricing of 5% correction in earnings. So the market is well ahead of what's likely to happen in the economy and has even forecast a pretty severe recession. Pretty severe recession. Is it in all sectors or is it specific to the retailers, specific to the semiconductors, specific to sectors that remain insulated from say some of the broader names that make up the index? Well, if you look at consensus expectations as a proxy for what we are likely to expect for the third quarter, the analyst consensus thinks that six different sectors are likely to record an earnings recession or a drop in earnings relative to that of a year ago as of the third quarter. In the second quarter, it was three. So there is a clear spreading of weakness going on. Energy is absent. The weakness, energy is still experiencing double-digit earnings growth gains, but that's likely to change going into 2023. So what we have seen is a progression of weakness and a broadening of weakness to more and more industries and sectors. The weakness is predominantly about margins still as opposed to revenues, but nonetheless, even the revenue forecast is deteriorating. But, do you know, I actually want to pick up on this and just in the minute that we have left, how surprised have you been that they're willing to sacrifice margins and to not lay people off to cut costs in order to preserve workers through a cycle after just getting burned by not having enough people or being able to bring people back after the pandemic? Yeah, I think it's a very difficult cycle, frankly. So I think this has been a surprise, but also sort of a consequence of the duration of this cycle. We were just in recession in 2020. So we haven't had the opportunity to really develop sort of a full economic cycle and then see removal of some of the excesses that typically develop in an economic cycle drive recession. So this recession is a consequence of very different factors than the normal type of earnings recession. A lot of it is frankly very tough counts from a year ago because remember in 2021 we were experiencing extraordinary earnings growth after the 2020 correction in earnings growth. So it is very complicated. It's a much different cycle than it's the norm and inflation is clearly also in a very different position. Much of what we're seeing on margins is simply reflecting input cost changes and input cost volatility, which is clearly quite different than companies have been contending with for a long time. If you remember that over the last decade, we've had very, very suppressed inflation, very low inflation volatility, allowing for margin expansion to sort of persist. This is a very different climate this time around. Gina Martin Adams of Bloomberg Intelligence, thank you so much.

There's taking to a script they're going to want the data to tell them to start to collect There's nothing in this this report that is going to suggest to them that they need to pull back Let's get that's aisa with the numbers here's my mckay monomite morning John slightly stronger than expected 263,000 jobs added to the payrolls In the month of September the August number of 315,000 was unruvised the unemployment rate though falls to 3.5% as the participation rate drops a bit 52,000 people dropped out of the labor force last month we had 768,000 additional people in the labor force and that's why unemployment goes down Average hourly earnings coming bang on expectations 310s for the month and a 5.2% for the year or 5.0% for the year which is a little bit of progress for the fed In terms of the job less story black and Hispanic unemployment 5.8% and 3.8% both of those drop from the prior month The U6 drops to 6.7% and as I mentioned 57,000 people fewer in the labor force while employment went up and unemployment went down in the household survey There are some interesting changes we would have had even more stronger report if we'd spread the number of teachers and education workers over August and September Because more went into August than in September seasonals pushed down the overall numbers for education But service providing look at that 244,000 of those service jobs retailers were gained just 1,100 and professional services was the big winner 46,000 do people do companies are they hiring at this point on the temporary side because they're not sure where the economy is going Real estate was the last number ahead on their 5,000 jobs gained that was the number the sector that was supposedly collapsed during the month So it's kind of hard to know what happened there bottom line participation rate falls and that makes the unemployment rate go down More people hired than lost jobs but participation is the key to the unemployment rate this time With that in mind Mike do we have to put our soft landing supply side dreams on hold No I mean you've still got a soft landing in these numbers because you've got a fairly strong payrolls report 263,000 is above the 191,000 which was the average for the five years before the pandemic So still a strong report 3.5% ties for the lowest that we've had So at this point it still looks good in the labor market and with average hourly earnings going down The Fed is on track at least to get to where it wants to be Mike McKee thank you how much pain how much damage will they need to cause to get there Futures down by 1.25% on ESMP the conclusion for many is this Fed has more work to do Yields up at a front end by four or five basis points on a two year 430 on a 10 year 388 yield up Around about six basis points please to say Rick reader join us now from BlackRock Rick wonderful to catch up with you again buddy let's start here your response",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,512,2022-10-07 13:06:33

You're response to that job report. It's solid. I mean, I think the comment Joe, that Michael said is right. I mean, I say it's solid. You know, to have these numbers, you know, this far in a cycle is still pretty impressive. That being said, I think you have to put a little bit of perspective on it. You know, the number, if you take the three month average, we got 260,000 jobs. I assume the three month average is 375, the six month, eight is 475. So deceleration, but it's still solid. I mean, you look at the job openings. We got this week. You know, you've had job openings coming down. You look at the claims data up a little bit. So listen, it's moving in the right direction today. What's solid though? I mean, I think all the commentary about it's just, you know, you've got an economy and still operating at a pretty good level. When the fed's got it, you've got to keep going. Spend the waste, Sam. Bad news was good news. It's solid news, bad news. Which one is it? So I will say, by the way, this is felt like another month this week. The, you know, by the way, the discussion earlier this week that was surreal to me, Jim, have been around Fed pivot bank of England does something because the pension system is having a challenge that maybe this is a sign of a pivot or put by the central banks. I thought that was bizarre. There's no pivot. The fed has got to keep going. And, you know, today for markets, listen, softening of the data is something that we're going to want to see. By the way, when we get the CPI report next week, we're going to want to see some softening if it's not. You know, that puts you in a tough spot for the Fed and financial conditions will continue to be under pressure. It doesn't give you come in every Monday morning. It doesn't give you any, let me get more financial assets on board when you're in that sort of environment. Rick, I was listening to a podcast that you did with Mev Faber. Congratulations to you both, by the way. I was fantastic, listen, for Mev over the weekend. And just listening to you both talk, just seems like, Rick, you've never been through a market like this before. You sound exhausted after this week. What a month the last week has been again. What are your thoughts on that? So I would say there are two parts of it. One, it is the most exhausting. I mean, trying to parse all this data. And by the way, you know, spend a lot of time looking at corporate earnings and what's happening. The margin pressure is business spending going to slow because I think that's going to trigger is this business spending going to start to come off. So gosh, there's a lot you got to go through. I mean, I seem to get up a few minutes earlier and you'll sleep a few minutes later every day. That being said, Jonathan, I mean, what you have to take some thought on or perspective on. This is, if you're a fixed income investor, the next few years are going to be, I think, extraordinary. You're pricing yields to levels that we haven't seen. And I know it's all right, I think on that podcast as well. Like you can sit and wait in cash in short duration assets and get paid very well for it. This is creating a environment that, you know, the markets have to recalibrate every few years. This is a massive recalibration. By the way, Jonathan, my partner, Bob Miller, reminded me this week, or this morning, that in March, the funds rate was at zero and the Fed was doing QE. Yep. And you think about now we've got a price in terminal funds rate, you know, closer to $4.75. That's a lot of movement in a few months. They've done 300 basis points in six months. I think they took them three years to do anything close to that in the last rate, I can cycle. Rick, you said a few years. And I just wonder, can we get to that new equilibrium with Fed funds in and around four? Can we get there and stay there? So listen, I mean, I think the Fed said, you've got to keep going. I think, I mean, there's something that's really important for my comment. You think about where we've gotten to. You're point about how much they've raised the funds rate. And then by the way, they're draining liquidity. If you think about since the, since where we were in December, you've drained a trillion, three of liquidity, you've drained a 300 billion in the last month, rate higher liquidity, draining, drained. By the way, this will have an impact. And so part of why I think the Fed's going to get to the number and then pause for a while. And I think you get a 75, you'll probably get another 50. We get to make another 25. You've got, you've just did an immense amount. You've got to let the system, you got to see what happens to business spending, what happens you see these openings drop like a stone, job openings, drop like a stone. So I think you got to steal them. When people say you got to keep going, listen, the Fed was easing too long. Now they're tightening, unbelievable, historically aggressively. Think about it. If they go too far, then you get to start easing again. It's crazy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,513,2022-10-07 13:11:54
12288," and believe me, historically, aggressively think about it. If they go too far, then you go start easing again. It's crazy. I think you've got to let the system recalibrate, let's see, because this is historic amount of monetary tightening. Rick, you've been in cash for a while. You've carried high levels of cash through much this year. We've talked about it a fair bit. If they start to decelerate rate heights from 75 to 50 to 25, is that sufficiently good news for you to say it's time to add a bit more capital? So Jonathan, in the next month, you think about what we're going to have happen. We've got CPI data coming out next week. We're going to hear more about the party Congress. We're going to hear about more about the war. We're going to hear more about UK utility prices. We got a lot of data coming in the next month or two. If the data, we've been getting a lot of bad news. If the data starts to suggest economy in the US moderating, we're getting through some of these exogenous shocks. In a bit better way, or at least we know what the news is, 30 days, 60 days hence, then yes, we'll start to put some money to work. And then you start to feel better about data. Cash will rotate into equities. Suppose that now I just don't find a very exciting at all. We'll show it in a bit more in batteries. You can now, instead of taking front end, like I've been buying commercial paper. I bought commercial paper 20 years, 15 years, 20 years. Cash and now you can press more into the high yield market, dollar stabilizes, maybe EM. But I still think you need 30 to 60 days. Let's see the data and let's see these developments. And then if you get that deceleration and it looks like the Fed's going to pause, you could have a pretty good environment. Rick, what do you make of how credit's priced at a moment in high yield? I look at spreads and spreads don't scream recession. I look at price in the yield and maybe some of that is saying, by me, what do you see? I'm closer to you, Delilah. I mean, I think you're right, the spreads historically, not that interesting, but you're also up to consider that the fault rates are low and companies have turned out their debt and they're sitting on a lot of cash. And the structure of the high yield market is better because the energy market they created the duress years back is actually better shape. So if you take the fact that the risk free rate is now pricing at an attractive level, that you feel that spread on top of it, you can buy high yield at 8, 9, 10 depending on how much risk you want to take. I tend to like it. That being said, I would say our positioning is moderate because I still think you've got these things to work through. But listen, at the end of the day, if you said to me, would I rather book a nine than worry about equity beta with margin compression and earnings flatlining to I think slowing? I'd like to take income into the portfolio. I think carry is pretty attractive. So I lean on the side of, by the way, I like it a lot more than real estate today. When you ratchet the mortgage rate up. So I like, I tend to like it. But listen, I think you've got to be reserved in the size of your positioning today because of all the aforementioned. Rick, the risk at the moment for many people, particularly over the last few weeks, has been in the risk free asset. And one question I've asked a few times, and I'd love your response to it. If we're struggling to price the risk free asset up 20 basis points, down 20 basis points on any given day on very little information, how do you price risk assets? You can. I mean, that's why liquidity in the market is going to show what's really important and what's really important, and what's really important and what's really important. I mean, I'm not going to be the only one of the most important and important that you can. I mean, it's so hard. Every financial asset we look at is a risk free rate plus a risky rate. And if your most conservative part of that equation is bobbing all over the place, you can. It's super hard. You've got to expand your bid-ask as it were in terms of what's your entry point on an asset. Amazon, two and a quarter years ago, when rates were at zero, issued at three, or at 0.25%. We were funding Amazon at 25 basis points. It's now a nine-month bond that you can buy at, I don't know, the exact level today, but it's back at 4%. And so you think about that. Now I'm funding because of the risk free rate, my real rate of return on asset, pretty good. You know, particularly looking at inflation break even sitting around two. So it's pretty interesting time to say, gosh, I need to expand my time horizon a little bit on assets that are yielding these sort of levels. And these are particularly, you can see in the front. And if you buy now three years.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,514,2022-10-07 13:16:39
12289," and my time horizon a little bit on assets that are yielding these sort of levels. And, you know, these are particularly, you can stay in the front. And, you know, if you buy now a three-year assets, it's a one-year or less or a nine-month with a nice yield to it. Now, that's pretty intriguing. So, Rick, this gets me to the final question. You just talked about the change we've seen in Amazon in a few years, feels like a few long years. We've just blown up a decade of negative rates, even negative rates in a corporate bond market, zero rates of the Fed, QE, trillions of it. Rick, there are some people out there that just struggle to believe that we've fully realized the spill-overs from that, that we can really go through the next couple of years without a default rate picking up a Fed bit. What'd you say back to them? How much longer do we have? You can't even have a couple of minutes. I think it's really hard, Jonathan. I mean, listen, I think I don't think it's a give-up, that you assume that boy, now the thing has to break. Listen, I hope negative interest rates is finished for the rest of my career. I don't make a work, because I think you create these anomalies in the system. I don't think it adds to velocity. It penalizes your pension system, your insurance system, it dulls investment. I don't believe in it. But what it did allow is it allowed companies to turn their debt out. It did allow companies to get healthier. And so to say, we've got to see all of this unwind. Well, you're going to slow an economy with a paradigm where you've actually got, by the way, not just companies, households, the household wealth and debt ratio is much better. The lowest part of the income strategy is in the tougher spot. But generally consumer leverage is okay. Financial leverage is okay. And corporate leverage is okay. So whether low rates allowed you to do all that, there is a fair argument to that. So to say, now it's going to unwind, it's going to create a problem. You know, the system's in reasonable shape. By the way, the debt's on the government's balance. Which is not perfect. I will dull your fiscal expenditure, the cost, certainly the cost of your fiscal expenditure. Listen, I think the starting point is reasonable. And to say, gosh, now the thing's going to tip over and it's going to get a lot worse. You know, I just, I don't see that. What creates stress in the system is leverage. I mean, in every, every, every time we go back to Asian crisis, et cetera. Now the leverage is not bad. It's on the government's balance sheet, which can handle a bit better. By the way, some parts of the world that are dollar liabilities not so much. But you can generally handle it a bit better. So I'm not in the, gosh, we're going to have that this thing is going to be disaster. I just don't buy that. And by the way, I don't think soft landing is an impossibility per what we're seeing play out today. But again, we've got to see a lot of exogenous things. Global dynamics play out over the next couple of months. Hey, Rick, awesome to catch up. I know you don't rest much, but we can. But this is what we've got to do it again Monday. Rick, read it there. BlackRock, thank you, buddy. As always, futures down about 1% on the S&P, yield to higher, coming up the payrolls report, keeping the Fed on track. We just now need to stay the course. We said we're going to do this. We need to follow through and validate the expectations that we've set in markets.

I am psyched for this one. This kid could actually be the president of the United States some day. When it comes to building generational wealth, it's not about the money that you make in college. I'm very excited that I made the amount of money that I made last year. I am even ten times more excited that I know how to make that money. This is Bloomberg Daybreak with Lake. Welcome to DeadBreak Australia. Bloomberg Technology with Bloomberg The lineup. I think we're quite a ways away from the falls. Restoring high stability likely will require ongoing rate hikes. Somewhere between four and a four and a half percent by the end of this year, I anticipate additional rate hikes into early next year. Headed for four and a half to four and three quarters percent by sometime next year. And then hold at that level as we continue to move into more and more restrictive territory. Can we achieve a soft landing? Until we see inflation truly get close to two percent. We're all waiting for inflation to peak. I'll be watching the data carefully. That's going to be really critical for policy making. Stay the course. Federal officials stick into the script and doubling down on their plans to tame inflation. The latest payroll report given the central bank a green light to keep going. This, as the Biden administration faces a string of economic tests ahead of midterms with CPI GDP and another rate hikes still on deck. Bloomberg's Amory joined us now from DC. Morning, Amory. Good morning, John Moore. We're still waiting for a statement out from the president on what the White House actually thinks of the latest jobs report. But they're going to take this and likely say it is good news, especially that unemployment rate, 3.5 percent. Not only does it match a pre-pandemic low, but also comes in line and matches at five decade low. So they're going to say their economic strategy as well as seeing above trend and wages that it is working. But Jonathan, the issue is jobs unemployment. This does not come up in the polls. The issue is inflation. So for this administration, what voters care about is next week CPI. Hey, Mitch, thank you. I think next week CPI is going to hijack pretty much everything. Amory, down in Washington, DC joining us now as I capital is Anastasia Amoroso, Pinchems, Mike Collins. Anastasia, what if I were to have you back? Your response to the jobs report 50 minutes ago. Well, it came in right under the nose in line with expectations. But unfortunately, the challenge is this shows that the labor market is slowing, but is really not weakening. I would say there's broad-based strength. Most industries are still creating jobs as Ann Marie mentioned. The unemployment rate is at 3.5 percent, which aside from pre-pandemic, you have to go back to 1968 to see that. So it's still an exceptionally strong labor market. And here in life, the challenge for the Fed, I think they want to crack the labor market. And there's lots of room for them to do so. So Jonathan, as we see the future is this morning, this is sort of really bad news, is bad news for the market. Because we kind of can see this train wreck in motion and slow motion. So to speak, we know that the labor market is going to continue to slow. And at the same time, the Fed is going to continue to hike. So between those two things, it's really tough for equities right now. Mike Collins, your thoughts on this. And I just want to throw in this quote from Ian Shepitz and a pantheon macroeconomics. This is the following, and on Twitter, it's just hilarious that stocks are cratering after a statistically insignificant dip in unemployment. And a statistically insignificant increase in the labor force combined to generate statistically insignificant falls in the unemployment rate and participation. Like I don't know if you got all that, but in response to it, please. Yeah, I mean, this is good news for the economy, right? This is good news for those in the soft landing or the moderation camp.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,516,2022-10-07 13:24:14
12291," All that been response to it, please. Yeah, I mean, this is a good news for the economy, right? It's good news for those in the soft landing or the moderation camp. It's good news for people who want to hold onto jobs. It's good news for confidence, for consumer spending. But as we all know, it's all about the Fed. It's all about central banks. Jonathan, it's all about monetary policy. How tight it's going to get. And it's priced to get really tight. And the markets are reacting to that. Amory said it. It's all about CPI. Next week is going to hijack the whole story. On a stage, you know how this goes for November. If this Fed sets the stage to go from 75 to 50 to 25, Rick Reader and I spoke about this moments ago, is that sufficiently good enough for you to add to equity exposure? No, Jonathan, I don't think so. I think it might be sufficient to create some sort of short-term bounce back. And that's what we've seen. Play out in the markets this year. But the reality is this is the Fed that is heading into restrictive territory. And the markets need to account for two factors. First of all, we're going to have depressed valuations. There's no reason for that multiple to expand. So that can't be the driver of equity returns when the Fed is clearly holding rates in restrictive territory. The other thing that's going to happen, we are already, this economy is sort of on the verge, on the brink. And as rates rise across the board, there's going to be more slowness and potential for a recession. So the markets will have to price that in. And that means that EPS downgrades are likely still to come. So even if we get some sort of a pop because of a so-called Fed pivot, the reality is the relative value of equity is quite challenged when rates are close to 4%. Well, we're getting a drop now on the S&P with down by a little more than 1% yield to higher at the front end through much of this morning on a two-year, on a 10-year, off the back of that payrolls report. On two, there are up four basis points to about 430. And a stage of my collins, going to stick with us and please to say, coming up the morning calls and later, the view from the White House will catch up with US Labor Secretary Maliwav responding to the Labor report. Looking forward to doing that with him in just a moment. That conversation just around the corner. Erik, youalnız face for 10 years but after all, We were thinking big from the beginning. I mean the reason that I was interested in doing this in the first place was a much bigger challenge than making a comfortable shoe or doing something in the fashion industry as a narrow opportunity. We thought that there was a big leadership opportunity. We looked around at an industry where there was 20 billion pairs of sneakers made every single year. It was 100% made from plastic and the hides from cows and it was terrible for the environment. We thought that we could offer something to consumers that was differentiated in the way it feels more comfortable, higher performance. We used sustainable materials and in doing so we could take a really interesting leadership opportunity and grab that and use that to tell a totally different story and compete on a totally different vector than what the rest of the industry were doing.

Through Thursday, up around 12% up another one percentage point this morning, 89.33 had a little look at 19 early in the session on WCI crude. Got a strength out there, Euro Dollar negative quarter of 1% 97 67 on Euro Dollar. What are we about 25 seconds into this? Let's get you some movies is epic. Given the solid jobs report, John, we of course have the familiar story as you've been talking about all morning yields up stocks down. So let's keep it macro. One of the big drags of course, Apple down 2% yields higher mean technologies down even more than other stocks. The valuation really comes into concern. JP Morgan Chase, the banks lower even with yields higher and as the yields curve inverts less, that would typically help out banks, but that's really not the case. One of the conundrums of this year, we do have a little bit of a bid for the energy sector. In fact, it's the only sector higher at this time with oil up 1% as you were just mentioning. And then of course, there's AMD. They miss sales by $1 billion. There's this sign of a PC slump. This stock down is now down more than 50% this year. And of course, Morgan Stanley is warning that it could in fact even get worse. Abby, thank you picking up on the energy story, the outperformance of energy relative to information technology story, the session story, the year as well, energy up by about 4.10 of 1% information technology. That grew upon a S&P down almost 2.4%. A strong labor report, a weak set of chip maker results, not a good recipe for big tech. Ed Blattlow has more head. Good morning, John. It's not pretty on the Philadelphia semiconductor index down 3.4%. Biggest dropping around 3% every week. As Abby said, AMD pre-lims sales to the third quarter, missing projections by 1 billion. We just had Samsung overnight as well. First profit drops since 2019. There's momentum in the bad news for this sector. And you know, all we're getting is evidence that it's not just a slowdown in the PC market, but for memory chips as well, we could be facing a pretty protracted slowdown in that sector. Also, of course, the jobs numbers hitting big tech pretty hard. Looking at NASDAQ 100 down 2%. And some of the mega caps also feeling the pain is not just this idea that higher rates discount the present value of future profits. I think there is mixed opinion on the street about how big tech including higher multiple chip names fair in a recessionary environment. It's not just about whether they have strong cash flow. It's also about the sort of breadth and diversity of their business. New versus old down here. I think I heard you talking to Taylor about this the other day. It's this idea that chips are the new transports, right? Everything uses chips. So if chips are suffering, that's kind of a leading indicator in the way that rail freight used to. But I'm keeping an eye on this space. The signs have been there for a little while. And it could be a pretty ugly session in the semiconductor. Taylor's the only one that can talk about the down the show. I apologize. It's all right. It's all right. Taylor Riggs made those rules up for self. Taylor Riggs, let's talk about the winners this week. It's all about energy. The favorite children always get a pass. I'll leave that alone, John. Take a look at where we are with the energy sector. And I think what's really interesting. We're seeing with Jonathan Gala over at Credit Suiz yesterday and saying that if you've tapped to the downside and energy to the upside, that is sort of the downside and the upside risk around the volatility of this quarterly earnings season. You take those out and things actually look stable. But energy of course does present sort of that upside risk when you think about the huge rebound and crude again, looking at $90 a barrel. A few days ago, X on mobile had climbed 4%. That was at a five week high. Chevron is near an all time high. So the good news, at least for the energy companies keep continuing to come as we think about day two, day three, reaction to the OPEC plus production cuts, of course, that are under way. Of course, this is a big weekly gain that we see here. Some of the biggest weekly gains that we haven't seen since March. Again, seeing that follow through from crude prices back into the energy stocks as well. Because there hasn't always been that one for one correlation as well. Let's talk about the energy companies, though, John, is we're thinking about sort of the earnings season that's coming under way. As you can see, things actually don't look horrible. You're not looking at some massive declines here, at least when we think about the volatility around these companies, maybe shaping up to be another decent rapport, at least on a relative basis to some of the other sector. I tell you, thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,519,2022-10-07 13:37:39
12294," We think about the volatility around these companies. Maybe shaping up to be another decent report, at least on a relative basis to some of the other sectors. I tell you, thank you. Earning season just around a corner. One week away, JP Morgan, October 14th, 7 a.m. in the morning. Kelly and Lines joins us now for more. Hey, Kaylee. Hey, John, I can't believe we're already here again. And I would just like to remind our audience what happened in the aftermath of JP Morgan kicking off earnings season last time around. And that was actually a pretty healthy rally from mid June until mid August is when we saw that 17% gain in the S&P 500 before we started worrying again about the macro policy picture and everything started to deteriorate. But the message of last earnings season by and large was it could have been worse. It wasn't as bad as feared. The question is whether that is going to hold true this time around because we have seen expectations deteriorating the closer we get to this season. Looking at the city earnings revision index, we see that downgrades are outpacing upgrades for 17 weeks in a row. That is what we see here on this chart. And if you listen to some of the bears on the street, that has further to go. Mike Wilson, Morgan Stanley, has been pounding the table about this for some time now. The idea that we have not not yet seen the bulk of earnings revisions that were still too optimistic given the economic outlook and the margin pressure a lot of these companies could be facing. So buckle up everyone. It's not just about the results, but about the guidance as well. And as I said, and you said it begins with the banks next week, the only $1.8 trillion worth of market cap will be reporting next week. It's really October 24th. That's the big one when we get all the big tech players, the Alphabet and apples of the world, $15.3 trillion of market cap will come that time around. And of course, for a lot of those big tech companies, other big multinationals as well, there is huge overseas exposure. And so FX headwinds going to be a big theme this quarter, too, John. Kelly, thank you. That's your set up for our next season. Back with us on police to say, on a stage around Marosa, Mike Collins, on a stage, yeah, this is your theme. And I think it's an important one, just because we see strength in the labor market. Doesn't mean there's no weakness elsewhere. No, there's plenty of weakness elsewhere. And there's a lot to pick up on here in the discussion that we just had about semiconductors and energy and banks. And for semiconductors in particular, I mean, a secular grower as this industry is, it is definitely not immune from cyclical headwinds. And I think the weakness in semis have started with the PC market. And we don't need as many laptops and computers as we did during the pandemic. But I think that weakness is going to spread to other places. And for sure, we're likely to see slower spending on a hyperscale of CAPEX, for example. And that's going to negatively impact potentially the semiconductor trade. And then eventually, I think the auto market weakness is likely to come to fruition, too. So I just think semiconductors is a tough place right now. And it is really showcasing the slowdown that we can see in the economy. So that's one thing I wanted to comment on. And then speaking of other places where we might see weakness is the banking sector. And full disclosure, I've liked this space for the soft landing scenario. But we have to kind of pivot away from the soft landing scenario, given what the Fed is doing. And so one concern that I'll be watching for in this early season is what happens with the link-wincy rates, what happens with net charge offs? Are there any red flags that the banks are already seeing now? And most importantly, are they going to be provisioning for it? So my senses, most banks are likely to take a cautious approach. And instead of being a tailwind, which was this release of low-loss reserves, it's going to become a headwind, because the banks will want to prepare for not a soft landing, but eventually a recessionary scenario. So those are the red flags. And energy, John, is a trade that we've liked all year and continue to want to buy on the pullbacks. And that view certainly has not changed. Let me just unpick the bank story. That's from the equity side. My Collins, I get a feeling you actually like it from the fixed income side of things. Mike, why is that? Yeah, there are a lot of sectors we like on the fixed income side, Jonathan, because again, if you look at the underlying fundamentals in the debt markets from a credit risk perspective, yeah, the fault rate expectations are going up. Earnings expectations are coming down. Margin's are getting compressed. But are we going to have a big increase in defaults? Are the big banks going to default on their debt? Unequivically no, right? And are they providing really attractive yields? Absolutely, yes. So there's a lot of fundamental value across different sectors. You look not only the banks, but in a stage we talked about the commodity space, the energy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,520,2022-10-07 13:42:08
12295," across different sectors. You look not only the banks, but in the anesthesia talked about the commodity space, the energy space, even the home builders, which are reporting pretty dire results recently in terms of cancellations. The auto companies are going through a cyclical week or period, but fundamentally, they're actually in really good shape. So when the cyclical credit sectors are in good shape, that means the fault rates will not spike. That means high-yield spreads where they are and investment grade spreads are probably close to fair value here. Part of the problem here, Mike is you guys. You won't buy that debt. They've underwritten some deals, and they can't spin off that debt at the yields that they thought they could maybe six months ago, 12 months ago, Mike Collins. Is it a buyer's market finally in fixed income? You know, on the rate side, it is, right? When that 10-year note gets close to 4% where it's approaching today, I mean, the markets are pricing in, Jonathan. A funds rate of four and five-eighths by next summer, that's another 150 basis points of rate hikes. And not a lot of cuts going out for 10 years. The funds rate that's priced in over the next 10 years is still close to three and a half, right? So I think it's a buy on the rate side, on the credit side. We are being a little more cautious. I think the credit markets are fair value. They're not cheap. I think there's a good probability they get cheaper, and we would be buying on that weakness. The last time we caught up, last payrolls Friday, I think you said by the 20-year. You liked the 20-year. And Mike, the 28-year-old has climbed since then by a decent 30 basis points or so. Why was it that maturity on the curve, Mike, that gets your interest? I think the whole rate structure basically, twos and out are cheap right now. I mean, I think all these yields, Jonathan, are going to be 100 basis points lower in the next year or two. All right, that's a lot of capital appreciation on top of pretty high yields. The reason we like the 20-year is because it jumps out at you relative to the 10 and 30-year. And it's just as abnormally cheap security on the curve. And there's a lot of embedded alpha in that part of the curve. So I imagine you're expecting a break of the positive correlation we've seen between risk and the bond market. And a stage where you're looking for the same thing to develop. And I wonder from your perspective, why that would develop? Yeah, Jonathan, I think the fixed income markets are a lot more attractive than price and they weren't in the beginning of the year. And I would argue that they're more attractively price than equities right now. I mean, I really kind of agree with Mike, for example, on the bank trade is that while equities may not be the most interesting place to be in banks, if you look at what you can get in the fixed income part of it, it I think is absolutely spot on. And again, to pick up on the capital ratios and the kind of the resiliency of the banking sector, the capital ratios are double what they were during the financial crisis. So this is not a solvent-see sort of risk. So as the spreads widened out, you get much better opportunities in fixed income. And look, Jonathan, the big theme for me this year has been get paid while you wait, while you wait out this volatility. It looks like we're going to be doing a lot more waiting. So if I can get a little bit of high yield in the portfolio, if I can pair that with municipal bonds, for example, that are screening really attractively right now, for investors, I think that's where a lot of focus will lie. What I hear from Mike is Mike's got a decent idea of the destination here, Mike. I don't. You think we can be 100 basis points south of where we are within the next 12 months, Mike? Does that mean you think we're going back to where we were a couple of years ago? No, I think the zero, that zero lower bound Fed funds rate is probably a picture for a few more years. We've always thought the range on the funds rate, Jonathan, for the rest of our lives will probably be zero to three and we're here. So maybe the right range is zero to four, or zero to four and a half. Maybe it averages two over the next 10 years, the funds rate. But what's priced in, like I said, is something closer to three and a half on average for 10 years. And I still think that's way too high over the long term. If you buy now and close your eyes or go to sleep for three years, I think you're going to have really big returns in fixed income. Anastasia, what do you think we go back to? What does leadership look like? What's the destination in your mind? Where does this all land? Yeah, I mean, we clearly need to work through the Fed who restrictive policy stance. We need to work through the slow down the economy. But at the end of the day, I would still come back to.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,521,2022-10-07 13:46:29
12296," I mean, we clearly need to work through the Fed, who restrictive policy stance. We need to work through the slowdown in the economy. But at the end of the day, I would still come back to some of his secular growth stories. And no, they're not gonna be the leadership for the next probably a few months. And maybe it's a year if it takes that long to kind of work through this restrictive stance. But if you look back, and if you take a step back, what are the stocks that outperform the market over a long term? The most important thing is earnings growth. And if I think about where that earnings growth is gonna lie, I mean, maybe some of it is gonna come from the S&P, but it's seven to nine percent on average, is what the earnings growth for the S&P should be. Can I potentially outperform by going back to parts of tech, by going back to parts of healthcare and biotech and sustainability type trades? I think yes, the caveat to that is the big huge tailwind for some of these tech names over the last number of years has been the zero interest rate policy. The multiple expansion has been a huge driver of returns. So I don't expect to see those outsized returns in the future, but if these companies can grow a 20, 30% per year, I think all things equal over the long run, they should still outperform the market and meet it. Alistair Ramarosa, my Collins to two of you, just absolutely brilliant. To my next stage is final point there. Zero rates, what did everyone chase? Long duration assets. No investment into things like commodities, basic resources, we weren't digging holes in the ground, we weren't building refiners. What do we see in play out right now? This is what Jeff Currier Goldman had to say. Revenge of the old economy. Energy up, that's the one big win of this morning, about six tenths of 1% on the S&P. The underlying commodity up by 1.7% on WTI, 89.96, had a look twice now at $90 on WTI, Brent Crude, 95.93, up by 1.6%. So breaking news just a moment ago, Abbie's got that. Hey Abbie. Hey John, yes, we do have breaking news. CVS has said to be an exclusive talks to acquire cano health. Now cano health, of course, operates primary care facilities and supports medical practices. So if this were to happen, this would be a continuation of their expansion, their diversification from retail. CVS, as you can see, plunging down more than 7% on Pace for its worst-estates in November. This deal is not a done deal, John. And of course, cano health is backed by billionaire, Barry Sternlecht. There's no certain TBS in part, because Humana has a right at first refusal should kind of find a buyer under an agreement they made back in 2019. But right now, CVS investors not liking that. That's Doc Dan 7% cano health has been halted. Abbie, thank you. Coming up on this program, the payroll support keeping the pressure on the Fed. It's going to keep the Fed untracked for 75-base point move at the next meeting. They were hoping that they'd still see a little bit more uptick in the legal force participation, but they didn't get that. So what has reaction up next? Lacey, you've got to explain this one to me.

Well, you know, we have a unique way that we go at big new investments. And I'm not sure it's right or wrong. It just happens to be our way. And we ask ourselves when we're considering something for questions. We ask if it's successful, could it be big and move the Neatoid Amazon? Is it being well served today? Do we have a differentiated approach? Do we?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,522,2022-10-07 13:50:34
12297," We ask if it's successful, can it be big and move the needle in Amazon? Is it being well served today? Do we have a differentiated approach? And do we have competence there? And if not, can we acquire quickly? If we like the answer to those questions, we'll go pursue it with a single threaded team that isn't distracted by the rest of the business. When it comes to the stock, it has fallen significantly. Do you think investors are missing something or has tech just been overvalued? I have never tried to predict what stocks may do. In any time, I've tried to a little bit, I've been wrong. I do really believe that in the short term, the stock market tends to be a voting machine and the long-term it tends to be a weighing machine. We have a concept we talk about a lot in Amazon, inputs and outputs. You know, in the ultimate output for a company, a share price. You know, in that other big outputs are free cash flow, or profit, or revenue. You can't really manage the outputs. You have to manage at the input level. And that's where we spend all our time. And so if you do the right things for the business long term, things tend to work out. I think we've had very good returns for investors. And I expect that to be true again.

We join now by US Labor Secretary, Money World. Secretary World's fantastic catch up with you, sir. A robust labor market report, Rick Reed with Black Rock, called it solid. Here's my question for you, sir. You're more worried about people losing their jobs or getting it down inflation. I think we need to work on, we're worried about both, obviously. I don't want people who lose their job, but we need to continue to bring down the flesh-hury pressures that people have. Certainly, what OPEC made a decision on this week to do was not helpful to us. The President was disappointed. We disappointed his administration, but we need to continue to bring down those pressures. I mean, I think that, you know, I had a long conversation on office today. I certainly don't want to see that unemployment number go up. I like to see people working. That's what the Fed is forecasting. Some people say that's the objective. How are you preparing for the pain that they're forecasting? And what can we do on the supply side when it comes to things like immigration? Well, on the unemployment, you know, we were talking for the last three months about seeing those numbers go down. And in the year 2022, we've had about 440,000 jobs per month. We're still seeing people 263,000 people going to work today. This month, I should say, last month, we're still seeing those numbers going on. So I think that that's something that is important that we continue to put those gains. We still have job openings. People are still looking for work. Obviously, we'd like to see the participation rate a little higher. I mean, that number went down a little bit this month. I think 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1. So we're going to we have to see what's happening there. Clearly, the employee over the last couple of years is getting some leverage it hasn't had for a few years. A number of years may be even decades over their employers. You broke a deal with unions in the last few months with freight rail companies, the 12 unions. I understand four of them have ratified the deal, Marty. Secretary Wosh, are you worried about the other right? No, I'm not. I mean, they're out there explaining, when I say they, the union leadership now and the bargaining committees are out there explaining to the members what's in those contracts. It was a very painful negotiation, not what I had, but prep leading up to me, two years of negotiation with really no movement. And I think that there's explaining to do in these contracts. And I look at these contracts, they're a good contract. I mean, it's 24% over five years. Healthcare, freeze cap, work rules changed. It was a good contract for the employer and employee as well. So hopefully we can get the rest of these ratified exit requisite available.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,523,2022-10-07 13:55:39
12298," 24% over 5 years. Healthcare freeze cap, work rules changed. It was a good contract for the employer and employee as well. So hopefully we can get the rest of these ratified in the next six weeks. In the Rose Garden, the president said this, because of this labor agreement, those rail workers will get better pay. A 24% wage increase over the next five years, improved working conditions, peace of mind around their healthcare by cap and across the workers will have to pay. Have the poor workers on the West Coast Secretary Walsh asked for the same conditions? No, I don't know what they're asking for for wages and benefits, but certainly those are all the conversations that are generally on the table. A little different negotiation. The West Coast Port negotiation is a very fluid conversation that the both sides are at the table. They both have in conversations. It's a longer process than I anticipated, but that's just historically the way they've operated. They kind of take one segment at a time. I stay in close contact with both the employer side in the unions and the West Coast Port. And both sides express to me that they're still moving forward. They'll obviously be sticky issues that will pop up every now and then, but nothing that's making me be concerned that I have to have a 20 hour meeting in my office about. What would make you concerned? Because you've seen pretty relaxed about that over the last few months through much of the summer. I think if I heard one side or the other side just kind of saying that they're not moving forward enough, and they're really concerned, I'd see in their voice or hear in their voice, so that expressed to me. I've spent before this negotiation started. I spent a lot of time out in the West Coast both sitting down with the unions and sitting down with the employers. So in this case, I have a lot better relationship with the employers in the unions than I did in the rail. The rail was kind of all new to me. The union side, I knew who they were, but I really didn't know the leaders of the unions. And I certainly didn't know the rail companies because I wasn't familiar with them in my old job. But so having that relationship with both sides going in makes it a lot easier to navigate and try and help continue moving on. Secondly, what was your memory, sirs me correct? I think the last time we did this on a West Coast was maybe 2014 and you can correct me if I'm wrong. But I'm just wondering in previous experience, did it take this long? Yeah, I did. It took longer, actually. And that's why I was having a conversation the other day and I asked how long. It actually took longer. I think 2014, I want to say 28. I think it went a lot out in 28 and there was a strike in 1972, I think it was. So it does take a long time because it's very complicated. They're doing the whole point, all of the West Coast negotiation and every peer has a different set of rules and negotiations that they have to do as well. So it's a master contract, but then there's individual rules in each of the ports. So they're going to all this systematically. Secondly, well, it's big month coming up looking forward to catching up with you. Our next conversation will be sandwiched in between I think Federal Reserve decision in the midterm. Secretary Walsh, thank you. The Labor Secretary, Marty Walsh there, down in Washington, DC. Equities down about 1.9% on the S&P on the Nasdaq down by 2.5%. And police are saying Mike McKee's dropped by the studio just for final thoughts as we look forward to next week. Mike, it doesn't matter what we say about today. This whole conversation gets hijacked by CPI next week, doesn't it? It absolutely does. Although I think going into CPI, we've pretty much decided that the Fed's going to do 75 basis points on November 2nd. So that may not have a major impact either. The impact on the markets today is the idea that the unemployment rate went down. And so the Fed has a lot more work to do. It is a bit of a conundrum because the labor force shrank, but the real change was the number of people who lost jobs compared to got jobs in the household survey. Employment was 204,000 strong unemployment down to 61. So you've got almost a half a million jobs swing between the two things. And that's why unemployment is falling. The good news for the Fed and maybe the markets are just kind of overlooking this is that we are seeing participation drop. We're seeing unemployment drop, but we're also seeing average hourly earnings drop. They've sort of stabilized on a month over a month basis and that's brought them down on a year over a year basis. And that would be good news for the Fed. And so maybe we should see things start to change in the markets. It's good news. My co-confused myself for a week. We're all confused. My Vicky. Thank you.

Pepsi's number fever campaign in the Philippines has probably gone down in history as one of the biggest marketing disasters in history, mainly because of a human error that led Pepsi to print more winning caps than they planned. The resulting chaos caused riots, civil unrest and even deaths. Reporting this story took over a year and it resulted in me flying to Manila in the Philippines to meet unlucky winners. And to find out exactly what happened back then in the 1990s. My name is Jeff Mesh. I'm a journalist based in Los Angeles. I wrote this story.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,525,2022-10-07 14:03:10
12300," My name is Jeff Mace, I'm a journalist based in Los Angeles. I wrote the story for Bloomberg Business Week about Pepsi's Number Fever campaign. The Philippines is a really interesting country, it's made up of thousands of islands and it's also a country that's very heavily influenced by America. American culture is everywhere you look in the Philippines, they're obsessed with Frank Sinatra music for example. They love all things America and that extends to their love for soft drinks, Pepsi Cola, Coca Cola. In the 1990s it was everywhere. Pepsi and Coca Cola were embroiled in what is now known as the Cola Wars. It was a fierce battle for market dominance. Number Fever was already a really popular promotion, it had been rolled out in America to great success. And so Pepsi decided to roll it out internationally, particularly in Asia. They thought it was the answer to their problems, they thought it could finally help them beat their biggest competitor. In the name of one, I won! Look for the winning number in size ice for a 7-day Alphan TV video newspaper. You could be a millionaire. A million pesos or $68,000 doesn't sound like a lot now, but in 1992 that was a phenomenal amount of money. You've got to remember that in the Philippines at the time the average monthly income was about $100. So a million pesos was wealth beyond anyone's wildest imaginations. Number Fever caught fire in the Philippines. Kids were saving up their pocket money to buy a bottle of Pepsi. Parents were squirreling away, all of the bottle caps in bags. You would walk down the street and people were going through trash trying to find discarded bottle caps. It was a national phenomenon. Pepsi boasted that half the population of the Philippines was playing it. Number Fever boosted Pepsi sales every month from $10 million to $14 million. It had a huge impact on Pepsi's bottom line. Number Fever quickly became number hysteria. Mades were being jailed for stealing their employer's winning bottle caps. There was even some murders over winning bottle caps. People were fighting in the streets over these caps. There were signs that there were going to be problems with number Fever very early. Pepsi had rolled out the competition in Chile and a garbled fax had caused some consequences. They had caused some kind of problem with the winning number. They'd announced the wrong one in Chile causing riots. There were signs that there could be big problems ahead if they didn't keep their eye on the ball. So in 1992 Pepsi decided to extend the campaign in the Philippines and they announced that the competition would go on for a few more weeks. One night on the television news they announced the latest winning number. The problem was 349 had already been allocated as a non-winning number in earlier campaigns. So there were literally hundreds of thousands of bottle caps with 349 just floating around the Philippines. Hundreds of thousands of people all across the Philippines, thousands of islands were finding winning bottle caps. 349, 349, some people had 10 lucky 349 bottle caps. People were dancing in the streets celebrating. They thought their problems were over. They were millionaires. It's still not certain exactly how many winners there were of lucky 349 bottle caps. But we know that Pepsi printed over 600,000 of them. Pepsi realized very early that there was a problem. Hundreds of people started arriving at their bottling plants with their lucky bottle caps. They realized something was seriously wrong. Pepsi tried to solve the problem by offering a small...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,526,2022-10-07 14:07:20
12301," who started arriving at their bottling plants with their lucky bottle caps, they realised something was seriously wrong. Pepsi tried to solve the problem by offering a small token donation to anyone that brought a lucky bottle cap to their bottling plant. But it wasn't enough. People didn't want just a handful of pesos. People wanted their million pesos prize. Within a year, violent protests and riots outside Pepsi factories would leave dozens injured and five people dead. At one Pepsi factory in the Philippines, a grenade was thrown through the window. It killed three Pepsi employees. Anacita Rosario was a schoolteacher living near Manila in the Philippines. She was one of the tragic victims of this whole thing. She was walking to a nearby store to buy some rice one day when a Molotov cocktail was thrown at a Pepsi truck in a violent protest. It bounced under the truck and exploded. It killed her and an innocent bystander who was just a child and injured many others. When I was in the Philippines, I tracked down Anacita's daughter, Cindy and her husband, Raoul. It was clear to me that they were still very upset by the whole thing. A family had been ripped apart by this competition. Raoul told me that he'd never remarried. He'd told me that he'd gone to meet Pepsi executives after his wife was killed. And he was angry. He said to them, this wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you, if it wasn't for number fever. The biggest revelation from my reporting was rumors that Pepsi was somehow involved in bombing their own trucks. I found a newspaper report with a headline that said Pepsi goons bombed their own trucks. And when I visited the MBI, the police department in the Philippines, they presented with documents and interviews with people who claimed that Pepsi had paid them to cause riots and to cause trouble outside their plants. In order to destabilize the situation and to frame the owners of the coalitions that were fighting them to try and curry favor, I just thought that was so shocking. And of course, Pepsi denied it. But helpers are that a company would be accused of bombing their own trucks. The contest had sparked so much anger in the Philippines because it landed at just this really weird time in the Philippines' history. It was during a crazy election that was racked with allegations of fraud. The Philippines was in a kind of love-hate relationship with America. They loved obviously the American aid and finances that was pouring into the country, but at the same time they yearned for independence. They wanted to be their own country. Vicente Del Fiero was a local preacher living in Manila, and he hated the number fever campaign. Del Fiero thought Pepsi's number fever campaign was just one of the many ways that America was asserting its dominance over a third world country. He hated seeing his fellow countrymen get ripped off in his eyes by this huge multinational American company. He wanted justice. Del Fiero rounded up over 800 winners of 349 bottle caps. And he got them all together to sue Pepsi for over 400 million dollars to be divided between those holders of lucky bottle caps. Del Fiero took money from some of the people who could afford it. They paid him 500 pesos to help with legal fees, but for people who couldn't afford the money he would just represent them pro bono. I love you, don't you? You can build that broker. I'm that big.

12302," and then pro bono. I learned that thing. He used to build that breaker on Becky. And for these two people, I might be the food. But I had my own campaign. I don't know where. I don't know where. He flew to America and he hired two consumer lawyers here in America to take on Pepsi. He had a meeting at Pepsi's headquarters to try and resolve the problem. But he said he wanted to take it all the way to the highest courts in America. When those cases were heard in America, those courts decided that this was a problem that should be heard in the Philippines, not in America. Back in the Philippines, Delphiero continued his case in the Filipino courts. At one stage, there were arrest warrant handed out for nine Pepsi-Cola executives, which he saw as a big victory. We don't know if those arrest warrant were ever upheld, but it made newspaper headlines across the country. Pepsi did not take kindly to Delphiero's campaign. They tried everything to shut him down. They sued him for libel. My father had to attend three times a month for a brunch, one for a day, and another heating for the brunch, one for 13, and also three times a month.

My father passed away January 13, when they then after staying for almost one year in the hospital, he died of complications with the heart failure. After the death of my father, I was inspired to do the website. Pepsi could be remembered for what they did to the consumer in the Philippines and to my father. When I reached out to Pepsi for comment for this story, they claimed that they didn't have access to anyone who was working at Pepsi that was around in those days. They also said that during COVID-19, they didn't have access to their documents about this, but they were very careful to say that they were sorry for everything that happened, and we do know that Pepsi did try everything to try and make this right. The Pepsi number fever disaster cost the company millions. We know that they paid up to $10 million in those good-will payments, but the financial effect could be much greater. After the disaster, we know that Pepsi sales dipped. They were overtaken by Coca-Cola again. Pepsi's number fever disaster changed the legacy of that soft drink in the Philippines forever. Some people of certain age won't touch it. For many people, Pepsi is a taboo word. A lot of the people that I spoke to were still quite traumatized by their experience, by that experience of winning a million pesos, losing it, and then returning to their normal life in poverty in Manila. When the news of the bombing came out, it was a massive story in Germany. We are following some breaking news coming to us out of Dortmund in Germany.

12303," Farming came out. It was a massive story in Germany. We are following some breaking news coming to us out of Dortmund in Germany. It was covered by all the media outlets. Three roadside explosions triggered at the same time last night as the coach left its hotel in the south of Dortmund. Public figures commented on it. We should not let them affect our life wherever it was. The media echo went far beyond Dortmund. I think it was front page news in every single big paper around Europe. Everyone thought of a terrorist attack and people were scared that throughout the city and Dortmund there was more attacks to be happening. Unbeknownst to investigators just after the bomb went off and the players of the team were shell shocked. The person who had mastered my attack was actually sitting in the hotel eating steak and sweet potatoes. My name is Thomas Rogers. I'm the journalist who wrote the article, The Get Rich Quick Scheme, that nearly killed a German soccer team. Dortmund is a mid-sized city in the western part of Germany in a state called North Rhine, Westphalia. It's a former industrial city that's kind of fallen on hard times in the last few decades. It was severely bombed in the war so the center of the city is quite stark. Some of the few high points include its soccer team. My name is Aikening. I'm a reporter with Bloomberg News and I'm a great fan of Borussia Dortmund. Dortmund fans are super loyal. On all matchdays the entire city isn't black and yellow. It's like a religion. I think more than most German cities, soccer does play a very large role in the identity of Dortmund. In October of 2000 the BBB became the first team in the Bundesliga to actually go public. Salaries for soccer players in the Bundesliga have gone up very dramatically. With such high prices they thought that by going public they would be able to compete better with big teams like Bayern Munich. Unfortunately that didn't go too well. Dortmund bought too many expensive players, high wages, and the club almost went bust in 2005. The price of their shares it has sometimes gone up but mostly gone down since they made that decision. On April 11th 2017 the team was staying in a hotel on the outskirts of Dortmund. Matchdays are always special in Dortmund. Everyone is looking forward to it. The team always meets in the same hotel ahead of matches. They stayed in this hotel in order to have a kind of neutral space before game so that they could concentrate and be isolated from distractions and things like that. Everyone was pretty optimistic they had a chance to go really far maybe into the finals. I was in the office and getting ready for matchday. I was going to meet with a friend of fellow Dortmund supporter in the pub. Es always, the fans are very excited about matches. On that day we were heading to play in the quarter final against A.S. Monaco at Signal in Duana Stadium which is in the center of Dortmund. Shortly before 7pm the players of the team boarded their official team bus. When the bus took off the parking lot of the hotel and turned on the street there were three detonations, three bombs that exploded and hit the bus off Dortmund. Three explosions occurred close to the Borussia Dortmund team bus. The B team bus had just left the hotel. The explosions destroyed two windows in the rear part of the bus. People screamed, people jumped to the ground. The fellow Dortmund fan I was supposed to watch the match with. He called me and said turn on the TV there was an attack of the Dortmund bus and I thought he was like there was impossible. Some of the players screamed at the driver to keep driving as fast as possible because they were worried that people might storm the bus. German investigators",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,529,2022-10-07 14:20:25
12304," It was screamed at the driver to keep driving as fast as possible because they were worried that people might storm the bus. German investigators say the explosive devices used in the attack on the Borussia Dortmund bus contained metal pins and the one had pierced a seat headrest. Unbeknownst to the team members, the actual mastermind behind the attack was as they were disembarking the bus, was actually eating steak and sweet potatoes at the hotel they had just left. Authorities were attempting to verify a letter left at the scene claiming Jihadists were behind the attack. Because there had been a series of attacks by Islamic terrorists in Germany and Europe, there was a widespread suspicion in the media that this was another Islamic terror attack. Three letters were found at the site of the bombing that took credit for the attack on behalf of Islamic State. There were however reasons to doubt this particular narrative. Would actually be a surprise if ISIS were actually part of this attack. Possibly could be employed by other groups like the Far Right wing to try and shift the blame. The letters had some strange qualities. They were written in a strange German that used big sophisticated words but had basic grammar mistakes as if someone was native German speaker but pretending to be a foreign person. Federal investigators have detained one man suspected of links to Islamist terrorism, one of two suspects whose apartments were raided this morning. Shortly after the bombing, a man in Austria named Rudolf who was a big BBB fan, he noticed that something strange was going on on the stock market related to the team's shares. He emailed the lawyers of BBB who then forwarded that email onto investigators. The email stated that someone had bought 60,000 BBB put options, a wager that the value of the shares of the team would fall below a certain amount at a certain date. I would someone buy that ahead of a match and then three bombs go off. Something is right here. For the person to make money off of that, it required the stock to go down quite a bit in a fairly short period of time and it wouldn't just be the team losing a match, it would require something much bigger than that. There was another big red flag about this purchase, which is the fact that it had actually been made. Number one on the day of the bombing, but also from an IP address that had been traced to the actual hotel where the bombing had taken place. When three explosions targeted the bus, carrying the Borussia Dortmund for ballers on April 11th, written notes left at the scene claimed the attack was the work of ISIL. The truth, as is now alleged, is remarkable. In April 21st, the police arrested a man in a southern German city called Tubingen. It was on his way to work and his name was Sergei Bina-Gord. He seemed like an unlikely suspect because he had no known connections to the Islamic terror world. He didn't seem like a far-right extremist. He didn't seem like a left-wing extremist either. He seemed to be a completely unremarkable young man. A 28-year-old German Russian man named only as Sergei W stayed in the same hotel as the players on the night before the bombing. He specifically requested an upper room overlooking the bushes where the explosive devices were hidden. The media dissected why he would do that, what was his past. He had been inspired by the 2015 terror attack in Paris. He noticed that in the aftermath of the attack, the stocks of French companies went down. He believed that if an attack took place that was directed at a specific company, that the decrease in stock price for that company would be even more dramatic. It never occurred to anyone that someone would do that out of greed. We now know that the suspect bought three different derivatives on the Borussia Dortmund shares, with all these derivatives he bet on falling shares. The suspect bought the majority of these financial products on the 11th of April, the day of the attack.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,530,2022-10-07 14:24:51
12305," of these financial products on the 11th of April, the day of the attack. If the plot had been complete, successful, and the stock had reached a value of zero, the intergold would have made up to 570,000 euros, or the equivalent of about $608,000. Ultimately, the plan completely backfired. The attacker, Sega, Benagolud didn't make any money, in fact, he lost money. In court, he would be extremely quiet. He usually kept his hands clasped together. One of the lawyers actually commented that he had never seen a defendant act so calmly. The intergold had served some time in the German military. From that information and from online research, he was able to figure out how to assemble remote, detonated bombs that would do what he hoped to do. There were a few days of extremely emotional testimony, including the soccer players who described, doubting whether or not they could ever play another game again. It brought everything back up and it didn't quite help them to kind of process what was going on. Throughout it all, he sat there completely silent. The big mystery that was swirling around the trial was the question of why he may have simply done it because he wanted to impress a woman. Rebecca is a young woman who has a very troubled home life. She ultimately sees her relationship with Vaynergold as an opportunity to leave that troubled home. Vaynergold is a Russian immigrant to Germany. He speaks with an accent. He has anxiety in large groups of Germans. She begins to resent the fact that he has these fears and feels a little bit trapped. Rebecca attempts to dump him on multiple occasions and T threatens to commit suicide if she leaves him. Vaynergold apparently told Rebecca that she would soon be seeing a surprise. After being dumped via text message, he apparently began planning for this attack in earnest. Vaynergold was charged with 28 counts of attempted murder, which carried a maximum sentence in Germany of life in prison. He claimed that he had nothing to do with the attack, but as time went on, he admitted that he had actually been the person who had built the explosives and had set them on. But he claimed that he didn't want to actually kill anybody. Ultimately Vaynergold didn't receive the harshest possible sentence he was given 14 years in prison, but it's still a considerable amount in jail in Germany. The threat of an asteroid hitting Earth is very real. If it's big enough, it's also very final. These are very, very infrequent events. The probability is not zero though. A blinding flash of light streaking across the sky. About a hundred tons of space rock falls on Earth every day. Most of it is so small it burns up in our atmosphere, or lands unnoticed away from major populations. No human in the past thousand years is known to have been killed by a meteorite. On according to NASA, no large object is likely to strike the Earth any time in the next several hundred years.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,531,2022-10-07 14:28:53
12306," is known to have been killed by a meteorite. And according to NASA, no large object is likely to strike the Earth any time in the next several hundred years. However, one thing is certain. We haven't found them all. There are thousands out there and we don't know where they are. There are a lot of asteroids in our solar system. They number in the billions. Scientists all over the world are working toward detecting and deflecting the most catastrophic of natural disasters. The reason is to find as many of these objects as we can. We have a way of calculating whether or not an asteroid is potentially dangerous or not. I mean, I think it's something worth investing in. Sorry, existence has stayed. Amy, let's get this one out of the way. It's probably the question you get asked the most, but how scared should we be? Astroids and comets are a natural hazard that's out there like a lot of other natural hazards. These are very, very infrequent events. These collision events where an object actually impacts the Earth. The most important thing that we need to know about asteroids is when the next impact is going to happen and how bad it will be. What we know is that an object that's about, say, a kilometer across is capable of causing very, very wide devastation across the planet, really, truly global devastation. The object that wiped out the dinosaurs was somewhere in the neighborhood of five to 10 kilometers across, so even bigger than that. At a kilometer, it's still going to be very bad and will have global effects. For objects that are capable of causing what I would call sort of regional damage, kind of a large major metropolitan area, a city in its surrounding environments, sort of around 100-ish meters. And it depends on the details of the composition and so forth. By the 1980s, NASA was cataloging near-earth objects. In 1994, Stargazers watched as comet Schumacher-Levy 9 hit Jupiter. The resulting zone of chaos was estimated to be as large as the Earth. And the event became a turning point in the search for asteroids and comets in our solar system. In 1998, Congress tasked NASA with finding 90% of asteroids and comets, 1 kilometer wide, or larger. Soon after, Hollywood blockbusters Armageddon and Deep Impact brought attention and fear to the masses. The great news is that the vast majority, more than 90% of all the really large one kilometer near-earth objects have been found. The challenge now is working down to these smaller sizes that are still quite capable of causing a lot of damage, but they're just harder to spot because they're fainter. They're smaller. Can you give us a sense of how many are out there in our solar system? We know that there are a lot of asteroids in our solar system. They number in the billions. Most of them, however, are between Mars and Jupiter in what we call the main asteroid belt. This is a region of space where most of the asteroids in the inner part of our solar system live, and they stay there for many billions of years. There is another population, though, that kind of leaks inward and gets into the region somewhat close to the Earth. We call these near-earth objects. We think that there are millions and millions of near-earth objects that are out there in the total population. As of today, we know of sort of around 20, 25,000, something like that. When we first spot an object, we really know very little about it. We just see something moving across the sky. All you get is just sort of a handful of snapshots, just enough to be able to tell that this isn't an asteroid that we've already seen before. Once we can calculate the distance to it, we can now start to make predictions about its true size. Is it large or is it small? So we have a lot of information that we have to get pretty quickly to really understand what's going on. Finding asteroids is just one piece of the puzzle. Planetary scientists are extremely skilled in determining the orbits and speeds of asteroids based on relatively small amounts of data. NASA runs simulations of the trajectories asteroids could take, which is useful, but time consuming.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,532,2022-10-07 14:33:40
12307," relatively small amounts of data. NASA runs simulations of the trajectories asteroids could take which is useful but time consuming. A team of scientists in the Netherlands have found a way that could buy us more time. Our methods is very quick. So you can very quickly get an assessment of whether or not the objects is danger or not. If you look at the classical way of determining the danger of an asteroid, it may take days of computing time on very big machines to determine this hazardousness. The current problem is that there's just too many asteroids out there to spend a huge amount of computational power on all of them. So the neural network allows us to focus on what really could go and pose a hazard to Earth. A neural network is a computing system that mimics the way the human brain operates to find underlying relationships in a set of data. By training the network in this way, you train it in recognizing those objects that are most likely to hit the planet. And once it's trained, you can apply this network to all the unknown asteroids. And then you can make a selection and saying, hey, these are the ones which appear to be having orbits similar to the ones which we know are hitting the planets. That doesn't mean that they do, but it only means that they look very similar to once we know they do. What else did you find? Should we be particularly concerned about anything? One thing that we did find is that our neural network was able to go and identify a handful of asteroids which weren't considered potentially hazardous that when we went into the gradient and forward in time, they came quite close to Earth. You find a handful which were not detected before or not considered being dangerous before and we think they are potentially dangerous. It's very hard to simulate kind of going forward in time and asteroid that's going to hit Earth because what the Earth is really small and what space is really big. And then you have to have very exact parameters to shoot an asteroid that goes and hits exactly later and then Simon had the ingenious idea of not even trying to do that and just launching the asteroids from Earth's surface and integrating backwards in time. It's very hard to make it hit. So you need a lot of calculations which all end up in nothing. And the idea was then like, well, let's not do that. This is basically what NASA is doing. NASA is taking an asteroid, making multiple copies of them, shooting them all forwards in time, calculating their orbits and then see what fraction sort of gets close to Earth. They'll be even hitting Earth but getting close to Earth and then they call it a potential impactor. So you calculate the solar system forward in time for let's say a thousand years and then you launch asteroids from the surface as if they if you go forward in time would follow on the surface, you calculate them backwards due today and then you get your orbital parameters of today's asteroid which you know will land on the planet and those you can use as known impactors and compare this all the other asteroids in the solar system. Consimulations and AI can those things fill in the gaps where perhaps telescopes and other imaging tools can't? Absolutely. Since the observations get more complex, the physics gets more complex and if the physics gets more complex the mathematics becomes more complex and at some point you can't solve your problems analytically anymore and then this is where the computer comes in. Now we have this trained neural network, we have a way of calculating in a fraction of a seconds whether or not an asteroid is potentially dangerous or not and therefore deserves more attention or more time to spend on for for redefining our if it is dangerous. When it comes to hunting asteroids, time is critical. What we can do about a potentially hazardous object depends a great deal on what we know about it and how much time we have before the encounter. We really like to find them on their decades away because the more time you have, the more options you have and the less energy it takes to move an object aside. It also means we might not have to resort to launching a nuclear warhead at an asteroid until recently pretty much our only choice. That's an option of last resort in my opinion, yes. We have lots of options available if you can just simply open to the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,533,2022-10-07 14:37:54
12308," Until recently, pretty much our only choice. That's an option of last reason I did my opinion, yes. We have lots of options available. You can just simply bump into the object and just nudge it out of the way. That's one possibility. And that's kind of in a way the sort of the simplest thing to think about. Just nudge it off. It's path a little bit with a massive object, a spacecraft one. It's kind of like bowling if you have a long time or a long stretch of runway in the lane. Just a very small twist on the bowling ball will make a big change in where it ultimately ends up. Another option would be something where you take a very big, big, massive spacecraft and you park it next to the object. And you use the force of gravity as a towing rig that takes longer though. And you need to be able to send a pretty massive spacecraft. And it obviously depends a lot on how big the asteroid is. Other options start to get more and more complicated. And they range from painting one side of the object of white color and painting the other side dark and letting a pressure of light sort of perturb its orbit. In a departure from the lab and computer simulations, NASA has real plans to rehearse kinetic impact deflection. In 2021, the agency will launch DART, the double asteroid redirection test mission, which will intercept a 160 meter asteroid in 2022. Better to practice now before we have to deal with an actual threat. In the meantime, discovering asteroids is our best bet. Thousands of scientists and amateur astronomers around the world make up an informal network that surveyed the heavens. But that may not be enough. NASA wants more resources to map our solar system and better technology. We need to ramp up our network of sensors. And also we need to just continue to strengthen our network of international observers so that we can get follow-up. Because we find these objects when they're distributed all over the late sky. Once we get more observations, we get better data, we can make better predictions. If you look at the big impactors we have had in the last, let's say, 20 years or maybe 30 years or 50 years, most of them we haven't seen coming. So the real danger I think comes from the objects we don't know about. And not from the objects we do know about. This particular natural disaster, like a lot of natural disasters, and climate change is a problem of the global commons. So the thing that we risk collectively is that it sort of then becomes nobody's problem and nobody takes our worship over it. Asteroids are all over the sky. They just truly cross boundaries and borders with a second's notice. They're kind of imagining the future. Maybe he walks a small satellite around the earth that are always going and looking outward. I think it's something worth investing in. Sorry, existence, that's state. Right. The pandemic has affected everyone in different ways. Some passed the time by baking. Home made sourdough bread.

I haven't gained over $3 million. I want some free money. I don't think you can overstate the online communities or social media influence on financial markets. A large group of inexperienced investors who discuss their plans on social media platform Reddit have shaken up the stock market in a big way. The stock that everybody's talking about right now is GameStop. Video game retailer GameStop has set to continue their head spinning ascent today. The revolutionaries on Reddit are spanking Wall Street's ass. The more these stocks go up, the more the big guys are getting creamed and losing billions of dollars. This is in a wealthy person's game anymore. Anyone can play it. I took up a little bit of a new hobby and I'm interested in day trading. As an investor nowadays, you don't have to look a specific way. You don't have to wear specific clothes. You don't have to be doing it from a trading floor on Wall Street in like a high-rise building in downtown Manhattan. The narrative of what's driving the markets is no longer being held in secret offices in New York and Boston of privileged people talking to other privileged people. It's right out in the open. It's on Twitter. It's on Reddit. From brokerage apps to discord channels and subreddits to TikTok vincluencers. One of the last holdouts in the world of disruption, finance is next in line. Investing should be as you pick with us as shopping online. That's Vlad Tenev, the CEO of Robinhood, the online brokerage app, talking about how he wants his app to disrupt the world of stock trading like Amazon disrupted the world of home shopping. And I think that speaks to exactly the mission that a platform like Robinhood has, which is to democratize investing. Robinhood was started in 2013 by Vlad Tenev and by Jubat, in where else Silicon Valley, as an alternative to the big brokerages, but with one big difference. As they were building the social network around finances for people, they realized that there was a gap in the market and that free trading could become something that they could bring to the markets. They could disrupt the industry. While no fee trading is industry standard today, it was unheard of when it was first introduced. The online brokerage industry was really innovative when they came on the scene 10, 15 years ago, but they kind of stopped innovating where you haven't seen those commissions come down beyond five or six or seven dollars. Robinhood, think that by offering zero commission, that they're gonna push people onto this platform. And on top of no fee trading, the customer's Robinhood was courting had been long overlooked in the world of finance. So the typical customer of a Charles Schwab, for example, is putting a lot more money in that brokerage account than the typical customer at Robinhood. Even today, with all of its popularity, the median account size is about $240. There's fiddilities in the Schwabs, in the e-trades, up to the world. They look down their nose at those kind of accounts. I don't want a thousand dollar account, they're just a headache. I want a hundred thousand dollar account. And this is key here, right? Because the thing about Robinhood, that's different than every other single brokerage platform is how easy it is to use. The design of the Robinhood app really has in mind a user who might be coming at this absolutely cold. The fonts are very well-sized, the shapes, the colors. All of that is something that the founders of Robinhood paid really close attention to. And by creating an interface that catered to a newer investor, they were able to gather a pretty healthy group of customers. And by 2019, they had about 10 million customers. Those 10 million customers were a huge success story for Robinhood, but no one could have predicted its explosion after the arrival of COVID-19. Remaining doors to the greatest extent.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,535,2022-10-07 14:46:49
12310," lotion after the arrival of COVID-19. Remain indoors to the greatest extent, and 100% of the non-essential workforce must stay home. What we saw when the pandemic hit was the growth of Robin Hood users absolutely turbocharged. And oddly, you saw this surge in interest in stock trading. Then they saw the absolute surge in 2020 in customer growth. And now by many accounts, they have more than 20 million customers, which is pretty extraordinary. So the next step for them is to figure out how to monetize those users and how even with their small account sizes to get them to grow with the company. And as it releases more products, come along with them. JESUS Robyn Hood would become one of the COVID economies break out successes. Robyn Hood traders, as they're called, became the shorthand explanation for the frenzy of often speculative retail investing after the pandemic lockdowns. Kids wake up in the morning, they go on Robyn Hood. They're, you know, in the shower, they check Robyn Hood. Kids are learning how the stock market works at 18 while they're at school, you know, checking their phones and between classes because notifications pop up telling them what their stocks are doing that day. With these new tools, millennials and Gen Z are investing in the market and ways their parents could have never even dreamt of. That is sort of key when we talk about the divide between older and younger generations is that the younger generation is exposed to so much more information and tools at their disposal to do what they want in the market. The older generations, you never had the technology or the cost structure that you could play the markets like you can today. So you were stuck with giving your money to a professional investor and paying them a fee to do it. When I speak to young kids, they tell me I'm making mistakes. I'm losing money. I'm not a perfect investor, but I'm 18 and by the time I'm 30, which will be, you know, 10 years from now, I'm going to have interacted with the markets for a decade and so it's a learning experience more so than anything else. And you can look at it and you can say, wow, that's, you know, that's risk taking that's dumb, but, you know, if you could possibly shave 10, 20 years off your working life versus adding five years, I don't think you can fault people for that. But Robyn Hood is only part of the puzzle. Sure, you can trade on it, but without research information and data, you're just blindly throwing darts at different stocks and hoping to strike it rich. Wall Street forever has always run on what we now call narratives or needs. You know, people telling rumors to each other, they've been around for a hundred years. On Wall Street, information is its own currency. Historically, either you had it or you didn't, and the people who had it had a huge advantage. In the past, those narratives and memes didn't have a network effect. It would be one person telling another person over the phone. In fact, when I broke into this business in the 80s, a lot of people used to complain that they weren't on the call list to get those ideas. Social media changed all of that. Fast forward to 2021. That's being done on the internet now, and that's being done on Discord and Twitter and Stocktwits and Reddit. And the impact is very similar, but orders and orders is meant to be larger. As social media has played a bigger partner lives, it's also played a bigger and kind of more important role in how people find investing ideas online and on these platforms. How do those ideas spread on TikTok? Yes?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,536,2022-10-07 14:51:19

People aren't just going to it for C-Shanty videos. The personal finance hashtag on TikTok has garnered 3.5 billion views from its 1 billion monthly active users. By comparison, videos found under the cooking and health tips hashtag have 2.6 and 2.1 billion views respectively. The trajectory of Robinhood and TikTok were literally on par. What happened in the stack market this week? So the word of the week is expectations. Absolutely essential that you understand the risks of shorting. And Kayla Kilbride and Kyla Scanlon are two of those financial influencer TikTokers, also known as Finn Fluencers. I think people still care about fashion, they care about culture, but it's also like, there's this big behemoth thing called the stack market that we really don't know a whole lot about. And it's a gate kept behind the industry. And so people want to unpack that. And so my audience is, a lot of them are younger investors who are looking to hone their skills. Tech in right up. Kyla and Kayla are two of the more, let's say, professional TikTok influencers. The Tesla Arc Bitcoin Biotech Risk Cluster. I've been trading since high school, and it was a really interesting way for me to fill out my decision making frameworks and to think about thinking. And I think that the more that we can have people thinking about finance, the better that we're going to progress as a society, I think it's a huge gap in our educational system. If you're going to buy an option for stock, you can just go up. It's a call. So think about like this. I made the options video where I was like options are just like shopping. Rumor has it that this pal is about to go up in price. So if I come into mom, can I still buy it at the press? And a ton of women just like attacked that video. And we're like, you explain things so much better than my boyfriend or my professor or like, I could sit and listen to you all day. And I was like, this is what I was looking for. But TikTok's algorithm does not reward common measured videos about responsible investing. It rewards this. Watch this video for 30 seconds and you'll be rich for the rest of your ****. I try not to say the a word, the a L G O word, because TikTok listens to us. The algorithm does impact how you feel. You do notice which videos do better versus which videos do worse. How do you catch some attention in less than 60 seconds? And how do you make it something that they're like, I need this in my life? Nearly impossible to do that in 60 seconds. But the people who perfect it are the people that you're going to watch and give a stick around. And where people are sticking around, read it. And it's nearly countless subreddits about finance. And by far, the biggest one of those is Wall Street Bets. There's a lot of social media platforms out there. But Reddit is like the social media platform for finance. Places like Wall Street Bets is where it all goes down. Started in January 2012, it wasn't long before Wall Street Bets adopted a 4chan like etiquette. Leading to their tagline, like 4chan found a Bloomberg terminal. We had all these unexplained stockings and we would be grasping for a wide stock XYZ jump 20% in a day. And you would look at Wall Street Bets and you would see people there talking about buying options in that stock. And it sort of squared the circle, so to speak, and started making sense. And it was at that point that it was like, wow, we have to start paying attention to this. Some people on the platform really spend tons of time and others are just looking for entertainment and to have a little bit of fun, effectively gambling or looking for an outlet trying to make a little bit of money. Then on top of all of that, there were stimulus checks now clearly this money is going to people who need to use that to eat, to live. But there's a lot of people who use this money to invest in the stock market. And it's not just stock tips, people quote unquote, yolo their entire life savings or stimulus checks on a single stock. They post what is called gain and loss porn, screen grabbing staggering hits and misses on stocks for the entire community to see. I am back to lose everything.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,537,2022-10-07 14:55:33
12312," a gain and loss porn, screen grabbing staggering hits and misses on stocks for the entire community to see. I am back to lose everything. And while some of the people on Wall Street bets are novice investors, the community contains multitudes. In one respect, what it did show us among these network groups is they are very sophisticated. They're not a bunch of ignorant people talking to other ignorant people. And this is where the pieces of the puzzle all come together to wreak havoc on Wall Street for a solid week in early 2021. It's pretty clear that the combination of more people having retail brokerage accounts and trading apps and more people being stuck at home looking for some kind of entertainment and some kind of community online came together in this very singular way. What came together is GameStop. Let's go back to the beginnings of what happened with GameStop a couple of years ago. On the boards like Reddit and StockTwitch, a lot of people were talking about GameStop as being attractive value. Some of them are even, you know, Wall Street alums who left the industry and now still have access to tools that they can use to improve their financial well-being and make very good decisions. And I think Warring Kitty is a perfect example of that. GameStop is one of the most compelling asymmetric opportunities in the market today. Really I don't understand how you can disagree with that. At the same time that this crowd was talking it up, the hedge fund institutional crowd didn't like the stock at all and it had the largest short interest of any stock in the New York Stock Exchange going into late 2020. Short selling is a bet that a stock price will fall and it's a fairly simple concept. An investor borrows a stock and then sells it. The investor is betting on buying the stock back later for a lower price before returning it to the original owner pocketing the price difference. What a short seller would tell you is that they almost act as a policeman in financial markets or they're at least looking for companies that aren't what they say they are. And that can range anywhere from an outright fraud that some short sellers try to expose to just a company that's not worth as much as investors think it is. The problem is if the stock price rises, the short seller has to come up with the money to buy the stock back and the more it rises, the more it costs. And that's what's called a short squeeze and the hedge fund Melvin Capital was on the wrong end of that squeeze. Melvin Capital lost over 50% of its money in the month of January alone just from being caught in the short squeeze of the stock. This is where the disruption comes in. One of the most wild stories you're ever going to see, GameStop shares absolutely going nuts. In less than a year, the company's stock has jumped from less than $3 a share to almost $350. Cheers everybody. Roaring Kitty has turned $50,000 or so investment into some $14 million. Others all over social media use the free trading app Robinhood to wreak havoc on Wall Street. They're actually piling on into some of these stocks to really hurt the professional short sellers. And they all used Reddit, Twitter, TikTok and Discord to tell one another to keep buying and quote, hold the line and not sell GameStop. People are getting cheerleaded for jumping in, buying at the highs. They're saying keep going. And it was working too. Until. Thursday morning, the trading app Robinhood sent out this tweet. In light of current market volatility, we are restricting transactions, including GameStop. People were really angry. Robinhood was supposed to allow the regular people to play the same game. These big boys are playing. But instead, we were all taken for schmucks and they screwed us. Shares of GameStop are jumping again now that retail investors are being allowed to buy shares of the stock. And what we learned is that when people organize online, they have the ability to disrupt the market. And it was a big sign that ivory rolls up in a situation that aren't as powerful as maybe the institutions let them to be. I don't know if pumping up GameStop was the best use.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,538,2022-10-07 14:59:44
12313," was a big sign that ivory rolls in the institution, art is powerful. It's maybe the institution's left them to be. I don't know if pumping out GameStop was the best use of billions of dollars, but I think that as a signal to society, it was pretty interesting and powerful. The GameStop saga was so impactful that both Vlad Tenev and Roryn Kitty were called into testify before Congress to clarify each of their roles in the saga. One thing that's emerged from the Congressional hearings is that they're interested in how retail brokerages make money and whether they're keeping the best interest of their customers in mind, but it's pretty fuzzy as far as what they would actually do as a result. While the frenzy around GameStop eventually subsided, it didn't take long for retail investors to find other areas to invest their money. Take a look at Bitcoin going bananas over the weekend. Bitcoin forms a brand new all-time high. It was after GameStop started to drop that we saw Bitcoin really go up to over 60,000. How much further does Israeli have to run? It's compelling to say that money shifted from one venue to the other. While correlation doesn't equal causation, there's a chart out there showing an inverse correlation on mean stocks going down and cryptocurrencies going up. There's definitely an aspect where people are making money on stocks and then moving, you know, they're agnostic, they're not hedge funds. They can invest wherever the hell they want. It's a classic sort of momentum trade. They're going to wherever the winners are and they're willing to jump on and ride it. So whether it's mean stocks like GameStop, mean coins like Dogecoin are entirely new ways to invest in art like NFPs. The new kind of retail investor is making its presence known. Over the next 10, maybe 15 years, you're going to continue to see whether by choice or by force, that baton go from older generations to younger generations. I don't think any single app is going to be the thing that disrupts. I think people are the disruptors. How people get ideas about what to invest in has become increasingly entwined with social media. And as social media companies govern more and more of our lives, the fact that now they're tied in more intimately to people's wallets is something that we might want to understand better. Usually what disruption I think means is technology comes in whether it's blogs, the newspapers, or online, retailing to brick and mortar. They come in and they're in the same business, but they just do it in such a gigantic cost savings that it causes everybody to switch. Well, that's the risk that happens here is that it's so much cheaper to just manage your own money. We're not there yet, but costs and conveniences are moving in that direction. So I'd say Wall Street, you haven't been disrupted yet, but you could be in the coming years and then that the final chapter on this story hasn't been written. Meet Bloomberg's own David Nicholson. Now his happy place is out in the field, on the open road. But like the rest of the world lately, he's been working from home a lot more than he's used to. COVID-19 has prompted a massive urban exodus as professionals of every ilk yearned for more space to live and work. As a result, rural areas have exploded and they're poised to experience a resurgence as more and more.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,539,2022-10-07 15:03:52
12314," Rural areas have exploded and they're poised to experience a resurgence as more and more families pack up and leave the big city to try out life in the burbs. But there's one problem with that. Not all internet speeds are created equal. Anyone who might need to upload or download large files for a living may not want to pack up and move to that cabin in the woods just yet. Now, David's house isn't a cabin, but it is in the woods and inexplicably his internet is workable. My internet is okay. I pay a lot for it. It's around $140 a month. The download speed is great and the upload speed is terrible. Which is really bad for my work because I have to upload these massive files. But I'm definitely one of the more lucky ones in this community. Just a few miles down the road my buddy has awful internet. It's usually under two down and under point two up. So it's it's often unusable. Some days it's around one and other times it'll drop down to about point two point three. I just want to be able to have internet at my house without having to go outside the normal ways of acquiring internet. It's really frustrating. We're literally miles a few miles away from downtown and it just cuts off. This is a problem and the solutions are not there yet because getting high speed internet in rural areas on mass is something our providers may simply not be ready for. If your internet service doesn't have fast download and upload speeds then you don't have high speed harmony. You have. Americans on average pay about $70 a month for internet at home. But in rural areas it could cost a lot more for a lot less service. So the pricing for a fixed wireless provider here can be something between $80 and $150 for about 25 megabits per second. However gigabit service which is a thousand megabits per second and symmetrical is running at about a hundred nineteen a month or a hundred thirty a month. That's John Paul. He co-owns Spiral Fiber, an internet service provider here in Nevada County, California. And for the past ten years he's been trying to bring an affordable fiber optic network to town. It all started when he applied to be part of the pilot program for Google's fiber service. Across the country civic boosters have been going to extreme chanting. Singing. And marching. Trying to get the search engine giant to look at their town. The internet these days is crucial to be in the world, to be a part of the world and to be connected to your community. Google ultimately went with Kansas City, Missouri which left Paul on a mission to get funding to lay out fiber optic networks for gigabit service. Over the next several years he would attend conferences and pitch venture capitalists and apply for grants to make his vision come to life. One of the biggest roadblocks to building infrastructure for the internet here in the United States are the existing large providers. They have their landstaked out, they would prefer that nobody come in and compete against them. In 2013 we applied for a grant. We went down and met with the commissioners at the California Public Utilities Commission. It was an arduous process to get funded. But we finally did against all odds. We got a $16 million grant and then we went out to seek venture capital. Then in March of 2020 the pandemic hit the world. Everybody got locked down and everybody came home and everybody started using the internet. I remember seeing on one of the local fixed wireless providers websites they said, hey we know you're all staying home but please don't use too much video and please don't use too much bandwidth and I thought that doesn't work. The US connectivity gap is far greater compared to countries that are considered its peers economically. Some developing nations actually have better internet than rural America. Like in Kenya which has a state of the art fiber optic network fed in from their coastline. The American connectivity gap does largely affect rural areas that are either outside of service coverage or simply prohibitively expensive.

12315," opportunities like that that are truly driven from COVID. We're moving as fast as we can regardless, but hopefully they'll give us some more time. Talking to John Paul, it's clear that he believes broadband is something that can transform a community and should be considered a public good. One of the first communities to come on in the United States with full on gigabit service was Chattanooga, Tennessee. Now they're a bigger city, but there is city that was economically in a downturn. On the last 15 years, the city of Chattanooga has turned around in an amazing way. It's a nexus for young people to move to. It's a place where technology happens. It's not just about logging on to Zoom, you know, to connect with your colleagues who might be in New York City. It's also your ability as a small business, you know, operating in the town of Nevada City or wherever it may be to, you know, quickly upload your payroll documents or something onto the cloud or to quickly, you know, swipe a customer's credit card. There's just some really basic business functions and mechanics that I think people in big cities really take for granted and that are just gonna be a much bigger challenge for small business owners and rural areas. One, two, one, two, one, two. Five, six, eight, seven, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten. Historically, the marginalized people, you call them as untouchables or dhaliths, they have been kept away from the center of the knowledge. Once you are born into a caste, it is very difficult for you to grow beyond that. You are stuck in that identity. I think education is the best way of liberating them. So that's how I chose to work in education sector. The kind of education that we are giving to the marginalized people is going to change not just the fate of these communities in Telangana, but it is going to be the source of inspiration, the source of hope for all the marginalized in this country. The greatest flight in India is the system of caste. For generations of Indians, the social code known as the caste system has defined how people earn a living and whom they marry. Although outlawed seven decades ago, caste remain a significant factor in deciding everything, from family ties and cultural traditions to educational and economic opportunities. Dalits, people who are on the lowest rung of the caste system, constitute almost one-fifth of India's population of 1.3 billion. Not able to afford the high tuition of private schools, many are forced to attend government-funded institutions, which in the past have suffered from poor infrastructure, lower education standards, and high student-to-teacher ratios. But Dr. Praveen Kumar is trying to change that. I am currently working as head of the Langan or social welfare residential schools. So totally, above 400 schools I manage, these are all residential schools for the students who are historically...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,541,2022-10-07 15:15:36
12316," Shalbel Fire Residential Schools. So totally about 400 schools I managed. These are all residential schools for the students who are historically marginalized but talented and then poor. Of them, 60% are girls and then 40% are boys because girls are more marginalized among the marginalized. They voices are always suppressed. My approach to improve the conditions in the schools has been put your eyes and ears on the ground always. Stock to the parents, stock to the teachers, stock to the students, you know, stay in the schools and then understand their problems, their challenges both in classrooms and then the corridors and the dorms, then go to the dining halls and see what kind of food they are eating and then go to their homes and then what kind of food they are getting. What kind of challenges the parents have? I have seen what I've seen. I've seen what I've seen. I've seen what I've seen. One of the important changes that I brought in after I took over was to complete the transformation of mother tongue to English medium because English medium, as I said, English is the language of emancipation and language that connects you to the whole body of knowledge in the world. So we had to train a lot of teachers. The result of the prediction is also and final then you win. As far as you know, it is the right time for you. Hey, Ritchie, how are you? I seem to find time here. I have a good view. I find the right time here. Identity is extremely important. There is a scientific evidence to prove that, you know, your sense of identity is extremely crucial to your growth as a successful human being in your life. If you accept an identity which is very humiliating which reminds you of very painful past, I think that identity will not help you to grow. Not that I'm not saying that you should forget your past. I'm not saying that. But that should not be the bubble in which you must live always. Sweros is an alternative identity. S stands for state. W stands for welfare. Aero. Swero and then Aero is a Swero. So the idea is your dreams have to be skybound. So that is what we are trying to achieve by changing the identities. Like, you know, I'm a Swero. And I aim to be a doctor. I'm a Swero. I aim to the top-notch engineer. I'm a Swero. I aim to be a top bureaucrat of this country. I'm a Swero. I want to be a very good actor or, you know, a musician in this world. So these are the positive images that are associated with identity. Just to give an example to you. See, in 2012, in our institution, we used to produce about six doctors per year. But because of our, you know, this self-eliberating ideology of Sweroism, we have this year, we have produced about 189 doctors. This is phenomenal for any poorest of the poor people. You know, how difficult it is to get into a medical college in this country. So, but today, because of this ideology, the students have been able to achieve this, you know, future. Pujita has been a form-lebror. Her parents, the angels are agricultural labourers. And then this girl used to sell vegetables. But thanks to the residential education institutions, she came to the Gowl-Edo D campus. And then she toiled very hard for one year, despite many problems. And today, I'm so happy to share with you that, you know, she has joined one of the prestigious medical colleges in the state of Telangana, Usman in Medical College. And then in future, you know, she hopes to be a gynecologist. So, this is the journey our children are hoping for. Similarly, the most...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,542,2022-10-07 15:19:40

Mount Everest Expression, we are very fortunate enough to place the youngest ever female in the history of this world, on the peak of Mount Everest. How did this happen? It's all because of an idealism that helps you to liberate yourself. We have a lot of extra-curricular activities and most of them got institutionalized now. So for example, music. Similarly, the games. We have so many coaching academy, boxing academy, Brazilian academy. We have a handball academy, so we have a cabadilla, traditional Indian sport. We have a goal. We have introduced a goal for golf. Golf is generally played by rich people, but today, even poorest of the poor people are also being trained in golf in our schools. So our intention has been to give all 360 degrees type of opportunities to the students. So the students, whatever is interested in whatever activity they can go and then do it. Break the barriers. Break the fence at least mentally, because the poor people have been programmed to be victims, programmed to be subjugated, programmed to be on the margins, always programmed to feel inferior. We wanted to change all that. There are certain games which are exclusive to rich people. There are certain languages which are exclusive to middle class and upper middle class in this country. To put it in one word, the sole aim of introducing all these co-curricular activities is to break the stereotypes which are directly imposed on these people. Their stereotypes talk to Kumar knows all too well. Born a Dalit, his grandparents were labourers and access to the village well was restricted. Dr Kumar credits his parents' belief in the power of education with helping him realise his aspirations. He went on to join the Indian Police Service, attended Harvard University and then began pursuing educational reforms back home. I attribute whatever I am today to my mother primarily. They educated me in the village, although there were no good schools. So then I stayed in social welfare hostel, the hostels which are managed by government for the poorest of the poor kids. I passed with reasonably good grades. Then I went to university and then I faced a worst form of discrimination in the universities. In those days I was talking about the bathrooms and toilets were exclusively meant for shelter and shelter. I used to fight discrimination on one hand and then again try to excel in academics day in and day out. That's how I came to education because I deeply believe that education is the only important weapon that can really place the poorest of the poor people from a very victimhood orbit to prosperous orbit. I think in future this is going to be a game changer for the marginalized in this country. I think that's going to be a game changer for the poorest of the poor people. I think that's going to be a game changer for the poorest of the poor people. I think that's going to be a game changer for the poorest of the poor people.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,543,2022-10-07 15:23:49
12318," If you look at a thermal image of a city and then compare that to a map of vegetation, you'll find that where there's greenery, the temperature is lower. This is because things like asphalt, concrete and shingled roofs absorb more heat from the sun than trees. This is the urban heat island effect and it accounts for higher temperatures in cities often by several degrees compared with their surroundings. It's becoming a huge risk to human health as growing urban populations exacerbate the heating effects of climate change. Heat waves kill more people than any other extreme weather event, more than tornadoes, hurricanes and even floods. That's why urban heat island mitigation strategies are being studied in Singapore by a group of researchers. The government back project called Cooling Singapore is now in the process of combining everything they've learnt to create a digital tool that can help cities all over the world, starting with Singapore. In Singapore, close to the equator, temperatures regularly rise above 32 degrees Celsius or 90 degrees Fahrenheit. And the city structures only make it worse. And that is also the case for Singapore which is basically a concrete jungle, more urbanized, more developed city. And even in Singapore what you have is a situation whereby there's a temperature difference of 7 degrees Celsius between the more urbanized and the more rural areas. The government has taken drastic steps to keep temperatures down. This is Gardens by the Bay, an award-winning park. And inside this greenhouse is a pleasant 24 degrees. That's because the dome, along with two dozen nearby towers full of thousands of people, is chilled by what's probably the world's largest underground district cooling system. It uses a large central plant, the cool water, and then pipes it into banks, residential towers, an exhibition centre, shopping malls, and the city's iconic Marina Bay Sands hotel and casino complex. So one of the biggest perks of using this system for the buildings is that they can save 40% of the income of electricity usage, compared to your traditional air conditioners. And with Singapore relying on natural gas for most of its power, this new system means emission savings equivalent to removing 10,000 cars from the city's roads. That has big implications for the rest of the world. If things stay as they are, more than a third of the world's electricity could end up being used to call buildings and vehicles by 2050. As the world gets hotter, gets warmer, there is a greater need for air conditioning and as well as refrigerators for instance. And the more people are buying these household appliances, the more energy usage they use and they release heat more and that then exacerbates climate change. It's a vicious circle. And so since 2017, researchers at Cooling Singapore have been identifying design solutions that reduce our need for so much cool air in the first place. One thing many cities have in common and that's the importance of vegetation. That's a very important measure to mitigate the urban heat because of the shading effect of course and the psychological effects of the vegetation and also because of the possible evaporative cooling effect of the vegetation. Vegetation can be of course on the ground floor in form of trees and shrubs and you can walk under them. This is the so called canopy layer that the vegetation forms above us. But vegetation can also go up the facades of buildings and it can go to the roof of the buildings. I don't know if it's really appropriate there's no use of highizations for violations in the community.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,544,2022-10-07 15:28:28
12319," But vegetation can also go up the façades of buildings and it can go to the roof of the buildings. Luckily Singapore has been striving for the garden city feel for quite some time. It was a vision initially introduced by them Prime Minister Li Kuan Yu in 1967 to make life more pleasant for people. And today Singapore is one of the world's greenest cities in terms of urban vegetation. Camping Admiralty, a community centre that contains health facilities and social spaces now provides more green space than the plot of land it was originally built on. It's topped by a roof scape of staggered terraces covered in local plants which functions as a community park and a village green in the centre that contains farm plots for residents to tend to. Park Royal on Pickering was designed as a hotel in a garden that doubled the green growing potential of its site. There's now 15,000 metres of sky gardens, reflecting pools, waterfalls, plantar terraces and green walls and the government has big plans as well. Singapore actually has a plan to plan one million trees and add more green spaces over the next 10 years. It is actually a mix of one thing to reduce the urban heat island effect but on the other hand is also to get the people to be more connected to nature. But it's not enough. The city state has still been warming twice as quickly as the world average over the past six decades. That's why calling Singapore has developed a catalogue of other potential heat mitigation measures. When you try to mitigate the urban heat island effect in a city or in any building in a village as well, the first place to start is by shading of the windows. You have to keep areas clear so that the wind can move through it. Water of a certain depth can act as a very good thermal buffer. If you have to construct heavy buildings such as high rises, at least you can make the surface the facade less heavy and you can protect it from direct sun penetration. You have to make sure that no combustion engines will be in the city in the middle and the medium to long term range. So ideally the electricity production is outside of the city and you bring just the clean electricity into the city. You can at least minimize the use of energy in the city and you can start to slowly convert the roofs, the facades of the city into production areas for renewable energy. In Singapore unfortunately this is a limited option but in the long run it could produce up to 20-25% of the energy of the electricity needed in Singapore if all the roofs and the areas in the buildings on the buildings on the facades will be used to do that. With so many different ideas, cooling Singapore is also designing a virtual model of the city to test them out. It's called a digital urban climate twin or duct that will calculate how each element of the city's design will impact the urban heat island effect. That means we model not only the geometry of the buildings digitally but also we model the transportation, the insulation, the temperature, the radiation coming from the sun, the weather, the local weather, the local climate, the even very, very microclimate of the city. The water, the movement of people in the city, we can invent scenarios, we can design scenarios, test them before we actually build them and if they test very well and we are sure that they will function then we can start to build them and put them into reality. Singapore will be using this new tool to figure out which actions it should take next and the model can be applied to any city whether it needs to keep heat out or keep heat in which will ultimately save energy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,545,2022-10-07 15:32:35
12320," Whether it needs to keep heat out or keep heat in, which will ultimately save energy, slow climate change and improve our quality of life. So this is something that Singapore will be able to export, maybe even together with its city development system that it already has. Singapore is one of the very few cities in the world that really combined this scientific approach with a very well-established urban redesign and urban design approach through its agencies and the combination of its agencies. It has achieved a lot in the past. If it keeps following the scientific path and the combination with the other knowledge in the city already, we think that it will be a very comfortable and very livable city in the future even more than today. The city has a very well-established urban design approach with a very well-established urban design approach through its agencies and the community. The city has achieved a lot in the past. The city has achieved a lot in the past. The city has achieved a lot in the past. Times are tough, jobs are scarce, it's risky to be outside and around others. It seems like there's very few ways to make extra money during a pandemic. So I guess I'll just hunker down and binge social media until this all blows over. Wait, don't these people make money? How do these people make money? Streamers, YouTubers, Twitch stars, how do they make money? Is it a lot? Is it a lot of work? I know, I gotta ask somebody in the biz and I got just the guy, Austin John plays. This is your full-time job now, right? As of November of last year, yes. This was always just kind of like a side thing. Like any money that I made from doing my videos and whatever else, I never touched that because I didn't really think of that as being like real money. And then it started coming in more and more. And then it was like, I hit my first day that I broke a grant. And I was like, this is actually gonna be money. How did the YouTube channel come to be? When the game Pokemon Sun and Moon came out for the 3DS, there was like things that I learned about the game. And then I wanted to just share that information with people. And at the time, I didn't have any way to capture screen or anything. So I found like generic footage and I kind of put it all together with so much editing. And that video got six views. And then two days later, I made another one. And that one got 12 views. And then I just started pumping out more and more content. And people were like, this guy knows what he's talking about. It really just started building on top of itself. And then it was like, my channel really focuses on tips and tricks. So I play a straight 18 hours. And I'll finish the game or get to about the 40 hour mark. And then I'll make my first video. While I'm going through, I have a giant no pad and just scribbles everywhere. And I make these notes of like the things that stumped me. So I know the things that may stump other people. What do you need to think about if you're building your YouTube channel? One, you need to do something that you're passionate about. Not that you like. Not that you think you're going to make money on something you're passionate about. The other thing is something that other people are passionate about. It holds a special place to them. And third is, it needs to be something that people are going to seek out information on. In order to enter into the marketplace. You either need to be better.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,546,2022-10-07 15:37:05
12321," It needs to be something that people are going to seek out information on. In order to enter into the marketplace, you either need to be better than everyone else. You either need to be faster than everyone else, or you need to be more accessible than everyone else. And you can't be more accessible because it's already on the platform granted. If you understand how the algorithm works, which is very similar to Google Analytics, then yeah, you can have a little bit of a head start. But if you're not doing it faster, and if you're not doing it better than everyone else, then why should anyone watch your channel? So my income as a YouTuber kind of breaks down to three different ways. One, which is the bulk of it, which is ad revenue. Whenever you go and you watch a video, and then there's an ad and then you wait five seconds and hit the bottom right corner, and then you go on to the next video, or a non-skippable ad, or the video starts immediately. You get the little banner ads at the bottom, or if you scroll down from the video, the first thing that shows there is an ad. Those are the four different types of ads that can appear on every single YouTube video. And all of them pay a certain amount. It varies on lots of things, like the country of the person who posted, the country of the person who watches it, the time of year, where you are in the quarter. If there's anything going on with a reduction in ad revenue, like great example, COVID-19 companies weren't as spending as much on advertising. So because of that, CPM went down. CPM stands for a click per thousand, and using the Roman numeral for a thousand. And that means that for every one thousand views, you get a certain amount of money. Now on low ads, when I first started off, my CPM was 30 cents. With every thousand views, I made 30 cents. But then once I signed with an MCN, and I started making more quality content and more engaging content, some of my better videos, and certain times of the year, I can see CPMs as high as 12 to 14 dollars. And there's a big fluctuation between, you know, if I post a video, when there's no ads being spent like January and February, that's a reason a lot of your favorite YouTubers. And also TV shows don't post new videos in that time of year, because ad rates are down. Why are they going to make content that instead, you're recording and you're bulking up for when ad revenue is higher. The second way that a YouTuber makes income is support, crowdfunding, things like that. When I first started off Patreon was really the only option, but then they started rolling out supporters and members for YouTube channels. So whenever I have a live stream, you can click a button and then you can become a member and then you get special icons next to your name, I believe they're called badges, or on any video, you can hit the join button and that helps support the channel. And then the third aspect of that would be merch. And for me, my merch has been somewhat basic. In fact, I'm wearing one of my t-shirts from last year right now. You have to endure the times that your first video gets six views that you post it on Reddit and they say, shut up and then an auto mod bans you. You have to go through that because until you go through that and you discover why you're doing it, you're not doing it for other people, you're doing it for yourself. If you're not loving what you do, then it's not worth it. Huh. So make a channel about something that I'm passionate about. Oh, sweet. I guess I can make the channel about that. Now, how do I grow an audience? How do I get popular? It's all about diversification, right? You have to have a massive Twitter following. You have to have a massive Instagram following. You have to have a massive YouTube following. Of course, you have to be on Twitch, which is the key platform. But basically, anyway, you can get in front of your audience. You can engage with your audience. It is going to drive those clicks, which ultimately drives the advertiser revenue that you can share.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,547,2022-10-07 15:41:36
12322," You can get in front of your audience, you can engage with your audience, it is going to drive those clicks, which ultimately drives the advertiser revenue that you get back from all of these platforms. It's me and Dan playing video games and talking in a funny manner over them. They're not just people who are good at games, they're actually people who are good at online engagement, online entertainment first and foremost. You have the right to remain stylish, anything you wear can and will be used against you in the quarter fashion. The streamer is either very, very talented at the game. The best player in the game is generally going to draw a crowd, because people like watching people who are very good. On the other hand, they're either very, very good or funny, charismatic, whatever it is on that side. Oh no! You know, it becomes more of a show where they talk about other things outside of the gaming world and gaming becomes really just a backdrop and an excuse to engage with other audience. There were those weird Ronald McDonald, straight to VHS movies, remember those? I'm personable, I'm chatty, I would kind of, you know, when boring things were happening in the game, I would ramble on about, you know, movies I'd watched or books I'd read or conversations I'd had and stuff like that. So I think being personable was a big part of that. It's not just getting on and playing games, it's getting on and being an entertainer. You are putting on a show. Alright, now let me go ahead and grab the samurai sword and every gym has. Okay, he's dead. To have a larger audience and to have that audience, I think, stay with you, you have to bring something extra, you know. You have to find your niche, you have to find what works and what connects with the audience and what makes them laugh and what makes them keep coming back. Then you gotta make it a little more exciting. Alright? Throwing a hanging bishop, have everybody in suspense for a moment? I think the real most important thing is, is to just get used to being on camera. Like in any sort of performance thing, is get used to talking on camera. You know, my first few videos were terrible, but because I sat down and did it for six to eight hours a day, I just got used to talking and I got over that uncomfortable hump. If you go into Twitch purely with the expectation that you're going to make money, make a job out of it, have all this growth and it's going to be great, you're probably going to burn out prior to getting to that point because there's very little payoff for a long time, right? Like multiple years generally before you really start to see a payoff. And so, you know, those first few times you're streaming, nobody is there. One person shows up every 30 minutes says hi, maybe, and leaves, right? Like, it's very discouraging, I think, for a lot of people. And so, you have to be there just loving it, you have to love talking to yourself. When nobody is around, you have to love just the game that you're playing, all of that stuff, because it takes a while and I think a majority of people burn out prior to getting to the like, profitable point of it. And there you have it. My very own YouTube, Twitch, Discord, and streaming channels all ready to go live. It's a veritable social media ecosystem just on the verge of thriving. So don't forget to smash like and subscribe and visit my Patreon for perks. Also, go to my merch page. And one last thing, stay cool, my friends.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,548,2022-10-07 15:45:44
12323," This is live stream shopping, one of the hottest trends in China. It's not about only shopping, it's about the experience, it's about having fun. You got to see 3D, you got to see in some kind of action, it's almost like a theatre act. The internet craze has taken over China. By the end of 2020, the country had almost 400 million live stream shopping users. China's live stream e-commerce market has also grown dramatically, with an estimated value of $161 billion in 2020. It's becoming popular outside China as well. So, it's live streaming the future of shopping. Live streaming is not a new thing, and China started in 2015 with the rollout of 4G, and it was first used for entertainment and socializing. Many live streamers perform for their followers or chat it to them, making money by receiving virtual currency and gifts. In the west, live streaming is mainly the domain of avid gamers, and China is broken into e-commerce. China actually has a very big e-commerce empire, so it uses these super apps, what we call that you have payment, you have search of information, you have recommendation system, and you have huge amount of goods available on the platform, as well as a lot of consumers. So, with this advantage, they merge these features of live streaming to make the influencers actually sell goods. Here is a perfect choice, nice neutrals, beautiful prints, nothing overwhelming, and the warmth and comfort of flannel. This is I think. Traditional TV shopping involves a one-way direction whereby a host introduces a product, demonstrates things, and say call this number or something, but live stream shopping is live. That in itself is a very big difference. It causes different psychology, and live stream shopping is a very entertaining way of engaging someone else. When you shop, actually this live streaming video will continue, it will minimize into a corner, and you can buy the items and pay all on the same app. After that, the live streaming screen will just enlarge by itself, and the promoter will come back to screen. So, it's very convenient. How about one of China's biggest e-commerce platforms owned by Tech Giant Alibaba added a live streaming function in early 2016. In the following years, other e-commerce and social platforms like JD and Do-In also integrated this feature. Over $70 billion worth of goods was sold via live stream on Taobao in the years from March 2021. Latest surveys show that over 60% of live stream users in China were watching shopping shows, and over 65% of them shopped at least once via live stream. In 2020, live stream shopping got a huge boost during the pandemic. With millions of people were in lockdown, and many retailers were pushed online. People doing the lockdown thought there's a need for more social interactions.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,549,2022-10-07 15:49:53
12324," So, like there's a need for more social interactions, this live platform creates an interesting kind of environment that these people, the sense that I'm actually interacting with you. And the live stream shopping brings in a lot more variety of things that people could buy and satisfy in order to sense the sense of a music control especially during the pandemic. At the heart of this craze are the top influencers who have tens of millions of followers and sub-products worth millions of dollars every night. They often use their stop power to get bargains from retailers which in turn boosts their own sales and influence. So, if you think about China's live streaming, you have to know the king and queen of the influences. The queen of live streaming, Viya, she is actually having the biggest viewership and the biggest sales volume for a long time on top of the platform. She can sell everything from like Gucci sunglasses, lipsticks, homes and cars. One time she offered her followers to go on a Tesla ride with her and she even for once so they rocky launch in her live streaming room for 40 million yuan. The king be Li Jiaqi. I widely known as lipstick brother. He used to be a cosmetic sales before he turned into live streaming e-commerce and he knows a lot about the cosmetics. So he's the one that will actually put the lipsticks on himself when he's on the show. Top live streamers like Viya and Li Jiaqi have become celebrities in China and earn millions of dollars a year. Although not everyone can be as popular, mid-breaking live streamers like Tiffany Stewart and a good income through sales commissions. If you like it, you can buy it. A lot of successful live streamers are generally very good at communication. They're very good at articulating very simply what the product does, what the product doesn't do. In order for them to sell, they need to be trustworthy and appear trustworthy and they need to show in some ways that they're authentic. So Viya and Li Jiaqi did able to articulate that quite a bit through their body language, through what they say. For example, Li Jiaqi will always say bad things about certain products because to him there's his honest opinion and sometimes people want to hear that. And so they seem very credible, they seem very trustworthy. And don't forget, they're also very entertaining and very interesting. If you're familiar with Li Jiaqi, you want a Guinness record for the most lipstick applications to models in 30 seconds. So if you're able to create a lot of buzz, we're going to interesting things that you do. People who may not want to buy lipsticks but also streaming just to watch what he does. And then from there you might get hooked to just an e-bann or a tool to the community. Live streamers also use cell techniques such as limited time or supply. These sense of scarcity can often encourage viewers to buy. The platform in itself creates and enhances some of these things, but you see it live. Something we call social proof has taken over meaning that hey, other people are interested, other people are joining in, other people want the same product. And they add it in the chat, and they ask questions and they say, oh, I want this too. What happens then? It makes the whole product even more scarce. But it's not just influencers, local farmers, luxury brands, even mutual funds have also started their own livestream.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,550,2022-10-07 15:54:59
12325," makes the whole product even more scarce. But it's not just influencers, local farmers, luxury brands, even mutual funds have also started their own live stream shows. Working with very top tier live streamers can be risky. It's not necessary that the benefits will end up with a brand. So we see company executives opening their own shows. And we see like PNG have their own sales room which runs shows every day as well. We also have like local governments in like small towns to sell their agricultural products. So the live streaming is definitely transformed the way product owners can think about how to reach their consumers and enables a lot of players to actually sell. The live stream shopping is going global. Merchants in Southeast Asia have embraced this trend. And in the West, Amazon has upgraded its live streaming function. And interactive features like chat rooms, companies including Google and Facebook are also developing and investing in technologies to integrate video and e-commerce. In the past, the market has actually started to become a topic which has been developing for a long time and is a big deal. Next, we will be more and more content-wise. It will become a more daily and more complex way to do things. If you look at the numbers alone, their numbers alone, the GCC's numbers are obvious. You know that they can sell and you know that they can generate revenue. Are they able to sustain it over a long period of time? It depends on how you know where they are at changing some of the things that they do. But you can't expect consumers one day turn into virtual shopping for good. There will be the nature of us that crave to go into the store to touch the goods and actually wear it and see how it looks like and walk around that with our friends. And those things wouldn't be replaceable with live streaming. Imagine that the oceans are actually the largest battery. We store a huge amount of energy in the oceans. The wave of motion can be very deep. It can extend down several hundred meters. It gets to the near shore from about 50 meters. The whole water column is moving backwards and forwards. As we search for ways to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, some are looking to a largely untapped potential source of renewable energy. In theory, waves off the coast of the United States alone could generate over two trillion kilowatt hours of electricity a year enough to power more than half of the country. Waves intensify and subside not as quickly as the wind and that means that it can produce a smoother power generation curve. One of the potential advantages of wave energy is that it could act as a complementary source of power compared to other renewables on the grid if it were to be scaled up to commercial scale. For decades, engineers have been trying to convert wave energy into electricity but a host of technological and financial challenges have complicated their efforts. In the years from around 2006 to 2015, there were a space of bankruptcies in the sector and this was largely because of a lack of continuous proven projects out.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,551,2022-10-07 15:58:49
12326," In 2015, there were a space of bankruptcies in the sector, and this was largely because of a lack of kind of continuous proven projects out at sea with reliable electricity generation. Since then, companies have been trying to develop the technologies that are steady at pace and with a smaller cash burn. But the same questions remain. Can companies develop devices and technologies that actually work? Is wave energy just a novelty or something that can become a major renewable energy source? The sea is a very challenging environment within which to operate a power project. So sea water is corrosive and conditions are very rough. So this means that power projects don't have a very long lifetime and it increases operating and maintenance costs. Partly because of that, many early wave energy projects hit rough waters, such as the Pellarmus Wave Energy Converter in Portugal and the Isla Limpet Project in Scotland. But that hasn't stopped others from trying. Companies are focused on testing projects out at sea, proving their durability, trying to raise capital and bring down cost. The sector hasn't really converged around one single technology design and companies are kind of undersigned about which design works best. Finland-based AW Energy is a veteran in the sector. The first proof of concept of the company's device was made in the 90s after diver Rano Coivissari observed the strong back and forth movement of a hatch cover in a shipwreck in the Baltic Sea. The waves are generated far from the coastline, so the wind blows on the surface of the water, causing the water particles to rotate. And that rotation extends deep down below the surface and the waves can be very long. They can be several hundred meters long. And as they come into the near shore, this rotational energy turns into an elliptical energy and eventually backwards and forwards that you probably noticed if you've been swimming on the sea shore in large waves, you're pulled in and out. That's the energy that we're extracting. There's a sweet spot where we deploy. So around 10 to 15 meters of water depth, that's where there's still strong wave energy coming in. After years of research, prototyping and testing, the company has deployed Wave Roller. A 350 kilowatt device in the waters of Portugal. Wave Roller has an 80 meter wide and 10 meter high steel panel fixed to the seabed via a flotable foundation. The panel moves back and forth with the waves, capturing the energy. It's submerged in the depth of 15 meters, so it's protected from the extreme waves. We generate electricity by capturing the movement with hydraulic circuitry in a machine room underneath the surface. That hydraulic energy we turn to electricity with hydraulic accumulators and hydraulic motors and also our generator. The Wave Roller has survived large waves at sea for over a year and delivered electricity via an underwater cable to the grid in Portugal. Meanwhile, the company has won a 2.5 million euro grant to work on an upgraded version of the Wave Roller, aiming to increase the electricity generation capacity to 1 megawatt. The upscale device would have a bigger panel, 2 power takeoff units, and improved software to control the energy production. We have taken into use a very prediction algorithm that tells us what kind of waves are coming into our device. That gives us a few seconds to prepare for capturing more energy and the difference in that is significant. Our future plans are to deliver technology around the world. So I'm hoping we can be working on delivering technology to projects in Asia and also...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,552,2022-10-07 16:03:03
12327," Around the world. So I'm hoping we can be working on delivering technology to projects in Asia and also in American contents as well. Meanwhile, Israeli company EcoWavePower is taking a different approach to capturing the power of the ocean. For the company's founder, Inna Bravaman, developing new sources of renewable energy is a personal mission. I was born in Ukraine in 1996 and two weeks after I was born, the Chernobyl nuclear reactor exploded, causing the largest in history, nuclear disaster. I was one of the babies that got hurt from the negative effects of such explosion. I had a respiratory arrest and a clinical death. Luckily, my mother and nurse approached my crib on time and gave me a mouth to offer a cessitation with saved my life. I got a second chance in life and decided to do something good with it. Growing up, Inna wanted to be a politician to positively change the world. After working as a translator at a renewable energy company, she decided to change paths. Solar and wind energy were fully commercialized. There were a lot of amazing technologies implemented everywhere. I saw that wave energy, although it's an immense source of electricity, the biggest companies in the world are trying to develop wave energy with no success. And there was kind of a race going on in the world of who is the company that is going to develop a viable wave energy solution first. In 2011, the then 24-year-old Inna co-founded EcoWave Power. Instead of installing devices offshore, the company's devices are attached to existing breakwaters, jetty's and peers. Our technology is very cost-efficient, especially in comparison to the offshore technologies, because we don't need any ships, divers, underwater mooring or cables when installed on existent man-made structures. And all our expensive equipment, the generator, the hydraulic conversion unit, the automation, is located online just like a regular power station. This is the EcoWave Power conversion unit that has been operating in Jaffa Port since 2014 until 2020. Here you can see how the technology works. Basically the floaters are going up and down and pushing the hydro cylinders which transmit by the gradeable fluid into land located accumulators. A pressure is being built, the higher the waves, the higher the pressure, which is used to turn the hydro motor, which is turning the generators. The whole system is controlled by a smart automation system, which you can see right here. And in case of upcoming storms, the system automatically raises the floater above the water level and keeps them in the upward position until the storm passes. The company has been operating a 100 kilowatt grid-connected device in Gibraltar since 2016, which is enough to power 100 households. Currently, inner and her team are working on another 100 kilowatt project at the Ported Jaffa in Tel Aviv. The project will be also the first time in the history of Israel that wave energy will officially connect to the electrical grid. And our goal going forward is to expand it to all suitable breakwaters in the city of Tel Aviv and to supply a significant part of the city's electricity needs. Today, engineers and entrepreneurs are still trying to crack wave energy. Globally, only a few hundred kilowatts of wave energy are deployed, compared with gigawatts of offshore wind. But the field has come a long way in recent years, and with the right engineering solutions, this new power source could eventually become competitive with more mature renewables like solar and wind. I would have a lot more confidence in the success of wave energy companies today, as opposed to like 20 years ago. But in the next few years or maybe the next couple of decades, it will be more likely to be used in remote locations like islands that are otherwise dependent on expensive diesel power or out at sea on...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,553,2022-10-07 16:07:29
12328," that are otherwise dependent on expensive diesel power or out at sea on gas decommissioning rigs or for powering underwater autonomous vehicles. So definitely, wave energy can compete with other renewable energy sources, but I personally believe that this is not a competition. In order to have a 100% renewable energy-friendly world, we need all renewable energy sources to work together. So can you please tell me? No Maria. I'm not going to... So can you please tell me? No Maria. So can you please tell me? No Maria. Please wait. You know, I've covered a lot of companies, I've covered a lot of Machiavellian companies where you know people play rough. I don't think I've ever seen anything on the scale that Nissan has. He is making you, but you know what, what's this? I mean, you're eating chicken. One of the most dramatic elements was Rivendor Pazzi's home being raided by court officials in Yokohana. You scared me. You scared Machiavellian. I love these things. So, Rivendor Pazzi's journey into the darkest recesses of the Japanese corporate world started when he was the general council, the highest corporate lawyer position in the company. In the past few minutes, Nissan has revealed that its chairman has been arrested after allegations of serious misconduct. He was tasked with investigating Carlos Gowne. And he was told conduct an internal investigation and get to the heart of the matter. And then along the way, he started to notice serious conflicts of interest. He is one of the few people who knows an extreme amount of detail regarding the alleged crimes by Carlos Gowne. And he is now ready to tell his own story on the record about some of the events that happened. My name is Rivendor Pazzi. I am the former global general council of Nissan Motoko Limited. And you could say yes, I had a front row seat in terms of what was going on. When Carlos Gowne saved Nissan years ago, he was depicted in Japanese comic books as this hero. And now maybe we'll see.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,554,2022-10-07 16:12:21
12329," What was going on? When Carlos Gone saved Nisan years ago, he was depicted in Japanese comic books as this hero. And now maybe we'll see comic books where he's the villain. In corporate Japan, Nisan was quite an unusual company. It was led for two decades by a non-Japanese executive. Well, Carlos Gone was a hero in the Japanese business world. If you had a global business celebrity in Japan and worldwide, it was definitely Carlos Gone. In a country with few foreigners at the top, he stood out. But over the years, he saved Nisan from bankruptcy, allied with Reno and Mitsubishi, and turned the alliance into one of the most competitive in the world. Yet as the years went on, I think his ambitions changed a little bit. He started thinking about legacy plays. And one of them was to really tighten the alliance between Reno and Japan. And unbeknownst to him, there was a contingent of senior Nisan executives that were really felt threatened by that move. They really thought that they would lose complete control of the car company. And even in the government, there was probably a little bit of anxiety about a national champion in the auto industry falling under full-blown foreign control. Carlos Gone was an auto industry leader respected by many in Japan. Now he's in jail. The arrest of Carlos Gone came completely out of the blue. This was in November of 2018. He was coming to Japan on Nisan's corporate jet for a regular executive meeting. And he was met on the tarmac by Japanese authorities who whisked him away to jail and charged him with financial misconduct crimes. So what happened was a power struggle ensued inside the company. And somewhere along the way, it was criminalized. By that, I mean that there were allegations leveled at Carlos Gone about the way he reported his pay to Japanese authorities, the way he handled money inside the company that in other contexts might have been a board action, might have been handled internally. A number of executives at Nisan decided to take this difference and take it over to the Tokyo Prosecutor's office. And that unleashed a chain of events that would shake the entire auto industry. So after Carlos Gone was arrested, Nisan launched an internal investigation into the events that led up to his arrest. So Rob Passe was tasked with investigating Carlos Gone. And he was told, get to the heart of the matter. Find out what Carlos Gone did wrong and bring it to our shareholders. Yeah, it's really complicated because you had various things coming out of the weeds. 2018 investigation has started. And we become aware of matters in terms of conflicts, actions by certain individuals, that cause some concern because things might not quite be what they seem. So in our story, we really took a close look at Harry Nada and his role in Carlos Gone's downfall. Harry Nada is one of the most fascinating figures inside Nisan. He's also a lawyer. He's originally Malaysian. How do Mr. Harry? And he had a meteoric rise through the company and became very, very close to Carlos Gone and other top figures. He had a front row seat at all the major strategic deliberations at the company. And when he discovered that Carlos Gone as his final legacy play was going to tighten the relationship between Renaud and Nisan, he made a decision to go against Carlos Gone. And he became one of the key figures that decided that Carlos Gone had to go...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,555,2022-10-07 16:16:14
12330," the decision to go against Carlos Gaud. And he became one of the key figures that decided that Carlos Gaud had to go. [""Full of Love""] Harry Nader was somebody who actually recruited me into the company. So I have a longstanding relationship with him, or did have a longstanding relationship with him. But for many, many years, he was a mentor. [""Full of Love""] I had doubts about the credibility of the process right at the start. Harry Nader had a plea deal with the Tokyo prosecutors. Now, that suggests he was intrinsically involved in some of the wrongdoing, or the allegations of wrongdoing. And it just didn't smell right. It just doesn't sit right. So there was a basic conflict of interest. In other words, Harry Nader had to deliver results to Japanese prosecutors to avoid his own criminal liability, and he's accusing and leading the investigation of Carlos Gaud. Some of the people who had been involved in the original alleged crimes were also looking into the affairs themselves. Revinder Pasi began pointing out some of these conflict of interest issues. And the reason for that is essentially his concern was for the company. If the company's own investigation into itself was compromised, that could lead to a very weak position in various lawsuits that it was dealing with across the world. I had discussions with Harry, discussions about with the statutory auditors about these conflicts, discussions with HR about some of these conflicts. Because at that point, we reported into him. At the time, everything was quite, as you can imagine, it was, we've got to do this, we've got to do that, we've got to move fast. But when you step back and look at some of these things, you just think, my God, what was going on here? Because me, members of my team, were being placed in immediate danger. Your chairman's been arrested. A representative director's been arrested. They both happened to be foreigners. And then now what we need to do, we're being instructed to do, is certain compliance professionals need to go into properties in Brazil, for example, and retrieve evidence. They've got to do it very carefully, because if they don't do it carefully, they're going to get convicted of criminal activities. And likewise, when a team of lawyers were commissioned to go to Lebanon, I mean, one of my immediate concerns was, why are lawyers from Nissan being sent to go to Lebanon to retrieve evidence? These are just lawyers, they're corporate lawyers, from Nissan. You had revelations that a number of executives had benefited from share appreciation rights, when they shouldn't have. I mean, substantive amounts of money been taken by these guys when they weren't entitled to take. And you do think, yes, that was this going to look later on. It's going to look quite concerning. So that triggered, for me, the sort of assessment that, well, I'm going to have to do something, because up until this point, I haven't put down on paper these conflicts and these issues. Andнь, thank you for those questions in that way, we invite VM402 to watch out for the great news about this going to help as well. To start with, I wanna break the lights.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,556,2022-10-07 16:20:58
12331," So Rob Posse makes a fateful move. He writes this letter to the board, listing every suspicion he has in great detail, backed up by evidence backed up by memos of why this internal investigation had serious problems. He sends a letter to the board and it's crickets. He doesn't hear much of anything. Nothing happened that often. Nothing at all. Just like it just got into a black box. And he began to suspect that there was a desire even at the highest level within Nissan to kind of sweep these conflicts of interest under the rug. Unfortunately for me, I think, again with hindsight, people must have thought that this is the nail that's sticking out and we can't have this. Within three days of me submitting that to the board of directors, that letter to the independent board of directors, I was removed from the go-and-executive conduct matters. I was then told that I could not attend board meetings anymore. And up until that point, I had attended every single board meeting. I was then also told that after eight years of being in Japan, I'd be going back to the UK. It eventually transpired that I'd be the VP of projects and transformation, managing a team of three. So you can imagine what this feels like at this stage, almost an arbitrary removal from Japan where I've lived for eight years, had three children there. My family has grown up and we've been settled there. Having a few months earlier been promoted to vice president at a global level to being almost demoted. So Pasi was essentially being reassigned to get him as far away from the internal investigation as possible and also to a certain extent in retaliation to some of the issues that he brought up regarding the internal investigation and harinata. What happened to Rob Pasi can be seen as a series of corporate humiliations. I mean, first of all, his immediate responsibilities were taken away from him. Eventually, he'd lost the coveted general council title. But it didn't stop there. Toward the end of his stay in Japan, Rob and his wife were convinced that they were being followed. During that period, I'd noticed that whilst driving my car, I'd have other cars following me. First I noticed this was around mid-March and I was driving. I can't remember where I was going, but this grave van, small van just literally started following me. And I noticed that there was somebody in the car taking pictures. And lo and behold, we were absolutely being followed by either by people on foot or other individuals, two or three, normally two burly men in a car, different cars at different times following us around. They were following the family as well. And given we'd seen, right seen, the Nissan Security Department behaving a very, very egregious manner with others in terms of following and surveilling, I was very concerned as to what they were doing and who they were giving this information to. Because if they're giving this information to the authorities, you do think, why? What's going on there? I mean, this is just not normal behavior. And this all culminated in a rather dramatic event in the middle of 2020. Who are you people where Nissan had hired a leader?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,557,2022-10-07 16:24:49
12332," where Nissan had hired a legal team and had obtained an unusual court order from the District Court in Yokohama. To basically do a search and of his home and seizure of his corporate laptop and phone and other documents. If you don't let us in now, we have to break this key. So it's a pretty extreme way to treat someone who had spent 16 years at the company. These people have all come in. We don't really know who they are, apart from the fact that I've been shown a badge that says the Yokohama Court. And they hit to recover a laptop and a mobile phone. It was even more weird because I'd highlighted to the directors that there, that certain Nissan executives were trying to recover this laptop and this phone whilst I was still in Japan. And I was very concerned because it had evidence on there that related to misconduct matters and other forms of inappropriate conduct. It was just another form of intimidation, another form of harassment, forcing me almost to leave the company and the country. Because once they'd retained and obtained these items, we were still followed. Which again, I just couldn't understand what is the point of doing that. You know, this isn't a car company, this is not the KGB. I think it's fair to say that Rob Posse didn't have full battlefield awareness of all the intrigue going on at Nissan. I mean, Harry Nata is interesting because he's both charismatic and charming and one of the most brutal corporate infighters one could ever run across. It's a confidential company email, right? You should not have this. If he had fallen into line, he would probably still have his job at Nissan, be paid very well and continue to his work. A career that he spent, you know, 16 years building at Nissan is irretrievably broken. It's been smashed to smithereens. He and his family paid a huge price certainly, but in terms of being able to sleep at night, I think, you know, he's come out ahead. I highlighted issues to the highest levels of the company so that they could be dealt with appropriately by those in charge. There was no response to those and there was retaliation against me. What's really profound, like absolutely profound, is that none of your colleagues, I mean, people who you have known for years, forget it, you're on your own. And yeah, you've got to be ready for that. If you take it on anyway.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,558,2022-10-07 16:29:14
12333," This is the awful truth. There's always someone in the family that's pushing it. This lady does not deserve to be taken advantage of. Expressionally, at your age with your own grandchild. My grandma is having to sue them. I'm testifying against them. Nobody's talking. They're one floor below right now. I get afraid to go on the elevator. It's sad that it had to devolve to this. It's like a soap opera to me. It's a very sad thing. It's a family feud. A family feud. Here's a family that, on paper, you would think, has the wealth that so many people seek yet. At the end of the day, it's seen to rip everybody apart. My name's Tom Schoenberg. I'm a senior reporter here at Bloomberg News. Cover financial enforcement. I was approached by someone close to the Shottenstein family and asked whether or not I would be interested in writing about Beverly Shottenstein in this case that she had against JP Morgan. And it was immediately clear that there was a great story here to be told. So I started just assembling all sorts of documents that the family made available to me. They included a diary that Beverly had begun writing when she started having suspicions about what was actually going on with her money. Beverly obtained her wealth from the Shottenstein kind of retail empire that has, at times, included big lots, value city, American eagle outfitters, DSW shoes. Beverly's husband died, and at which point they sold off their portion of the company, bringing them an enormous amount of wealth in around 1990. Estimates of her wealth were around $90 million. She, for many years, had that pool of money being managed by outside advisors. Her grandsons in the late 2000s had both graduated and were becoming financial advisors. She gave them a little bit to work with, and over time, her grandson Evan became the trusty of her entire state. Managing sort of family money is not a conflict. In fact, some ways in wealth management, it's kind of how you get your start. It's kind of the seed that you need to sort of get going in the business. But Beverly started having suspicions that something was wrong probably in around 2016. Well, there were suspicious things, but taken separately without everyone talking about their own experiences, it was hard to really put it together. She had written a check to her caretaker Dawn that bounced. So she went down to her local chase branch to sort of find out what was going on. She wasn't getting paper statements in the mail, so she asked them to print out a number of her statements having to do with her checking account and her credit card account. So we went to the bank and asked for the statements, and she got a whole year and going through all of them, page by page by page. And it was there. She saw all sorts of charges that she said she did not the riser didn't know about. I was becoming.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,559,2022-10-07 16:33:31
12334," I fell off the page by page by page. And it was there. She saw all sorts of charges that she said she did not the riser didn't know about. I was becoming very, very suspicious. I was starting to look in the money part. And that's what bothered me more when I saw that money was going. And I was not a big spender. Around the same time, Dawn, she starts noticing Beverly's son, who lived in the condominium below her, came up with Evan, with a shredder, and started grabbing papers in her office area, including some with JP Morgan Letterhead. And just started sitting at the kitchen table, just shredding documents over and over. Yeah, they came in one morning. They used to do it the back. Through the back door. And they brought this shredder inside. And then they went in the drawers in the office and took out all the papers. And they started to do it. I was very suspicious because I know you don't go around and get in destroying papers. Beverly said that they had done this many times before. That's when she said to me, you know, Dawn, I'm going to write my feelings in this black book. Diary. And it's a diary. And she started writing. Each day, she would write a little at a time. We run the holidays of 2018. The package had arrived. The FedEx package. And in it were materials about a venture capital fund based out of the Cayman Islands. Dawn and some other family members take a look at this. And they see that Beverly is signed up for this fund to the tune of $5 million over the course of several years. And that was really the beginning of it. That was sort of the tip of the iceberg when it became obvious that something was going on that my grandmother really wasn't aware of this fund. You know, Beverly started to panic. She was got really upset and called, you know, JP Morgan's headquarters in New York and asked for Jamie Diamond. She said she was told someone would call her back. But she says that that never happened. She wrote a letter to Evan and Avi. And in there, she laid out a number of things that were concerning her on authorized trading, the checking account she had about a million dollars worth of jewelry in a safe deposit box. And that her son Bobby had the key to that box. And that jewelry had gone missing. All this was kind of packaged in this, you know, five page handwritten of Memantil Will and Trust. They're such an evolving narrative about why the jewelry was taken. The only truth we really know is that the jewelry is gone. But why it happened? There have been a lot of different stories. You just don't take your mother's wonderful things and hand it out. And they email that note to JP Morgan to seize all activity on her account. And it ended up setting off a fire storm after that. As soon as they got this email that there was a season to assist and that she wanted to send her money and change brokerage firms, they were actually vacationing one floor below downstairs through there right now. The next day, Beverly's in her place, a granddaughter still in her place visiting. Donna's there and up comes Bobby kind of barging through the door. And he's screaming about what was sent to the JP Morgan. They're now investigating them. And he's furious, takes his mother and sort of puts her into a chair, gets pen and paper. And she says physically forced her to write a retraction letter. They were pushing me around. It was a scary time. I was really afraid too. I had to take her to the doctor. And she did an x-ray because she was in so much pain. The locks had to be changed. The phone number had to be changed. I really thought we were going to have to hire guards to be outside just for protection. Oh, it was terrible. Terrible scene. Beverly brought her case before the financial industry regulatory authorities, usually known as Finra. It took several months' hearings. She sees all sorts of transactions that's going on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,560,2022-10-07 16:38:12
12335," Several months of hearings, she sees all sorts of transactions that's going on. Hundreds of them that she claims that she never knew about, never authorized. But yet we're logged to JP Morgan's files as having been direct requests from her. That included the sale of a large amount of Apple stock worth several million dollars as well as all her stock in big lots. You know, over the course of their time with JP Morgan, Evan and Avi were making all sorts of trading on her account that was generating millions of dollars in commissions for themselves in the bank. Yet she was not sort of getting any of the type of gains that you would expect. Sort of an 80 million dollar account in a bullish market to be able to get. They issued a ruling entirely in her favor finding that her grandson's as well as JP Morgan. They were liable for violating their fiduciary duty, misrepresenting themselves. And they also found that the bank and her grandson, Evan, reliable for elder abuse. Evan and Avi, they were fired from JP Morgan. They issued an award of about 19 million dollars. I reached out for comment and JP Morgan emphasized that Evan and Avi were no longer with the firm and that their actions do not represent the sort of values of the bank. I reached out to Evan and Avi, heard back from their lawyer saying that they disagree with the law and the facts that Finra kind of used to decide the case against them and are seeing if they can have it withdrawn. Her son, Bobby, wrote her a letter. Said his sons weren't criminals and he also admits to taking her jewelry. And he says he needed it to pay off some bad business debts he had. They never once came up to say, I'm sorry. If there had been an apology and some acceptance and asking for forgiveness from my grandmother, I don't think we'd be in the position that we are now. Since the piece came out, we've received dozens of messages from people, many of whom are telling their own sort of personal tales of financial advisors gone bad or family members who got control of in a state and abused those within. Seems that it's really resonated with a lot of people. I keep hearing a lot of feedback about Beverly and how a lot of people feel she did the right thing. You're never too old to stand up for yourself and try to write an injustice. She was adamant that she wanted to stand up for herself. At the end of the day, they did wrong. It's a painful life lesson. You know, Beverly taught them that you don't mess with grandma. On April 20th, oil markets did something they never had before and they crashed, and they were in a state of emergency. The price of oil has collapsed to a record low. We've never really seen anything like it. WTI this morning down more than 35%. People maybe wouldn't have been so surprised if the oil price had fallen to zero. The price went to minus 38. It went far lower than anyone had expected. And so lots of people in the market were saying, well hang on, something else is going on here. A couple of months later, I started to get wind through a network of sources that are a tiny firm.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,561,2022-10-07 16:42:19
12336," Hang on, something else is going on here. A couple of months later, I started to get wind through a kind of network of sources that a tiny firm in the outskirts of London had made a huge amount of money that day and potentially had some parts to play in what happened. The information we got was that nine traders at Vega Capital London had made in the region of $660 million in one day. As a group, I think they made as much money in one day as Apple makes from its international sales in one day. I mean, it's an insane sum of money. Did they pull off a fantastic trade? Did they predict the way the market was moving and get it absolutely right? Or was there something else going on and had they actually done something that breached market rules in a bid to push the market? And that investigation is ongoing. So Paul Cummins is a trader who cut his teeth in the pits in the 80s and 90s when everyone had a nickname, his was Cuddles. If you can imagine that was a very sort of cut throat type of world where people are doing hundreds of thousands and millions of dollar trades by shouting at each other, giving hand signals and then sort of scrolling on scraps of paper. The culture of the trading pits in London was very influenced by the working class guys who became traders there. They weren't like the city bankers that had gone before them. They weren't usually Oxford or Cambridge. They didn't wear several rose suits. They were ordinary working guys who happened to have a talent for trading. And a lot of them came from Essex. I think it was 400 traders in the pits and Cuddles in his oil and gas pit was described to us as amongst the top three in amongst that. It was very successful and made very large amounts of money as a young man. But inevitably mechanisation and the arrival of electronic markets was the kind of death knell for the pits. And in 2005 the IPE closed down. And when the pits shut down, a lot of the traders who worked there lost their jobs or quits or went to work for financial institutions pull commons decided to start his own trading collective out in Essex. Some of them are ex-pick guys, cut from the same cloth as him. Lots of them are actually sort of in their 20s. And they're, you know, drinking buddies, son. Or their own kids, friends from football. You know, their young lads, hungry and ambitious. And he brings them into the fold. And fairly shortly he's got, you know, maybe a dozen or so traders. They're independent. Let's be clear. But they're all part of this collective. Yeah, I'll let Liam do with Essex. I am from Essex. So I feel like I'm free to, you know, to get into this. Sweet as they say. If you were to ask someone in Britain how they would imagine a kind of Essex person, they would see someone who's maybe slightly flamboyant with a sort of cockney accent, a sort of guy which he start accent. You know, not afraid to splash the cash, but it's probably pretty bright and has done well for themselves. Don't even make sense, does he? But, you know, these guys, they drove around very nice rolls, roises and bent leaves. They went to places like Marbaea on holiday. Fade and boys is a very wealthy place. You have to have considerable income to be able to afford to live in that village. It's a really nice place to live, and it's 20 minutes to Cheebride away from the city. Earlier in the summer, we have this lead, which is that there's this tiny firm called Vega Capital London, and they were the biggest winners from the biggest oil crash in history. You know, anyone that covers markets, it's going to be surprised about that. You know, you're thinking your BP's of the world, your Glencores, but there's this tiny firm. And one of the big challenges that we had was actually finding out who worked with Vega Capital. It wasn't immediately obvious, and at first we had absolutely no idea. If you go to the Vega...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,562,2022-10-07 16:46:53
12337," But is this tiny firm? And one of the big challenges that we had was actually finding out who worked with Vega Capital. It wasn't immediately obvious, and at first we had absolutely no idea. If you go to the Vega Capital website, it says it's under construction. If you do basic online searching, it's very difficult to find anyone who's publicly connected to the company. So inevitably we're incredibly curious at this point. Like, who the hell are these people? The more reporting we did, the more it became clear that this group were connected socially as well as professionally. They went to weddings together, they played golf together, they would go and holiday together. We found out that a number of them were members of the West Ham Supporters Club in London. A few of them started companies together, so you could see all the connections between them and start to see a distinct group emerging. And it really just was this kind of shock that, you know, this wasn't just like a hedge fund or a firm you'd never heard of. This was actually a group of buddies who all had the same experience on this day, and it had all made a huge amount of money. So if you're an oil trader, there's a number of different ways you can trade. And probably the most popular is WTI futures contracts. And it's basically a contract that says, I'm going to buy a thousand barrels of oil from you at this point in the future. Or I'm going to sell a thousand barrels of oil to you at this point in the future. It's actually just a financial contract to gamble on, to predict where the oil was going to go up or down. On the 20th of April in Essex, there had been signals for a while that this was going to be an exceptional day in oil markets. And we know that some of them arose early and started their trading in the early hours of the morning while it was still dark outside. Essentially what they were doing is buying contracts that gave them an obligation to buy oil at whatever the price ended up at 230 p.m. So they're basically placing a bet that oil was going to fall throughout the day. But they're simultaneously between what they buy the oil for and what they sell the oil for. Now of course we now know throughout April 20th the price dropped and dropped. So this is going very well for them. You know they are committed to selling oil at these prices and the prices are continuing to fall which means they're going to be able to offset it and buy oil at cheaper at the end of the day. Now once it gets to kind of 130 to p.m. that's when things start to get really interesting. Suddenly there's a kind of influx of buyers and sellers. You know as desperation increases in the market and trading volumes go up. Now at 208 p.m. exactly something bizarre and unprecedented happened which is the oil passes into negative territory. And it fell to a record level of minus 38 dollars. We've never seen anything like a period in terms of the contraction of the global economy. That huge gulf between what they were buying the oil for and what they were selling it for enabled them to make more money than they ever thought possible. So their profit was the difference between minus 37 and all of these positive numbers on every contract they sold. The price of crude briefly hit minus 37 dollars a barrel. For one group of traders operating from a small office it was a very very profitable day. It's important to remember this had never happened before in the history of oil trading. No one could have predicted it. I can't think of another example of where you enter a trader, you get paid on both sides. You get paid both to sell and to buy. You know it's unthinkable. One thing we know about the cuddles trading arcade is that they were very comfortable taking large risks and you know you have to be clear this was a large risk. Yeah we spoke to oil traders, both people that know these guys and people that don't and they all say that this is you know incredibly risky. And that's actually what stops a lot of oil traders doing trading like this. They simply aren't willing to stomach the risk but cuddles in his friends work. So when the kind of final calculations came down the group of the nine most profitable traders made $660 million or thereabouts between them. I mean if you can imagine I think three or four of them made in excess of a hundred million each. One of the astonishing things about this trade is that two of the individuals who made more than a hundred million dollars in a single day were in their 20s. One of them was 22 years old. You know in a few years earlier he'd been posting on his...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,563,2022-10-07 16:51:17
12338," Is that two of the individuals who made more than $100 million in a single day were in their 20s. One of them was 22 years old. You know, a few years earlier, he'd been posting on his social media about doing teenage stuff with his mates in town and going to see girls and rap music. And here he is a few years later making $100 million in a single day's trading. When me and Liam discovered that, we couldn't believe it. We couldn't believe what we were seeing. All trading is a zero-sum game. Anytime you're making money, it's an all-trade that someone else is losing it. Amongst the biggest losers were the investors in this Chinese fund, crude oil treasure fund. There were thousands of them and they lost everything. Lots of people have put their savings into oil funds. They lost money that day, big banks and brokers who sort of stand in the middle of trading parties. They lost money that day. And another interesting thing is the oil producing countries like Q8 or Canada, they sell oil as an average of the WTI closing price over the preceding month. So the fact that one of those numbers in that average was minus 37, men, if you can imagine, countries like Saudi Arabia and Q8 potentially lost a couple of dollars on every single barrel of oil they sold that month. Vega Capital's traders made such an extraordinary sum of money that it was inevitable they would be some scrutiny of what they did. But it wasn't just the sums of money they made. In the vital half an hour before the settlement price was set, they were by far the biggest sellers of oil futures in the market, which is an incredible thing to think about. When you consider that the other participants in that oil market are going to be the world's biggest banks, oil majors, BP and Shell. And here you have a group of nine guys in Essex who are having this significant influence over a global market for oil. I mean, I think you have to assume that if these guys have made seven million or ten million dollars, they probably would be celebrating in Essex right now. But the fact that they made closer to 700 million has meant that they are facing understandable scrutiny. We wrote individually to all the Vega traders who did exceptionally well that day. And we got a letter in response from a law firm representing the group. The law firm was at pains to point out, number one, that they haven't been accused of any wrong doing, that they all traded independently and separately. And they basically all made up their own mind that this was what was going to happen in oil markets based on publicly available knowledge and decided to execute this trade. What I love about these stories is there's a real variance of opinion. And some people will look at what happened and think that must be dodgy. They all traded at the end of the day. They all made a huge amount of money while all these people lost. That's shocking. But lots of people say these guys are at acute disadvantage. They're in a market that's inhabited by huge technology driven funds and firms and oil giants that have got all the advantages in the world. And when you get a bunch of Essex geysers who essentially beat the market and find a way to make a huge amount of money, they should get a pat on the back really because that's the dream. Since this happened, a lot of the guys have stopped trading the monthly settlements that they've done so well out in the past. Several of them have set up new companies. They've essentially gone very quiet. Any kind of social media presence they had is has kind of closed down. By all accounts there, you know, waiting this out. It's certainly too early to try and predict how the regulatory investigations are going to pan out. You know, we just don't know. There's a number of potential outcomes for these guys. You know, potential punishments if there are any findings of manipulation against Vega or anyone affiliated with it might be, you could be fine. You could be banned from trading. And, you know, in most extreme cases there have even been criminal prosecutions in the past of people who have been found to have been manipulating the settlement and misconduct related to trade settlement. There are other outcomes too. You know, one obvious one is going to be they're able to walk away from this life-changing trade with all the money that they made and celebrate it as heroes in the trading community that, you know, they'll go down as legends.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,564,2022-10-07 16:55:30
12339," With all the money that they made and celebrated as heroes in the trading community that they'll go down as legends. It's very important given the nature of the climate crisis right now for the general public to have an understand. They'll look to have an understanding of what progress is or is not actually happening. I think many readers right now see these hundreds and hundreds of companies making these big bold climate claims. They would be forgiven to think that we're well on our way to meeting the emission reduction trajectory we need to be on. And the reality of the matter is we're just not on that trajectory. And a key reason for this sort of disconnect is the use of offsets that aren't doing what they claim to be doing. We have a massive potential for sort of willful blindness. We can convince ourselves of things regardless of what the facts are. And so that's what tends to happen in these cases. It's not that anybody is setting out to commit climate fraud. They sort of walk themselves into a situation and they convince themselves of one thing and that allows them to convince themselves of another thing. But at the end of the day, they're doing something that makes no sense at all. My name is Ben Elgin. I wrote the story about how the billion dollar market for carbon offsets is setting back the fight against climate change. So one of the challenges in reporting on carbon offsets and trying to figure out what's going on is really finding good experts who have been steeped in this marketplace and are willing to candidly talk about it. One of the best people for this is a fellow named Mark Trexler. And I've been talking to him for more than a decade. My name is Mark Trexler. I've worked in climate change for the last 30 years. I was actually hired by the World Resources Institute in Washington to work on the first carbon offset project in 1988. In terms of defining a carbon offset that one of the beauties, so to speak, of greenhouse gases, sort of the silver lining of greenhouse gases. So when you put up a molecule of CO2 into the atmosphere, it can be anywhere in the planet in seven days. And therefore, if there's an option to reduce emissions on the other side of the planet, and you can do that very cheaply as compared to doing it in your factory, for example, then why not pay that person that factory on the other side of the planet to reduce their emissions. And then you are in a sense offsetting your emissions. And the atmosphere doesn't really see your emissions anymore. So carbon offsets have been around for quite some time. And they were actually key with these international climate agreements, such as the Kyoto Protocol, which mandated the wealthiest countries, reduced their greenhouse gas emissions. The trade was signed on the 11th of December 1997. The business community in general saw carbon offsets as a huge opportunity to comply with whatever policies and measures might be coming down the pike on climate change much more cost effectively. We've seen a huge surge in companies making big proclamations about how they're going carbon neutral or zeroing out all of their carbon emissions. We're going to reduce our carbon footprint to net zero. We're going to reduce our carbon emissions to net zero emissions.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,565,2022-10-07 16:59:36
12340," or zeroing out all of their carbon emissions. We're going to reduce our carbon footprint to net zero. Unilever is committing to net zero emissions. We can achieve a net zero emissions world. We began looking at these corporate claims of dramatically reduced emissions. And we noticed so many of these companies were using carbon offsets to achieve these aims. And as we began to look at the carbon offset projects themselves, what we found is that the environmental benefits claimed by these companies are not actually what they seem to be. And as we sort of saw and spotted a number of these very aggressive carbon offset projects which appeared to be generating inflated credits or bogus credits, we saw a number of them were associated with the Nature Conservancy. This surprised us. The Nature Conservancy is the world's biggest environmental group. They have about a billion dollars a year in revenues. And they've been around for seven decades. They've preserved about 125 million acres of land. And they've done so many good works over the years. And they've been very strong in terms of working with corporate partners. The Nature Conservancy has taken a different approach, a very pragmatic and pro-business approach. They will not go out and criticize a big polluter. But they're very happy to work with them. Some might say that, well, that's selling out. But others would say, and those at the Nature Conservancy would say, these companies have deep pockets. They can help fund important preservation work. And we have absolutely no problem working with them on this stuff. So, companies are very warm and they've partnered with the Nature Conservancy for many years. And yeah, it definitely lends a sheen of credibility to these projects. Here's 20 Nuries, this is the business world this year. One, two, three, four. If you look at, for instance, Disney. It's a sprawling company with theme parks and cruise lines that burn up diesel fuel. They have office buildings and television studios that consume electricity. So, these companies are trying to make major, major reductions in their carbon footprints, but it's very difficult to change these fundamental ways their businesses operate. So, Disney has been a big buyer of carbon offsets that are orchestrated by the Nature Conservancy. One of the projects that they buy from is called Pennsylvania Riges. And that's a plot of land. Most of the land is actually about a three-hour drive outside of Philadelphia. Interestingly, this land, 3,000 of these acres, was actually acquired by the Nature Conservancy in the late 1990s. This land was eminently threatened. There was a pending logging contract on this land. So, they do what they have done so well for all of these years, which is they go out. They raise money from local philanthropists, and they go buy this land to protect it from developers and loggers. And at the time, according to an archive version of the Nature Conservancy's website, when they were proudly announcing this deal, they said, these threats have been abated because of this acquisition by the Nature Conservancy. So, it's really interesting now, fast forward two decades to earlier this year when they put forward this carbon project. And if you look through it, this land is a key part of that carbon project. And what they're now saying is, this land is now, once again, eminently threatened. 72% of the trees are going to be cut within five years. Now, this is just astounding because this land is owned by the Nature Conservancy. They do not clear-cut land that they've bought through philanthropic donations. So, this scenario that they've put forward to get carbon revenues is not really plausible. And what that means is when you have Disney coming in and buying these credits, when it eventually lowers its carbon footprint because of these credits, well, that won't be a credible or truthful claim by Disney. So, let's see.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,566,2022-10-07 17:04:07
12341," Because of these credits, well that won't be a credible or truthful claim by Disney. So this is an organization that truly understands the threat of the issue of climate change and is wanting to do its part to address this. However, in this situation, it just appears their drive, which they've had for decades, to increase the amount of revenues that it can use for land preservation work. Nature Conservancy and many others see that carbon credits as a part of money that they can tap into to further their own benevolent aims. But unfortunately, what this has resulted in is claims of climate progress that just aren't really happening. So the Nature Conservancy defends vigorously these deals and they and others will say, look, our projects are just following the rules that these registries set up. So somewhat also put some of the blame on the registries themselves because they're setting up the rules which allow these vapid projects to get up and sold. So we've reached out to all of the companies we mentioned in this story, including Disney, they didn't want to be interviewed for this story. But they all told us that, look, we have to rely on the experts out there and those experts, they say, are these carbon registries that have been set up. Most of these nature Conservancy deals are set up and sold on this exchange, it's called the American Carbon Registry. Now it's the oldest of these registries that allow voluntary carbon credits to be sold. They've been around since 1996. What these offset registries do is they set up rules and any carbon offset project has to follow those rules. But there's this tension that's always there. If the rules are too strict, then it's going to be very hard for carbon offset projects to get up and running. So there's this balance going on where the registries want rules that attract projects. But they don't want it to be so strict where it will disincentivize projects from getting listed. One of the challenges with designing carbon offset systems is that there are normally two people at the table. You have buyers and you have sellers. And to some extent, you have policy makers, but the buyers and the sellers are really the ones with the expertise, with the incentive to really participate hard, make a lot of things happen. And the challenge there is is that both of them sort of want the same thing, or they're both happy with the same thing. They're happy with low cost offsets and a lot of them, because that works for their business model. You end up, though, with nobody really representing the atmosphere, so to speak, nobody's really representing the climate in those discussions. And so the policies end up by useing the whole system. And you end up in sort of a race to the bottom. And that's what we've seen happen. And so, when you come specifically to the topic of carbon offsets, I am a fan of carbon offsets in the sense that they can help mitigate climate change. They absolutely can. But, you know, if we're not going to do it correctly, in a way that actually does help mitigate climate change, then it's nothing but a distraction. And, you know, after 30 years, you have to start wondering, is it really just a distraction? And that's really unfortunate, but that's where we are. Ultimately, what needs to be, what needs to happen is systemic change. You know, we're sort of nibbling around the edges with some of these different things. We need to change how we produce energy. We need to change how we transport ourselves. We need to change what and how we eat. You know, we need systemic change associated with transitioning to a low carbon economy. A lot of what we're doing today is not promoting systemic change. It's sort of trying to stick your thumb in the dike to preserve the current system. And, at the end of the day, that...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,567,2022-10-07 17:08:25
12342," to preserve the current system and at the end of the day that can't really work. The Hyperloop. There's a good chance you've heard the name by now. This is the Hyperloop system. It can take people hundreds of miles in minutes. The Hyperloop is a series of tubes that would transport people in pods at ultra high speeds over long distances. This is a remarkable new form of transportation that can whisk people from city to city in a flash. 29 minutes from New York to DC, 30 minutes from LA to San Francisco. For years we've been seeing these futuristic utopian renderings of some cross between a spaceship and a monorail. But lately the Hyperloop is becoming much more real. It was surreal to be sitting inside a Hyperloop and just even more incredible to actually be riding down a track in something that was nothing more than a crazy idea six years before. Companies all around the world have been developing and testing the technology needed to propel passengers at speeds of over 1000 kilometers per hour. But for many, speed is only the first step to unlocking the full transformational effects of a new mode of transportation. Fast is what we just sort of take for granted in the Hyperloop world. It's the network effects that really deliver the benefit and that opens up a completely different scale of economic opportunity. We've got planes, trains, automobiles and boats. We're getting around Earth. But what if there was a fifth mode? And I have a name for it, name for it which is called the Hyperloop. The Hyperloop? Hyperloop, yeah. In 2013 while riding high on the growing success of Tesla and SpaceX, entrepreneur Elon Musk released a white paper outlining the basic framework of the technology he called Hyperloop. The basic idea goes a little something like this. A tube reduces the air pressure to a near vacuum like environment. A Hyperloop pod is then suspended in the tube, usually by magnetic levitation. The whole pod can then be propelled forward. Because there's no traditional friction sources like air resistance or rolling friction that would push back against the pod, the Hyperloop is able to move at incredibly high speeds and do so fairly efficiently. Despite its futuristic name however, the general concept behind Hyperloop is actually pretty old. In fact, New York City's first attempt at an underground public transit system in the 1870s was based on a similar principle. The pneumatic transit system was short lived however, only stretching one block and topping out at a rather leisurely 10 miles per hour. While Elon would make some 21st century improvements to this concept and bestow a very 21st century name, he wouldn't end up pursuing the technology itself, instead electing to focus his efforts on something a little bit deeper. Literally digging the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,568,2022-10-07 17:12:40
12343," name. He wouldn't end up pursuing the technology itself, instead electing to focus his efforts on something a little bit deeper, literally digging the requisite tunnels by a his boring company. It would take another billionaire industrialist who dabbles in spaceflight. No, wait, not that one. Yeah, that's the one. After Richard Branson would make a large investment in the company Hyperloop 1, it would be renamed to Virgin Hyperloop. What we've always been trying to do as a company is show that this technology could work, that it could be made safe, and that ultimately it's something that's happening in the next couple of years, not the next 20 years. Josh Geigel is the co-founder and CEO of Virgin Hyperloop. In a familiar tech startup story, he's seen the project go from a garage to a large-scale testing facility outside of Las Vegas. So we started building the first kind of Hyperloop system in 2016. We've done a lot of work, about a 500 test that we've done on that over the last five years. And what we realize that we need to do is take that technology, show that it can be commercial, so drive the cost down, improve the efficiency, improve the performance. But the key thing is, you know, is actually making it approachable and safe for individuals. In order to do that, Josh, along with Virgin's head of passenger experience, Saralucian, bravely volunteer to take the inaugural ride. What her and I were realizing is like, we're the first two people sitting in a Hyperloop. The only type of people that have gone through this environment are in spaces, and there we are in just like normal clothes, because of the system, the safety of what we designed. Three, two, one, launch. And then once we started going, you felt a bit of acceleration. We accelerated a little bit harder than we would in commercial, be like a sports car. Yeah, we got about 108 miles an hour on that test. And it's a short run. It's about 500 yards or so, and came to a stop. The test lasting only about 20 seconds and covering only a quarter of a mile at just over 100 miles per hour is a long way away from a true functioning Hyperloop. But as for optics, it's a crucial step for the future of funding. The number one question we got from investors or from project proponents or just people in general was like, is a Hyperloop safe? And what better way to show something is safe than by actually getting people on it? But convincing investors and governments that would likely be fronting some of the construction costs for an unproven technology is no easy task. First and foremost is the question of safety. Most people don't know how an airplane works, but yet they get on an airplane. They get on an airplane because it's faster than driving. And most importantly, they've probably gotten off of one before. They've seen someone get off of one before. And so what we set out to do was actually show that Hyperloop could be safe. With two normal people, not astronauts, not adrenaline junkies or test pilots or anything like that, two normal people getting on a Hyperloop. And then most importantly, those two people getting off. But beyond safety concerns, constructing Hyperlupes will undoubtedly require a significant capital investment to the estimated tune of around $60 million US dollars per kilometer of track. So a track from San Francisco to Los Angeles, for example, is likely to come with a price tag over $10 billion. And before large governments are willing to come in in front of those costs, investors who are funding Hyperloop development must accept it as a long-term mixture of technology and infrastructure investing. Investors that are used to short returns because you're developing apps or something to that effect. Those aren't the investors that really get excited about Hyperloop. What you start to see is the people that are looking at platform technologies. So this idea that because this smartphone existed, Uber could exist. So who are the Vanderbilts of this century? And that's the part where you're going to get a lot more nose than yeses. But those people that have the ability, the fortitude to stick it out to see the game-changing platform here. Those are the people that we're looking for. And since we've done that passenger test, there has been a lot of interest that's really, oh, this is a lot sooner than I thought.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,569,2022-10-07 17:17:17
12344," After a few days, Fzelf and other appointments, we decided to go hiking in Hes eigentengernauts ourselves! Also, we visited Malaysia at Happy Tag Gallery, feels like it was late. Invisiting the ripple effects of what Hyperloop could achieve, though, is fairly challenging at this stage of development. It's fast, yes, but for point-to-point travel traditional maglev trains can move pretty fast as well. And outside of China, South Korea and Japan, even those haven't seen much adoption elsewhere due to the high costs and questionable profitability. The Shanghai line in China, for example, loses around $100 million every year. Hyperloop companies, however, believe they can offer something different than traditional railway lines. My name's Alan James, and as far as I know, I'm the only guy on the planet who's written the government-level business case for 300 kmH conventional high-speed rail, 500 kmH maglev and 1000 kmH Hyperloop. It's fundamentally about moving people from where they are, to where they want to go, when they want to make those journeys, and doing it in much smaller numbers. So pod designs for Hyperloop range from 12 to 28 seats, typically. Why are they small? It's because small enables the network to operate flexibly. And a great example of that is the East West strategic route across the north of England, from Liverpool to Manchester to Leeds. So to get from Liverpool via Manchester to Leeds by train is just short of two hours today. It'll probably take you two hours driving as well in average traffic conditions. That result is those three city regions remain three separate entities. Liverpool Manchester Leeds, there's very little commuting traffic between those urban areas. The whole loop absolutely changes that from the ground up. Liverpool to Manchester is a five or six minute journey. Manchester to Leeds is also a five or six minute journey. What effectively does is create a single super city economy. In this vision, the Hyperloop acts a little more like a highway, where pods have fixed destinations and don't need to stop along the way. You can travel on a Hyperloop network from say Liverpool to Leeds, while the pod behind you travels from Liverpool to Manchester. And if that Metro Hyperloop network is connected to other networks from the same location, you can travel from Liverpool to Paris or Liverpool to Amsterdam, all without making a single stop. For passengers, for business, for leisure, that is utterly transformational. For high-value freight and logistics, it's equally transformation. But critically, if you do a Hyperloop network at scale, you begin to deliver massively significant carbon savings to it. A multi-regional Hyperloop network could become a replacement for both short haul passenger and cargo flights and traditional ground transportation, both of which are significant carbon producers. One Hyperloop-connected distribution hub, perhaps at an airport that is predominantly used for international air freight, replacing maybe 10, 12, 15 distributed road hubs. It takes a lot of polluting and inefficient truck haulage off the roads. That itself means roads gain extra capacity. Hyperloups will still need to use electricity to both move pods and maintain the near-vacuum environment and the tube. Proponents of the technology believe that this could be done by using renewable sources, including a combination of solar panels and battery technology that could be used along the Hyperloop itself.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,570,2022-10-07 17:21:31
12345," believe that this could be done by using renewable sources, including a combination of solar panels and battery technology that could be used along the Hyperloop itself. But even with all multipliers of time and carbon emission savings that a Hyperloop network may provide, the investment capital required to actually build such a network becomes even more economically and politically daunting. Committing doesn't mean spending billions on day one. Committing means how do we phase it? One company in the Netherlands is working to develop that technology and perhaps more importantly, the international coalition needed to make the Hyperloop network a reality. So we are here in the year of first full-scale Hyperloop test facility where we can already prove every conceptual technology of the Hyperloop. This is Tim Houter, a co-founder and CEO of Heart Hyperloop, headquartered in the city of Delft. And while this testing tube might not seem as large as others, inside is a key technology to create the on and off ramp type infrastructure of a Hyperloop network, that is a lane switch. That's something we can already test here. You can actually see it here. Then the track is diverging from one track into two. That makes it possible to eventually split up the Hyperloop track in two sections. And in that sense, you can create a complete Hyperloop network. But in the end, we'll make it possible to travel for example over a whole continent and take Europe for example, with the same ease as you can now travel with a metro in the city. The nice thing about this magnetic levitation system that we have developed is that there's absolutely zero moving components in the track. So for example, if you have to do a lane switch, all you do is that the tube basically splits up. And statically, the tracks also split up. And whenever the vehicle enters a switch, it either pulls itself to the right with its magnets or pulls itself to the left with its magnets. Lane switching on traditional rail requires the physical movement of the rail. Even modern magnetic levitation tracks use lane switching techniques in order to transfer trains from one track to another. And this is a very crucial element because this is the thing that limits the capacity and in the end, the usefulness of the real network. Because the moment that a track is switching, that means that at that moment you are creating an unsafe environment for the trains behind it. So you need a lot of space between trains. In a Hyperloop because you have no moving components in the track, all the vehicles can be much closer to each other. You can achieve a very high frequency and basically have vehicles moving and merging in and out of the network very much like a highway. For now though, Hart's physical testing has been limited by the size of their tube. Because the test track is only 30 meters long, they haven't tested this lane switch at speeds greater than 20 kilometers per hour. However, the company is working to build a new test site, where it plans to increase that testing speed to 300 kilometers per hour. We're now in a phase where we have proven most of the most important technologies in the test facilities that we already have. And we have also demonstrated the viability and the feasibility of a network. If you look at all the top systems that it consists of, most of those are proven systems. We already demonstrated in lab conditions. So we don't really believe that the technology itself is going to be the biggest challenge. Because for all Hyperloop companies out there, actually building a Hyperloop system requires more than just a good product. We're talking about the safety aspects. We're talking about integration into the environment. We're talking about the social aspects. Do people feel comfortable traveling in such a system? So it's about all these different aspects. And the complexity is really getting all the different stakeholders that are relevant. And that they need to contribute to bring this to market. To get them all following the same roadmap.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,571,2022-10-07 17:25:53
12346," Let's get started! In order to help build this coalition of private and public interest in hyperlip development, heart in 2018 partnered with other hyperlip companies from Europe and Canada, the goal was to define, establish and standardize the framework to regulate hyperlip systems. Right now we are working with all the hyperlip developers together in setting up the first, let's say, a structure for starting the standards drafting. One of the most important goals for heart is interoperability, which is essentially making sure the different systems can communicate with each other. Interoperability is so important because what we want to achieve is actually have this seamless travel experience. So you don't want to end up, for example, going from Madrid to Paris and then switching because you need to use a different technology to get, for example, to Amsterdam. The idea being that as companies around Europe create the first commercial hyperlip tracks between individual cities, one day those can all be connected to a larger network. Everyone that believes that hyperlip is a future transport system also realizes that there is a need to have this network because that's where hyperlip thrives. Hyperlip is such a huge project, it's definitely not something that you can do in your own or as a single company. So you need to do it with a lot of other companies, you need to have the governments. I think in that sense the biggest challenge that we've encountered is to really get all the required parties together to take the steps in development and in commercial implementation. Hearts Next Plan is to build the European Hyperlip Center, an open testing facility which will include a 2.6 kilometer test track and the company hopes to test travel speeds there at up to 700 kilometers per hour. Virgin Hyperlip is also racing to construct the first commercial hyperlip route with projects in various states of development in India, Saudi Arabia and the United States. Recently the company announced plans to build a Hyperlip certification center in West Virginia which will include a six mile long test track. Proving the technology here will be crucial if Hyperlip networks can find a home among infrastructure investments that the Biden administration hopes to make. The idea that there's multiple Hyperlip companies I think is a redeeming aspect in the business. People really want to see something happen so having multiple people move forward is good for that. I was struck when Josh and Sarah rode the pod. Two or three of the major outlets used the phrase, we now have a new mode of transport. And although all of that technology had existed before those two human beings rode it, it was the moment at which those two human beings traveled that short distance down the tube that in popular imagination Hyperlip became a mode of transport. The metaphor I use with my team is that the Wright brothers refers but none of us fly on Wright brothers' airlines anymore. If you don't continue to innovate, you're not going to be around and so we'll continue to be at the forefront of building Hyperlip. Back in 2013, Elon had an idea. I think the difference now in 2021 is some brilliant engineers have spent real time grinding out the details. And I thoroughly expect the next three to five years to be decisive.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,572,2022-10-07 17:30:14
12347," You This week, how hydrogen can transform our energy usage. We'll look at why the universe's most abundant element could be a game-changer in the climate revolution. Hydrogen technologies are not new. They are used in other sectors. We use them in space on our rockets. And we don't need the laws of physics to change to be able to use hydrogen on our planes. From iron ore to green hydrogen, one of Australia's richest men tells us about his pivot to sustainable energy. Let's take action. It's practical. It's implementable. Let's do it now. Plus, the hydrogen revolution. We'll speak with the CEO of Italian Utilities firm Snam about his new book and how green hydrogen could be competitive within five years. Cossacks are coming down and people are waking up to the fact that it's the only way to decarbonize certain sectors. From Bloomberg's Global Headquarters in New York, I'm Kayleigh Lines, and this is Bloomberg Green. It's a new year, so here at Bloomberg Green we're highlighting new solutions in the fight against climate change. And one of those is as old as the universe itself. Hydrogen. It's the simplest element around, but could well be a game changer when it comes to turning around our dependence on fossil fuels. Today, hydrogen is used in the chemicals industry to produce petroleum products. It's also starting to be used in steel production and industry under a lot of pressure to decarbonize. But it has far more uses as well, from power and cars to heating our homes. And Bloomberg New Energy Finance sees a seismic shift in the sector in the next ten years as green hydrogen squeezes out dirtier alternatives. No-called grey hydrogen dominates today, but as renewable electricity gets cheaper and more accessible, so we'll green hydrogen. In this week's edition of Bloomberg Green, we'll explore what this push into hydrogen means for tackling climate change. We'll hear from Australian billionaire Twiggy Forest about his pivot from Iron War to Hydrogen, and we'll also speak with the CEO of Italian utility company Svamm about his book, The Hydrogen Revolution.

12348," But first, what are we using hydrogen for? And why does it actually matter? Christine Lee Edwards explains. [♪ Music playing in background, playing in background, hydrogen is the most plentiful element in the universe. On Earth, we find that mostly bonded to oxygen in the form of water, or in other gases known as hydrocarbons. Hydrogen gas, H2, burns hot and clean, making it an attractive tool in the race to net zero, but isolating hydrogen from other elements is no easy task. Today, the cheapest way to do this is via chemical processes that break up natural gas. This releases a lot of carbon dioxide. Another method is to use electricity to split water molecules in a process called electrolysis. Although there is no carbon byproduct, a lot of electricity is needed. And if this power comes from burning coal or gas, it negates to zero emissions goals of using hydrogen to begin with. Hydrogen produced in this way, power by fossil fuels, is called gray hydrogen. If carbon capture and storage is used together with fossil fuels, then it becomes blue hydrogen. If nuclear power is used, it's called pink. And finally, green hydrogen is what is produced via electrolysis and powered from renewable sources. This method is considered emissions-free. It's predicted that by the early 2030s, H2 made from renewables will be cheaper than that made from fossil fuels. But that hinges on the cost of electrolysis declining, which will be achieved through larger projects and an expansion of manufacturing. To be clear, vast amounts of H2 are already used today. Global production in 2018 totaled 117 million metric tons. This hydrogen is mostly used for its chemical properties, not as a source of energy, and very little of it is clean. Some sectors like steel could start using hydrogen for these chemical properties, replacing coal. Industries like cement and glass may also use hydrogen as a source of heat. Another advantage is its energy storage potential. It can be stored over long periods of time and used when more power needs to be added to the grid. It also could hold an advantage over batteries and heavy transport and shipping. The promise of hydrogen for energy has been around since at least 1874 when Jules Verne wrote about it in his book, The Mysterious Island. But the future of hydrogen will depend on policy. Countries with net zero targets, carbon pricing, and hydrogen strategies with investment mechanisms are likely to see the highest H2 demand. That was Bloomberg's Christine Lee Edwards explaining what hydrogen means for the energy transition. But how are businesses approaching the sector? Well, one of Australia's richest men is making a big play into hydrogen. Andrew Forrest, better known as Twiggy, made his fortune from iron ore, being the chairman, former CEO, and major shareholder in Fordescue Metals, one of the world's biggest miners. But after having made over $10 billion in profit from the metal in the last fiscal year, Twiggy wants to transform Fordescue into a clean energy company. He's been scouring the planet in search of investment opportunities in hydrogen and renewables. The firm plans to allocate up to 10% of its annual profits for green energy investments, and his exploring projects across the globe from Indonesia to Argentina. Prancing Laquah caught up with 24-est. There's only one type of clean hydrogen. All the rest is dirty. That is great. If you just say, green hydrogen is clean, the rest is dirty, then you've actually nailed it. And anyone else who produces any other hydrogen, any other agridist, look at the answer. Why is global warming accelerating if anything you're saying is true? And then you'll know, actually, it's greenwashing. Yeah, but there's a lot of greenwashing because I keep on being told it's a transition. We can't just, you know, make the transition at a click of a finger. So what are we doing wrong? What can we do better? I don't remember the personal computer having to transition the typewriter. I really don't remember that. I don't remember that the smartphone having to transition the pocket calculator and the old landline. You know, it's transition line is complete rubbish. The light got put to it. Two days ago when JCB...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,574,2022-10-07 17:38:59
12349," I'll get calculated in the old landline. You know, it's transition line is complete rubbish. The light got put to it. Two days ago when JCB, a really loved British company, every right for the country to be proud of JCB, and Portuscue, holding a bit of a similar reputation, fantastic track record, a bit of a suitable from Portuscue, huge balance sheet, super strong. When those two companies got together and agreed at 79 billion USD green with per atom, then that's a real wake up call to say, hang on. Greenhagen is obviously commercial now. You know, every other form of possible fuel, possible fuel hydrogen, you know, it can compete with it on price. It can probably lose on price, but what we know, it is cooking the planet. And only greenhagen zero methane, zero carbon in the supply chain. Don't worry about the molecules in the supply chain. But at the moment, we're not even facing up call. If you look at the G20 company case, so we have a long way to go to talk about only using green hydrogen. Yeah, so look, I have a call, which I'd like to make now, that the world should not fund any more qualified power stations, coal mining projects ever. We should wind them down as quickly as possible, because they are cooking the planet just like grey and blue, hydrogen is cooking the planet. Yeah, you know, hydrogen to not make renewable electricity is releasing 10 to 16 times more carbon, let alone the methane, which is worse than it is hydrogen. So we've just got to stop doing things which are self-harming under the guise of greenhagen. So why are leaders so slow, even if you look at the appetite for eSG investments, they're growing exponentially. So are emissions. So where are we allocating capital? Okay, so take the recent G20. There's probably a reason why there wasn't strong, strong action coming out of the G20, because people were not aware that major transactions between large companies were taking place now on greenhagen, that actually this pollution free all the way to the supply chain fuel was now being transacted at multi-billion dollar scale. I don't believe any sovereign leader or any energy minister, or climate change minister, could not take ultra-seriously that greenhagen is never here today, it's broken through, history has been made, it will never go back. Okay, what is the one thing that you would tell leaders today and business leaders? How do we transition faster than what we are now? Because we're at real risk of missing our targets. So that's really simple. Do you stop funding? Do you stop subsidising? Do you stop using money into fossil fuels? Right. It could be carbon sequestration, fuel rebates could be anything. Hundreds of billions of dollars getting ashed while we ash the planet on fossil fuels subsidies. Because we haven't had that renewable energy, we haven't had that greenhagen, it's kind of been pushed down, it's down, it's also some excuses, it never be commercial, it never be supplied into quantities we needed. Now we know, let's take action. It's practical, it's implementable. Let's do it now. Okay, if we do it now, is there going to be a shock to the energy system? Is there going to be a shock actually to economically? And is it worth not talking about transition? Just going from 8 to beat? Yeah, it's a fantastic question. 8 to beat is the solution. Let fossil fuels do what fossil fuels do. Just burn their coal, burn their oil, burn their gas, at least they're pumping up carbon and methane into the atmosphere, honestly. Well, not that honest, because they don't mention methane, which is 90 times worse than carbon. Yeah. But at least the carbon has been done, honestly. Encourage the greenhagen sector to come in really fast. Okay, it's there. There's renewable power all over the world. We know how to make electrolyzes much cheaper, like 25% of the original cost. We know how to do that now, we don't have an excuse to get into it. Does it need to be cheaper than oil and fossil fuel for it to be viable worldwide? Well, right now it is. Okay, so let's just swallow that bit of financial data. Right now it is cheaper. And it's getting more check. It's the high-fueled you know. Mr. Froskin. It's declining in value. You don't have enough of it. Right, to power the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,575,2022-10-07 17:43:24
12350," and it's getting more check. It's the only field you know. Right, to power the world. We haven't had policies to support. We had policies to support it 5, 10 years ago. We've got 5, 10 years to make a huge difference. And he policy it all over the world. To appreciate, now, OK, big business is transacting with $300,000 in multi-billion dollar agreements. We now know it's here and it's here to state that's spread everywhere. Coming up on the program, the Hydrogen Revolution. We'll speak with the CEO of Italian Utility firm, Snam, about his new book. And why he thinks green hydrogen will be competitive in just 5 years. Plus, how are airlines working to become more sustainable? We'll look at how Airbus plans to step up in the climate fight. And this is the Berk Green. From Bloomberg's world headquarters in New York, I'm Kayley Lines and this is Bloomberg Green. What will the world look like in 2050? Will global temperatures have stabilized? Electric vehicles be abundant? And solar and wind power homes around the world? According to Marco Alvera, the CEO of Italian Energy Company Snam, that vision of the future could be a reality. And he says that hydrogen will pay its way. As he tells it in his new book, The Hydrogen Revolution, Alvera's moment of reckoning came in November 2018 when he tasked the Snam scenarios team with studying how Europe could reduce its CO2 emissions to zero by 2050. Looking through the results of the study, Alvera said he was struck by how much hydrogen was in Europe's energy mix by that year. Beyond the abundance of hydrogen, the Snam model also predicted that it would be the cheapest form of decarbonized energy for many sectors, and that it could be cheaper than today's prices for oil, coal, and nuclear power. Our Maria today has spoke with Alvera at COP26. It's happening all very fast. We see the cost of hydrogen coming down a lot. Hydrogen will play a big role in the energy mix. We don't know if it's going to be 15 or 25% of a fully decarbonized energy system, but it's going to be big. Costs.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,576,2022-10-07 17:47:23
12351," a lot. Hydrogen will play a big role in the energy mix. I don't know if it's going to be 15 or 25% of a fully decarbonized energy system, but it's going to be big. Coss are coming down and people are waking up to the fact that it's the only way to decarbonize certain sectors, so-called hard-to-abate sectors. And you say it's the only way in the cost are coming down. Where do you see prices moving? Because a lot of the reticence of times has to do with the pricing. That some argue will still not be the cheapest option out of the market. So when I was first working in hydrogen in 2004, it was costing $1,000 per megawatt hour, $2,000, $10,600. Today, $100, and we see it going down to 50 in five years' time and to going down to $25 per megawatt hour in the next 10 years or so. Which is a quarter of word as today. That's really because renewable energy, and we're talking green hydrogen here, renewable energy costs are falling, but the cost of making the electrolyzer, which is the kit that you use to convert solar or wind energy and water into hydrogen, the cost of this kit is falling a lot because it doesn't really exist on an industrial scale. So as we build up capacity, we industrialize it, we standardize it, and we squeeze costs out. That's really the cost trajectory. And for that, of course, you need demand, however, for governments and also institutions to kind of buy into this idea that it is a future we want to invest in creating infrastructure. What are they telling you? When you speak to governments, when you speak to officials, are they keen on this? They're very keen. So the Department of Energy shares our view in the states of getting to below $1.00 a kilo, which is $25.00 a megawatt hour. The European Union has a hydrogen strategy, which is very clear, and several member states have the same. Chile wants to export a lot of hydrogen. China's big on hydrogen. Australia's very big on hydrogen. Japan is blending already hydrogen. So I would say the world is now really focused on this because it's the only way to store energy for a long period of time economically, is to convert it into either a liquid or a gas. And of course, you talk about the price, but the other big component is the volume, you know, how big can you go? Where do you see that on a time scale? So wherever it's sunny or windy, you can produce very cheap hydrogen eventually. And so compared to oil and gas, which are concentrated in a few parts of the world, it's going to be very democratic from that point of view. So every sunny place, every desert, every ocean wind can be turned into hydrogen that we can put on ships in pipes and really start trading it around the world. So it's going to happen a lot faster than a lot of people think. So and will you say a lot faster? What is that in time? As they said, $50, which is essentially oil parity within five years, and then depending on how quickly we ramp it up after that, we could get to $25, which is coal parity before the end of the day. And big scale. And big scale because once you get to coal parity, that's the only way we're going to get China and India to stop burning new coal. We have businesses in China and in India. And I see a lot of hydrogen development, a lot of renewable development in both countries. The Indian announcement was incredibly strong on 2030. Some people were upset about the 2017 net zero deadline, but when it comes to 30, he announced the big, big commitment to get the 50% renewables. I was surprised that they would make it so explicit. And even the net zero is a big thing for them. And so I think it will happen faster than 2070 because of the falling cost of renewable and hydrogen. India's burning 80 gigawatt of oil, diesel to keep the lights on. So there's an immediate opportunity there. And we're very interested in working that country. And with regards to China, perhaps the fact that we haven't really seen them active, I guess the diplomats are working on this, but we haven't really seen the leadership. It's going to be technology. It's going to be industry, I think China has committed to a net zero, which is very important. At the G20, China was clearly behind the one and a half degrees. So I think a lot has been achieved between the G20 and COP. And I think what's really important is to see in the coming years, how quick it's in our hands to make part of this happen in five years or could otherwise happen in 15, 20 years. It's about building the project. The capital is there. We saw how many trillions of dollars are already committed. What's missing is really the projects and that's where companies they got to step in. Marco Alvera, CEO of SNAM there speaking with our Maria today. Let's turn now to the aviation industry. It's a big contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions and it's under pressure to change that. In October, the International Air Transport Association, a trade body representing airlines approved a target of achieving net zero emissions by 2050. To achieve that, many airlines in the US and Europe are looking to buy sustainable aviation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,577,2022-10-07 17:52:07
12352," Trade body, representing airlines, approved a target of achieving net zero emissions by 2050. To achieve that, many airlines in the US and Europe are looking to buy sustainable aviation fuel made from renewable sources like used vegetable oil. Initiatives like these are pushing plane makers to come up with some radical new aircraft that will eventually cater to our growing appetite for travel without hurting the environment. We took a look at how Airbus, the world's number two aircraft manufacturer, is stepping up to the challenge. How long until we can fly emission free? Airbus says it's more confident by the day it can be done by its 2035 target. Airbus a CEO spoke about its ambitions for hydrogen-powered planes at the company's summit in France. The physics works. Hydrogen technologies are not new. They are used in other sectors. We use them in space on our rockets. We don't need the laws of physics to change to be able to use hydrogen on our planes. So every day we become more confident. But we think we need to have a plane. We need to have the right fuels, the hydrogen available in the right quantity at the right place at the right time. And we need the regulations to be ready. So we really need the work and the collaboration of many people on the globe to make it happen on time. But it could be a long wait until green passenger jets go mainstream. Large aircraft with more than 150 seats are not expected to feature globally until about 2050. That means manufacturers and airlines today are under growing pressure to ramp up short-term innovations to cut their carbon. In a long term, meeting the ambitious plans for so-called green hydrogen means building a giant industry almost from scratch. To make that happen, British airline EasyJet is among those saying governments need to get involved and fast. Aviation's emissions over the last three decades leading up to the pandemic grew by about 80% to over 1 gigaton, and that's projected to double by 2050. According to Bloomberg, NEF, about half of the airlines with the largest global market share have set net zero targets by that same date nearly three decades away. Coming up from Blue Sky projects to the bottom line, we'll speak with our Bloomberg NEF expert Meredith Annex and dig into their models about how hydrogen fits into the future energy mix. British",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,578,2022-10-07 17:56:28
12353," From Bloomberg's World Headquarters in New York, I'm Kayleigh Lyons, and this is Bloomberg Green. Now let's bring in Meredith Annex, our Bloomberg N-E-F Hydrogen Specialist to talk more about how hydrogen could change the energy landscape. So Meredith, what place do you think hydrogen is likely to have in the future energy mix globally? Hydrogen is this incredible solution for us as we look to decarbonize because it's a perfect solution in areas that are hard to electrify. So we're really like to think about hydrogen playing a role. It's in things like heavy industry, especially where you need a feedstock as well as energy source. And in things like dispatchable power, it's a very long-called transport, maybe even shipping and aviation. That sounds great that it can be used for such diverse industries. At the end of the day, though, how much is this going to cost? Well, that's the amazing thing about hydrogen because depending on how you make it, it can actually see significant cost of clients in the future. So when we're talking about clean hydrogen, we're usually mean green hydrogen produced for renewable electricity. And in that case, your hydrogen is almost as cheap as the renewables that are used to make it. So if you're in a place with really good renewable resources, you'll be able to have cheaper hydrogen. But even in places with less good resources, we think that hydrogen can be cheaper than a dollar per kilogram, which is the price of unabated hydrogen today and around $8 per million BTUs for those who prefer to think in energy units. And that can be achieved anywhere in the world by 2050, we believe. All right, so let's talk about kind of the pros and cons list. I don't know where cost fits into that. But what are the advantages to hydrogen over other renewables and then what are the drawbacks? Yeah. Main advantage is the fact that hydrogen can serve roles that electron struggle with. And that's things like seasonal storage, for instance, or just anything where you need storeability where your electrons are harder to store, hydrogen is going to be easier. That also leads to a downside though, because hydrogen is less energy dense than the usual things that we use for storeable energy today like coal or oil or natural gas. So you will need more volume of storage to handle the same amount of energy. Let's talk about the viability as well and how it may differ in different geographies. What is your view on that? Yeah. So for green hydrogen again from renewable electricity, really places with the best renewable resources, things like Latin America, or the Middle East, even southern Europe have really, really good potential for producing hydrogen. And then when you're looking at blue hydrogen, which is produced from natural gas or coal with carbon captioned storage, we do see that becoming more expensive than green hydrogen in the future, especially as renewable electricity costs come down. But that can be a viable option in places like the US Gulf Coast or Russia, where you've got good geological storage for the carbon, as well as ample natural gas that's quite cheap. All right, great breakdown. Thank you so much to our Meredith annex, our Bloomberg NEF Hydrogen Specialist. And of course, you can get more from the Bloomberg NEF team on the terminal and online. And they've recently done a podcast called Hydrogen 101 as part of its switched on series. So from iron ore titans pivoting to cleaner energy to talk of a hydrogen revolution, that's it from the Suix edition of Bloomberg Green. We'll be back next week with a deep dive into the state of electric vehicles. And you can keep the conversation going by following us on YouTube, Instagram and Twitter at climate.

The Dow Jones industrial average down 604 lower now by 2%. Nesstank down 407. A decline there of 3.7%. 10-year yield, 3.87%. We've got the 2-year yielding 4.29%. Wall Street got a reality check today data showing a hot labor market that will likely keep the Federal Reserve on its aggressive hiking trail. As for the market outlook and today's jobs report and a station Amaroso, this chief investment strategist at I Capital. As rates rise across the board, there's going to be more slowness and potential for a recession. So the markets will have to price that in and that means that EPS downgrades are likely still to come. So, even if we get some sort of a pop because of a so-called Fed pivot, the reality is the relative value of equity is quite challenged when rates are close to 4%. And again, we do have that 10-year yielding 3.87%. The S&P worth repeating down now by 2.65%. Spot goal down 7.10% to 1% 1700, even the ounce, while West Texas, intermediate crude oil up 4.4%, 9235.

We also got the founder of the blockchain ecosystem. Topple stopped stopping by. So we're looking forward to that. And the next episode of crypto IRL premiered last night. And you can catch it again tonight at 830 on Bloomberg television. All right, lots to get to. Let's get to it though, with the market drivers report. All right, as we mentioned, Krite Gupta is with us, Akron Market's correspondent, App Bloomberg along with Michael McKee, International Economic, Sympolicy correspondent, App Bloomberg News. I know Mike, I gotta start with, I gotta start with Mike, because I begged him, please. She said I gotta start with, and then she looked at Krite's. She, because it's like the markets are selling off and the dog's work. Which one is gonna be mad at me. And I actually like, I was like Mike, please, please stick around, who has been in since 4am this morning. To have a report, what do we need to know? I left, I told David Weston earlier today, I got a fortune, they had fortune cookies upstairs at lunchtime, and I, I'm not fortunate, I'm not fortunate. We got the jobs in the front. My fortune was not bad, but okay. Wow, that's what it said. Seriously? And that's the way I would look at the jobs report. What does it say about your fortune? It's good news. Yeah, I'm telling him, I'm gonna go there. It's good news in that the job creation was still strong, but it had declined. So it's not as strong as it was. The unemployment rate unexpectedly went down. We did see strong job gains in the household survey and drop in the number of people who reported being unemployed, which is for the overall economy good. The question is then how does that all feed into inflation? We saw a slight drop in the average hourly earnings numbers, and that may have been because the biggest job gains were in sectors where they're relatively low wage, and people had been reluctant to go back into those jobs, waiters and waitresses at bars and restaurants, home healthcare workers, that sort of thing. So we may be reaching the limit of the participation rate, the number of people who are going to come back into the labor force, labor force decline too. And if that's the case, it makes it harder on the Fed because the labor market may not loosen up as much, but if the trend in wages continues, and if it's more people going back to low wage jobs, that would be slightly good news for the Fed. But basically keeps the status quo, they'll keep raising interest rates. Which is why it feels like once again, equity investors at least, credient are a little concerned. Yeah, and bond market as well, because of the knee-jerk reaction here was basically cell stock, cell bonds. And obviously the equity market, selling has accelerated. And I want to say not even on extreme volume at all. You're seeing, I like to look at the five-day average, because it's a little bit more short-term frequency. The S&P 500's five-day average volume is only, is down about 4%. So you're actually negative on the day. That being said, to see a... And do we see stronger volume on the days where we sell a bunch of buying this week? We have, we have. And I think one of the, I'll give you the bull and the bear argument, the easy thing to basically say is, the good news for the economy is bad news for the markets, for the exact reason that might just outline when it comes to the Federal Reserve and how hawkish that they're going to be. Or perhaps even fate that no matter how hawkish they'll be, they can't give enough slack to the labor market. There is that as well. But let me give you perhaps the bull argument, as well here, is that there's been so much selling in the equity market, so much doom and gloom. A lot of people have been waiting for kind of this moment of capitulation. It hasn't yet come yet. So a lot of people are saying that perhaps this is the week to cash out, just given that we did have gains earlier. In the week that we're pretty substantial, only to kind of prime the market for any good news in the CPI report, any good news in the earning story, because then even a tiny blip of positive earning stories on an individual micro basis will then kind of reward the share. So there is kind of weird backwards logic to it, but there is a bull and a bear argument. Well, now that we have gotten the non-farm payroll's number, Mike, we do look forward to next week to try to get an understanding of inflation. And you chuckle because if we think back to last CPI report, that's kind of what set off the current downturn that we're seeing right now. Cameron, HA.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,581,2022-10-07 18:09:44
12356," We do look forward to next week to try to get an understanding of inflation. And you chuckle because if we think back to last CPI report, that's kind of what set off the current downturn that we're seeing right now. It came in hotter than expected. What's this one going to do? I mean, not crystal ball question, but what kind of effect could it have? I'm a burger. I think a number out of the air. Well, the consensus is we're going to see a slight decline in CPI. The problem here, and this is a problem for Joe Biden and the Democrats as well as for the economy is that oil prices are going back up. So when we get the CPI report, it may show some progress on inflation, but then people are going to go to the gas station and go, no, there's not. So the psychology is still there and that also puts pressure on the Fed to keep rates moving higher. I just want to check in with you too, that we've got FOMC minutes next week. Is there anything else more Fed speakers? Anything else that you think we should be giving on our radar when it comes to that? Well, when it comes to all this, the retail sales report is out on Friday. We'll see if Americans are still spending and in what categories they are spending. Are we moving away from goods? The other thing is happening next week is there's a G20 meeting in connection with the IMF meetings which you're in Washington next week. And so I mean, interesting to see what kind of pressure the rest of the world puts on the US over the dollar. Right. I mean, it's always our dollar, but they're a problem. But there may be some talk of maybe we should say something or do something to let people know. What was our story? What was our story? The US doesn't care. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah, we can't care. We have to do what's best, all the Fed and everybody else has to do what's best for this economy. And everybody else has to do what's best for their economy. Right. But it doesn't help the rest of the world. 20 seconds, we get earnings next week. We do have some earnings next week, but can I actually do say contrary and say, I think the bigger move is going to be in the oil market for the exact reasons that Mike just said, we're looking at 98 on on bread crude with a stronger dollar. That's a big deal. So she's saying no, you don't care about earnings. I care about earnings. I just care about oil more at the moment. No, I understand man. Just a big pickup, she drives and gets too well for that. She's from Texas, okay. Cutter some slack. We cutters of slack. Over yet. Hey, all right guys, have a great weekend. Thanks to both of you, Michael McKee, International Economic and Policy Coors, but of course, Creedigoop, the Anchor and Markets course. Well, let's get a check on the latest world in national news with Nancy Alliance and 991 Newsroom in DC. Hey, Nancy. Thanks, Tim. You've been talking about it. The US labor market appears to still be resilient following those steep interest rate hikes by the Fed. Employers added 263,000 jobs in September, slightly more than expected. The unemployment rate surprisingly dropped to 10% to 3.5%. Meanwhile, average hourly earnings rose firmly. Well, global food prices have fallen for the six month in a row, which could mean some relief for consumers. World food commodity prices are now about 15% below a record set in March, but the latest decline will take a while to show up in grocery stores, where prices are also determined by energy and transportation and labor costs. Crop exports from Ukraine picked up, agriculture demand is easing, and a United Nations Gage of Food Prices declined 1.1% last month to the lowest since January. What happens next will depend on efforts to extend that crop export corridor beyond mid-November. In Washington, I'm Amy Morris, Bloomberg Radio.

12357," We're talking about New York City Mayor Eric Adams declaring a state of emergency of the city's migrant crisis, saying that the recent arrival of more than 17,000 asylum seekers from Central America and South America is straining the city's resources. Well, as part of the order, Mayor Adams directed all relevant agencies to construct humanitarian relief centers and to provide assistance. The city will spend more than a billion dollars by the end of the fiscal year on the crisis. Adam said it in news briefing Friday. He called for support from the state and federal authorities, saying the crisis is burning through our city's budget. You know, for those of us in and around New York City, we know it has not come back completely by a mile from the pandemic. Oh, not even close. And you know, you see a lot of homeless people around, certainly in the subways and on the streets. And the crisis is this story notes. We're sending an already fragile shelter system here in the city, which is operating at near 100% capacity. The mayor pointed that out as well. Around 61,000 people were in the system as of Thursday night and one in five was an asylum seeker. So the migrant population obviously playing into that. New York and other cities are straining under an influx of hundreds of migrants sent primarily by Republican governors from border states. The city has been working to provide shelter and other services to the migrants, many of whom fled violence in Venezuela and other Latin American countries. The mayor called the crisis a situation that was, quote, manufactured by leaders in other states who were exploiting the city's right to shelter mandate. Under a legal settlement from the 1980s, New York is required to provide housing for anyone who needs it. I'm a city that previously opened up 42 additional temporary shelters and hotels. The mayor here in New York City promising that the city would also accelerate moving New Yorkers in the shelter system into long term housing in order to free up beds and space for newer arrivals. And then a previously planned triage center will open on Randall's Island in the coming weeks. So cities are grappling with this, which many would argue there needs to be a bigger broader policy for from the federal government. Yeah. Yeah. In terms of taking the man caring for them and just figuring it out. So more news to come. No doubt about it from major cities across the United States.

We have got the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 588, decline there of 2%, as stacked down 395, a drop there of 3.6%. 10 year yield, 3.87% the 2 year yield now 4.28%, spot gold down $12, the ounce to 16.99, Bitcoin is down 2.9% to 19,472, West Texas, NVIDIA crude up 4.5%, 92, 41, a barrel. Briefly sources tell Bloomberg CVS Health is an exclusive talk to my Kano Health and is a health care provider back by billionaire Barry Sternlecht. CVS shares are lower now by just about 10%, Kano is up by 5.2%. I'm Charlie Pelot, that is a Bloomberg Business Flash. All right, Charlie. Thank you so much for that update. You are listening and watching Bloomberg Business. We call Master Along with Tim Stenevich live here on Bloomberg Radio. Do want to get back to something we just talked about with our Mike McKee. We're talking about this morning's jobs report, just a reminder, the US labor market staying strong. In September, the unemployment rate unexpectedly returned to an historic low, leaving the Fed on course to deliver yet another aggressive interest rate hike. Non-farm payrolls increased 263,000 in September after a 315,000 gain in August. An employment rate dropped to 2.5% that matched a 5-daked low average hourly earnings rising firmly to him. We like to turn to on days like this, Becky Francoitz, Chief Commercial Officer, President North America for Manpower Group, Becky joining us this afternoon on the phone from Chicago. Manpower Group of course, a placement firm that works around the globe and has a really good understanding of what exactly is happening when it comes to jobs in this economy and more. Becky, good to have you back with us. How are you? Hi Tim. Well, thank you. Any surprises in the jobs report that we got? For the equity market, it's another good news, bad news scenario. Yes, I'd say first we saw some softening, gradual softening month over month, which is actually good for employers. Tim, I know it sounds counterintuitive, but a little bit of release of pressure and it's really tight labor market is actually encouraging because employers are hoping they can actually fill some roles now. A surprise earlier in the week is that quit rates. Prove that fewer job openings haven't diswaded people from resigning even if we go into this holiday. I would say that was a surprise a bit earlier in the week and I think that the no news is the news around wages. And prizes to extend.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,584,2022-10-07 18:22:24
12359, resigning uh... even if we go into the holiday so i would say that was a surprise a bit earlier in the week i think that you know the no news is the news around wages uh... also with clear reports morning so what are you guys seeing at manpower group when it comes to what companies need are they finding their need give us some color behind these numbers that we got from the government and what you guys are seeing in real time yet here on so glad you ask that because you know the jobs report is is a backward looking view and so if you say what's going on today back you what's going to the market today i would say too big headlines one is hybrid holiday so we are seeing retailers start to hire out what i call hybrid and uh... my kids make fun of me because i said it's it's i or l you know in real life so we're seeing people want to shop in store and therefore we're seeing roles associated store managers service people in the in-side retail and we're starting to see some some pick up there as well as continuing growth around you know logistics delivery drivers et cetera which really didn't show up in the report today and so it's a bit more delaying uh... that would be one big thing that we're seeing and the second thing we're seeing that wasn't a report today is tech hiring carol continues really robust aggressive and apparently slow down proof really that's so weird because okay because we get so much anecdotal evidence whether that's you know met a platform is the parent company of facebook or you know you just go and type in what and i'd job cuts in the bloomberg terminal and there's headline after headlines so much the base in silken valley are you just using the term tech differently is more a more encompassing term well it's about text skills about tech companies and so you're absolutely right that i think i think that companies yet every company today is in some part of tech company and so anything anyone who might have been impacted by silicon valley layoffs rapidly picked up in either another industry or a smaller company and the tech unemployment is still under one percent our country under one percent you know it's interesting what was the thing a labor hoarding we were talking about where companies are afraid to let go of workers even if they're a little nervous about the outlook because they just maybe they don't think they if we get a recession it won't be deep and so they don't want to let go of workers because they know how tight the labor market is and they don't have to scramble on the other side of it what what can you tell us about what you are seeing when it comes to companies and doing labor labor hoarding yes i i've said we're still in a post-tendemic labor recovery and i know you know we like to think the pandemic is well over just now supply chains are normalizing you've seen the headlines around freight costs going down containers you know now being readily available lumber going down and so we're still in this post-tendemic recovery and employers memories are long and they remember for the last 18 months they've not been able to find talent and so yes Carol we are seeing i love that term by the way labor hoarding we are seeing labor hoarding in some places because you know employers are afraid if i let these people go i may not go to get them back in a few months when we we all hope the economy rebound uh... can you give us some indication on i don't know how you're looking forward a little bit back to you to understand what comes during the fourth quarter of the year in q one of twenty twenty four because the twenty twenty three excuse me i'm getting a little ahead of myself uh... the the fed is certainly trying to figure out what happens there investors are as well yes i would say you know holiday high rings the weather vain it's gonna tell us what we're gonna see for the rest of you know at least the rest of this year and also into the very first part of twenty twenty three so that would be one you know one thing so if we see so okay so let me just make sure i understand this if we see softness when it comes to holiday hiring that could be a bad sign it could be a concern you know so far we're seeing you know i know you saw amazon just announced their hiring a hundred and fifty dollar for the holiday and so you know we'd see early signs of promise but it's still early in the season but that that is the weather vain that we should all keep our our eyes on i think the other is you know does the fed take action again and what impact does that have on the job market and that's well outside of you know my control are you concerned the fed over does it they've talked about where the unemployment rate needs to be potentially in order to bring down inflationary pressures are you concerned that we will see maybe it's six months from now maybe it's twelve months maybe it's three months that we will see those unemployment claims to cire and and a significant amount of people might be out of work and just got about thirty seconds becky yeah so i would say carol i hope it's not significant the labor market traditionally lags the economy it's lagging at a bit more so i'm hoping the economy rebound and the labor,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,585,2022-10-07 18:26:47

All right everybody this is Bloomberg Business Week the Friday edition uh Carol Masterlong at Tim Stenevek coming up we're going to talk about this Bloomberg exclusive it does feel like the M&A world which has been under a lot of pressure this year feels like activities picking up. Uh yes CVS said to be in talks to buy cano health um you know what? What? Is is it picking up? It seems like it's picking up. It does but you look at some of I think the numbers it's just like still down. Yeah well we'll talk about this and why it's happening right now. Not all just about Twitter and Elon but that's a good point. Does feel that. Yeah it's a good point. Let's get over to Charlie Pellet because he's watching the markets we got less than 90 minutes ago. Indeed uh and a busy Friday too yes jobs reports stocks selling off but that CVS report also interesting said to be an exclusive talks to buy cano health right now we have got CVS shares plunging by 10.6 percent cano up by 5.4 percent not the only big deal perhaps to talk about sources tell Bloomberg Brookdale senior living one of the biggest operators of senior living communities in the US is exploring options shares of Brookdale they are surging today up now by 17.7 percent the focus so on the US equity market steep losses lows of the day right now the S&P on this jobs Friday down 109 a drop now of 2.9 percent that now is down 686 of decline there of 2.3 percent now to stack down 426 a drop there of 3.85 percent 10 year yield 3.87 percent the 2 year yield 4.29 percent the catalyst for today's selling the jobs report we have the Dow the S&P and Nezdaq all declining after the labor market stayed strong in September non farm payrolls up by 263,000 in September unemployment dropping to 3.5 percent here's US labor secretary Marty Walsh interview today on Bloomberg Radio I don't want people to say job but we need to continue to",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,587,2022-10-07 18:35:42
12362," Timber unemployment dropping to 3.5%. Here's US Labor Secretary Marty Walsh interview today on Bloomberg Radio. I don't want people lose their job but we need to continue to bring down the flesh or the pressures that people have. Certainly what OPEC made a decision on this week to do was not helpful to us. The President was disappointed with this point that there's administration but we need to continue to bring down those pressures. I mean I think that you know I had a long conversation in my office today. I certainly don't want to see that unemployment number go up. I like to see people working. After earnings, Levi Strauss, now down by 11.5% advanced micro devices rattling semiconductor stocks down now by 12.8%. I'm Charlie Pellet and that is a Bloomberg business flash. All right Charlie thank you so much. So watching shares of CVS health which are down about 10% into day's trade. It's a good decline in the carol. I know that's nice to try. Should I use it as one of my decliner's? I kind of wish you would. Okay I will. My gainer cano health is your cano your third gainer. I'll make it that way. Thank you. This is what we do. You're seeing out of sausage is made. All right so folks it is a Bloomberg exclusive. CVS health said to be an exclusive talk to buy cano health. It's a health care provider backed by billionaire Barry Stern like this is created people familiar with the matter. Let's get to it though with Bloomberg intelligence. Senior health care analyst Jonathan Palmer. He's on the phone in New Jersey. Hey Jonathan good to have you here with Tim and myself. So tell us about this. I think this has been percolating a little bit out there. Does this make sense first of all if it happens? Hi Carol thanks for having me on. Sure. I think a couple things to think about in the back drop here. I mean you mentioned CVS being down 10%. There's really like two things going on with CVS today. One is this cano health deal and the second was some Medicare advantage ratings came out yesterday and a number of companies had their star ratings which is a measure of quality well-weird. So you're seeing peers like Centine and Clover and Oscar also down 7%. Plus so there's really like a two if it's two for for CVS today well-we're ratings and the news on this deal. But really what we're seeing is an explosion of interest among the big provider or the big insurers among all different sorts of assets in the provider world and CVS is not alone in this we've seen Walgreens move ahead with their village MD deal. We've seen Amazon with one medical. Everybody who's in sure wants to provide more health care to their customers. So can I ask you the 10% drop then do you think it's 5% or 8% the Medicare quality ratings drop or? What's the spreadsheet telling you Jonathan is what Carol wants to know. I think the majority of it is the Medicare advantage ratings the star ratings falling and then a little bit extra for maybe the potential dilution on this deal if they wind up working that way. Okay very helpful especially when we talk about these stocks later in the day. Hey Jonathan give us a good idea of what all of this consolidation means for the end consumer for the people who use that health care. I mean that's all of us. Yeah I think it's a great question. I mean ultimately I think what CVS and its peers would tell you that consolidation and bringing more services under one roof will help lower costs and improve outcomes. I mean I think the devil is in the details there. We don't necessarily see that across the health care universe right now. I mean we have things like minute clinics CVS has their health hubs. That was part of the big vision of this at the deal was to marry an insurer with retail assets to provide more health care locally and it's still a work in progress. So I think this idea of value-based care and putting a whole bunch of services all under one roof the piece still needs to be proven out both on the outcomes and the cost. So in terms of and I know in our reporting we pointed out that there's no certainty a deal will be reached and part because Humana has a right of first refusal should cannot find a buyer under an agreement they made back in 2019 at least according to the people in the know right. So it's not necessarily a done deal. Exactly I mean Humana's I believe their biggest cannot health biggest customer and as part of that the deal that they can go should in the past they have a right of first refusal if there's ever an offer firm offer to buy the company. You know I think what that means for for CVS assuming",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,588,2022-10-07 18:39:54
12363, the negotiate in the past they have a right of first refusal if there's ever an offer firm offer to buy the company you know i think what that means for for cbs the assuming you know our reporting is good at you know most likely to have to pay you know maybe a little bit more of a premium just because you know she man it does have that option that that match it you know i think you know so this might be the proper meets the road of whether they actually want to own it or what somebody else on it like cbs hey johnathan carol had this uh... this this comment that kind of struck me which was you know what wondering about the return of mna and i'm wondering uh... just because of the economy that we're seeing right now in a carol you have you know twitter and uh... you on musk on my mind yeah on your mind for this week in that mna news but we've been talking to a lot of folks who have said you know the ipio market has dried up and we see the numbers to prove that mna is you know watch for it but we're not seeing a ton of it right now is the health care space in exception you know it that's uh... that's a good one because i think there's there's a couple things that play you know there's an appetite for these bigger companies to grow and and they can't all do that organically so they you know clearly turned to the m in a market and companies like cbs have been very clear say that they you know they want to do m in a and they have the capacity and and there's strategic areas like primary care which can no place in where they want to get get stronger so it's me it feels like uh... m in a market i don't want to say it's higher than it has been but that uh... the interest is still there in the income and so still have the ability to do deals even with rate higher you know they can manage the leverage alright johnathan so great to check in with you thank you so much of a great weekend johnathan paumar senior health care alice blumber intelligence on the phone in new jersey all right let's get to world national news nancy lion standing by in the cc news and that's thanks to president by the says today's jobs report shows the number of people re-entering the workforce is the fastest in any modern economic recovery we still a lot of work to do what we're building a different economy before a better one stronger one employers added to hundred sixty three thousand jobs in september that was slightly more than expected the unemployment rate surprisingly dropped to tens of her percent a three and a half percent the president made his remarks during a visit to evolve a plan in haggars town merlin the Biden administration plans to launch its student loan forgiveness this month but legal challenges could threaten the rollout five separate lawsuits have been filed across the country arguing the president doesn't have the authority to grant such large-scale debt relief without congressional approval the president's plan relies on a two thousand three law that lets the education department wave loan requirements in an emergency the law was passed in the wake of the september 11th attacks but the president says covid counts if the application process goes live later this month the Biden administration says some borrowers could see a drop in their balances before loan payments resume next year in washington i'm nathan hager bloomberg radio you value school leaders have pulled the districts and battled campus police force off the job four months after the rob elementary school shooting they cited quote additional concerns with department operations the force recently hired a former texas state trooper who is part of the hesitant response in a major league baseball playoff the cleafling guardians of one their wild card game against ampah two to one the fillies and the cardinals are scoreless in their wild card game global news twenty four hours a day on air and on bloomberg quick take powered by more than twenty seven hundred journalist and analysts and more than one hundred and twenty countries i'm antsy lions i'll see your trial and uh... one-up you a trial no that's not exactly what's going on that's not exactly what's going on but among the most read on the bloomberg terminal this afternoon just a reminder what you can do is type are you the go on the terminal is a story about Elizabeth homes in her acts ramesh ball warning he sees her bid for new trial and well he wants one to yeah exactly if it was a home stands to get a new free trial trial that's right again if Elizabeth homes stands to get a new fraud trial after government witness showed up at her home uninvited and sounding remorseful for convicted x-boyfriend deserves the same chance and that is what a lawyer uh... for her x-boyfriend is saying i guess yesterday asked the judge who presented over both executives trials to let his client piggyback on uh...

12364," To let his client piggyback on Elizabeth Holmes bid for a retrial. Yeah, we're talking about Ramesh Sunnybyl-Wani. And if you as district judge Edward DeVilla agrees, the ex-partners could both appear at an October 17th hearing in a common quest to challenge the credibility of a former Theranos lab director Adam Rosendorf, whose testimony was damning for both of them. It's interesting. The judge already has made it clear his only concern is to confirm that Rosendorf gave truthful testimony regardless of whatever regrets he may have had in hindsight. Bologna's lawyer used the same word as Holmes as the attorney and the judge extraordinary to describe the highly unusual scene that unfolded in August when Rosendorf arrived at the Holmes household and allegedly told her current partner that he had such misgivings about his testimony that he couldn't sleep. Wow. You read the book. I've gone over it. Yeah, I've gone through it. And I mean, it's incredible that this is a story that's still being told. It's a story that's continues to unfold. You know, well, you know well, because I think maybe we're wondering what we didn't know. And I think it was just amazing how all of us in the media were kind of caught up. There was so much coverage of her and what she was seeming to do and up end. Magazine covers everywhere, right? Exactly. It's kind of seen as like a Steve Jobs for the healthcare space in many ways.

From Bloomberg World, Hank Waters, I'm Charlie Palojob's Friday. The selling is intensifying with the Dow, the S&P and Nez Dank very much in the red labor market did say strong in September, but that is raising concerns about the Fed's next moves with the S&P now down by 109 points, down 2.9%. We've got the Dow down 693 points, down 2.3%. Nez Dank down 419 points now with decline of 3.8%. We are trading at the low of the day on the S&P 500 index. Gotta keep it locked into Bloomberg Radio to see how things shake out at the close.

Briefly, I robot has won a first ground in a bid to ban shark ninja vacuum imports. An ITC judge has found that those vacuums in fringe some I robot patents. I'm Charlie Peloton, that is a Bloomberg business flat. I just like when you say shark ninja. Is this the vacuum? It sounds like it. Do we go? Yeah, shark ninja huh? There we go, let's say it together. Shark ninja. Jinks. It could be a yeah. Jinks you owe me something. I don't know, like a Netflix series. What do you think? Coming to you soon. Alright Charlie Peloton, thank you so much. Alright, coming right now is a story that's among our most red on the Bloomberg. It's also in the new issue of Bloomberg Business Week, that's just that. It's in the feature section. It's about hackers targeting home buyers in a novel way to intercept wire transfers for down payments. If your heart hasn't skipped a beat, it should now. This is terrifying. We got Natalie Wong joining us. She's US commercial real estate reporter for Bloomberg News. She's with us in the Bloomberg interactive broker studio right now. She's on Twitter, so you can follow her there as well. As Carol mentioned, it's in the current issue of Bloomberg Business Week magazine. So Natalie, let's say that you've saved for years for a down payment on a home, upwards of what, $150,000, like one of the subjects in your story in Business Week. And then you find that that money ends up getting stolen through some sort of hack. What's the recourse there? How does this happen? It's terrifying. It's been happening more rapidly in the US basically, you know, like people enter into these home deals. They're stressed out. It's a crazy housing market. They're trying to seal the deal. A lot of these people, it's their first homes. They don't really know how things are done. They're flooded with emails and it turns out all along. Some hackers have found their way into the system through the channels of maybe a real estate agent or a tidal agent. And they're literally monitoring the correspondence of this deal for months, you know, weeks, if not months. And they're waiting for the perfect moment when the deal is about to be done. And they know that a wire payment has to be sent. And that's when they come in either through, you know, the realtor's email or through a fake email that looks almost identical. And then they send the home buyer fake instructions that looks exactly the same. But they don't know anything that's wrong because no one warns them. The numbers are the same. It's when they're expecting it to come in. So they wire the payment. They think they have a house. And often they don't even realize that they...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,591,2022-10-07 18:53:00
12366," So they wire the payment, they think they have a house and often they don't even realize that they sent the wire payment to a hacker until they show up at the closing table. And they're like okay, so where's the payment, right? Yes, where's the check? They're like, right, we're ready to close and then their title agent is like okay, where's the check? And they're like, what do you mean we sent it two days ago? Well, and that's when they realize. Part of what blows my mind is the amount of time that these hackers are spending to get the make sure they're at the right time, but they also are gathering so much information. How often is this happening? It's happening a lot and we've heard that it started really in 2017 and it's exploded over the past few years. You know, the Secret Service team that we tracked, they recovered about $244 million worth of like stolen business email compromises, a third of which are real estate deals. These are called B-E-N. B-E-C. A whole B-E-C's other. Business email compromise. It's basically hackers infiltrate corporate accounts to send phony and voices and phony wires. It can target every industry, but they're finding a really big jackpot and real estate deals. So what's the recourse for somebody who finds that they've lost their down payment? So if you know within 24 hours, there's more of a chance that you get your money back. If you know exactly what to do, you know who to contact at Secret Service or FBI, you have a bank manager that's helpful that knows what to do. Then maybe you can get all your money back, but unfortunately most of the people that I talked to don't realize that until it's over. But don't they know who the money was sent to because a wire trial, I don't know how it works, but a wire transfer shouldn't be associated, that other account number be associated with somebody. Yes. So unfortunately, what happens is that with the banks, there's a lot of bureaucracy and a lot of miscommunication happening. So that when they contact, like for instance, one of our victims immediately contacted a New Jersey Chase Bank account that it was sent to. And I mean, they don't know who this guy is. So they're not going to randomly freeze one of their clients' accounts just because you say there's fraud. I mean, the whole process needs to be started to close it or why not. And often they're dealing with mid-level managers that have no idea what this is, even though they should. The crazy thing, there are times I've tried to do things digitally and make a payment. And my own bank is like, I'm sorry, your account's frozen. You haven't done enough security steps or something. So there's just so many backstops in the process. So it is amazing. Like how did this ultimately, how does it happen? Are they just getting more sophisticated in terms of the scammers? What is it? Scammers are getting more sophisticated. They know how quickly they have to act. And so they're usually trying to get the money out within 36 hours. And immediately, they move it to different domestic bank accounts across the US, money-mule accounts. And then they either cash it out to cryptocurrency, cash it out in real estate or jewelry or cars or they move it abroad. And by then, the money's been split up across so many different bank accounts that it's extremely hard to track or get any of it back. Okay, this is terrifying for so many reasons. It's not just you know, when it comes to mortgages or when you're buying a house or putting it down payment down. But in other situations, like let's say you have a big tax payment or something and you need to move money between accounts and you actually are emailing with your accountant about that, right? So I'm wondering if there's a way around this. If there is a way, you know, to kind of go old school. For, you know, so someone can show up maybe with an actual paper check at the closing rather than wiring the money. Right, I mean, there's definitely fraud too when it comes to cashiers. But, you know, with this essence. You know, the joking crypto world is. You're talking old school. The joke in the crypto world is, you know, like crypto fixes this, the blockchain fixes this. But, you know, I haven't seen it fix this yet. Yeah, I mean, honestly, there's a simple fix to this and it's really just all the parties involved should at least take an extra step just to warn their clients that this is a big thing that's happening. Like most of the people I talk to after it happens to them, they're like, I had no idea this was even a risk. Well, and then real estate partners are seeing it. And so they're seeing it more and more frequently. And so there is a question of like, you know, kind of warn your clients that listen, make sure before you transfer any money, you know, XYZ because there's been some scams out there. A lot of them maybe in like their emails at the very bottom, they have a tiny disclaimer, which is like, don't send wires that are sent to you by email. But for example, the main victim we highlighted, he mentioned that when he first told his agent what happened, the first thing she said was she wasn't surprised at all. She was like, thank you for the help. She was like, you know,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,592,2022-10-07 18:57:29
12367," main victim we highlighted, he mentioned that when he first told his agent what happened, the first thing she said was she wasn't surprised at all. She was like, thank you for the help. She was like, you know what just actually happened to one of my clients a year ago and he was like, how did this happen to you and you didn't even tell me that this could be a possibility? There are actually though in a digital world, there's actually physical criminals and part of your story you talk about that they were the FBI agents were able to track some individuals down, right? It's a tiny team of secret service agents and you never think of secret service agents. As the ones tracking down financial criminals, you think they're presidential guard. Yeah. But there's a tiny team of secret service agents that are trying to track down these money meals that are moving money through New York, New Jersey bank accounts. And there's individuals right that they've actually tracked you throughout New York City, right? Yes. Yeah. Yeah, there's a group of 11 individuals that were moving the money across different bank accounts, buying new Mercedes-Benz, new vehicles and basically engaging in all these different schemes to get money abroad. Can you have a bank account? Okay. 30 seconds left Natalie. Can you can someone avoid this by doing all this over the phone and making sure that they're actually talking to the parties involved? Yeah. I don't want to ask you if they can avoid it. But is that a safer thing to do? I think the safest thing to do is really just to triple check with all the parties involved, make sure that everyone is on the same page, make sure that you know exactly that. I've done that Sunday because you can see me freaking out right now. Well you do things really like you cause them in like, hey, did you send me that? Is this to you? Natalie Wong, great story, US commercial real estate reporter here at Bloomberg News. This story, among our most red, and it is in the new issue of Bloomberg Business Week magazine, so be sure to check it out.

12368," Music Countdown to the close. Bloomberg's comprehensive cross platform coverage ahead of the U.S. market close starts right now. We count you down to the close just 60 minutes left in the trading session Caroline Hyde remained Bostick Taylor. We join our colleagues, Carol Maser Tim Stenevich, the whole gang together. We go across TV, radio and YouTube to dissect with us all together a really true day. Off more than 400 points on the NASDAQ. Yeah, Caroline, it always makes you forget the rally that was done happened earlier in the week. I've been looking at some underperformance and that is in the chip names in particular. The Philadelphia stock exchange semiconductor index down more than 6% in today's trade. This group is down 40% so far still has about a 3% gain on the week but pressure today. Chipmaker is warning on a weekly basis that demand is sputtering so we do feel like there are signs piling up that the tech downturn may be deeper and longer lasting than feared. And remember we had Samsung AMD reporting disappointing results within hours of each other that widely misprojected. So it just seems like continuing to see. But what I don't understand here, Carol is what two days ago we had those results out of Taiwan semi and I was going to be on semi was the outlier. But why? Because then you had Morgan Stanley basically say that this was a broader read on the chip sector and that it was rebounding and everything was fine and now today we're all pulling our hair out because of the AMD and Samsung. No, have it pivot pivot. Well, is it is a different type of chip makers? I mean different parts of the market but it does feel like when you've got one outlier and a lot of other players saying things are so good. And so it's not semi is massive. So maybe they're able to just like an apple often can kind of deal with some of the tougher. Or perhaps it also to do with you know what AMD said about a slowing demand for the PC market in general. But again, that's something that we knew coming out of COVID, right? We knew that people weren't buying as many PCs. Do I get can I talk about Tesla or do I have time? No, people buying. I think I think I think you're time to let's move. All right, that's fine. I'll talk about Tesla later. Okay. That's fine. I'm proud. Come on. Tesla down. Yeah, okay. It is down about 1560% over the last five days on the day today on the week. I should say there's kind of a one two punch here, right? You have quarterly delivery numbers missing over the last quarter. So that wasn't good. And then of course the Elon Musk and Twitter news sending concerns that he might have to sell more shares in order to find that purchase. Just brutal time for Tesla. Pretty beautiful time. Brutal time. Therefore for the Nasdaq, we're off by three and a half percent. That's the worst performing index. We're down by 394 points. We're off by more than 600 points on the Dow down by 2% we're looking at the S&P of by 2.7 percent. West A since September the 13th, Russell 2000 also of by 2.7 percent Taylor. Energy is still the best performer on the week. And it's get the best weekly performance that we haven't seen since about March. Now, energies you can see there. It's in the red, but it's only off to 10 of 1 percent. And half of the names within that sector are actually still in the green. Everywhere else remain this looks like a broad base sell off. You can't even get any individual security within these sectors that are up maybe about 10 percent of them higher on the day. It really has been a lot of selling on a sector level and an individual security level discretionary and technologies off three and a half to four percent. And I've been taking on a closer look at a lot of the sort of the individual levels here and the individual measures and you get a better sense of just how bad this market is right now. You take a look at Microsoft down of 5 percent here on the day. You're talking about a lot of stocks now that are just because of retesting not only their 52 week lows, but for some of these companies the lowest levels that they've been at more than two years. I mean, you're going back to 2019 even for a company like Meta platforms. We talk about AMD and the chip sector really taking it hard AMD down 13 percent. A lot of the other software makers like ServiceNow moving lower as well. And there are a few bright spots out there including draft kings and basically anything tied to the M&A space. That seems to be some of the juices, but again, that juice is few and far in between draft king, so up 2 percent on the day. Yeah, with the M&A and deals in the air every now and then. Also what's in the air is an awful lot of quon analysts talking about various charts. This one, the rule of 20, we were sort of getting very excited about this a few weeks ago. I seem to recall the stock market signal that has never been wrong. Perfect track record. So says Bank of America basically is pointing to the fact that equity markets haven't often dealt yet. So the video audience is the gauge that looks at the S&P 500 index.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,594,2022-10-07 19:06:08
12369," I've been wrong, perfect track record, so it says Bank of America. Basically, it's pointing to the fact that equity markets haven't often doubt yet. For our radio audience, this is the gauge that looks at the S&P 500 index, trailing price to earnings ratio. In combination with CPI, remember consumer inflation we're getting in next week, we're basically not at 20. You get a need to get to 20 before we hit the bottom. And at the moment, we ain't there yet, we're above 25. Yeah, that's it. I feel like the big debate that's going on, have we bottomed out. Although I would argue that we saw a lot of participation on the rally earlier in the week, and I feel like on the downside, certainly if you look at the S&P volume is down, so I don't know what we're talking about. Was there another technical indicator that a few months ago we were talking about a lot that had a perfect track record of about a more than 50% retracement saying that the bottom was in. Yes, we did. I'm just making sure. It's called cherry picking. Okay, I was just wondering. I just want to make sure I'm thinking about the right thing. But that cherry picking too, I mean, that kind of gets to the idea that there is so much conflicting signals out there, whether you're looking at economic indicators or the technical market indicators. So you could kind of sort of make a bull in bear case, depending on what metrics you want to look at. Not conflicting though, and many would argue that we're still seeing a pretty strong labor department. We certainly got that in this morning's report, right? Like in terms of most of the metrics there, US Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, so catching up with our TV team, Jonathan Farrow earlier this morning though, he did say he'd like to see more when it comes to the participation rate, which did see some negative tones this morning. Check it out. We still have job openings. People are still looking for work. Obviously we'd like to see the participation rate a little higher. I mean, that number went down a little bit this month. I think one tenth of a percent. So we're going to, we have to see what's happening there. Of course, that's the Labor Secretary of the United States. Marty Walsh, I mean, don't you scratch, I mean, scratch your heads a little bit about, you know, here we see the strong labor market continuing, and yet every day we all are talking about some company or other that is talking about job cuts. Well, okay, so we put this question to Becky Francoitz over a manpower group a little earlier in the program. And they said, what about all that anecdotal data that we get from companies like Meta Platforms or the hiring freezes that we hear from from some of the biggest tech companies. And she said, there's a distinction between tech companies and tech workers. So any tech employee who can't find a job ends up getting hired at not necessarily a tech company, but a company that has tech employees. So she's seeing incredible strengths still across the industry, across that sector. There's also difference between layoffs versus just hiring freezes. And there's been a few sort of reading between the lines of some of the big tech companies where it may not be a flat out firing. It just could be a pause in some of the new hiring as well. So I think that's important. But that goes back to the Joltz data too. I mean, you had this huge gap, and technically you would have to shrink before you would start to see sort of that real mass layoffs. And maybe that is a blessing in disguise that we had those 11 million job openings. So maybe the job openings go away first and that saves a lot of folks who actually have their jobs and allow them to keep their jobs. Yeah, so 1.7 people on the sidelines for everyone job that's open. But that's why we therefore look at the wage part of the equation. And there, I mean, 5% is well off where we need to come down to to stop fueling basic inflation. And that's the big print we got to look forward to next week, whether or not that runs hot, I mean, more than 8%, it's unlikely to be cool enough to sort of make us once again start fighting the Fed. Yeah, right? Oh, go ahead. Oh, obviously, and don't forget about the produced of price numbers, which are still going to come in about 8% if you believe the Bloomberg estimates. And then those retail sales numbers at the end of the week, which are also going to be kind of a radic. Yeah, so certainly to keep an eye on, I do think going back to the labor market, there's a whole idea of labor hoarding and companies just holding on to workers because they remember what it was like during the pandemic in terms of trying to find some workers. So when they needed them, so you do wonder how much of that is going on. And maybe we'll kind of keep those labor market numbers strong for a while. All right, guys. I'll set. OK, thank you. I'm so glad. We're going to be back in less than an hour's time. We're going to cut you down. Wrap up the trading day, the trading week. We'll be back for Beyond the Bell at 4 p.m. Wall Street Time. OK. This is Bloomberg Business Week with Carol Maser and Bloomberg Quick Takes Tim Stenevig on Bloomberg Radio. I just want to mention a headliner cross. US August consumer credit rose $32.2 billion. The estimate was for again, $25 billion. So revolving credit was up 17.2 billion. Non revolving credit was up 15 billion. But this is an important thing to watch. I know it's something that Vincin Nurella has talked about and others have talked about is that as consumers spending, maybe continues to stay strong.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,595,2022-10-07 19:10:43
12370," billion. But this is an important thing to watch. I know it's something Vince Signorella has talked about and others have talked about is that as consumers spending maybe continues to stay strong, which you want to watch is how much of it is being done on credit. And that eventually at some point the credit card company is going to be like enough and consumers are going to say enough and I can't spend it on credit. So just another number to keep a watch on. I want to talk about a word that I don't think we've used in this entire broadcast. Pivot. How did you know I was going to say that? Because I'm smart. You are smart. I don't think we said pivot. And it's interesting when you know the S&P 500 is down what close to 3% on the day the NASDAQ down right now. Well, the fit pivot not happening. That's what I'm saying. And the exactly what I'm saying the NASDAQ down 3.6 the Dow down 2.2. We're still up for the week and glasses have full Carol master. Well, the what I guess I am saying I do think we're trying to find a bottom. And you know, don't don't trade on me. But I'm just saying that if you look at the five day trade, you know, you're up almost 2% on the Dow. You're up about 1.5% on the S&P and you're still you just up about 1% on the NASDAQ 100. We've definitely paired the gains that we got earlier in the week because of today's trade and yesterday's trade for that matter. I guess to some extent, but you know, bottoms don't all happen and then just go, you know, they take a while. NASDAQ down 32% for the year. The S&P down 23.6. Let's get to Nancy Lyons who's in Washington, D.C. for World of National News. Thanks, Dan. President Biden is welcoming the latest report on job creation. He spoke this afternoon while visiting a Hagerstown Maryland plant that makes parts for Volvo trucks. The president said the addition of 263,000 jobs in September still puts the nation on a path to long term sustainable growth. That's 10 million jobs since I've come into office. The fastest job growth at any point of any president in all American history. The pace of job growth is cooling while still powering our recovery forward. We need to bring inflation down without giving up all the historic economic progress that working class and low class people have made. President Shided Republicans who voted against infrastructure spending and called it he said, socialism. And he named a half dozen who have sent letters to the administration asking for projects in their districts. In Washington, there's Chepin, Bloomberg Radio. President Biden is worried Russian President Vladimir Putin's threats to use tactical nuclear weapons are real and could lead to quote Armageddon. Nuclear weapons expert Joseph Serencioni agrees with Biden's assessment. President Biden is absolutely right. We've had many nuclear accidents and near misses over the last 60 years. But we haven't been this close to the intentional use of nuclear weapons since the Cuban missile crisis. Joseph Serencioni says war game show repeatedly a nuclear exchange that begins with a tactical nuclear weapon can easily escalate.

Streaming on YouTube. I clicked. If you want to see Carol click in the wrong thing, just watch on YouTube and then you can see it in action. It's fun guys. Let's talk about Credit Suisse. The story that keeps on giving. It's not just Twitter and Elon Musk. Credit Suisse offered to buy back up to $3 billion of its own debt in a move to aimed at calming investors, jitters ahead of the unveiling of a critical strategy. We've been talking about this story all week. Yeah, this announcement is signal of confidence in that the bank has enough liquidity to take advantage of the recent slump in debt markets and scoop up its own debt at a discount. Credit Suisse shares and bonds rose in Friday training. Trading will be cost of ensuring against default fell. So you know, this is a company that's going through a lot, right? Yeah, we talked about it with Shinoli yesterday. And about selling off its investment banking business. And so it's interesting. It's been a very tumultuous week for the company. It's really questioning the company's stability. It bit a mid-a broader sell off the CEO is due to detail the bank's second strategy over a holiday year. That's supposed to happen at the end of the month. And that's widely seen as a critical opportunity to restore faith in the lender after more than a year of losses in management missteps. The debt repurchase plan is quote-.""",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,596,2022-10-07 19:15:00
12371," all in a year that's supposed to happen at the end of the month and that's widely seen as a critical opportunity to restore faith in the lender after more than a year of losses in management missteps. The Deary Purchase Plan is, quote, a smart move. It builds confidence and liquidity of the balance sheet and helps lower credit suites as funding costs. That's according to the head of financials credit at federated or mayes of Alibu Maria al-Owadi. I told that to Bloomberg and London. All right. So it's a story that we're certainly watching to see kind of what happens next in terms of this company and how they ultimately move forward and really regain investor confidence. I think we talked about it that this stock is down. I want to say about 40 or 50 percent this year, but I should really check in terms of the ADRs. But we talked about how much has been pummeled this year. Well, you're checking that, Carol. I'll talk a little bit about what we spoke about Wish and Oli. I asked specifically if it was a credit suite story or a story about the broader financial sector in worldwide or in Europe. It's down 49 percent this year. So you were exactly right. Just checking. And she said it's more of a credit suite story. Yeah, it's very particular. This is a company that's a bank that's been plagued by a lot of things. All right. Mark Radio.

Let's head right over to the first word breaking news desk for today's afternoon call. Here is Bill Maloney. And good afternoon, Charlie. That's right, US stocks have been plunging since that 830 jobs report, downstriently down 689 points, SESAB dropped 110, and NASDAQ is lower by 3.8%. The US 10 year old at 3.89% gold is trading lower by 17. Oil is surging, and Bitcoin is trading lower by 2.9%. Among the main 11 SB sectors, all were trading in the red that by losses in tech and consumer discretionary in the Dow, all the stocks were also trading in the red, but by 5% losses in Intel and Walgreens. In Indian News credit suites SPG units, draws PIMCO and Centerbridge interest, and Brookdale Senior Living is set to explore a sale. In other news, AMD plunged 13% after preliminary third quarter sales misprojections by more than a billion in wrapping things up Fed's way and said we need to get interest rates up further. Live from the first year of Brick and News desk on Bill Maloney, Charlie. Much Bill Maloney into here live, breaking news over your Bloomberg time squawk, SQU8WK on your terminal. I'm Charlie, how about that? Is a Bloomberg business flat? Charlie, thank you so much for that update. Over the summer, the blockchain ecosystem toppled raising $15 million in a series A funding round. That's on top of a $5 million seed round, which happened back in 2020. We want to talk a little bit about the business and what they're up to. We got Chris Georgian, the founder and managing director of toppled joining us from Houston, Texas. Chris, how are you? You're in great. Happy to be on today. Yeah, thanks so much for joining us. I, Coincerer, show called crypto IRL and I still think there's so much confusion over what exactly the blockchain is and what it can do. In a recent episode, I actually talked about this. I said that we've been hearing about the promises the blockchain for over a decade at this point. Consumers have yet to see a point in their lives that has actually gotten better as a result of this technology. Would you disagree with that or would you agree with that? Well, I would definitely agree with that. For a lot of people, it hasn't become apparent yet. We're starting to have some small use cases, supply chain traceability, carbon credits, starting to be tracked this way. But I think we all need to remember that blockchain came onto the scene from a retail perspective very early in its lifespan. AI got started in the 60s, but I think none of us really heard about it until 15 years ago. So, blockchain's kind of a, had its coming out party in a very public way. To remind our world, Chris, what you are doing specifically and what kind of companies are you working with and maybe who are your biggest partners or customers at this point? Absolutely. So, the way that we think about top is, we think of it as blockchain for sustainability for positive impact or to use an acronym for ESG. And what that means is we're doing everything from tracking and tracing conflict freedigments moving around the world or fair wage agriculture. We work with energy companies and big project developers to issue track, buy and sell carbon credits. So we do a lot with power in the energy transition and we do a lot to help clean up supply chains, making sure that they're properly environmentally sustainable and also following good labor practices as well. So, dig a little bit deeper. How do you do that? The big part, you know, you say ESG and kind of the hairs of my neck.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,598,2022-10-07 19:23:25
12373," and also following good labor practices as well. So dig a little bit deeper. How do you do that? Because the big part, you say A, H, G, and the hairs on my neck perk up because I think we keep saying, or I certainly keep saying that E, S, G feels like it's going through a reckoning after years and years of good performance in an upbeat market, a bullish market. It's going through a reckoning where people want visibility, transparency, and a better understanding. And so tell us what's your proprietary technology that helps customers make sure that they are complying by real E, S, G means, if you will. Absolutely. And the way that we think about how blockchain fits into this is blockchain can be open. Blockchain can be decentralized. And really one of the biggest problems with a lot of ESG claims is they're being assembled after the fact that the main corporate office months after something supposedly or hopefully happened somewhere out in a plan or out in the field. Well, blockchain technology and what we're able to do is get data directly from when it's happening. So maybe that's taking inputs directly from SMS information from the far-fetched reporting end. What's SMS? Tech messages for everyone. So maybe farmers are text interacting with the system or there's IoT or satellite information that's being fed directly into this technology. So you don't have kind of like after the fact report being assembled, which you've got data being sourced directly from on the ground or where that impact is supposed to be happening. And that's being able to relay direct-to investors, get more transparent access to it, or consumers, get more transparent access to it. Chris, this conversation reminds me of the way that we've seen Google Glass develop and the technology and heads up displays develop over the last decade. Ouch. Well, only in the sense of when this came out, that Google had this video of everyday people wearing these glasses and heads up display saying, walking down a subway into a subway station underground. And it's like, oh, something pops up. Subways closed, better go, use another one, that sort of thing. But what ended up happening was consumers didn't want that type of technology. They didn't like the way that they interacted with it. The technology was then used in warehouses. And it's caught up on the industrial side of things. Do you see that happening with blockchain? Like, something was promised to consumers, but it's actually more applicable in an industrial space. I think the earliest use cases absolutely will fall into that pattern. And that's really the pattern that we're following as well. It's right now it's behind the scenes technology. It's powering applications and platforms that are all being built on top of it. There's still probably a long way that innovation can go. And so just like we might see Google Glass or a competitor make a reemergence once the technology is ready to come back out of industry. And I say in the next two to four years, we'll see that on the consumer side for blockchain as well. Hey, listen, just got about 45 seconds left here. Robloomberg, we care about this kind of stuff. You guys are raising money from investors. So what's been the growth in your business? Top line, and I'm assuming you're not profitable yet, but you can clarify. So some of this is kind of a, still private information, but over the last year we've onboarded about 30 different projects. I've all across the world onto the platform. I think we're active with projects across five continents right now. Team is growing healthily. I think we've just onboarded our 35th person. So it's also a great time to be hiring in the tech space. So we've been really enjoying that as well. All right, well, no slowdown. So is that like, double digit growth? Yeah, I didn't hear it. Pretty close to that, yeah. OK, well listen, good to know. And it's definitely world that we're interested in. Tim is all over it on his show. You watch our new show, Crypto IRL, Tonight 830, Bloomberg TV. Little, little love. I like that. That's the like, fifth of more plugs, OK? I love it.

12375," I think that that's something that is important that we can see to put those gains. We still have job openings, people are still looking for work. Obviously we would like to see the participation rate a little higher. I mean that number went down a little bit this month. I think one tenth of a percent. So we have to see what's happening there. Chip stocks selling off case in point, advanced micro devices plunging now by 13.9 percent. We've got intel down 5.5 percent in video now down by 8.3 percent. Recapping 10 year yield 3.87 percent S&P down 3.3 percent. I'm Charlie Pellet. That is a Bloomberg business flash. Alright Charlie, thank you so much. So we want to talk about Walt Disney's ESPN. Nearing a large new partnership with sports betting firm, Draft Kings, according to people familiar with the matter. And we did see this news sending shares of Draft Kings soaring. We got a great group with us. We got Crystal C, Deals reporter for Bloomberg. Nears she's with us in the Bloomberg Interactive Broker Studio. Also with us right now is Jerry Smith media reporter for Bloomberg news. Here with us we got a full house in the Bloomberg Interactive Broker Studio. Crystal I want to start with the M&A news here. The potential talks I should say, not necessarily M&A, but you're the Deals reporter. So bring us to give us an idea of what this looks like. So we learned that Disney, ESPN is nearing a large deal with partnership with Draft Kings. But they're actually not all of details yet. We don't really know how it's going to be structured, how ESPN is going to pay. Or what kind of incentive, how is it going to entail? We don't know that much yet, but we know that the stocks react quite positively on both ends. Which is a really, really big win for Disney as well. Because just last month of you remember they had an activist calling to spin off ESPN. So this is actually making a good comeback. And Draft Kings at their high were about 8.8% still up about 2%. Jerry, does it make sense? I mean, we know when we did our Super Bowl show or head of the Super Bowl, I'm going to say. Yeah, when we were at LA. All of the sports guys, Amazon, Disney. I feel like everybody was talking about how important it was to have a gaming company. What was that word, engagement over and over again? Yeah, engagement, engagement, engagement. Yeah, that's right. I mean, you could break it down from both sides. From ESPN side, obviously they would be getting a significant amount of money from a sports betting company for a large partnership. And ESPN is really trying just like a lot of other TV networks are trying to cash in on the legalization of sports betting. And their viewers are not only just watching sports, but they want to make bets on sports now that it's legal and roughly half the country. And what ESPN said they want to do is try to reduce the friction. So if you're watching a game, you can make a bet very easily. I mean, the industry really is moving towards betting not just on the outcome of a game, but even moments in the game. And if ESPN can find a way for that viewer to seamlessly watch a game and place bets at the same time. I mean, that's sort of the holy grail here. Is this cell there? Is she cheering on Tom? No, I'm just kidding. But ESPN is a studio in Vegas, right? That's right. I mean, ESPN has, you know, it's complicated because on one hand, they're owned by Disney. Right. And Disney is a very family friendly company and sports betting up until very recently was really considered to be taboo. On the other hand, it has embraced sports betting. It's not taking bets, but they have sports betting analysts on their shows. They have sports betting related information on their shows. They have partnerships already with Caesars Endraft Kings, where if you're on the ESPN website, you, you know, their links are integrated. So you can click on a link and it'll take you to the sports book where you can place a bet. But what this would be potentially is a much deeper relationship between ESPN and draft Kings. So how do you... Okay. Well, so what does that, what does that word mean, right? Those two words deeper relationship crystal. I mean, does that mean that one could acquire, you know, draft Kings that Disney could actually acquire? And the thing is, we're talking like a different culture here, right? Disney is Disney. Yeah, they only ESPN, but they also have all the assets that have to do with, you know, Mickey Mouse and Snow White. Mickey likes to gamble, I heard. Oh, no. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. But that's a serious question. And Jerry can weigh on that too, before really, because there's some serious cultural differences. Yeah, that's true. Like you have a really wholesome family-oriented media company marrying potentially a... well, having a partner show. You've never seen Jack Sparrow, a pair of things. No, I'm stopping. I'm sorry. I'm in the party mood. No, go ahead, go ahead. No, but it's true. Like there are some speculation on, you know, whether there could be a potential M&A here, whether one could...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,601,2022-10-07 19:41:43
12376," I'm stopping. I'm sorry. I'm in a party mood. No, go ahead, go ahead. No, but it's true. There are some speculation on whether there could be a potential M&A here, whether one could own the other. It will most likely be Disney buying STN, but there has been endless speculation on that. But I think that has been quite dismissed, quite promptly, mostly because there is a license, Jericho and Wayne on this, and the license holder is draft kings. And I don't know how it's going to be transferred, but it's really complex. And Disney, it's a whole empire, like you said, to marry that culture, it would be extremely difficult. And also, you don't know how Shae Holder is going to react. And Disney Shae Holder had been through quite a bit with the whole third point activism campaign in the past couple of months, and it only just sat in September. So this one, it's bringing them kind of a home run, but if they do end up trying to buy draft kings, I could see, you know, Shae Holder is being not too happy. That's right. And I think the other, I mean, ESPN actually owns a stake in draft kings, which they acquired when Disney bought the entertainment assets of Fox. But you know, from draft kings perspective, I mean, they are in a real battle with Fandall and Caesars and Bed MGM, really to sign up as many customers as they can. They're spending gobs and gobs of money on advertising, giving away free bets to get people to sign up. So having a deeper partnership with the largest sports media giant in the country is a real opportunity for them. Right. And gives, do you think it's likely ultimately? It's hard to say. But you know, I mean, they are what we've reported is that they are nearing a very big partnership and you could see how it could be a win-win for both sides here. Yeah, really fascinating. Disney, by the way, $175 billion market cap and draft kings, about $7.3 billion. So just a little perspective. Jerry Smith, Media reporter, Apple and Burg news. Thank you so much. Crystal C, deals reporter, Apple and Burg news both here in our studio. Let's get to Washington DC in the 99.1 studio there where Nancy Lyons is standing by. Hey, Nance. Thanks to President Biden is hailing the September jobs report, calling the numbers quote, an encouraging sign. The economy is moving towards steady growth. Our economy created 263,000 jobs last month. That's 10 million jobs since I've come into office. That's the fastest job growth at any point of any president in all American history. The president spoke from a Volvo plant in Hagerstown, Maryland. Well, the battle for control of Congress is heating up with about a month until the midterm elections. In Pennsylvania, Republican Senate candidate Mehmed Oz has cut into Democrat John Federman's lead with the barrage of ads on crime. And former president Trump's super PAC has booked more than $2 million in ads in Pennsylvania and Ohio. Bloomberg government reporter Emily Wilkins has more on where things stand right now. Democrats are actually a little more likely to win the control of the Senate. That's what we're seeing from a lot of projections, including at 538. But of course, at this point, it's very close. It's still anyone's game. Bloomberg government, Emily Wilkins, New York mayor Eric Adams is declaring a state of emergency over the city's migrant crisis and says they'll spend $1 billion by the end of the year to deal with it. As part of his order, he's instructing all relevant agencies to construct humanitarian relief centers to provide assistance. In Major League Baseball, the Guardians beat the rays two to one in their wild card game. The Phillies and the Cardinals are scoreless. Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg quick take powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. All right, Nancy Lyon. Thank you so much. Thanks for joining us with an update on World of National News here on this Friday, Carol Master, Tim Stenevich, live in our Bloomberg interactive broker studio. We are watching the markets. And as you know, we are seeing we did bounce off our lows again. And again, I would argue that to some extent, the trade, are we trying to find a bottom? We are off our lows, but still down almost 3.9% on the NASDAQ and down nearly 3% on the S&P 500 down, about 2.2%. But again, well off our highs of the session, but also just off our lows. And the main time. We're even seeing energy down today. We are seeing energy down. Yeah, down 7.10% of 1%. I mean, every single industry group in the S&P 500 is down today. And that begs the question of, you know, how much of what's going on in terms of the energy markets to? We know that there are, we talk about the OPEC cut earlier in the week. And that is certainly putting pressure on the Internet.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,602,2022-10-07 19:45:55
12377," The question of how much of what's going on in terms of the energy markets too, we know that there are, we talk about the OPEC cut earlier in the week and that is certainly putting pressure on the energy supplies, but also there may be will not be a need or want to raise production levels, especially if producers think that the economy, global economy is slowing down and this is why we have to watch usage by something like China in particular or just the major markets around the world. The perfect segue to talk about what's happening with central banks is they start to shift billions of dollars in cash, readying for intervention. Central banks around the world are swapping their stockpiles of US treasuries for cash, just in case they need to intervene in markets to bolster their currencies. Yeah, foreign monetary officials purge $29 billion in treasury securities in the weekend in October 5th, bringing the four week decline in holdings to $81 billion. This is according to the Federal Reserve data. It is the most extreme outflow since the beginning of the pandemic back in March of 2020, bringing total holdings of $2.91 trillion with the US dollar stronger than ever and recession risk rising. Little surprise, essential bankers are stocking their cash coffers, so making sure that they've got money on hand for whatever comes. Yeah, we're talking about all over the world, Carol. Policy makers from Tokyo to Santiago have already stepped into foreign exchange markets to prop up their currencies with improvised solutions such as selling dollars directly to the market. Still though, as writes in Icap economist Lou Crandell wrote in a note to clients, much of the foreign officials selling in September appears to have been precautionary. And those weaker currencies also, you know, you worry about the inflationary impact of those weaker currencies on various economies as well.

12378," [♪ music. Fart sometimes heavy drum. Markets, headlines, and breaking news 24 hours a day at Bloomberg dot com. The Bloomberg business app and at Bloomberg Quick Take. This is a Bloomberg Business Flash. From Bloomberg World, Hank Waters, I'm Charlie Pada Jobs Friday. The Bloomberg market a slight bounce off the bottom emphasis on slight 13 minutes to go with the S&P now down by 108 Trump there of 2.9%. A couple of minutes ago we were trading at the worst level of the day. We've got the Dow down 664 down 2.2% the Nasdaq 100 index down by 4% and Nasdaq Composite index down now by 3.9%. 4.30% spot gold down $16 the ounce down 1% right now, 16.95 76 on gold while West Texas, NVIDIA crude up 4.7% 92 56 a barrel. Wall Street got a reality check big time data showing a hot labor market that will likely keep the fed on its aggressive hiking trail. Recapping a sell off ahead of the clothes here with the S&P down now by 3%. I'm Charlie Pada, that is a Bloomberg Business Flash. I'm driving in my car, a turn on the radio. Yeah, but you let me drive. Oh, no, no, no. Who's going on a drive at home? Honey, please, I'll do the drive. Drive-on. Listen to me, I want to drive. It's the driving. It's the question of the drive. This is the drive to the clothes. The punk's a music while driving up to the dawn on Bloomberg Radio. All right, everybody, just about 11 minutes left in today's trading session, getting ready to wrap up what has been a wild, volatile week here in the trade. Having said that, I do want to point out as we see stock selling off in a big way today, we're off our worst levels of the session. And we are still up nearly 2% on the Dow Jones industrial average this week, up about 1.3% for the S&P for the week overall and just holding on to about a 6-10% of 1% gain from the stock price. I'm going to start with the last 5 days, but again, seeing some significant selling in today's session. And I will say that one reduced volume, I think, in particular for the S&P 500. Let's get into it with Brian Jacobson, senior investment strategist at all spring global investments. They've got a little bit shy of $500 billion in assets under management. Brian joins us once again on the phone from Milwaukee. Brian, how are you doing? Oh, yeah, better than the markets. Okay, that's good that we don't tie, you know, how you're going to tie up the stock price. How do you weigh in on what's going on here? Because at the start of the week, we saw a two-day rally that was the biggest two-day rally that we've seen in two years, leading many to say, wait a second, perhaps there was some short covering there, but also echoes of maybe a Fed pivot. We can throw that out the window now, right? Yeah, I think that Fed pivot, that's not going to happen until they take the blinders off, right? And I don't think that they really want to even contemplate changing their tune until they get the 4.5% with the Fed funds rate. I think that they have a lot of interest in the Fed. I think that's a lot of interest for them. And I think that's one of the things that we have to do in the Fed. We have to do it all spring on my systematic edge, multi-asset team. We have one of our many tactical calls this morning, discussing kind of doing a little debrief about what was going on. And I think that, you know, Ned Davis was famous for a lot of his wisdom, the trend is your friend, and don't fight the Fed.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,605,2022-10-07 19:57:06
12379, debrief about what was going on and i think that you know net davis was famous for a lot of his uh... wisdom the trend is your friend and don't fight the fed but uh... now you can compare for you that by saying don't fight the trend because the fed isn't your friend and the trend unfortunately is towards weakness in terms of the meeting you talked about having with your team how much did coming how much did finding a bottom kind of come up in that discussion or nearing about them because the market was very very oversold prior to the rally earlier this week yeah and i will be agree that it was generally oversold and we're expecting some bear market bounces uh... one of the challenges is that just looking back at history and recognizing that most bear markets don't really and until recessions begin right and uh... you know that's just been the history going back to nineteen fifty with the eleven bear markets that we've had around uh... recessions and they typically and within a month or two of the recession starting now i think you could look at earnings season and quarterly earnings we've actually had two sequential quarters in a row of declined in s&p five hundred as reported in hopper in earnings so maybe we already have a profit recession in the books uh... but the problem is that we probably don't have the economic recession the broader one until sometime in two thousand twenty three so you say probably already in earnings recession but not necessarily an economic recession yet exactly and we think that maybe this is that's kind of what makes this time somewhat unique is that the earnings recession maybe happened before the economic recession so then the question for us becomes one of how do you build a portfolio that's most resilient to an economic recession and that's where there's all sorts of wonderful divergences within the market small cap value emerging markets from uh... valuation perspective look like they've already experienced those recessionary conditions whereas other parts maybe not so much and let me ask you so if it's an earnings recession already why aren't companies letting go of more workers that ultimately would show up in the labor numbers yeah you know i think because of how challenging it was to fill those vacancies they might be a little hesitant to let them out exactly so it's kind of the economic theory of labor hoarding where it's one of the reasons why the labor market is a lagging economic indicator uh... you don't really look at it for an indicator about where the economy is going because you know it's costly to find someone trained them and uh... companies you know they don't necessarily just want to let those people go uh... and it's uh... one of the reasons why it's uh... little uncomfortable to hear the fed talk so much about what i'm looking to see more labor market weakness because you're not going to see the labor market weakness until it's too late for the rest of the economy that just means that uh... you're already in the midst of the drawdown of uh... broader economic activity what kind of scenario brian is priced into equity markets right now i you know the way that we're looking at it is that the market is pricing in a fairly mild recession uh... one where uh... maybe you know there's a little bit more downside uh... we're expecting to see some more bear market rally some choppy trading probably until the fed actually does uh... begin to pivot which isn't likely going to be until maybe third quarter of two thousand twenty three so perhaps for the full next year we can expect to have this type of uh... choppy trading ahead of us uh... and so we think that the market is what the top of your here it's the top of your year but how much choppyness happens though as again you try to find a bottom and i guess i keep pushing this a little bit because if i look at you know we're still on track for the best weekend stocks i look at the s and p five hundred in the past month is that a significant trade essentially yeah it's not interesting that it's one of the best weeks but also one of the worst days uh... and and that is i think one of the characteristics of the finding a bottom but it doesn't just because you find a bottom doesn't mean that you have to rise from that bottom and i think that's the position that we're in right now okay that's interesting towards that bottom and it's just going to be that choppy trading until we do get a whiff of a fed pivot uh... which is a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,605,2022-10-07 19:59:07
12380," the position that we're in right now. Okay, that's interesting. Towards that bottom, and it's just going to be that choppy trading until we do get a whiff of a Fed pivot, which isn't likely going to happen until, you know, they get up to 4.5% and hold it for a while, in which, you know, is good for active traders and active managers like on my team, we do a lot of tactical trades. And so it's a fun way to try to add value, but it's not necessarily the most comfortable ride for strategic long-term investors. So when do we start to see, I mean, it's interesting because if you say that, you know, the Fed pivot could be unlikely until we get up to 4.5%, when do we get there? Because as Mike McKee has talked about on our air a lot, it's, you know, as important as how long it stays at, you know, the terminal rate. True, exactly. It's the entire contour of the path of rate types. And I think that's why the market maybe got a little excited on Monday and Tuesday, the idea that's, oh, maybe we only have to go up to four and a quarter and maybe they can begin to pivot mid 2023, but looking at Fed fund futures today, now it's pricing in, well, maybe they want to get up to an upper end of about 4.75. Right, right. And hold it to it until towards the end of 2023. And that seems reasonable. And it's that change in the expectation, which you might see that as far as some more dissents from some of the more dovish numbers of the Fed that maybe they've pushed things too far, too fast, and they need to take a little breather. Just got about 40 seconds left here. So we can talk all the macro that we want, but ultimately at the end of the day, right? You've got to do something for your investors. And they don't always love to just throw things in cash, although in this environment, we know cash has been more interesting than as of late. So what do we do with money right now, Brian? Yeah, well, cash is a wonderful investment as far as with the yield that you can get on it. And so our short duration strategies are doing quite well as a result of this increase in yields. But we're finding some really good opportunities. Longer term consumer staples, small cap value, emerging markets, especially those on the emerging market side with a focus on equity income. And even just adding some of the- You're not worried about the strong dollar on the emerging markets just quickly? Not really all that worried about it, because maybe we might be closer to the peak of the dollar as opposed to the trough for the dollar. So a lot of the pain is hopefully mostly behind us. All right, we got to run. Hey, listen, have a great weekend. Brian Jacobson, he's senior investment strategist at all spring global investments, $476 billion in assets under management on the phone from Mill Walkie. And folks, we just have about 2 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 left in today's trading session. We're bouncing off our lows, but still down about 2.8% for the S&P 500 Dow Jones industrial average down more than 600 points. That too is a decline of about 2% and the NASDAQ down 3.7% and 413 points to the downside. Again, off our lows, but nonetheless, a lot of selling. All right, time to head over to our TV team for Beyond the Bell. Live on Radio TV and YouTube. We're counting it down to the close. Beyond the Bell, Bloomberg's comprehensive cross-platform coverage of the US market closed starts right now. And right now, we are two minutes away from the end of the trading day. Romain Boston, Caroline High, Taylor Riggs counting it down to the closing bell. Here to help take us beyond the bell. It's our global simulcast. Join right now by Carol Maser and Tim Stenevik. We welcome our audiences across Bloomberg Television Radio as well as on YouTube and Carol. It's been a incredibly wild week. You go back to those first two days where it looked like this market was ready really to take this rally to a new level and a lot of that being unwound over the last three days. Yeah, really the juxtaposition of those two things. Keep in mind, we were just talking with our market guest. So we are on track for the best weekly gain in the S&P in about a month. At the same time, we are on track for the biggest drop, daily drop for the S&P in about a month. So that just plays to exactly what you just said, Romain. Yeah, we spoke to Brian Jacobson, Senior Investment Strategist, all spring global investments just now. And he said, not necessarily get used to days like today, but choppy trading and not just to the beginning of next year, really until the end of next year. He said that until we start to see 4.5% or 4.75% from the Federal Reserve and then they're going to hold it for a while, we've got to see evidence of an actual pivot there when it comes to interest rates. And that could be the end of next year. We've heard even more bearish calls in that Tim on TV, talking about the lost decade, maybe at least another last couple of years just as you may.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,606,2022-10-07 20:03:32
12381," Hivett there when it comes to interest rates and that could be the end of next year. We've heard even more bearish calls than that Tim on TV talking about the lost decade maybe at least another lost couple years just as you mentioned as well 2023 and beyond. I think Caroline for me what I've been really thinking about with all of these analysts is you need peak yields and a few more months after that. You really need to fed to understand that they're holding type for some time and the markets are going to have a hard time as that Clissel told us turning around before that point. And the Fed potentially breaking something that's something we keep hearing and voyeur, saying a little bit earlier the cracks perhaps in the bond market already signs of this. Yeah, lots of keeping eye on here the final seconds of trading on this Friday afternoon. We're taking a look at a Dow Jones industrial average is going to finish the day down by more than 600 points. That's down about 2% here on a percentage basis so we should point out on a weekly basis the Dow Jones industrial average still in the green by about 2% here over the last five days. S&P 500 down 104 points or about 2.8% on the daily basis higher on the week by 1.5%. The Nasdaq composite down 3.8% here on the day higher on the week by about 0.7%. Meanwhile the Russell 2000 finished the day lower by about 2.9%. Yeah, and we did see an uptick in terms of volume compared to what we've seen in the past five days for the S&P and the Nasdaq. So looking certainly picking up some momentum. Hey, just want to mention Taylor about 474 names in the S&P lower today 29 higher. So pretty broad based in terms of the selling. Yeah, I see that here too. Want some of the individual sectors, Carol? So you're smart and right really to point that out. Some of the cool best performers are still very much in the red. I'll point out energy sector. It's off about 7.10% of 1%. It's a huge winner for the week though. Still having one of the best weeks that we haven't seen since March as you've looked at a lot of the production cuts and a rebound in oil prices. So energy is off today, but otherwise it really has been a lot of money. So it's off today, but otherwise it really has been a bullish story for the year. Everything else, as you can see, a lot of red on the screen as well. Take a look at, well, it's media, it's technology, it's software and service, it's semi conductors. We talked a lot about AMD that's off 13%. So all of those sectors, if you think about those long duration equity assets, those are all four, five, almost 6% as well on the day. Pretty significant though, that energy also down today, pretty wild to see that. All right, let's get to some of the gainers. Fingers crossed that they hold and they have a lot of energy that they have. So, I think that's a lot of the gainers, fingers crossed that they hold and they have draft kings, which was up 8.8% at its highs today, finishing with about a 3.3% gain. You know this story, it's on the Bloomberg Walt Disney's ESPN nearing a large new partnership with draft kings according to people familiar. So that's certainly got to kick to the upside in today's session. Cano health also kind of special situations playing out today. News that CVS has said to be an exclusive talk to buy cano health according to people familiar, no certainty that a deal will be reached, but nonetheless, this name was up 9% today's session. So, holding on to most of its gains today. And then we had deaths come. It was top of the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ 100, surging Alice positive after Medicare update on coverage for its glucose monitoring. And so, expanding coverage, Alice weighing in, Dexcom makes those monitors. So, this has been a good thing for them. That's talk again up about 7% in today's session. All right. And that's actually the biggest mover on the week in the S&P 500 to up about 26% of the day. So, we have a $1,200,000 on the S&P 500 to up about 26%, 27%. Yeah, really significant. Thanks. We got some superlatives on the downside as well. Let's start with AMD Advanced Micro Devices, finishing the day down by more than 14%. That was one of the companies that ended up moving lower today. What I'm looking at right now is AMD being the company that is at the bottom of the S&P 500. It's biggest drop since March of 2020 on a percentage basis down there. After the bell, we got preliminary third quarter sales numbers that they miss projections by more than a billion dollars, blaming the PC market for hurting sales, citing weaker demand in a build up of inventory in the supply chain. It's hitting other companies as well. It's ended up hitting, and it ended up hitting Nvidia, certainly weight on the entire chip sector. We got this morning results from Samsung as well. And then, Carol, you mentioned the Canon news, CBS Health also finished and they did down by more than 10%. So, double whammy here. We did speak to Jonathan Palmer over at Bloomberg Intelligence and Senior Healthcare Analyst. And he ended up saying that it wasn't just that Canon deal that weighed on CBS. It was the Medicare health insurance plans that lost ground in US government quality ratings today. He actually argued that that that was a bigger hit on the company's stock today. Meanwhile, let's have a little look at what happened across assets. Let's have a little look at what happened across assets.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,607,2022-10-07 20:08:23
12382," V.S. was the Medicare health insurance plans that lost ground in U.S. government quality ratings today. He actually argued that that was a bigger hit on the company's stock today. Meanwhile, let's have a little look what happened to cross asset for a moment because it was a day where, well, interestingly, oil defied everything. We still are more worried about the production side, the cuts, the OPEC plus talk, than we are about the demand pullback that potentially a more hawkish Federal Reserve signals. WTI crude up 4.7 percent, Brent crude up 3.6 percent. Federal gas actually rolling over as we are less worried about the production side of natural gas here in the United States. But really, this spoke to, therefore, some outperformance of the Canadian loony with the outperformance in the Norwegian crown. But in general, this is a story of weakness versus king dollar, king dollar back on top as we see resilience in the jobs market. The means the Federal Reserve is not for turning. So we see a dollar index that is strengthening by 4.5 percent. We see the key we off by almost percentage point. We see a really Aussie dollar feeling some of the pain about metals. And I am looking at sovereign bonds just across the board, yields push higher, whether in Europe, it is at the up 20 basis points on a two year. We are seeing some talking tough across the more hawkish central bags tailor. It is a hawkish central bank that continues to move front end, middle, long end yield curves for the day and for the week as well. On the day you are looking at yields that are still up about 6, 7, 8 basis points all the way across the curve. We are all for us on TV, we have been talking about the big superlatives of a two year yield that is up about 5 straight weeks in a row and a 10 year yield that is now climbing for 10 straight weeks that is the longest straight since 1984 when 10 year yields jumped about 12 weeks in a row. So there has been just sort of this consistent theme and consistent narrative. And a long term one year GP chart, it is deadly scary. All right. Quickly this is changing. It is really hard, it does feel very harsh and when you think about that trend line, especially when it comes to yields, right? Because how long have we been talking about where do we top out in yields, where do we bottom out in the equity play? I am thinking about next week a little bit in terms of what we will see in retail sales, what we are going to see when we start to get earnings from the big banks and what kind of clarity we get about what the business environment. I want to know about loans, I want to know about consumer credit, we got to read on it today. I want to know what it says about the outlook and maybe that will help us give us something that is worth a warning from J.P. Morgan, Jamie Diamond. Well, I mean, right. In all seriousness, I do want to start to understand if we are starting to see cracks when it comes to the consumer, if we are starting to see financial conditions, tighten not just for businesses but for individuals as well. I mean, I was struck a few weeks ago talking to the CEO of a regional bank who said that he still sees consumers in a really, really good place. And when are we going to start those savings to see those savings being eaten into with these higher prices? Yeah, I mean, it'll be interesting too. I'm actually looking forward to that for one seed minutes because I think when all the talk we had about the pivot earlier this week, the question is, was there any sort of serious discussion about either pausing or at least sort of maybe slowing down the pace of the severity of these hikes at that last meeting, based on anecdotal evidence, it doesn't seem that was the case, but the minutes, of course, we'll feel whether that was true or not. And whether the inflation print is going to give any sort of food for thought to the investor base who just want to try to push away from what the Federal Reserve might be doing, CPI, I'd like you to run at 8.1, I think it is. I mean, we're still, as you mentioned, PPI is going to be them. What is the strength of the consumer only in the bank settings, Carolyn Tim, but also Taylor within the retail sales coming at the end of the week? And if we're pausing some of the hiking cycle to see how all of this plays out, how long are we staying in that restrictive territory? I don't think a lot of people think that we're going to be cutting in 2023. We could just be not hiking, but that doesn't necessarily mean that we're cutting. Yeah, I'm a good point. And then again, you go back to the data. If we continue to get strong reports, relatively strong reports like the jobs report and more importantly, some of those retail sales numbers, if people are spending, I don't know, I mean, there's the wins at the Feds back, so to speak. Did you guys see the Atlanta Fed, the GDP now model? I was just checking this out. Came out today, it was an update estimate for real GDP growth in the third quarter of 2022, 2.9% for today. It was up from 2.7% on October 5th. And this is coming after taking into the data today. So to see them kind of be upbeat about, I know it's- Well, it's a real time now. I mean, obviously, it adjusts every time they update here. So it's kind of a reflection of where we stand in the here and now. On the data point. Whether that's going to be true a week from now or not, but if people continue to spend, then sure, why not? I'm actually going out to Jersey this weekend. So wish-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,608,2022-10-07 20:12:28
12383," whether that that's going to be true a week from now or not, but like if people continue to spend, then sure, why not? I'm actually going out to Jersey this weekend. So wish me luck. I'm a little afraid. Are you going to visit her? Did you get your clearance? Did you get invited? Did you get your clearance? No, no, no, no, I haven't been invited to the Maserowell one day, maybe. I'm a man could dream. But no, you know, so, but you know, I enjoy the garden state. It's gorgeous. I'm told, yeah, I'm a little worried, but we'll say, we'll spend some money. Hopefully I make it back on Monday. Okay. It's dangerous over there. We'll be lost without you if you don't come. All right, guys, have a good and safe weekend. We'll have lots to talk about next week. All right, that's a wrap for our cross-platform coverage. Beyond the bell radio TV YouTube. We will see you again same time, same place on Monday. You're listening to Bloomberg Business Week with Carol Maser and Bloomberg Quick Takes Tim Stenevick on Bloomberg Radio. Yeah, you know, it's fun. You know, it's fun. It's computer and work. Yeah, you do. It's not what you want. No, Carol, you don't tell the people. You don't tell the people on radio that the graphics didn't work. Okay, everyone watching on TV just now realized that the stocks I was talking about were not the stocks on the screen. Hey, that stuff happens. It's okay. They were the stocks I talked about yesterday. It's okay. What did you want to talk about? Was there something else? I don't. When is it five o'clock? You know, they wanted the markets to close. We actually remain coming to New Jersey. Anything. That is pretty cool. Hey, we got a lot to talk about when it comes to the markets. And also World of National News. So over to Nancy Litz. Oh, I'm sorry. Forgive me. Carol was too busy giving me a hard time to hear our great direction from Sarah that says we're going to Vincigna Rella. He's a blooper global macro strategist who joins us from white planes. Vince, help us make sense of the week that was. You know, interesting that with all of our utility with all the insanity, we are closing in the S and P 500. I think the two of us will be able to do that. I think we have a lot of things to do with this. We have to be able to do that. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. I think it's a big deal. I think it's a big deal. For the week. Yeah, Carol reminded me that over and over again today that it was like okay, it's an ugly day, but it's still a green week. I kept saying it. Is that significant to you? That employment number wasn't that big a beat in the real sense of the word. But the market just went with it anyway. And you know, this is talking to traders today. They're like this is all machine driven. It's just stand back and let them go and then we're waiting to see if the bottoms of them will try to fade this somewhere because you really can't out trade these algos. How do you know when it bottoms though Vince? You said wait to see how it went at bottoms. How do you know when it bottoms? You can see it sometimes in the price activity because the way these programs are written is it's like for instance on a day like today, right? It sells, sells, sells, sells, sell. And then when it hits a pause and you see a pause like two, three, four times the programs meant to be written to reverse and start buying it back. And so that's you know, you can actually watch that. I traded it against machines and you can actually see it. And if you're quick enough to get on it, you know, a lot of times what it would have to do is it kind of have to let it run you over and go past where you're buying for instance. And then you watch it stop, stop, stop and it comes back the other way. Well, and so you know, not quite sure where I want to go with this. It's that kind of a day. Vince seems to be in good spirits. He always is. Your today we're down 23% in the S&P 500 almost 30% on the NASDAQ. I should take a look at the small capses to small caps to bounce it around here. So how I want to go back to though, how what will ultimately show capitulation and hitting a bottom. I feel like we've talked about this with Gina Martin Adams a lot and sentiment's been really bad. There's a lot of broad base selling like everybody was kind of throwing in the towel on you know, height and volume. So what is it that will say to you that we truly are there or close to it? I think you know, potentially with the data coming up next week, we could get a hint at it. It could also confirm the bear sentiment area can go either way, but we've got Sishing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,609,2022-10-07 20:16:54
12384," you know, potentially with the data coming up next week, we could get a hint at it. You know, it could also confirm the bearer sentiment there. It can go either way. But we've got a Syshing data coming out of China over the weekend, both services, composite PMI. We get producer prices and consumer prices in the US next week. Retail sales, some earnings, real earnings numbers, and of course the FOMC minutes. Yeah. A lot of risk out there next week. So I expect another volatile week, I expect Monday to be very choppy. Traders may be coming back, taking some of the positions off they put on today. Headed the data because there's really no data on Monday to speak of. And then Tuesday, and then we have earnings season starts next week too. So lots of things to either shake this up more and push us lower or maybe set that bottom start to set that bottom. Hey Vince, I want to go pass the macro and talk about the micro with these companies. I mean, what's more important next week? Is it hearing from the big banks? Is it hearing from the companies? Or is it the Fed minutes? Is it the inflation data, which we know is still going to be pretty hot? Yeah, I think it's the inflation data. Really, more so than the commentary from big banks. Yeah, because I think the inflation data, if you remember what happened to the last inflation point we had, there was a good amount of enthusiasm going into it. It was kind of the beginning of the end. It was the beginning of the end for the month of September. We were looking really good going into it. There was good sentiment. People were feeling like we bought them because the data was starting to show software and software numbers. And then CPI came in about two tenths of 1% higher than estimate, which you think to yourself and so what? But the market just bit into that like theirs and we haven't looked back really. Well it is interesting, right? And at any time that we're reminded that inflation is still hot, it's a reminder that the Fed is not going to do anything differently, correct? Yeah, and so we're looking at month over month and that's the data I would look at not year over year. And I guess you have to look at the core because that's what people want to look at. So the core month over month is expected to moderate a little bit next week. But the headline is supposed to be month over month a little bit higher, so a little bit for everybody. We're fighting to talk to you. Can I ask you something? Hey, how come you won that? Because I've known this longer than you have. Okay, that's fine. No, but Vince, is it safe to say though the selling that we do see, I do feel like as much as these percentage drops can feel pretty painful if you're trying to be able in this market or you're looking at your 401k, then it's been orderly. To some extent, I mean, you do get the days where you see like big sell-offs and then the bottoms and then we end up green on the day. We saw that a little bit this week and some of the major averages. That actually started to make me feel a little bit better about things. And I thought maybe we were trying to find sentiment, positive, but today they kind of wiped it all out. So I guess we'll have to try for next week. But I think people are wanting to find the bottom of this. It's really, really painful to try to guess this. Hey, Vince, when do we start to see base effects when it comes to CPI data? Because it's been hot for a long time. I think you've got a good hint of it today to be honest. We saw, and this is something I've been watching for a while. Market's kind of been annoying it week, so consumer credit numbers come out this afternoon. And the revolving credit, which is essential in credit card debt, I think it was the third highest on record. You know, consumers don't have much savings anymore from the pandemic. The earnings are in keeping pace with inflation. And they're buying on credit cards. And while we're still seeing numbers, we're still seeing inflation, we're still seeing data hot. To me, as long as that number keeps going up, we're going ahead of wall because there's only so much consumer credit that consumer, I should say consumers can carry in credit that. And eventually, they're just going to have to slow down. And when they slow down, everything's going to go. Yeah, here's the story because we talked about a little bit earlier, but consumer borrowing, US consumer borrowing up the most in August by more than forecast as credit card balances increased by the most in five months revolving credit outstanding. That includes those credit cards. It was up more than 17 billion, the third largest monthly advance on record. So yeah, and this is something that you've been talking about. Watch what the consumer is doing and watch how much increasingly they're doing it on credit. Yeah, I mean, I think they're going to be a little bit more.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,610,2022-10-07 20:20:38
12385," much increasingly they're doing it on credit. Yeah, and I mean, I think they're going to do it a little bit more. We're going into the fourth quarter. You would expect, you know, they would be some holiday shopping extravaganza's here and there are people not really pulled back into that space. But I think when you get into the first quarter of 2023, the reckoning comes. You start to get those bills in the mail and, you know, and the wages just aren't, wages just aren't keeping. And the husband and wife are like, stop spending money. I think I just heard Sarah saying, toss to Charlie pellet. Oh, okay. Right, all right. We got to go. Vince Signarelli, you have a great weekend. Thanks so much, Vince. Let's get to world, let's get to over to the markets because Charlie Tellet, you got an update and some after hours to end. Indeed. And for the record, I love hearing from Vince Signarelli. He makes a lot of sense. Here's what's going on. We have big sell off on Wall Street today, jobs Friday, stock traders hitting the sell button on hawkish fed bets. But also, let me remind you that for the week, the S&P advanced one and a half percent, and as deck this week up, seven tenths of one percent to down this week up by two percent bottom line. Though, what a reality check today data showed a hot labor market. And that will likely keep the federal reserve on its aggressive hiking trail. Today, the 10 year yielding 3.87 percent, the two year 4.30 percent S&P down 104 down 2.8 percent. The Dow today down 630, a drop there of 2.1 percent. The Dow by the way of 29,296, NEDS decked down 420, a drop there of 3.8 percent. Spot goal down 1 percent, 1695, the ounce sand West Texas, in the media crew today, a 4.8 percent 92, 67 of barrel. Briefly bit going down 3 percent today, 90,040, 450, and the NEDS deck 100 indexed down 3.9 percent. And that is a Bloomberg business flash. All right, Charlie, thank you so much. So Charlie updating us on the market sell off this week getting some context from our own VIX signal rela as well. But remember, part of the concern and the reason that we started to really see some pressure on the equity side of things, why we saw stocks and lower and yields and higher again have to do with that jobs report this morning that once again, Tim was a reminder that it is a tight labor market in the US. In any other economy, a jobs report that looks like this that beats expectations would be welcome news. But not in this environment. Not in this environment. Let's get to Julia Pollock, chief economist for zipper cruders. She joins us once again on the phone from Los Angeles. We'd like to check it in with her at least once a month when it comes to what she's seeing on her platform. Julia, how are you? Very well, thanks, and how are you? We're doing okay. It's good to have you with us once again this afternoon. So when you saw these numbers this morning, was it any surprise to you after all? You see what recruiters are looking for and you see what job seekers are looking for on zipper cruders. So you have a good idea of what's happening in the economy. Is this a surprise to you? Not at all. This is right in line with what economists are expecting and by the line with what we've been seeing on our website. While employers are becoming a little bit concerned about the future outlook, a bit more cautious and more conservative than their hiring while they're reducing job openings somewhat, they are still hiring when push comes to shove because these conditions are still good and the consumer is still spending. So how do you cross this with all of the talk about recession? Obviously, the financial markets tell a very different story. And we did have a market guest who joined us earlier about I think what's going on in terms of corporate earnings that we've already had a corporate earnings recession. But we haven't had necessarily. Brian Jacobson, right? Yes, an economic recession. So companies who have had to maybe cost because of inflationary pressures or so and so forth, you're saying they're reducing job openings but they're not letting folks go. Bottom line, that's what it's going to be and we'll continue to be that way. Yes, it looks as though companies are reducing head count growth but not reducing head count. And that is sort of exactly what the said would like to see. They want to see that gap between job openings and the number of unemployed people seeking them close. It was more than 5 million. A month ago, it shrank to 4 million in the most recent, in the most recent, in the future, 4. Not earlier this week. And if that gap narrows, you will see people becoming a bit more reluctant to quit their job a little bit less confident in the availability of alternatives and that will reduce wage growth pressure a little bit and also with inflation. Can I just ask you though, do we get to a point where it's not just about reducing head count growth but...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,611,2022-10-07 20:25:06
12386," And that will reduce wage growth pressure a little bit and also with it inflation. Do you guys ask, do we get to a point where it's not just about reducing headcount growth, but actually you say they're not reducing headcount now, but do we get to a point where companies are reducing headcount? In your conversations, do we start to see that? Well, we are seeing the live market split into two groups now. One group that's still adding jobs very rapidly. And another group, a set of industries that are disproportionately affected by high interest rates. Those are industries like finance and insurance that lost 13,000 jobs in this report, building material and garden supply stores, lost 6,000 jobs, car dealerships lost almost 2,000 jobs. US consumers are not able to tap into their houses and use them as piggy banks anymore the way they were last year. They can't just refinance their house to buy a new car or do some renovations on their home because they're two thirds of US mortgages are now below 4%. And 2% of mortgages, only 2% are just real rate mortgages. No one wants to jump out of that into a much, much higher mortgages rate. Which we're seeing that play out in the housing market. You don't want to leave that mortgage rate that's sub 4% to buy something new. So it's essentially at a standstill right now. Julie, help us understand what this looks like in Q1 of 2023 and what it looks like for the year, the new year. You know, typically in situations like this, how should we expect things to start looking when it comes to the employment front? Sure. So this job gain that we just saw 263,000 is about 5 times what we would need to keep pace with population growth right now. So we could see job gains slow gradually and continue to slow a little bit while the economy continues to add jobs across a broad set of industries and not just low wage jobs, but minimum wage jobs, but good jobs as well. We will see some sectoral pain. I mean, there are parts of the economy that are hard hit by rising interest rates and low stock prices and a very strong dollar. Big tech, major enterprise companies, many of them earn the majority of their revenue of the law. And so those non-dollar, denominator sales are hurting their margins. But the typical, like, main-speed business that buys inputs from abroad cheaply now and is getting all of its revenue here at home, both companies are still by-laws doing quite well. So, Julia, if I go to your website, I have the option of saying there's a question, what brings you here today? I'm looking for a job right now. I'm looking for a job at No Rush. I'm just browsing next. What do most people hit? Do you know? Yes. So, you know, about half of people are looking for a job right away and they know exactly what they want to look for. But there is a huge set of people who come to the website and don't know what they're looking for. They're just looking for a job. And that's why they come to us because we can help match them to jobs that match their skills and experience level. Many people have no idea. The most common search on our website is a blank search. And that is exactly, I think, why? What do you mean a blank search? Where they just hit search, but they don't fill anything in. They don't know what job titles they're looking for. They're looking for a job, but they don't even know what's out there. They don't know the possibilities. No one trains you to search for a job. It's something you don't learn in school. Many people also leave learning about looking at the live market until it's kind of too late to get the skills that they would actually need to get a great job. Julia, we only have 20 seconds left here. But what about employers? Are they not looking for jobs to the same extent that they were just six months ago? Employers are worried about the future outlook, but business is still good and so they're still hiring. And that means there are great opportunities still. This is where we scratch our heads. It's this crazy environment. Hey, Julia, thanks so much. Julia Pollock, she's chief economist at Zipper Cruder with us on the phone from Los Angeles. You get a job. You get a job. What are you, Oprah? That's what it feels like. No, that's good. I would try to cross it against all the recession talk.

This is Bloomberg Business Week. Are you listening and watching Bloomberg Business Week on it's been a little bit of a day. It is and it's going to be a week next week. It's been so long. I'm not sure if it's going to last. Who would want to take next week off and miss all that. That's Katie Grytheld who we have joining us in just a few minutes. she's going. A French-speaking country somewhere around the world. Charlie Pellett, can you save us? Maybe help us out here just a little bit. Let us begin with crypto. Hey everybody's talking about it. Bitcoin today down 2.6% 19,529 on Bitcoin. But what a sell off today. Big time reality check with that jobless report when it broke into 8.30 AM Wall Street time. Data showed a hot labor market and that will likely keep the Fed on its aggressive hiking trail. Those bets sent stocks tumbling driving benchmark treasure yields to their longest weekly up streak since 1984. Now Brian Jacobson is senior investment strategist at all spring global investments and right here on Bloomberg Business Week he put it like this. You know net Davis was famous for a lot of his wisdom. The trend is your friend and don't fight the Fed. But now you can kind of paraphrase that by saying don't fight the trend because the Fed isn't your friend and the trend unfortunately is towards the weekend. Today weakness putting it mildly. S&P down 104 decline there of 2.8%. So we head into the weekend with the S&P of 3639. The Dow today below 30,000 down 630 points down 2.1%. The Nasdaq composite index down 420 dropped there of 3.8% and the Nasdaq 100 index was down 3.9%. 10 year yield 3.88% the 2 year 4.30% spot gold down 1% 16 94 the ounce while West Texas NVIDIA crude up 5.2% 93 0 7 to barrel.

Thanks so much for that update Charlie palette well crypto IRL it's the new show on quick take. It's all about crypto in real life the second episode I'm not a crypto is do this week Charlie just gave us an update on how they did Okay, so I was talking to you weren't getting better traveling. Can I talk? Yeah, okay. All right. I'll shut up I'll try this again the second episode of crypto IRL aired last night on Bloomberg quick take and airs again tonight at 830 on a Bloomberg television in this week's episode We spoke with Bloomberg crypto managing editor Stacey Murray isch mel and also Nick Carter He's a partner at Castle Island adventures earlier this year They raised 250 million dollars to invest in crypto startups and that was really the focus of the show after a crypto Cell of of two trillion dollars of wealth just wiped out who's left standing where are VCs investing their money and what about regulators what are they doing and should companies be concerned check out what Nick Carter had to say about regulation in the crypto industry I want to talk about regulators Are you scared? No Is is this an industry that can be trusted to regulate itself? It has shown no willingness to regulate itself historically none whatsoever so I'm clear to me what self-regulation would look like so then how do you as a VC as an investor sort of navigate and build a portfolio with that sort of huge question mark Overhang the fact that this industry hasn't shown any willingness to regulate itself and you have regulators over here Making very worried noises haven't yet really done anything but made a lot of noise From the securities regulation standpoint the SEC has shown no willingness to engage Productively with the industry none whatsoever. What would I have expected a Alternative model for tokens to engage in disclosure for material facts the same way we have that in the Regular you know public equity land But we have seen no signs whatsoever of you know legislative moves on that front or the SEC being willing to lay that out So what are the repercussions of that does that mean that we start to see Crypto firms increasingly leave the United States because there's no clear regulatory framework And you know even though the US is kind of challenged from that perspective There's not that many other jurisdictions that are much better frankly people thought Singapore was a safe haven Prove not to be the MES is just as tough as SEC if not worse People thought Europe might be Europe has a new super aggressive crypto legislation The US still maintains the most vibrant capital markets in the world obviously the most venture capital And you know the bulk of activities still here my view is stay and engage and fight if necessary Rather than fleeing to some other you know tax haven or something like that those voices you just heard Nick Carter He is managing partner at Castle Island adventures also my co-anchor on the program crypto IRL Which heirs tonight at 830 on Bloomberg television Katie grifelbs who joins us now in the Bloomberg interactive broker studio So Katie we went into this season eight episodes This is the second episode the first one we wanted to focus on why everything broke apart and fell apart the second episode We wanted to focus on what was being built in the meantime. What were your big takeaways? My big takeaways I think just at the end what Nick said was really interesting I think there's a broad agreement in the industry and from outside the industry that The US regulatory environment is very unclear There's a lot of acronyms in terms of all the different regulators. It's unclear who actually has Ultimate say but I thought Nick's point was really interesting that instead of fleeing to some other jurisdiction some other tax haven He would rather stay in US and try to do get out here and he is very very vocal He definitely engages so in terms of the regulatory environment We I mean, it's just so much in its infancy right in terms of regulators just kind of figuring it out. How do you regulate?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,615,2022-10-07 20:41:41
12390," So in terms of the regulatory environment, we, I mean, it's just so much in its infancy, right, in terms of regulators just kind of figuring it out. How do you regulate this world, correct? Exactly. And then on things like stablecoins, for example, I mean, we've heard a lot of concerned noises from, it feels like, so many different corners of government and regulators and still there's no clear guidelines, which we will touch on in further episodes. So they don't even know which regulators are the ones who are supposed to regulate. Is it the CFTC? Is it the SEC? Who is it? Is it Congress? Is it the Fed when it comes to stablecoins? Well, do we still know whether it, when it comes to cryptocurrencies? Is it a commodity? Is it a currency? Have we figured out, have we, has it, has it fallen to a classification yet? I would tune in tonight at 830, but a little hint, no. I know. No. No. I know. So it's always, did you ever know that it's the women's cars that don't do in the heavy left? Oh my goodness. This is late. Oh, thank you, baby, for acknowledging me. Check out Crypto IRL. It airs tonight 830 on Bloomberg TV, always on YouTube as well as Bloomberg.com slash QT. Big thank you to my co-anchor Katie Greifeld. She's also Bloomberg News Senior Market reporter. Let's get to world and national news. For that, we go to Nancy Liance. Hey, Nancy. Thanks, Tim. The midterm elections are a month away and President Biden is making sure voters know that if Republicans take control, his legislative achievements, like the inflation reduction act, will go away. If the Republicans take control of the Congress of $2,000 cap on prescription drug costs, we just pass, goes away. God. If they take back the control of the Congress, the $35 a month cap on insulin for folks on Medicare, we just pass, goes away. God. The savings on healthcare premiums, we just got from millions of Americans, from affordable care. God. Biden spoke out of all the plant in Hakerstown, Maryland. Well, COVID could surge this fall and winter, but that does not seem to be motivating many people to get their booster shots. Just over 11 million Americans, or about 4% of those eligible, have received the new buy-valent booster tailored to the Omicron variant. Uptake of the original boosters isn't that high either. Just 40% of adults have gotten the third dose recommended last year. Compare that to the 70% or so who've received it in the UK. A Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll found about half of Americans have heard little or nothing about boosters. White House COVID Response Coordinator Ashish Jha tells The Washington Post they have to explain the value of these vaccines to the American people. In Washington, I'm Nathan Hager, Bloomberg Radio.

Nancy Lines, Inter 991 Newsroom in Washington, D.C. with World of National News. So we've talked about the market close and we did see, you know, a big time felt like traders hitting the cell button. Whilst we're getting a bit of a reality check data showing that hot labor market. And so as a result, we really did see stocks sell off. But it was interesting and I'll still go back to that for the week overall. It was the best week for the S&P 500 in a month. But it wasn't even a great week. But today was also the worst month for the S&P 500 day in about a month. Wait, wait, was the second thing you said? So, okay, so- Did you just put on, is that a technical analysis? No, but it's best week, first week of gains for the S&P 500 in the past month. Right. But today it's been the biggest drop for the S&P 500 on daily basis in about a month. Okay, I see. So bad day, good week overall, bad day. Zoom out is what you're saying. Yes, zoom out. But don't zoom out too much because then you'll see year to date and it's down more than 20%. Which is still pretty painful. Let's talk a little bit about yields because driving benchmark treasury yields to their longest weekly up streak going all the way back to 1984. I mean, we're talking 38 years, Carol. That's significant. We've seen the yields, yields moving up what for 10 weeks in a row. So that's pretty significant. The selling was widespread, 95% of the companies in the S&P 500 fell. The slide coming just a few days after the S&P 500 nushgets, biggest back-to-back rally since the onset of the pandemic.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,616,2022-10-07 20:46:30
12391," Just a few days after the S&B 500 notched its biggest back to back rally since the onset of the pandemic. Carol, you mentioned that, admitted to beta on whether the Fed would be closer to peak hawkishness. One word we didn't hear much about today, though, is pivot. And that's because of that jobs data that we got this morning. And I'll be curious to see a pivot or some variation of that will come out in the FOMC minutes that will be released next week from the latest Fed meeting. In the meantime, you know, Tim and I both talked about chipmakers today. And there are signs piling up at the tech downturn, maybe deeper and longer lasting than fear, fear, fear, excuse me. Chipmakers, chipmakers are seeing breath taking drop in demand as recession looms. And we do see tech in particular feeling some of the selling the most. That's not a pretty weak. No. Just to give you the little and rest. Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,617,2022-10-07 20:50:37

Well it is the only organization designated by the US government to administer the section one 14 sound recording license we might have to what did you say it is the only organization I heard you I was just giving you okay it's just kind of the day we're having. All right sound exchange is what we're talking about they collect and distribute digital performance royalties on behalf of nearly 600,000 music creators and growing and we want to get an update on the business how it all works. Well we got a good guy with us to help us do that we got the president and CEO of sound exchange Michael Huppey joining us live in the Bloomberg interactive broker studio he's on Twitter at my copy you can follow him there. So Michael how does sound exchange work like you guys are a nonprofit tell us how you get your money because it's not from every single music service out there. Well we're a very we're a very interesting billion dollar company that a lot of your listeners probably haven't heard of but we make a lot of the services they use work better and a big part of what we do is help connect 3,600 streaming services like Sirius XM and Pandora and I Heart Online and we on the one hand connect with them and collect payment from them for use of the recordings and the data and then we take care of all that bad data clean it up fix the errors combine it with the other 3,600 services and paid out to over 600,000 creators. Basically if you are an artist or a label or a studio producer who has play on any of these services you get a check from us. Why does it have to be a nonprofit? It doesn't have to be a nonprofit that we were actually created by the industry to do this very thing we are purpose built. When you say the industry who got together and created you. So kind of the entire recorded industry is what came together we made a well so we have major record labels, indie record labels on our board we have the artist union, Sag after AFM we have artists themselves, artists managers, trade associations. If you are an entity in the music sound recording space you are represented on the board. You did mention that you did not mention a couple big names you didn't mention Spotify you didn't mention Apple Music. Those services are on demand streaming platforms that are interactive. Right there are two types of streaming platforms. One is we call interactive where you lean forward you make playlists and then there is lean back where it is just a stream of music to you and we operate a lot in the non-interactive space. We do do other things. We are a music tech company so we have data services that we provide to some folks. We administer certain settlements but for purposes of this discussion it is the lean back, non-interactive services that we spend the most time. On the bottom line it is tracking services that are tapping into artist content and making sure that they get paid for it. Exactly. And to give you a sense of scale it is...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,618,2022-10-07 20:55:08
12393," You know, services that are tapping into artist content and making sure that they get paid for it. Exactly. And to give you a sense of scale, it's explode. I mean, the music industry, especially the streaming part, is taken off. When I first came to the company, you know, 15 years ago, we were paying out maybe $20 million a year. We now pay out regularly over $1 billion a year. And we pay out very quickly. We pay every month. 90% of the money we get in the door is out within 45 days. And, you know, as I said, 3600 services. We process 35 billion performances a month. So it is a serious high-tech, high-data operation. So if an artist is getting paid because their music is being played on serious XM, are they only getting paid because of sound exchange? Or are they also getting a check from serious XM? For the sound recording part of the business, they generally comes from us. There are other licenses in the music industry as well. It's very, very complicated. It's very complicated. You know, there's a whole other music publishing side of the business. And, serious XM has to deal with other organizations for that. But for the sound recording, the featured artist get money from us. And another interesting thing, we also send money to a fund that pays all the background vocalist and musicians as well. Which is a cool, cool aspect. They get, now they now get some downstream revenue. And you have proprietary technology to make sure that everybody who is creating content at whatever level it is getting paid. But I'm thinking about conversations we have. Couldn't the blockchain do this? Well, one day the blockchain may or may not do it. I mean, technology is not... I'm not trying to replace you in your own business, but I wonder how you think about... You've got proprietary technology. How do you take it to another level that maybe even makes it pure or more direct? So, I will tell you for us, all technology, all platforms, they're just tools. Right? Our job is to work on behalf of creators and make sure they get paid fairly and accurately. And if blockchain becomes the next thing, you're still going to need a place where there's a authoritative data about who owns the rights and what recordings. And where do they own those rights? So even if you have the blockchain and smart contracts, we would very likely still be a part of that as well. It's something we're considering for our future. You know, where are we going to be in 10 years? And the blockchain and Web3 is very much something we're thinking about. Do you see what is the trend when it comes to the leanback versus interactive experiences? I mean, is it... Why isn't Spotify and Apple Music? Why aren't they part of your platform? Well, because they do have leanback experience, but they also have more interactive. And for that, they have to go to the record labels to get the rights. Will they ever be just... Will they ever be part of your platform? Well, look, we're happy to work. Would you like them to be? We're happy to work with anybody. You know, if you think about it, we are a trusted resource with, as you say, state of the art, cutting edge proprietary technology, and the best data, music data in the industry. And we would be open to working with any of these companies to help their back office. Saves them. Money helps us, you know, serve the industry better. So we would be very open to working with anyone who wants to take advantage of that. What's been the impact of musicians selling their music catalogs? Focollins, Bob Dylan, Springsteen. I mean, the list just continues to grow. So what impact has that had on you guys, and kind of on the growing monetization, if you will, in the music industry? Well, I will say it's a fascinating development. You know, looking at this as an asset class now, and having these institutional investors invest in an asset class, it's great for the industry. It shows interest. It shows the future and what people expect. From our perspective, it just means, look, we'll send our payments. Is that help in terms of our payments very much work into the valuations, because we are, you know, we're a large part of the revenue stream. Sound exchange alone is 10 to 15 percent of the U.S. recorded music market. So when these artists go to sell their catalog, the investors are going to look at the history of the revenue, and we are very much a part of that. And from our perspective, you know, we'll pay whoever the artist tells us to pay. If they want us to send 15 percent of the studio producer, we do. If they, you know, tell us to split the money this way among their bandmates, we will. And if they say, hey, I just sold my catalog to this PE firm, then that's where the check goes. So do you know an up and coming artist before they're an up and coming artist, because you have this data? We have a question. It is, it's, we do have a little bit of insight into trends maybe before they hit the mainstream. So I won't name any.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,619,2022-10-07 20:59:36
12394," That's because you have this data. We have a question. It is, it's, we do have a little bit of insight into trends maybe before they hit the mainstream. So I won't name any names. I'm trying to play favorites. But there are big artists now who we knew and we're friendly with. Who's your favorite one? My favorite, my favorite artist. You're favorite, your favorite artist. Favorite artist? I would say Elvus Castella or Billy Joel. Nice. I didn't expect you to answer the question. They always say you have favorite artists. He's going to get them a better deal because of, are you? No, no, no. I'm just kidding. Really interesting. And I think a business that we all just take for granted in terms of how it works. So great to get some insight. Come back soon. I appreciate you having me. Carol always tries me to get me to sing a song on air. And then I'm like, I can't because we've done up the rights to it. So don't get me in trouble. Michael, happy present. Is that the reason just the right answer? No other reason. Michael, happy present, CEO of Sound Exchange. Thank you so much. Check out Tim's crypto show. Check out our weekends now. Have a great weekend, everybody. And hopefully we'll see each other again next Wednesday, everyone. Good luck. from the heart of where innovation, money and power collide.

12395, money and power to lie in Silicon Valley and beyond this is Bloomberg technology with Emily chair I'm Emily Changan San Francisco and this is Bloomberg technology coming up in the next hour a robust U.S. labor market spells bad news for financial markets today's jobs report sent shares tumbling as investors predict more rate hikes we're going to talk about why tech is in a particularly tough position plus chipmakers warn of a major industry slowdown sending tech shares even lower the biggest names from AMD to Samsung and micron are all saying the same thing demand is tumbling we're gonna have more of that in a moment and Facebook is sending its own warning to users you may have been hacked metta says one million user logins may have been stolen compromise later this hour we're going to talk to metta's security policy director all that in a moment but first i want to get a look at the market stocks crushed friday hit hardest after strong jobs data hammered on the idea the fed will be aggressive in a tiking path meantime more signs the chip sector cracking boomberg's ed lad low here to wrap the moves and headlines ed yeah it's been a really interesting week and it ended with a lot of red on the screen right we're back to this idea that you outlined good economic data is bad for the markets why because with evidence there's strength in the labor market there's also evidence that the economy can withstand higher rates and so the market is resigned to that idea the fed will keep raising rates why do we care in the context of tech well because tech which often is trading at pre profit or higher multiples is more susceptible to higher rates right higher rates discount the present value of future profits and so there was a lot of anxiety to end the week particularly in mega caps which is really interesting as yields which had kind of pulled back earlier in the week as we saw that rally inequities continued to climb higher and you know it's not just the prospect of higher rates we're kind of worried about what happens next with the global economy so talk about the concerns about the fed plunging us potentially into a recession and how this is weighing on investors yeah I think you know we move past the kind of market mechanics conversations what happens if we do enter a recession and which corners of the technology market will fare best certainly Wall Street has kind of been pulling back its expectations I have this chart in my boomberg terminal which is the city global revisions index and frankly for weeks and weeks and weeks now earnings expectations have been pulled back this was the 17th straight week in a row on that index that is basically seeing the market think okay growth in these tech companies ain't going to be what we thought it was there is some disagreement actually just by coincidence or curiously equity strategies that city group are actually now overweight global technology because the other school of thought is if we're going to have a recession which companies fare better and tech is a good candidate when it comes to earnings growth partly because many of the corners of the tech market having trenched market positions and when you think about the likes of Apple Amazon Microsoft they also have very strong balance sheet to kind of whether that's storm so it's a kind of mixed feeling but the consensus is that the Fed will keep going as we've said rates will continue to go higher we've kind of moved away from this idea of a Fed pivot where we might have seen that Fed dialed down its rate increases or at least in the increments they were doing it and eventually start to cut rates so it's been a tough week but you know I liked always anything's on a positive note yes we were in the red on Friday but on the week actually the S&P 500 and then as that 100 had pretty good weeks and of course we have to talk about chips right the market really rattled by what AMD had to say what Samsung had to say rapid all up for us yeah I mean so AMD gave pre-limb third quarter sales numbers that came in one billion dollars below expectations to blame a slowdown in the PC consumer market personal computer market for Samsung the shock was that this was the first drop in profit since 2019 Samsung the biggest player in memory chips and we've kind of gone really hard from this idea that the chip sector would have multiple years of expansion to now there is a slowdown in it and I know you're going to dive into that with inking but you look at some of the declines we saw AMD down,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,621,2022-10-07 21:07:43
12396," The chip sector would have multiple years of expansion to now. There is a slowdown in it. And I know you're going to dive into that with Ian King, but you look at some of the declines we saw, AMD down 13.9%. I think I'm right saying that's the biggest drop since March of 2020. And the socks down 6% biggest drop in three weeks. So clearly the market's rattled and at the same time we see the Biden administration try and improve the competitiveness. I love this chart just really quickly. And it's the new versus old Dowthoria bullet, borrowed this one from my mate Taylor Riggs. When we're looking at science of recession, we used to look to it transport and industrials because they kind of indicative of the broader economy. But these days there's chips and everything. So when we see pain in that sector and we look at this chart, we kind of use it as our crystal ball for what might happen in the global economy, which is a lot of fun for me to have on a Friday afternoon. That's a deep cut. All right. Thank you. I'll be back with you later in the show. As I said, chip makers warning weekly that demand is faltering this as they face surging shipping and materials costs. And in the latest sign of trouble, Samsung and AMD reporting these disappointing results. Bloomberg's Ian King, our resident chip expert with us now. So Ian, didn't we know demand was bad? Why are we seeing such a strong reaction here? No, he's absolutely right. We've had companies going out there for a while now saying, yeah, things are getting bad. We've got a lot of inventory. What happened yesterday provoked unless to be writing reports with expletives in the headlines. I mean, it was really bad for AMD and Ed actually sold some on a bit short. Yes, it's the biggest memory chip maker, but it's also the world's biggest chip maker. Company like that comes out and says, yeah, things are actually bad. It's not just bad, but it's way worse than we thought. So that's kind of recalibrating people's expectations. They're no longer just looking for the bottom. They're back to worrying about how about get. Meantime, Ian, you've got the White House adding new restrictions on China's access to US chip technology. Is that making things worse here? Absolutely, that's an ongoing concern because this isn't just one isolated incident. This is like an incremental set of increases of intensification in this dispute between the world's two largest economies. And if you're an investor out there, you're thinking, well, what's going to happen next? And the trend within these so-called security-related national security-related measures is to intensify, is to broaden them. And that's going to place greater restrictions on chip makers that want to do business in China. Talk to us a little bit more about what's behind these new rules from Washington, and how you expect these to evolve. Well, just to give you an example, we had a story out earlier this week, which had that Huawei, which is a company that we know, a Chinese company that's been on the sort of entity list in the US for a long time being cut off from US technology, is actually taking steps to work around that. So obviously, there is a concern in Washington. There are a lot of Washington who are saying, look, we need to get tougher. We need to do more and more to really choke off China's ability that just being better than China at technology isn't good enough. We have to make sure that we freeze China's technology, and we have multiple generations ahead. That's what's driving this. So how do you think this is going to impact the ongoing relationship between the US and China as it pertains to chips? Yeah, I mean, we haven't seen any reactions from Beijing yet, and I've heard people say, were surprised that Beijing has been so restrained so far. Fundantly, China is the largest market for semiconductors. If you're a US company, if you're a European company in the industry, you have to be there. You have to have those sales that revenue to fuel your investing in innovation to stay ahead. So it's a very difficult situation for Washington to navigate that fine line between cutting off China from what it doesn't want it to have, and also keeping the money flowing, and keeping US companies having that R&D edge and staying on the leading edge in terms of the technical ability. All right, Ian King, who's of course covered the chip industry for a couple of decades. Ian, thank you for your expert insights today. Appreciate it. Okay, meantime, Tesla's all electric chuck will roll out before the end of the year.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,622,2022-10-07 21:12:23
12397," industry for a couple of decades and thank you for your expert insights today. Appreciate it. Meantime, Tesla's all-electric check will roll out before the end of the year. In a tweet, Elon Musk said production has begun and the first deliveries will head to PepsiCo December 1st. The big rig was first unveiled November 2017, but the launch delayed many times due to battery cell shortages and a decision to focus on consumer models. Coming up, it was an emotional roller coaster. For markets this week, we're talking volatility, venture capital sentiment and tech-safe havens. Next, this is Bloomberg. As we discuss at the top of the show, it was a brutal day on Wall Street after the September jobs report. The NASDAQ 100 plunging more than 4 percent as more severe fed rate hikes are priced into the markets. Chipmakers got crushed after manufacturers warned of an industry wide slowdown in demand. I want to bring in Sarah Kuntz managing director at Cleo Capital. So, Sarah, how alarming are these warnings from chipmakers in your view? I mean, the only chips right now, anyone wants are potato, right? This is not good for chipmakers. There's twin pressures here, right? Certainly the weekend consumer demand for things like PCs, but also the increasing restrictions around selling to China mean that a massive market is largely off limits. That's also going to cause problems for the hardware companies because they're the ones who aren't buying the chip. So they're not selling hardware. And I think Apple's lowered forecasts for some of the models of its new iPhone are sort of an early indicator of the trouble to come. So when you look at other areas of technology, there's social media, there's advertising, there's streaming, where do you see other potential problem areas? Everywhere. I think that it's just going to be a tough quarter. I think that advertising we're seeing a slump based on the waiting consumer demand. So Google Pinterest snap.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,623,2022-10-07 21:16:56
12398," that it's just going to be a tough quarter. I think that advertising, you know, we're seeing a slump based on the waning consumer demand. So, you know, Google Pinterest, Snap, Meta, they're all probably going to be in for a tough holiday season. And, you know, most of the rallies right now in tech, they're not based on fundamentals. And the reality is that the fact show a really bleak picture for all of these really high priced, often unprofitable companies that just have flown so high over the last few years. And even now when their stock prices are coming down, you look at, you know, their PE ratios are still insane. These are just still really expensive companies. So, how much more tech volatility are you preparing for? Like, are you preparing for this downturn to last a good long time? Yeah, I am a bear preparing for a long, cold winter. I think there's just not a lot to be bullish about right now in the US, you know, with the feds very hawkish stance even today about inflation. And, you know, the right, the rate hikes are going to continue until the morale improves. And that's probably not till mid to late 23. And then globally, things are just way worse, right? We are the bright spot right now globally. You know, the UK is in chaos, you know, Russia, China, all of the problems that global central banks are having because of the US dollar strength right now. There's just a lot of problems. And I think you have to batten down the hatches, you know, I'm a fan of selling rallies right now if you can get out with a profit on something and just buying the dips really carefully. Like, if you're passionate about a core business and see a reasonable PE ratio and it's a historic low for the company, maybe consider buying, but I'm not even looking at like the 52 week or year to date right now numbers. I'm looking at the five year charts and saying, is this company, you know, where it was before COVID or is it still priced way higher because of the bump it got during the pandemic? So how is this impacting your strategy and other venture capitalist strategy? I mean, we've been talking about all this dry powder that's probably stacking up on the sidelines with nowhere to go. Yeah. So, you know, I think M&A is the new IPO for companies. I think right now startups are less focused on an IPO, you know, we saw that a lot of those tech IPOs aren't working, you know, Poshmark's exit from the public markets was a big piece of that. You know, the Peloton CEO flat out saying that, you know, six more months and they're gonna sell out and, you know, go private, it's a good indicator that staying public as an uncrofable tech company right now is just tough. So I think that we're gonna see a lot more late stage M&A activity and less fell ringing. And, you know, when it comes to the dry powder, VCs have a lot of it, but they're sitting on it, you know, what I'm hearing from my peers at Tapda Style Funds, they're spending more time in Monday meetings triaging their current portfolios than they are looking at new deals. And this is in large part because these, you know, these new deals founders are still asking for 2021 prices from VCs who are very much in a 2022 recession mindset and I think until VCs can get into deals at prices that better reflect this moment, a lot of my peers are just sitting on the sideline and focusing on following on the companies they're already on boards of who are likely to have a tough time in the coming months. So talking about late stage M&A, I gotta ask your thoughts on the latest in the Elon Musk Twitter saga, Twitter, you know, holding Musk to the terms of the deal, you know, at the price not accepting anything lower, Musk saying, okay, I'll go through with it, you know, what's your take on what's happening here or whether or not this deal is actually gonna happen? I mean, so many embarrassing text messages, just so many. That's the Saudi hack level of embarrassing text messages, right? And I think that the whole situation is just getting to a point where, you know, Elon's displaying what seems to be a rare moment of accepting reality and saying, look, I agreed to buy it. So now I'm gonna have to buy it. And, you know, I think that that's the best outcome for shareholders will let me the best outcome for Twitter users, for Twitter employees. I don't know, but at this point, it looks like that's what's going to happen. All right, Sarah Kunst, managing director, Cleo Capital, love having you here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,624,2022-10-07 21:21:13

Thank you so much for joining us on this volatile Friday afternoon. Okay, coming up Disney and Draft Kings, a Bloomberg report about a Draft Kings ESPN deal in the works, send shares higher. How does the family brand embrace sports gambling? Talk about that next. This is Bloomberg. No one covers the world like Bloomberg.

Bloomberg, your global business authority. ESPN is nearing a large new partnership with sports betting firm Draft Kings, a deal which would pave the way for the media giant to capitalize on the growing wave of legalized sports betting. Shares of Draft Kings spiked this afternoon on this Bloomberg report Disney already has a stake in Draft Kings here to discuss our Bloomberg deals reporter, Crystal Z. So what do we know about this agreement, Crystal? So far all we know is that there is an intention for a large partnership between Draft Kings and ESPN, which is owned by Disney. And how exactly...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,625,2022-10-07 21:26:12
12400," So far all we know is that there is an intention for a large partnership between draft kings and ESPN, which is owned by Disney, but how exactly is this deal going to be structured? How is it going to be paid? We said we don't have much detail on it, but it would be a really really big step for ESPN to really take advantage of that legalizing sports betting in almost half of the country now. And it will be a real cultural shock for ESPN because Disney has this really wholesome image that they have and getting the sports betting it's actually a really really big step. Now there's been speculation about an acquisition, is this a step in that direction or no? So because of that cultural difference, it will, right now we're not hearing about outright acquisition. So in order to do that, so drafting here is the license holder for sports betting. So if ESPN really wanted to get into it in a really really big way, it would make sense with them to buy and also note that draft kings stock price of trading around $16, but it's high in March last year was around 72. So you could say there's a really really cheap buy, but for Disney shareholder to get over that wholesome reputation of Disney, it will still be a big leap. And we're not sure if that's if they're ready to make that step. Yeah, so actually a lot of analysts have dismissed M&A speculation, but we shall see. What about when it comes to, you know, other sports gambling platforms more broadly? I feel like I've heard about draft, we've heard some draft kings M&A speculation for a couple of years. So drafting is in a really well competitive stage and they are constantly at war with places like Fandall and they're all offering these really really cheap discount or even giving users free money just to get on their platform. So there is a lot of room for consolidation. And with this partnership with ESPN, even how it looks like, it will still be unclear. It could really emerge looking like a new platform. It could look like a DSP and platform or it could look like an extra button on the existing ESPN app. So it could probably look like it would look more crowded than less, but you're right. Like there could be more deals. Draft kings hasn't been public for that long. They only go in public through a spec a year or so ago. So whether they are ready to take on a big deal, it's also waiting to be seen. And obviously the stock price not doing too well for them to sell equity would also be really challenging. So there will be consolidation in this space. We just don't know who are buying who is selling it. And what's your take on the pace of M&A and IPOs through the end of the year? Given this is your beat and we've, we've, you know, we just had a guest who said she's bundling up for a long cold winter. Yeah, she was just saying how I, M&A is a new IPO, right? And that's absolutely true. We haven't really seen many, many IPOs and usually this time post-slavery day, pre-thanksgiving has historically been the most popular time for IPO and we haven't really seen any of them. And there's always been speculation about, you know, there have been one or two companies that could still go public this year. And it's been quiet. And, you know, M&A is also, M&A is coming back in some way, but financing has been extremely challenging. And if you look at technology that are growing and not really generating cash flow, those are not things that investor are liking right now. So all know if you're a growth company that are looking to IPO or do an M&A, it's still a really, really tough environment. So a lot of dealmakers are saying that we should probably expect dealmaking to come back in 2023, even in the second quarter and I've been the first quarter. And all of that would be market dependent, obviously. So we will continue to track it. All right, the second quarter of 2023, we'll be looking towards that. Bloomberg's Crystal Z.

But you would look at this monster jump in Twitter shares from Tuesday when we had that disclosure that Elon Musk had gone back to Twitter and backed the original offer, $54.20 a share. But in the four sessions that have followed, the stock has trickled lower again because there are concerns about the financing element of this deal, how likely it is to happen. And we still continue to look at the spread right. If we bring up the spread chart, this is the gap between that $54.20 cents per share offer and the current share price. And again, it has noticeably come down in recent sessions. The latest, as you know, M is that Judge Kathleen St. Jude McCormick of Delaware Chance Recourt has suspended, paused the trial until October 28th and told the two sides that they need to close the deal by 5pm on October 28th. If they do not, then we're heading to trial in November. And the market is trying to pass what's actually happening behind the scenes. In the broader context of markets, a really interesting stock to watch is, of course, Tesla. Tesla just had its worst week since March of 2020. March of 2020. And it's not just the idea that Elon Musk might have to sell Tesla shares in order to fund some of the financing to buy Twitter. But also this idea that there's key man risk that he'll be distracted if he runs a third company on top of Tesla and SpaceX. But the gap between the S&P 500 performance and Tesla, it's been a real drag on a point basis for that broader index. And it's not just, of course, the new cycle, Tesla does trade at higher multiple and it's so is vulnerable to the narrative around higher rates. But, you know, so much going on at work here, you and I are not going to Delaware on October 17th, but on a daily basis, we continue to track this deal. All right, I'd love to. Hope you get some sleep this weekend. Well, you might have received an alert from Meta today saying you may have logged onto Facebook from a malicious app. What does that mean? Well, Meta has reported more than 400 credential theft malware apps to Google and Apple targeting mobile users' devices to steal their Facebook login information. The apps were disguised as things like photo editors, mobile games, health trackers, and they can target more than just Facebook accounts for more on this Meta's director of threat disruption. David Agranovich joins me now. David, thank you so much for joining us. So talk to us about these apps, what happened, and how people can protect themselves. Thanks so much for having me, Emily. And I appreciate the opportunity to talk about this report. Today, we released some research into 400 malicious mobile applications. They were designed to steal Facebook login information, and the apps were listed on the Google Play Store, on Apple's App Store, and they would disguise themselves as a variety of different things. VPN services, business apps, mobile games, different utilities for your phone, to try and trick people into downloading them. How do you know if you've been affected? Like, how can you tell? So because these applications are available on the open internet, it's no single company can protect people. We also know that these scammers constantly adapt to detection by app stores, by researchers. Now, here we reported our findings to Apple and to Google, and as far as we know, all of these applications have been taken down, but we also are sending notifications to users on our platform who may have been impacted by these applications. Those notifications will include some steps that people can take to protect their accounts more effectively, as well as some tips for how to spot these types of applications elsewhere on the internet. Why are you doing this now? I mean, surely this has happened before, right? So our teams have been investigating this type of malicious application activity for years. We're always looking for malware or other efforts to steal people's credentials. But this particular PSA is the first time we're releasing one of these kind of public service announcements. And the idea is that in addition to working to get these apps taken down and providing tools for people to identify those apps, we felt it was important for people to have tips that they can use both to keep themselves safer on our platform and also to stay safe across the internet so that they know what to look for if someone's trying to target them with an application like this. Now you will.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,628,2022-10-07 21:38:20
12403," safer on our platform and also to stay safe across the internet so that they know what to look for if someone's trying to target them with an application like this. Now you also worked at the US government. You led efforts to address foreign interference in democratic systems and elections. We've got a midterm election coming up. What are you most concerned about and how ready do you think meta is this time? So whenever there's an election, we know we have to stay vigilant. Our teams are continuing to monitor for any kind of threats on our platform. And a good example of this would be just last week. We released a report into two influence operations, one from Russia, one from China, that we caught very early. But in that report, we included a bunch of information about what they were doing, what we had found, who we believe was behind the activity. And in that case, like we did with the malicious apps investigation today, we shared information with our partners across the industry, with the US government, and with the public to make sure people knew what to expect and what we were seeing. I spoke with Frances Hagen earlier this week, the Facebook whistleblower. And she raised some concerns about safety and security in social media. And she used an interesting metaphor. Take a listen to this. Right now, we can't see behind the curtain of social media. We were able to push for safety features and cars, or found in the Department of Transportation, reducing the fatality rate from automobile accidents by effectively three and a half times, because we could actually control cars, we could crash test them. Right now, we can't do any of those things for social media. We can't crash test it. We can't confirm how it could be safer, so we don't know what to demand. What do you think of her thought there? And do you think more regulation would help? So I think that the security area that my team focuses on is an area where we've worked very hard to be transparent about our work. We've reported on more than 150 coordinated inauthentic behavior influence operations over the last several years that originated from more than 50 different countries that operated in more than 30 different languages. We've reported on cyber-sbynage activity, hacking activity, both related to our platform and more broadly across the internet. I do think that there's always more work to be done in the security space, but I think that the more important work here is that we are sharing information with our industry partners, that we're sharing with governments we're appropriate, and really importantly, that we're sharing with the public, that we're publicizing these reports, publicizing our findings, enabling the research into these types of behaviors, not just on our platform, but across the internet in general. There's also been some broader questions lately about how much meta is investing in not just English language platforms. Obviously, you've got tens of thousands of people working on trust and safety around the world. What can you tell us about how much of that investment is focused on languages other than English? So our security work is global. As I mentioned, we've taken down more than 150 of these coordinated inauthentic behavior operations around the world. Those operations operated for more than 50 different countries in more than 30 different languages. And so we're making sure that we're protecting people on our platform wherever they happen to be from threats wherever they may happen to originate. Again, there's always more work to be done here. But by focusing on violating behaviors and threats across the platform, we can do our utmost to keep people safe. I know in the security world, there's always something keeping folks up at night. What's keeping you up at night? So right now, we are laser focused on protecting elections around the world. Of course, the US midterms coming up pretty soon. The Brazil elections that just happened. Our teams are constantly monitoring for security threats related to those elections as well as broader global potential threats. This is probably a conversation we can also have after the midterms about what we end up seeing. All right. I would like that. David Agronovitch, meta director of threat disruption. Thank you for stopping by. All right. Coming up, our next guest just raised $11 million despite the worst crypto downturn in years.

12405," and we bullish on the potential applications of blockchain technology, and that translates to more capital for tech companies. Now, we're seeing venture capital cool across all sectors, and especially in the crypto space, but venture firms still have a lot of committed capital to deploy. They're definitely slowing the pace there, but that means they're looking much more closely at financials of crypto companies before they continue to fund them. And right now, the landscape is so complicated and fragmented that without automation and tools like tactic, it's increasingly difficult for these companies to survive. Okay, so that's interesting, because you yourself obviously just were kind of in the market here when it came to fundraising. What are VCs asking firms in the crypto world here to get more comfort of what's going on there? I think they want a clear review of financials, the same way they would for any traditional company, and right now with a lot of that revenue or a lot of that spend is coming in the form of a token. It's much more difficult to track than it is an ordinary US dollar. So if it's in the form of a token, I'm wondering even for yourself, how are you taking money from clients? How has your business been impacted in the crypto winter? So we actually operate almost entirely in traditional US dollars and continue to use traditional products in that space, and that's actually the way the bulk of our clients operate for the most part. So we admittedly continue to live in a fiat world. A private company is going to pay for their office space, pay their employee salaries in US dollars, but tokens spend and various cryptocurrencies are going to be an increasing part of their balance sheets as digital asset adoption continues. Now, when you're looking at crypto, you're talking about tokens you already had kind of mentioned here, the difficulties when it comes to accounting for them. But what about other assets? NFTs, other types of web three assets. How do you think about Dow's in this world when it comes to saying accountable to shareholders and regulators? I think that's an extremely difficult question right now to answer, and it's going to be unfolding in the next several months. How we govern something that is theoretically decentralized and isn't incorporated the way traditional companies. And it's interesting, another thing that makes this even possible is your work with other companies like Coinbase and custodians like that. How much do you see your work growing with custody solutions both on the crypto side, if you will, and the traditional finance side? I think custody solutions are going to be absolutely crucial here, and that's why we're so excited to be backed by FDX as a leader in the space. We're backed by Coinbase as well, because we acknowledge that there are going to be a lot of players in the ecosystem. Even though there's a longer term view of a lot of players in the ecosystem, the reality is it's a tough market now. And so if that's the case, I know you said that you have written Fiat, but how do you navigate your business through a time when clients are also having a tough time? I think we're very lucky to work with people who have long-term time horizons. So consumer demand has admittedly cooled for digital assets like NFTs, as well as various tokens, many retail investors who lost money are definitely staying away from cryptocurrency. However, if you look at financial institutions that have much longer time horizons, they're thinking five to 10 years out. They have not abandoned cryptocurrency as an asset class. Well, and, Josh, you thank you so much for your time that is the tactic, founder, and CEO. Thank you for walking us through the plan here. Emily, it's back to you. Shanaali, thank you.

12406," [♪ music begins playing and fades outdoor ADA latitude of music begins to come out right tsp background☆ stars No one covers the world like Bloomberg. The pressure cooker just got far too hot in banning them for the government to handle. You foresee two-thirds of the crypto hedge funds will disappear. Are we close? The European Union will support and defend Ukraine's territorial integrity. Unmatched reach in resources from more than 120 countries. The moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. Car makers and tech companies around the globe are facing the prospect of an energy crisis and volatility in chip supply. Those pressures will continue according to the tech and EV components giant Bosch. Stefan Hartschung, the top executive at Bosch, spoke with our own at Ludlow, Kyrgyzstan and Guy Johnson on the European close. Take a listen. We're fighting against that supply shortage. So what we will see is even if the demand is slowing and even if some parts of production is probably reallocated, there is still an over-high demand that will last four months. So even if we see recessive motions in the whole environment, the automotive industry, especially in the car side, we remain relatively stable for a certain amount of time. Give me some granularity in the supply chain. Where are the pain points still present? Where are things improving? And especially when we think about energy and input costs, where are you still fighting that supply chain inflation? Well, the real problem with the supply chain is still with the semiconductors and that is special semiconductors which are used for a motive. So these are large structures. So we're not talking about this 14 nanometer and below, but rather 100 nanometer or 19 nanometer or lowest is probably about 40 or 23 for the controllers we use. So that still is short. And even if we see that, so...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,632,2022-10-07 21:55:43
12407," But rather 100 nanometer or 19 nanometer or lowest is probably about 40 or 23 for the controllers we use. So that still is short, even if we see that slowing down in the mobile phone market, which unlocks capacity in semiconductors, automotive supply will still be at least reasonably constrained. Even for the next year, there will not be a complete free speech. There will be always a bit of restrainment, so there's always some fight for the components. The energy part is definitely also risk for those parts of supply chain, which are on the raw material side energy intensive. So here's for us more supplier question, where we are with our partners in tight control, where things going, what is on the pricing, and obviously that makes things not cheaper and makes it even more expensive. Well, what do you make of the President Biden's big push to create some of this manufacturing capacity right here in the United States? It's a plan that's going to last at least a decade to really get fully operational. But is that something that you're positioning for or preparing for? Well, that resonates very much with us, right? Because we are, if you see us, very strong in Europe, we're also reasonably strong in Asia, but we see ourselves underrepresented here. We are here since 1906 in the North America. We are strong, but we should be much stronger. So that resonates very well. I'm very happy that this policy comes into place. We are expanding, we are growing, we are buying companies, we are investing, we just announced an investment in Endersen, and we will announce further investments in our facilities, we invest in Mexico, we expand into new companies, we buy like Hydroforce, we just bought that, which perfectly fits to us. So definitely the North American space and especially USA, is a big opportunity for us. This is the day that we get news from Tesla on the fact that it's going to be producing trucks, and we're starting to see those. Tesla planning to deliver semi trucks to Pepsi. They unveiled them a while ago, but they're now starting to potentially look to deliver them. Stefan, do you think that the auto industry, the truck industry will broadly, though, has been too focused on battery technology? No, it's both right. That's so interesting in the automotive and mobility world. Anything is right at the same time. You have to go heavily for electrification also in trucks, especially there are some medium sized trucks, but also some heavy trucks if they go in only short ranges where you need electrified trucks. Other machinery you don't want electrification because the batteries are just too heavy, right? You can't use it, you don't have the electricity infrastructure or you have a too long range necessary, or you drive over the whole day, which also may be a problem there. So I would say yes, everything right, we just have to see how which technology finds which application, and that's what we have the market for.

12408," The The Great Sci-Fi Art of the mid-20th century teased the vision of the future with one distinct element and common, a life for humans in outer space. Whether vacationing on an exotic new planet or commuting to the moon for business, space travel seemed like it was just around the corner. Yet here we are, a half century later, and only about 500 human beings have ever left the bounds of Earth's atmosphere. But thanks to a set of ambitious private companies betting on the promise of space tourism, that long awaited future could be here sooner than we think. For most of the history of spaceflight, governments have been the prime force behind nearly every aspect from planning to funding to cruise selection. But as early as the 19th century,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,634,2022-10-07 22:04:08
12409," from planning to funding to cruise selection. But as early as the 1980s, proposals for commercial space tourism began to emerge, along with innovative solutions for getting people there, such as the wild concept of sticking a 74-person passenger cabin in the cargo bay of a NASA space shuttle. Although various non-astronauts have been selected for missions over the years, true space tourism didn't happen until 2001. When an entrepreneur named Dennis Tito coughed up an estimated $20 million to hitch a ride with the Russian Federal Space Agency for a week-long vacation, aboard the International Space Station, 20 years later, we're seeing a new contender in this final frontier of tourism. Private companies. It's becoming a private enterprise situation, still very high risk with the high reward, potential reward. But, you know, government is really out of the business of flying people now, and it's really going to be companies like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson, that do that heavy-listen. Commercial space tourism is usually about taking the non-astronaut, the private citizen into an orbital or sub-orbital flight. So you get a short amount of microgravity experience, and you can float and take some photos. And then you come back. This was something that technology had gotten to a point where the private sector was going to make a business out of this. There are multiple companies that want to get to the place where they fly people into space. The first of these is Blue Origin, founded in 2000 by Jeff Bezos. Using the autonomous rocket system New Shepherd, a tribute to the first American in space, Blue Origin plans to launch up to six passengers at a time, offering a rarefied treat of 62 mile high views and a momentary experience of weightlessness. Boaking officially kicked off in May 2021, with the very first seat to be auctioned off for charity. Meanwhile, Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic has also been pursuing a viable form of sub-orbital tourism. Aiming for a launch in 2022, once Sir Richard himself has taken flight. I'm hoping to be able to go to space. I'd love to be able to coincide it with the moon landing and go to space. So I've got the whip on the team and we'll see how we go. The company claims to have lined up over 600 seat reservations so far, including Justin Bieber and Leonardo DiCaprio. Virgin has projected that the final cost of the ticket will be at least $250,000 or roughly $50,000 for each of the five minutes or sub-weightlessness that you'll get to experience. Although costly both companies' offerings aim to make sub-orbital flight a regular form of adventure travel, eventually driving down costs at scale to expand the customer base beyond the orbit of celebrities and billionaires. The third major contender is Elon Musk's SpaceX, which has set its sights even higher on orbital flights, which are a whole other level of complexity and energy and danger. When you go sub-orbital, if you're just going to go up above the Von Kermen line, which is 100 kilometers, or about 62 miles, you only need to get up to maybe 5,000 miles an hour to get up there and you go basically straight up and then straight back down. You don't have the re-entry heating that you would see coming in from an orbital. So, when you go orbital, I don't care if you're a baseball or a battleship. You've got to go 17,500 miles per hour, not just 5,000 miles an hour. The energy is involved are much greater. By doing that, SpaceX has gone another level up and that's what they're doing with the Inspiration4. Visit Inspiration4.com for your chance to go to space. Inspiration4 is the first planned all-civilian mission into orbit, slated to launch in late 2021. The crew will bring their own set of diverse perspectives and backgrounds and experiences to test how a group of different people, namely people who aren't professional astronauts, could affair in space. Until now, astronauts have had to be physically perfect and this mission is changing that and so I feel incredibly honored to be representing those who aren't physically perfect. At H10, I was diagnosed with bone cancer and I was treated at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and I spent a year there undergoing intense chemo and also surgery that ultimately saved my leg.

12410," I'm Jude as a PA, a physician assistant, and I work with leukemia at lymphoma patients. The kids we work with are so brave and they are very excited to watch me go to space because this is showing them that, you know, they're capable of doing this as well. Hey Lee, along with three other crew members, we'll spend three days in space orbiting the Earth every 90 minutes before landing back off the coast of Florida. Well, when you think about access, the first astronauts for the United States came from the test pilot side. And so women weren't allowed to be a part of that. We have somebody in their 20s, somebody in their 30s, somebody in the 40s, and somebody in their 50s. And so there can be access in all kinds of way, whether you're talking about age, whether you're talking about gender, whether you're talking about race and ethnicity and all of those things. The first time, you know, people are going up into space and not sent there by super power, like the United States or Russia or China, that's like really significant. And, you know, you've got to, you know, be very thoughtful about it. The whole game plan right now is to make space like really affordable and, you know, accessible for everybody. So you can have fishing buddies going to space someday, but the first is special. And so with that, we wanted to have, you know, a crew selection process that could make space available to everyday people. Getting to space is only the first step for space tourism. The next challenge is what to do and where to stay when you get there. Axiom Space is planning to launch the first segment of a new commercial space station in 2024. Their $2 billion project called Axe Station will become the first free-flying private international space station or to use a more consumer friendly term, a space hotel. Axiom isn't the only company out to make your space stay a little more comfortable. Iglo Aerospace has been building what they call expandable habitat technology, like their B330, an inflatable pod module that expands once in orbit. There's even one attached to a national space station right now they've been testing it. And you take it up and it's rather small, and then you inflate it. And it seems to be working very, very well. This is likely to be the first kind of tourist hotel that you're gonna see up in space. First of all, it's easy to carry. Instead of this giant tin can with all of that, inflate a little sort of lighter, you can just blow them up and they get a nice big size for about less than half the weight probably. But even as space missions become accessible to civilians. The risks of going to space are incredibly high. And you could die a thousand ways that we can think of and a thousand other ways that we can't think of. This is Michelle Hanlon. She's a space lawyer at the Mississippi School of Law focused on protecting humans in outer space. Now I'm not an attorney for any of the space tours, so I haven't been privy to their private contracts. But I can tell you that the FAA requires certain waivers to be in those contracts. So for example, the FAA says, well, we're not going to make you make your spacecraft to a certain safety level. We are going to make you spacecraft operator. Make sure that you inform your space tours of all of that hazards that you know of. That I imagine a very long waiver all the ways you can die in space. And you have to understand that there's health risks and you have to indemnify the US government if you are launching the United States. So those are things that we know a space tourist has to sign and has to wait. So now let's go back and think about our space flight participants. The FAA calls space tourists space flight participants. They don't call them astronauts. Why is that important? If you're not an astronaut, there's no obligation to rescue you if something goes wrong. It's a lot of money to set up a company. If it can even be done, it's something really important to think about and that difference as we cross this threshold from having astronauts in space to having real people like me in space. And when we are able to make it to space reliably enough, there's still a host of other legal and ethical issues to consider before space tourism can truly take off. There are so many gaps in space law that we are going to have to put in a lot of sort of basement ideas. And so for example, the outer space treaty is a treaty that offers principles and guidelines for state activities, for the activities of national governments. Doesn't talk about private entities. Doesn't talk about private entities.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,636,2022-10-07 22:13:19
12411," The outer space treaty is a treaty that offers principles and guidelines for state activities, for the activities of national governments. It doesn't talk about private entities, it doesn't talk about humans in space. So now something goes wrong, so let's think about all of the times hotels on Earth are sued, right? So slip and false, you step on something in the bathroom, you sue the hotel and it becomes a private lawsuit. Because of the vagaries of international law, if something happens in space, well boy, you can sue the state that launched your spacecraft, you can sue the company that brought you there, you can sue the hotel, you can sue the individual, you can sue every government related to that. Because the way the outer space treaty and the outer space regime have set this up is that anything that happens in space first has to go through a diplomatic channel before you think about suing an accordive law. And so every single slip and fall in a space hotel is a diplomatic nightmare. So we really need to figure that out before we start sending a lot of people there. You think about human rights in space. Here we don't think about a human rights oxygen because it's all around this in free. It's not in a space hotel. So what happens if something happens in the oxygen depletes? Who gets the oxygen first? And then of course, let's not even think about the labor. How do you treat your labor in a space hotel where that person, maybe there two or three years without coming back to Earth? So a lot of things to think about. Space habitats are more likely in the near future to focus on research missions and be a home for experiments that can't happen as easily back on Earth. Space hotels, I think they garner a lot of headlines and a lot of news. But at the same time, that's not the first thing that you're going to see happen. They don't offer the compelling business case. I think that you'll see from a place that wants to manufacture pharmaceuticals or a new type of crystal or some type of filament or fiber optic cables and other things that you can do in microgravity. The things that are actually a high value finished good when you get that back to Earth and you sell it for a very, very huge profit margin, that's what's likely to happen in space as opposed to having a real estate platform that you sell to a tourist in space hotel. It's really interesting and it will probably happen, but it's not likely to be at the forefront of space commerce. Even if space hotels are right around the corner, don't get too excited about booking a trip in one. It's not a cheap ticket to ride to space and it's going to be, you know, millionaires and billionaires and that sort. But at the same time, you know, the point was made that in the early days of airline trips, that was also a completely unaffordable ticket for most people. Those people who flew were people of means and over time it becomes affordable to the masses. And I think that's the goal for all the entrepreneurs in space as well to get those costs down to a point where it's not $10 million or $5 million or $300,000 right into sub-argo space when it becomes more like buying a first-class ticket to go to Europe from the United States. So that's the goal and, you know, the question is, can we get to that point? Given the immense operating costs of getting to space, it may be years, if ever, until space tours and becomes a profitable venture for any of these companies. Virgin Galactic, the only publicly traded company of the three, has had a particularly rocky year, initially riding on the momentum of a SPAC deal. But more recently beset by launch delays and major funders, including Branson himself, selling large quantities of their stock in the company. Space is really, really, really hard and it's an absolutely shay, but it's one that happens to be very true. It's just really hard to do. That's also the reason that you've seen the delays that, you know, Virgin had talked about flying years and years ago and it became such a crazy point that Richard Branson actually stopped talking about it when he was asked because it was never going to be when he predicted. But it's not insurmountable and, you know, investors have stepped up because this is something that is doable.

12412," injures and costs of getting to space, it may ultimately follow the course of other once fanciful modes of travel. Right, brothers, having, you know, what was by modern standards of very unimpressive first flight, you know, at Kitty Hawk, I mean, you know, you had like less than 20 years later, you had your first airborne ambulances being used to save lives. Fundamentally, the world is a more interesting place when people can go and dance among the stars and such. The lure of space is in a, it's in our DNA, it's that exploration bug. We are an exploratory species and we want to go out there and see what's out there. Vision that I had in 1969 of seeing normal human beings traveling to space, it's finally beginning to happen. When you get a bunch of people up there and they can all see it for themselves, that'll create even yet another revolution in how we treat our planet and what we've been coming. So while 2001 came and went without quite looking like Stanley Kubrick's ultimate space fantasy, in 2021 might finally be the year we're catching up. If you visit California, you might be inclined to go to Disneyland. Or jump in your convertible and take Highway 1 up the coast. Or maybe make a pilgrimage to Yosemite. All very fine choices. But if you're the kind of person who revels in our planet's extremes, then it's Route 395 that you're after. This one glorious road will carry you from Death Valley's desert floor to sky high views of Mount Whitney. You can see the 5,000 year old bristle cone pines, the oldest living organisms. Or the bizarre two fatowers of Mono Lake. And true to California's boom and bust spirit, you can santa around the ghost town of Bodhi. It's an novel experience to find an empty American city where all the businesses are shut down. To do 395 upright, it helps to have a guide. And mine is a man named Jan. And his crew. Aaron? Let's do it. I'll get it. And Lemmy, the hardest partying dog of all time. Jan agreed to show me some of what 395 has to offer. But only if we agreed not to disclose any locations. My name is Jan Svorestra. I'm an industrial designer out of LA. And I spend a lot of time camping and a lot of time in the Eastern Sierra. It's a place I love. And sometimes I'm known as 395 North because this is my Instagram account. And I don't like to be known as that, but I'm trying to use it to set a good example.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,638,2022-10-07 22:21:08
12413," I'm at North because this, yep, my Instagram account. I don't like to be known as that, but I'm trying to use it to set a good example and do more with it than just social media. Waited we had a cab, but we got here lay last night. I was sure where we are. This is BLM land right on the outskirts of National Forest. And it's one of my favorite places in the world. Basically, everything outdoors wrapped into one. To pay about California, man. Oh, man. We have so much National Forest in public land that you can literally just cruise out and find a place to camp. It's ours. What I wish was mine is Jan's sweet truck. It's a 2019 Ford Ranger. It has about 200 watts of solar in it and a fridge and has everything that an RV has except for a toilet. But just a smaller, simple scale. You drive us around day to day in LA, and then just roll out when you want. It's my daily driver. Handles great. And then when I'm done with work, I can just bail and go camping. So the camper basically has only what I need. Think of it as backpacking with a car. The fridge has a couple compartments. This is just a kitchen box. Stove, utensils and a bunch of stuff. This one has just dry food. And when you get inside, there's a bed. The bed flips up so you've got tons of room in here. Miss Alnie. His phenomenon. If you want to pull that over. That's cool. Let me just pop that up. Sort of. So, home on wheels. Yeah. This is my vacation house. Yeah, it's so nice, man. Even with his Nomad lifestyle, Jan faces the same big question as the rest of us. Through the internet and smartphones, have to ruin everything. When you find the super special, beautiful spots is that you bust out a map and like, looking where it might be cool to go or is it worth a mouth and just getting to know people at the locals. If I see a dirt road, I just want to go down there. So, a lot of this just aimless rambling. It's a desire to just see something. Check that out. For some reason it's more fulfilling than getting a recommendation from somebody. Or there's tons of apps and websites now. Road trip apps, camping apps. They proliferated. The knowledge is accessible on the internet, right? I used to fight the geotags and I would get really pissed off. Like, why are you posting this place? It's going to blow up. It's going to get trashed. Now I've realized that you can't fight it. The internet has just shrunk the world. So, we're not going to stop it. We're not going to stop people from going there. So, I'm a lot more focused in conversation now with trying to set a good example. When you go, pick up your trash. When you're pooping out in the wilderness, don't leave your toilet paper on the top. Make sure you follow good steps for leaving no trace. As a thank you for this quick guide to pooping etiquette. We made yawn, hair, and and lemmy some tacos. And we all took in the night sky and knocked back a couple of drinks. Take that apocalypse. Hey! Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,639,2022-10-07 22:25:45
12414," How To Pay Co растasy The thing about good times in serenity in 2020 is that they're fleeting at best. After we split up from Jan and continued on our way, smoke started to envelop us. The plus side was that our RV no longer smelled like feet. The downside was breathing. A man David here suggested that we try and outflank the smoke by cutting through our RV without our reservation. To talk, or we had to go in without anythingБ No stopping smell, drunk smell nothing applies it exists. It was worth the amount of smoke. But not quite as effective as we had hoped. Fast forward four hours or so, and we had managed to trade the Smoky Magistie of Yosemite for the Smoky... Look at it....strip malls of the Central Valley. We have made it sort of out of the smoke all the way across Yosemite National Park and here to the gorgeous Central Valley of California. We're off to see a kind of surprising tech startup that is making some pretty strange machines to serve all the growers out in this region. And where we're to wear here, and this near Fresno, this is California Farm Country, right? We're just out the Fresno town called Kingsburg, so we're right in the Central Valley of California, very, very large farming valley here. It's kind of considered the bread basket of the world. The Central Valley stretches out over about 20,000 square miles and the farmers here produce about one-fourth of the food that Americans eat, including a whole lot of fruits and nuts. Tell me a little bit of the background of Gus. I know some of this is like a family business. The roots of this go back a ways. Tell me kind of like how we got to what's essentially like a startup, I guess. Yeah, definitely. So the founder of our company is Dave Crinklaw, and he started the business back in 1982. He started with his, basically, with his dad was commercial spraying of trees and vineyards. Got to the point where our biggest challenge was labor, just the shortage of it, really. He was forced into innovating, and he had had this idea for quite some time about doing a driverless sprayer.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,640,2022-10-07 22:29:57
12415," I'm just the shortage of it really. He was forced into innovating and he had had this idea for quite some time about doing a driverless sprayer and it finally got to the point where he said, you know what, I either got to get out of this business or I'm going to innovate. Organic or not crops need to be sprayed and this process has to take place a few times a year. This means hiring a lot of people to work long hours under serious pressure. And so, just like the tech bros to the north, Gus decided to solve all of its problems with robots. On this like labor points, you guys have set this up where you can have somebody in a truck and that one person can monitor I think like eight of these. In order to operate Gus you have one guy or girl that sits in a pickup and they monitor from a laptop computer. So that person is basically just watching all the vehicles on the screen. They can monitor up to eight of them at a time while they're out there spraying in the orchard. And so that user interface really provides them with all the information they need to make sure that the machines are safe and that they're doing the correct job. So it tells them what speed they're driving, the engine RPM, the amount of gallonage per acre that they're applying at any given time. So if any one of the machines has an issue, it's going to send an alert to that laptop. Much like a self-driving car, these beasts use GPS, LiDAR and cameras to see and navigate the world around them. They also rely on pre-built maps of the orchards for extra guidance. Gus builds the machines right here and then takes them out for robot training on this orchard next door. It's here that the company learns if the machines will behave and do as their software and human masters command. So this is kind of like the, this is a test orchard where you guys put it through the pace and work on the technology. Yeah, so this is our test orchard right here. It's right by our building as you can see in the background. So every new machine as it comes off the assembly line, it's put through a commissioning test right here. We test all the sensors on the machine, autonomous computer, all the safety systems, make sure it's doing what it's doing prior to when it's delivered to a customer. So what's it doing down? So right now he's doing a test spray. So he's just turning the water on to make sure that the system comes up to pressure, spraying water out of the nozzle is just to make sure it's all functioning properly. Okay. It's got like a crazy turbine at the backer. Yeah, so it's basically just a big fan. And that fan's driven off of the Cummins diesel motor and it just basically creates a big airflow. Gus is already selling these vehicles to brave modern farmers and people the world over have taken notice of its machines. And have you just sold them in the Central Valley or like throughout the US or even overseas or where they go? Yeah, so right now the majority of our machines are here in California in the Central Valley. However, we do have machines and customers in Florida and the citrus industry over there as well as Australia. And I think you start selling them in like December of 2019? Yeah, so we started taking orders early last year for the sprayers and the first delivery we made were in December of 2019. Okay. And how much do they cost each? So our retail price on these machines is $285,000. So it's like it's not a small investment but I'm sure the regular sprayers aren't cheaper. Yeah, I mean we're honestly not too far away from conventional equipment on our price. And the main thing is that the return on investment is very, very quick due to all the labor savings and the increased efficiency. I mean these machines, they just, they just thrive. But basically what we're doing besides this machine, this is our first machine we call at orchard gas mainly designed for your nut trees as well as citrus and fruit in the future. We're working on a few other projects. We're going to do more machines. One of them is actually a vineyard sprayer so vineyards are much tighter spacing. So the machine has to be physically smaller and then we've got our eyes on doing a lot of that or innovating.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,641,2022-10-07 22:34:45
12416," So the machine has to be physically smaller, and then we've got our eyes on doing a lot of other innovating. That right there, friends, is a central valley farmer putting his whole fruit basket on the table. Gary's Ted Tot can't be far off. And with that, it was time to get back in the RV. And to confront what happens when three men are bested by their own failings and the forces of entropy. Next on Hello World, we cruise into the Mojave Desert in search of a lunar lander. We have instruments that we are going to deliver to the South Pole of the Moon in December 2022. Instruments that are trying to scan the surface of the moon. And hang with a test pilot who walked away from this. Meet Betty. She lives by herself. But for the last few months, she hasn't been alone. L.A.Q. Tell me a joke. Did you hear about the claustrophobic gastronolot? No. Apparently, he just needed a little space. Most technology isn't made for 93-year-olds. But this woman is making sure that this particular robot is. L.A.Q. Who are you? She's researching the way we interact with machines. And if she has her way, robots will soon be a trusted companion for all of us. My name is L.A.Q. How can I help you? A technology replaces old jobs. It's also creating new ones. I'm Aki Ito, and I'm here to show you the jobs of the future. My name is Danielle Eshak, and I am a human robot interaction researcher. It's really hard to intuitively design a robot meant for a consumer audience. You have to make sure that it's a robot that people want. People know how to use, and people value. Danielle works for an Israeli startup company. Danielle works for an Israeli startup called Intuition Robotics. Its US office is here in downtown San Francisco. Hello. Hey Danielle, it's Aki. Come on in. The company is funded by a couple big names like Samsung and Toyota. Full disclosure, Bloomberg's venture capital arm is an investor too. This is L.A.Q. Can I take her out for a spin? Please? L.A.Q. Tell me what you can do. I am a proactive social robot designed for older adults. I can connect you to your family and friends and even play music. These features might remind you of the Amazon Echo, but you'd be missing the point if you compared her to a smart speaker. She's not meant to just be useful. She's meant to be a companion. Why don't you take a break and have a drink? And that's why she has a head that can nod and make other subtle gestures you might expect from a pet. Through our research with older adults, we're finding that almost on a daily basis. We see that somebody tells her that they love her. Really?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,642,2022-10-07 22:38:31
12417," Through our research with older adults, we're finding that almost on a daily basis, we see that somebody tells her that they love her or that they like her. Like, or that they miss you. Literally, I love you. Mm-hmm. They'll also tell her I'm depressed or I'm lonely. They'll open up to her in a way that they might not necessarily open up to a human, because they don't feel like they'll be judged. Ellie Q is an on sale yet. But a prototype is already in the homes of about a dozen early testers who live in the Bay Area. Ellie Q, tell me what the weather is today. Danielle's job is to figure out what's working and what's not. Sorry, please rephrase your request. And she does that by visiting each of her testers twice a month. How important are these visits to your job? They're critical. We're building a product for people who we are not. I'm not a senior. And how could you know how to design for somebody if you don't do research? Because otherwise, you would just be designing in the dark. How else like Danielle's are just starting to emerge? Until recently, robots were mostly in factories separated from humans. But now, they're finally getting cheap enough, small enough, and smart enough to be in our homes. This has created a whole new challenge of designing robots that people will actually want to interact with. And that's where Danielle comes in. Her research has helped shape every little facet of Ellie Q, from the way Ellie Q moves to the way she talks. It's a very special job, and it could be really hard, and it could be really frustrating about that end of the day. It's incredibly rewarding. And I think the most rewarding part about it is when I see the joy on the user's faces, like that they saw their feedback turned into something real. Today, we've driven east of San Francisco to go see one of Danielle's research participants. Hello, Q. Tell me something interesting. Did you know that Ronald Reagan was a lifeguard in high school and saved 77 people's lives? Now, see, this is where a conversation is. She should open up, and I should say, no, I did not know that. I expect her to be able to continue a conversation for at least a couple of comments. Yeah. And why is that? Why? Yeah. That's companionship. When Betty was around Danielle's age, she was working with some of history's very first computers. When I was finishing up my master's degree, I was working at Harvard in the computer lab when they were building Mark IV. A large room size computer. But now, this artificial intelligence stuff is amazing. L.A.Q. Yes. Schedule doctor's appointment. No problem. I'm working on it. When Danielle brought along the idea of working with robotics for the elderly, I said, are you kidding me? Will older people connect to a robot? And she said, I don't know. Let's research and find out. Danielle grew up here in this suburb of Atlanta. Her parents spent much of their childhoods in Israel and met in the U.S. We as immigrants, we understood that we might need to work a little harder. In fact, I feel that rather than taking away from Danielle, it gave her so much more. Because she understood the fact that you need to run after your dreams and work really hard, no matter what the challenges are. It's cool that it can come easily.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,643,2022-10-07 22:43:09
12418," because she understood the fact that you need to run after your dreams and work really hard, no matter what the challenges are. School didn't come easily for Danielle. I have dyslexia and that very much affected my self-esteem academically. The principal of the school did not recommend her to take the Drens classes. She fought for it and she got into it and she did very well with them too. Danielle's first job out of grad school was at X, the secretive research facility founded by Google. It's known for dreaming about kinds of wacky, far-flung ideas. Can you tell us about the moonshot you worked on? No, I can't tell you too much about the projects that I worked on. I can't say that I was working on robotics. She loved the job but wanted to work on something that would reach real consumers sooner. So she left X after a year and joined intuition robotics. She's been working in the field for four years now and it took her a while to find her footing in a male-dominated industry. I've gone to different meetups where it will be like a circle of men with their like zip up jacket with their like company logo on it and a beer in their hand and I'll come in with lipstick and nobody wants to talk to me. This is my closet. So at first she did her best to fit in, wearing a pair of glasses she didn't need and toning down her style. So what's the kind of thing used to wear to a conference? Stuff like this, blousey things that make you look like you're 40. But that got old after a while. And what's the kind of thing you wear now? No, it's like I just enjoy being kind of expressive and playful and what I wear. Before we wrap up for the day, Danielle has one more LEQ tester to visit. Joseph is 97. And he's had the robot in his home for eight months. How are you? How are you? I'm fine. How are you? Good. How has Miss LEQ been? She always tells me to take a drink of water at least four times a day. So we added a whole bunch of new facts to LEQ. Did you know that a cup of chopped red bell pepper contains more vitamin C than an orange? Okay. What did you think of that? Certainly the print was, I could see that quite clearly. What about this? Well, I can see that. LEQ, play music. No problem. It will begin shortly. By 2050, almost half a billion people are going to be 80 or older. And if current trends continue, more and more are going to be like Joseph and Betty, living alone. LEQ, stop. Today, both of them are doing okay. But some of Danielle's other participants have been struggling. Is it kind of hard to leave them at the end of the day? It is. Some of our testers are pretty advanced in the stages of depression through loneliness and isolation. And at times, I know that LEQ is cheering them up in their day. But I know that it's only part of the way. No source of artificial intelligence robots will ever be able to replace.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,644,2022-10-07 22:47:12
12419," But I know that it's only part of the way. No source of artificial intelligence robots will ever be able to replace humans and human companionship or human care. The key to Danielle's work is to embrace that very limitation of machines. Robots should help humans do what they love, help humans interact with more humans, help humans in general. Not pull humans away from humans, not take humans jobs, leave humans without purpose. Whether it's in our workplaces or in our homes, robots are soon going to be everywhere. And it's up to Danielle to make sure this robot-filled future leaves us just a little better off. So don't be afraid. And if you are afraid, come and join us. It's a friendly place. If you're like the estimated 74% of adults in the US who use YouTube, this might be what your home screen is. An algorithmically curated look into what you like to watch. Maybe some tips on how to prepare a new meal or your favorite vloggers latest video. But if you're a parent who shares your phone with your children, it probably looks a little more like this. Kids content on YouTube is huge. Views for videos can reach into the billions. Five of the top 10 videos in all of YouTube's history are either music videos or kids videos, with baby shark having more views than people on the planet. YouTube has created a revolution, not an evolution, in the way kids and families consume video content. And that extends then into how they view toys and play and all of the associated things that go with that. Kids YouTube for the unaware can be adorable. It can be boring. It can also just be flat out strange. But often it involves toys. And for toy makers who embrace the platform, it led to record success. I think it was surprised, unquestionably, the biggest phenomenon that has ever happened in a toy industry. This is the story of how YouTube changed kids toys. Play patterns, the way children play is timeless. But how we deliver on those play patterns through product and how we market that to children has changed quite a bit over the years. And I would say that the last five to ten years really ranks right up there with the 1950s when TV commercials directed to children was first launched by Mattel. This is Nancy's Wears. She led the Barbie brand during the 90s and spent four years as the chief marketing officer for Spinmaster. It used to be that there would be a few play things that parents would bring into the home where that children would create themselves. Like a stick and a ball becomes a play thing. And the industry was out of certain...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,645,2022-10-07 22:51:14
12420," You play things that parents would bring into the home where that children would create themselves like a stick and a ball becomes a play thing. And the industry was at a certain level of volume at that point. Mattel was very innovative and actually put the first product on TV and advertised it to children. Let's play home. This created a huge explosion in the toy industry that unfolded across decades. The hit of the day when you're ready to play, everyone knows this thing. Here he comes, here he comes, greatest toy you've ever been. And his name is Mr. Machine. Here I go, here I go, fighting man, for it to go on the land of the T.H.D. Air. When you go back to the 1980s, what do you think of in terms of hit shows? You think of things like masters of the universe. You think of the original Transformers and Care Bears. The joke was they were 22-minute commercials. Just close your eyes and care. Let's make a TV show which is really promotion for our property or IP to help sell toys. There were a lot of those famous characters in which kids absolutely loved it. They were totally entertained, but there were huge toy lines behind them. This is Jim Silver, a 37-year veteran of the toys industry. In 1999, he started a consumer toy review magazine called Toy Wishes. And now he's the CEO of an influencer talent management group, TTPM. Regulations changed through the years, and also parents became aware that they were purely commercials. And you saw a lot of the new channels, the Disney Channel and Nickelodeon. They realized that wouldn't work anymore. And to them, entertainment came before licensing. What happened over time was that toys started to become designed for a 32nd commercial. Close it's a mild matter true box. Open it's a micro machine USA. Cruiser mini micro machine vehicles planes and both to the police station, the marine of the mini motorcycle repair shop, the gas station, the construction office, work the rear working driver, highway passenger rap and garage doors. So if you couldn't explain it in a 32nd commercial, cost reduce it out of the product and just stick with what you could say. And features of toys, magical features using electronics, lights and sounds and mechanical movements that magic, like they don't know how it happens, that became more and more important. The sound of power is heard. Fire from Batman. See you Batman. Batman's turbo powered net mobile flies into high gear. Since 2000 with cable channels dedicated to kids, Disney Channel, Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, there became the opportunity to reach kids in mass numbers every day of the week. And so the toy industries continued to grow. The toy industry for the most part was a pretty solid business. Just growing a couple percent a year here and there. There'd be big, big years here and there when there was maybe a hit movie, like a Star Wars movie come out, you know, drive a lot of toy sales. From 2014 to 2019, the global toy industry would grow by 15%. At about the same time, those major cable networks of Nickelodeon, Disney Channel and Cartoon Network would lose half their total audience. 2017 also saw the bankruptcy of Toys R Us, as both parents and kids discovered and bought more toys online. If you think about kids, they're usually the first adopters of a new medium. Kids weren't watching things like Nickelodeon as much as they used to. They were watching things on YouTube. YouTube started in early 2005. And this was like, you know, the very early web 2.0, this beginning of sort of like what was the time was going to be your generated content, like web blogging with the big, my space was the biggest thing on the internet back then. There was an early video of a Brazilian soccer legend doing stunt tricks that just when it exploded on the site, one of the first viral videos, lazy Sunday. If you remember that SNL short. That's the chronic one, Kills Adonia! Oh, Charlie! I'm gonna be a bit late. You remember those early viral hits? YouTube in the early days was definitely comedy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,646,2022-10-07 22:56:32
12421," Surely, I'm done a bit, babe. You remember those earliest viral hits? YouTube in the early days was definitely comedy and in music. It was a place of experimentation. I was the chief audience officer at Maker Studios. I oversaw essentially the creator partnerships and all over the world. Maker Studios was one of the largest multi-channel networks on YouTube and had partnered with some of the biggest YouTube channels of the time, before being sold to Disney in 2014. Chris is now the CEO of PocketWatch, which represents some of the largest kids stars on YouTube, including Ryan's world, and Love Diana, who can amass over a couple billion views every month. The Trude is one of the very biggest and earliest videos on all of YouTube, is by a creator and star named Ijustine, where she unboxed her first mobile phone bill for her brand new iPhone, and it came in a box. And this ultimately morphed into many different formats associated with unboxing and tech was actually really big. And those became fairly successful pretty early on on the platform. And you saw them expand from tech products to beauty products and then around 2012 and 2013, which only just explosion in the toys. So here's the Furby inside right here. We used to call them handschance. And a handschance was literally a top-down view of someone's hands unboxing typically a toy. And they'd unbox it, they'd show each component. We just got Uncle Screamy. I would speak to many of those creators. We signed many of those creators at Maker Studios to be our partners. And it was fascinating in that it was this whole new genre and this whole new format. And that corresponded with a rise of kids and family viewership on YouTube that was stuck, that was hard to miss. And you would see it in the data. And we had access to a lot of data in Maker Studios around YouTube. Let's see what's inside. First up, we had the storm super pig. You saw the launch of EvanTube, who I consider the first child, so to speak, unboxing star. And they would open toys. And kids would just mesmerize by it. They loved watching it. And next thing you know, you had literally 50 unboxings. They were unboxing just about every toy. It was, and people were just really excited. You open the toy, and you see a toy pop out. And kids just got excited to see the piece by piece. Yeah, he's in a bathroom. We're in a, he's eating a lobster. You know, the early days of these unboxing videos, the videos were, you know, from a doll's perspective, just terrible. I mean, they were 10 minutes long. They were boring. They were a shaky camera. There was absolutely no production value. And if you think about these executives, you know, they're trying to figure out how to reach this new audience. And they're brought these videos and say, well, look at this video. It has 200,000 views on it. And it's terrible. When I first heard of it, I thought it was the weirdest thing. It just seemed kind of bizarre. Who would want to watch someone opening a toy, taking it out of the box? But then when I started thinking about this idea of exploration and discovery as a core play pattern, the most fundamental play pattern there is, it started to make sense. And I think that I have to say that the company that really jumped on that in the most concerted way was MGA with their launch of LOL. L-O-L Surprise! LOL Surprise had three key elements, a doll play, which is, you know, basically the most popular play pattern there is, collectible. So within each LOL Surprise, you'd get a little sheet that showed you all the other dolls you'd collect. And then the surprise factor. You don't know which doll you were getting. It was a blind pack, as they call it. And LOL was made by this company called MGA. Back then, you know, 2016, they were small player of the toy industry, founded by this guy named Isaac Larian, he's the CEO and founder. I have three adult kids, and they were making fun of me that day.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,647,2022-10-07 23:00:49
12422," Small player of the toy industry founded by this guy named Isaac Larian, he's the CEO and founder. I have three adult kids and they were making fun of me that oh you're old you don't know anything about what's happening in today's sink and I said like what and they said for example there is do you know about this iPhone unboxing videos that get millions and millions of views? So I thought they're pulling my leg children to make fun of their parents and then I did go and look one night and I was frankly shocked and flabbergasted that why would you why would anybody buy an iPhone take it home and open the box and show it on the camera and everybody can go and watch it so I type toy unboxing and my god I saw so many different videos and people kids and adults might toys like an apple and unboxing in a video and posting it so that gave me an idea that why why not come up with the ultimate and that's the first L.O.S. surprise. All right oh yes we've got a goal ball. L.O.L. changed the way you open with toys and everybody saw that and the packaging became part of the play which became part of the entertainment so normally if you get a package that you just open a package you take the toy out that's not exciting. You open up L.O.L. you peel it away you open up inside you have seven surprises and it took off like wildfire and quickly became you know the top toy in the country. By December of 2018 eight of the top ten toys sold were all L.O.L. surprised brand and according to MGA from 2016 to 2020 L.O.L. would generate over ten billion dollars in retail sales worldwide. You know L.O.L. was bigger than Star Wars it's bigger than Marvel it's bigger than Barbie these brands with huge advertising budgets are known basically by everyone you don't have to you know you know figure out what Marvel are or Star Wars is and L.O.L. eclipse them all. In the toy world blind bag or blind box toys have been growing in popularity the most famous example in recent years is Pokemon cards where you open packs in hopes of getting a Charizard but more often wind up with something common like Blagar here two years before the launch of L.O.L. in 2014 the Australian toy company Moose toys launched a blind bag collectible called Shopkins and in 2016 spin master would launch a more expensive blind box toy it called Hatchimals. But the thing that sets L.O.L. surprise apart is that it mainly focused on YouTube and not putting ads on YouTube but working with creators and influencers to get their products in the hands of these kids doing the unboxing videos. For MGA actually the move towards YouTube was kind of a bit lucky and almost out of necessity. In late 2015 Nickelodeon parent company Viacom would sue MGA for breach of contract after it failed to pay $3.5 million for the production of a TV series based on their Lala loop seat dolls. They tried to flex their muscle and they said well if you don't agree to our way of seeing things in the conflict that we had they said that conflict we are going to stop your advertising of toys. At the time Nickelodeon was the number one ranked children's network and not to be able to advertise and Nickelodeon could have been a death now. But MGA necessity is the mother of invention that caused them to lean into digital advertising far more than any big brand had ever done before because they had to they had to find a new way to reach kids. The court would ultimately rule in favor of Viacom both in L.A. federal court and on appeal in the 9th Circuit. Larry and Blaine the court defeat on what he contends was judicial bias. Nickelodeon parent company Viacom didn't respond to a request for comment. So that by itself forces us to go and say okay they had with Nickelodeon let's find another way to reach to children and that's how we went and doubled up on YouTube especially.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,648,2022-10-07 23:04:49
12423," They held with Nickelodeon. Let's find another way to reach to children. And that's how we went and doubled up on YouTube especially. And the rest as they say is here. So early on MGA partnered with YouTube creators with huge audiences like Cookie Swirl See. Good morning, Choppelene Chippy Cookies. We are going to be spending the morning with this LOL surprise baby fancy. They took it another step further. They actually helped kids learn how to do their own unboxing videos. They gave them support and learning and tools. And so all these kids got to be kind of a little many influencers themselves as they were unboxing their LOL products. So just to give you a flavor of how popular these videos are. Go on to YouTube and search LOL surprise. And you'll see videos with a million views, 10 million, 25 million, 50 million, even 100 million. There's a lot of them and kids are watching these videos and they're probably watching them over and over again. The old way toy manufacturers would do things is they buy TV which was about 90% of their ads spend. And then traditional PR get on the big morning shows. It's an entirely different formula. It's much harder for toy companies right now because the formula is so complicated. You have to really take a deep dive into each platform. Am I promoting on Twitter? Am I promoting on Instagram? Am I promoting on TikTok? What am I doing on YouTube? You have to look at every possible social channel. By 2017, big toy brands like Mattel had shifted nearly 50% of their marketing budget to social platform advertising. Brands would help seed videos of their toys. And if they were lucky, that could kick off a wave of creators making their own content around the product. In 2020 alone, tubular labs estimated that LOL related content had amassed 5.1 billion views. This idea of imitation. So when you see kids playing with product, it kind of excites the same neurons in your brain that happen when you do it yourself. The more we could show children, having this experience, the more kids felt what it would be like to have it and then wanted to experience it themselves. One of the criticisms of this whole influencer movement among kids is that kids are young. They don't understand what's necessarily an advertisement versus real content. And that's a big criticism of this industry. Is that a lot of kids are getting on YouTube at young ages, not being supervised by their parents and just watching these videos. And they don't realize that maybe that influencer is getting paid by the brand to do that video or there's some other compensation. And that, you know, blurs the lines for kids is sort of developing and figuring out how to consume media. Questionable advertising concerns aside, kids YouTube creators would take off. Channels like Ryan's World would grow to almost 30 million subscribers and a whole industry formed around them. When we first started working with influencers, they were very happy to work for free product. You give them the product and they do something for you. Then gradually influencers got smarter and started, you know, charging for their services as they started building a following. Now, because it is such a big business, the dollars can be significant investing in big influencers. When Spin Master launched one of its new TV series and associated product, we made it a point to buy an advertising.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,649,2022-10-07 23:08:52
12424," After launched one of its new TV series and associated product, we made it a point to buy an advertising package with Ryan's world to ensure that we could get really quick, big reach right away. This is an advertisement for Spin Master. So from these unboxing videos, the contents gotten a lot more sophisticated. They're creating narratives around the toys, voices, and meta-universes, if you will. And it's really engaging content, even more so than the original unboxing videos for these kids. And you know, the content's coming out maybe once a week, or even daily. So if you think about it, what they've done is they've created basically like a TV show around a toy. It's not unlike what we saw back in the 80s, which was criticized back then, by the way, when you've had toys like GI Joe, turned into an animated series, or Masters of the Universe, or Transformers. So we've kind of seen this full circle now, right? So back to where we were, content, and basically many television shows created around toys on YouTube. Kids content on YouTube is likely to face increased regulation in the coming years. In 2019, the company would agree on a $170 million settlement with the FTC for serving ads based on personal data to kids on YouTube. YouTube would put more emphasis behind its Made For Kids platform YouTube kids, and each video uploaded to YouTube must be flagged as either Made For Kids or not. In a statement outlining changes to the site, YouTube would say that responsibility is our number one priority at YouTube, and this includes protecting kids and their privacy. Still, the site is far less regulated than traditional television. I do think parents have a better understanding of YouTube now, and the new genres and formats there that they didn't prior. And they now notice things like their kid isn't watching a toy unboxing. That's a commercial for a toy. Their kid is watching other kids play with toys in an imaginative way, which inspires them to go play with things in the real world in an imaginative way. In just a few short years, YouTube had caused a transfer of power from toy and network executives to nine year olds and their families. The Kaji family may have started out as toy reviewers, but now Ryan has launched his own line of toys. A cartoon series. He was even a blimp in the 2020 Macy's Thanksgiving parade. You and I might think about Spider-Man or Snoopy, but today's kids see that blimp of Ryan and they relate to him. He's the character they want to grow up with. He's the character they want to engage with. And as we go forward, these influencers are becoming more and more like big, giant, global brands. And that has profound effects for entertainment going forward. You get a duration of movie utility.

On any given night you could have as many as two million people staying in an Airbnb all around the world. You know our mission is that everyone can belong anywhere. We're talking you know 300 million stays on any average year and there's tyranny in numbers. The vast majority of Airbnb stays don't result in a safety incident but sometimes things go wrong. And for Airbnb you know we're talking thousands of safety incidents that occur every...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,650,2022-10-07 23:13:38
12425," For Airbnb, we're talking thousands of safety incidents that occur every year that the company has to handle and has to respond to. I'm talking situations like kid naffings, hostage cases. We're talking murder, we're talking rape, we're talking the worst violent crimes that occur in our society, happen inside Airbnb. Airbnb never wants these kinds of cases to end up in the headlines. You know, that's really bad for their brand, their reputation and their public image, particularly because this is a business that's based on strangers trusting one another. So when crimes like this occur, that kind of threatens their entire business model. I'm Olivia Carville, I'm a reporter on Bloomberg's technology team and I've been covering online travel companies like Airbnb for the last two years. Airbnb is a startup that's based in Silicon Valley and like many of the sharing economy startups, it managed to grow so big so fast by essentially skirting regulations. It was based on that premise of move fast and break things and it wanted to work against regulations in order to grow as big as possible and win the popular vote because it became so popular, so fast that cities could no longer control it. And a peak night is past August, we had one million people from around the world coming from 180 countries in a single night staying in an Airbnb home. The vast majority of Airbnb stays, we're talking, you know, two million people staying in an Airbnb on any given night don't result in a safety incident but sometimes things go wrong. And for the company, you know, it was dealing with these cases was a really challenging, difficult, complicated area. You had hosts and guests and sometimes they disagreed on what happened. You had regulatory issues in some of their biggest cities, then you also had, you know, the growth of the platform and the fact that if you're going to try and prevent some of these incidents, it could cut into revenue and cut into the number of listings that you have. So for Airbnb, it was about trying to figure out the best way to handle these crises in a way that's going to not only protect the individual in crisis but also protect the company's public image, its brand, its reputation, which is essentially what its business is based upon. As Airbnb grew, like way too big for them to be able to take all these calls alone, they developed a team of 100 highly specialized agents that handled the worst of the worst cases. Over the course of my reporting, I've talked to almost 50 former employees at Airbnb and you know, seven or eight of those work directly on this elite unit. These safety agents, many of them come from military backgrounds or trauma backgrounds. They're trained to handle traumatic situations and to try and, you know, help people who are going through what may be, you know, the worst day in their lives. For these safety agents, a lot of them understood that they had a dual role. First and foremost, they wanted to protect the user in crisis, but they also knew they had a responsibility to protect the company's brand and public image. I mean, everything about housing in New York is a total mess and it's always chaotic. It's not too surprising that Airbnb's biggest battle has broken out here. 2015 was a really challenging year for Airbnb. Airbnb's listings between 2010 and 2014 were essentially illegal hotels. You know, the company was seven years old now. It had grown huge. It was now a household name, but by growing that big that fast, they also came up against, you know, a pushback in regulations. Now, Airbnb's under attack in a lot of me. They can't give up on New York, because New York's too important for every kind of reason. They knew that they couldn't lose the battle in New York because it was one of the biggest markets and also it could result in a domino.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,651,2022-10-07 23:17:53
12426," important for every kind of reason. They knew that they couldn't lose the battle in New York because it was one of their biggest markets and also it could result in a domino effect. If other cities around America saw New York City either backing down on regulations or enforcing strict regulations that could in turn be rolled out right across the country. I think it's going to be awkward when they have to put in their perspectives, their risk factors when they have to say, well, you know, one risk is that the whole thing might be somewhere illegal in our biggest market. And in December of that year a young woman from Australia flew into New York and stayed in an Airbnb with a group of her friends. They picked up a key from the local corner bodega without even needing identification. The police report said this 29 year old woman left her friends at a midtown bar and returned to the Airbnb on her own. She thought that she was alone, but she wasn't. There was a man inside the apartment hiding in the shadows with a kitchen knife. He grabbed her, dragged her into a room and raped her. He laid a fled. But in an hour after this attack, he came back and police were in the apartment at the time. They opened his backpack and found three items of interest, the kitchen knife, one of the woman's earrings, and a set of keys to the Airbnb. This case was a really complicated one for Airbnb partly because it occurred in New York City where they were fighting this really tough battle with city officials over regulations and partly because the alleged rapist had the keys and he was inside the apartment. That meant that Airbnb needed to do what it could to protect itself. They wanted to find out, you know, how did he get the keys? That was a really big question for them. They launched an investigation to find that out. But before they did anything like that, before they thought to kind of protect their own reputation here, they really focused on doing what they could to help this young woman. They paid for her to move to a hotel. They paid for her mother to fly in from Australia. They paid for both of them to fly home. They offered to cover any health or leave or counselling costs that she might need later. But inside the company internally, they also launched an investigation. They wanted to know how did the alleged rapist get the keys? How did he get inside that Airbnb? And when they found out that the keys had been left at the corner of Odaiga, that then created, you know, a problem of liability for Airbnb. They didn't have a policy around key exchange. They didn't tell their hosts how they did or didn't have to hand keys over to guests as they were arriving. So for Airbnb, they also, you know, they wanted to know what was going to be said in court. They wanted to know if any media were going to pick up on this story. And they wanted to know what their legal liability potentially could be. A week later, the alleged rapist was indicted in the Supreme Court in New York. An Airbnb sent a staff member to find out if the company was going to be mentioned in any of the court records. And it wasn't. It wasn't mentioned in the police report. It wasn't mentioned by prosecutors. There's no mention of Airbnb really in any public record. This case has never been reported until now. And, you know, for Airbnb, that was kind of lucky. This case never landed in the media. And, you know, 18 months later, when this woman's lawyer reached out to the company, they signed a settlement for $7 million. And part of that settlement, there's a clause that says she cannot assert or imply responsibility on the part of the company. We've spoken to legal experts who indicate that what this really did is gag the woman from saying, I blame Airbnb.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,652,2022-10-07 23:22:18
12427,"... Airbnb is one of the few companies in the world that has this like online offline kind of hybrid situation where you have users who meet online and then actually meet in the offline world and stay under the same roof. And that means that the company at the end of the day really has to take more responsibility than other social media platforms might do. With Airbnb's terms of service, that really means that whenever there's a dispute between hosts and guests and the company, this is all handled behind closed doors in arbitration. Most of these cases don't even make it to the courtroom. And when they do, the company will settle them so it doesn't go on through the courts. And what that means is that there hasn't really been a legal precedent that's set to determine what your B&B's liability is here. You know, is it really responsible for when things go wrong inside its listings? What I learned over the course of my reporting is that this is anything but simple. This is a complicated, nuanced area. There are difficult trade-offs here. The company also has to have hard, you know, tough conversations about policy. Airbnb's business model is based on strangers trusting one another. We often hear from the founders and the chief executive himself saying trust is their number one priority. I've actually heard Brian Cheske, the chief executive of Airbnb, talking about how he didn't build a website or a platform that allows people to stay in each other's homes, what he built was a community that trusts one another. And when that premise is undercut, Airbnb's entire business model is under threat. The firm's earth view. Earth's view sounds far-fetched at the moment, doesn't it? But you know, we may be seeing ads like this in the not-too-distant future. Living away from Earth has always captured our imagination. As well as providing the basics for survival, these ideas are a symbol of humankind's unique creativity and ambition. This advanced beast or a species' station would be hit quadrace with a final accent to the moon. Today, the idea of multiple outposts where we can live and work in space has never seen closer. We're going to fly. It's about making our lives the best we can make it. It's about as a species having a path for our future. And the mission to create these habitats is well underway, as private companies get ready to take that next giant leap. The International Space Station, it's the only space habitat we have. One of the first places they take you in the ISS is the CUPLA, so you can find...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,653,2022-10-07 23:26:51
12428," The International Space Station, it's the only space habitat we have. One of the first places they take you in the ISS is the Coupola. So you can finally look at the Earth in all its beauty in it. I don't care who you are, it's always stunning, it's shocking, it's amazing because that's the view you've been waiting for your entire life. It passes over 90% of the world's population without most of us ever realizing. And at an estimated cost of $150 billion, it's the most expensive object with ever built. You think about like the Sistine Chapel, the Pyramids, and the Burj Khalifa, or take your pick. I mean, it far outstrips those. It's the one and only non-terrestrial human outpost. We've had a constant human footprint in orbit for almost 20 years because of the International Space Station. The collaboration between 15 countries started construction in 1998 and was pieced together in space over the course of a decade. Since 2000, it's been a permanently crude research laboratory, a space habitat that's allowed human kind to live, manufacture, and explore beyond Earth. The overarching achievement of the space station has been education. It has educated us about how to do research, it's educated us about how to live, it's educated us about the harshness of the environment that it is in, and it's about learning, I think. People say what was one of your favorite parts about being up there? Hands down, floating everywhere I went. But your first impressions for ISS certainly is how big it is. The ISS is a size of an American football field. With most of that footprint taken up by eight solar arrays, these provide enough energy to power 40 homes. The station has an American side and a Russian side, as well as contributions from other nations like Canada, Japan, and the European Union. Astronauts on board can pass freely between these sections. They're living in working areas and made up of modules, each 4.2 metres in diameter, and in total they have the same volume as a Boeing 747. The three main labs, Destiny, Hope, and Columbus, are conducting up to 600 ongoing experiments at any one time. And while it's been a collaboration between governments to build and maintain the ISS, its next chapter will rely more on private enterprise. Today is a very remarkable day. NASA is opening the International Space Station to commercial opportunities and marketing these opportunities as we've never done before. Managing and maintaining the ISS costs $3.4 billion a year. That's over half NASA's space operations budget. Aging hardware and space debris will only add to these costs, which is why NASA is now hoping to pass some responsibility for the station over to commercial companies. We would like to see a robust commercial marketplace in lower orbit where space stations exist outside of NASA, the goal being that NASA could be a customer. And we want to have numerous providers that are competing against each other on cost and innovation. With federal funding proposed to stop in 2025, opening the station to private enterprise would free up resources for the space agency's ambitions to return to the moon and journey to Mars. Transfrying to a more commercial model is allowing industry to take over many of those areas that NASA has traditionally been responsible for, like the design and operations and maintenance of space systems. But the most exciting part, I think, is new opportunities. The iPhones would have never come from the government, for instance. The base technology came from the government, but the way it's used, the way it interacts with consumers, governments aren't really built for that. So I think that would be exciting to see how private industry uses the same technology or the same systems, but then use them in a different way. Every NASA achievement has been the collaborative achievement of NASA and industry. What's going on right now that's a little bit different is NASA is turning to companies not to direct them what to do, but it's turning to companies to build relationships with them because those companies are attracting investment from non-s.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,654,2022-10-07 23:30:57
12429," Ships with them because those companies are attracting investment from non-space sources and are bringing a different kind of innovation to the table. In the shadow of NASA's sprawling Johnson Space Center, the headquarters of startup Axiom Space might seem a little modest, but their goal is big to build the first commercial space station. Led by a former ISS program manager, the team has been involved in every mission to the station since its inception. We know it has to be much lower cost operate on orbit than ISS is today, so this is key to continuing the heritage of ISS. It's to start there so we can evolve everybody to the next platform. I liken this to the internet. So the internet was created and we got very excited. And any kid with a good idea and just the basic programming skills could go build a program to do something. We have huge companies that grew out of that and still today there's new ideas, new things being built. The thing about a microgravity environment is it's limitless. It's like the data we have access to on the internet is limitless and it is not immediately obvious to us all the benefits that that's going to entail, but over time it will become very very obvious. By 2024, Axiom plans to send a central node to attach to the ISS. That will make up the core of their new station. This will be followed by crew quarters for 16 people and research and manufacturing modules. When the ISS is retired this will break away and additional modules with a lifespan of 30 years will be added and swapped out as they age using a robotic arm. And they're hoping to do all of this for one-fiftyth the cost of the ISS. I mean when you talk about our vision it sounds really simple. It really is about driving the thought process and the cost down so that anybody that wants to take advantage of our place in orbit and a microgravity environment can do so and that's really it. The International Space Station is a fantastic vehicle but one of the big things is they have a quite a few major components outside which means you have to do an EVA, a spacewalk to go fix it. A spacewalk on a good day is a hundred hours of crew time to get ready and actually go do the the spacewalk so we're able to take advantage of the reduced size of components and so our design is going to have all of the components here on the be it in the pressurized environment. So we know what the basics are you know water, food, clothing, life support and we know how to handle those. And now the next step is how do we make it more intuitive and we want to now take advantage of the technologies and the capabilities have today to build more luxury into the experience. The objective is to make the environment the background for all the users. You're every day doing whatever you want to do on orbit, research, manufacturing, looking out the window, whatever year they are to do, we want you to be able to do that not even think about the environment and it's because of our experience on ISS and what the team brings to the Axiom space we're able to build that environment. You won't worry about that. Three, two, one, release, release, fire, fire. Like Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin Axiom is hoping to attract space tourists with tickets starting at $55 million for a 10 day mission. But that's just one part of the commercial space station market that they think could be worth $37 billion over the next decade. Our first commercial customers are countries who have astronauts in space and want to expand their activity in space and countries who do not yet have a human spaceflight program who want to send people up and we've now got both research and manufacturing companies who want to do work with us while we're at the International Space Station and on our platform after it separates from ISS. Human spaceflight is particularly exciting because it's that slice of space that is really nascent. It hasn't undergone the crowding that satellites have had it hasn't already had that explosive growth. It's really ready for that now. The first thing I'm really looking forward to seeing happen is the face of our first astronauts on orbit looking back down on us and knowing that we had a hand in sending that person to",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,655,2022-10-07 23:35:25
12430, The first thing I'm really looking forward to seeing happen is the face of our first astronauts on orbit looking back down on us and knowing that we had a hand in sending that person to space and ultimately the separation of ISS when it's ready to be retired and de-orbited and then we continue in space independently. For me that is a stepping-off moment for humanity. It's almost like when Neil Armstrong put that first boot on the moon. This will be the first time that we've gone from a platform of learning how to live in space to building our permanent home in space. Other private companies also want to use the ISS as the starting point for their own ventures. Bigelow Aerospace already has one of its inflatable structures attached to the station and others including Sierra Nevada and Nanorax have put forward proposals. Space habitats are expensive. I think it's a false dichotomy to say okay we're done with the International Space Station let's move on to commercial platforms. What I think is much more likely and realistic in what NASA is certainly driving toward is an incremental transition where commercial platforms attach to the space station or work collaboratively with the space station. The next chapter cannot occur without the active engagement of companies. That said that active engagement might not be as customers might not be as drivers it might be in service of government mission objectives. We will return American astronauts to the moon not only to leave behind footprints and flags but to build the foundation we need to send Americans to Mars and beyond. This proposed mission along with SpaceX's own ambition to reach a red planet has opened up a longer term market and some companies are already thinking beyond orbiting habitats like space stations to actually building on the surface of other planets. I was working in a firm designing skyscrapers and you know I saw Elon and landed his Falcon X rocket in the middle of the ocean and that for me was a trigger. I thought wow this could actually happen and it's always been my dream to put a building on the moon or Mars and if he's going at the pace he's going it could definitely happen within my lifetime and I want to be the one to build it. In this warehouse alongside startups from across the US architecture firm AI space factory are refining the production of Marsha a four-story structure they created for a NASA competition to design the next generation of space habitats on Mars. You know when we started designing our Mars habitat Marsha I think we looked at everything that had been done already and kind of tossed that aside but what we were given was a set of guidelines from NASA they think the best way to build a habitat on Mars or the moon is to use what they call in-situ resource utilization so use the materials that are there. If you've seen sci-fi movies you might see like glass and steel domes on distant planets but the reality is to ship that kind of material to the moon of Mars would be so absorbed in the expense of you would never be able to build in the first place so the idea is to send a 3D printing robot which can then harvest the materials you find on a site and build with that. The reusable print material is a mix of biopolymer made from recycled plastic or plants like corn and sugar cane and basalt a rock found on Mars and Earth. It's the rock that gives us it's incredible strength we've tested this material it's three times as strong as concrete in compression and it actually has what we call it a tensile capacity and prevent itself from being pulled apart which is something concrete is not very good at you need to think at all times how do you optimize the amount of material that you use and that's also why this thing is shaped like an egg and if you think of an egg it's a very structurally optimized form it's very very thin but it provides the strength that the egg needs and that's why this is shaped the way that it is. The egg shape as well as a nested shell structure also accommodates for extreme differences in pressure and temperature on the surface of Mars but more research still needs to be done to find out how print materials could be gathered and how 3D printing would work in a unique environment of space.

12431," You're dealing with a completely different set of physics and environments which is very harsh. The cold, you know, the low gravity, the vacuum of space, you know, and finding solutions for how to build their or do anything in space just requires a high degree of innovation. There's no such thing as brute force when it comes to space. Like you need to think about the problem, find a very elegant lightweight, cost-effective solution. The next challenge is really going to places on Earth, literally taking the dirt that we're finding on a site and beginning to print with the dirt. We have to perfect this technology on Earth and then we go prove it out on the moon and then finally on to Mars. The first customers could include NASA and companies like SpaceX who would lease out these structures for individual missions. But before that, AI space factory hoped their technology could be monetized as well as transformational here on Earth. The challenges of building on Mars forced us to kind of make this jump in construction technology which we can now apply on Earth to build more sustainably. So rather than building with steel and concrete, which are these manufactured very energy intensive materials to go to a site, have a solar-powered array that would then allow our 3D printer to print in the most sustainable way possible. And we never would have found these ways that wasn't for the challenge of building in space. Three, two, one, ignition and lift off the Falcon 9 to the space station. On the first commercial launch from Kennedy Space Centers, historic had 39A. Humans have now been consistently living and working in space for more than 15 years. And if we want to keep that up, what do habitats need to look like? And frankly, they can be larger, they can be small. But the future of space habitats really, to me, comes down to the ability to persistently maintain human presence. Whether that's a few people or many people, that seems to be the dividing line between where we were before and where we want to be in the future. We have to learn how to benefit from what we do on orbit and bring those natural benefits back home. So we help ourselves out on the ground while we also learn to live somewhere else. And it really, at the very deepest level, is about survival or species. So I get pretty excited when I spend a few moments thinking about what we're off to go do, because this really is the first step to learning to live off the planet. That first step is just the start of our journey to create a lasting legacy in space. While commercial companies may be stepping in to imagine what these new space habitats look like, it's what's happening inside of them that may unlock the future of space industrialisation. On the next episode of Giant Leap, we'll visit the private companies who are looking to build their business around manufacturing in space. Using the unique properties of microgravity, they plan to create new materials with extraordinary qualities that can't be replicated on Earth. Including new manufacturing techniques that could change how we build large structures in space and even unlock the ability to 3D print full human organs. But before low Earth orbit can become a new industrial centre, we're going to need to take another giant leap.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,657,2022-10-07 23:44:23
12432," This is how it used to work. A real estate agent would lock in the client, they'd stage the place, hold an open house every single weekend, and hope that the right buyer walks through that door. Ten years ago, you could probably go look at a house and circle back two to three weeks later and still have an opportunity to make a bid. The first time I received a lead through Instagram, my mind was blown. If you're seeing something in a neighborhood that is established, you have two to three days after the open house in this market to make an offer. Our world has shifted so much. Folks are getting comfortable doing business either through social media or 100% virtual. But social media, like everything else it touches, has turned the real estate business upside down. You've heard this trope before. Millennials aren't buying and owning as much as their parents' generation. Be it a car, a diamond, or a home. But the lack of ownership is not always by choice. In 2018, a survey found that 89% of Millennial Americans want to buy a home. They just can't afford it. As of 2019, Millennials of all stripes owned only 5% of US housing, compared with 15% for gen Xers. Millennials haven't been able to make these big ticket purchases the same way as their predecessors did. Now, this is down to the financial crisis. We have rising student loan debt and a higher cost of living. Now, Millennials are getting older. They're earning more money and saving more. So now is about the time where a lot of them are going out and making those purchases. And now, having been stuck at home for over a year, the same generation that embraced ubers and Airbnb's wants something to call their own. I got married and I have a child. So, you know, looking for more space and thought about a conventional route of young and single and living in the city and then move out to the suburbs when you have a kid in a wife. I've seen a whole bunch of my friends just move on down to the West Palm Beach, my AMI area, Austin, Texas. So they are certainly moving out of the city, but space was top of mind for them moving out. We lived in Williamsburg for about 16 plus years and week two in the pandemic, we just realized we needed more. So we started looking for a house right away. We now live in Goshen, New York, which is about an hour and a half from New York City. Program accounts like circuit houses and cheap old houses offer a glimpse into the perfect suburban life, often at a price point not too dissimilar to what adults pay for rent in major cities. By the end of 2020, New Yorkers who didn't flee paid an average of $2,700 a month for an apartment, even as rent prices plummeted during the pandemic. Millennials make a large percentage of spending right now and that makes them a valuable consumer for brands. That means they're being courted by everyone out there to spend with them. They grew up online. They're comfortable with pretty much anything that you can do there and that's buying things, selling things, Craigslist, eBay, all that. Making a $100 purchase on Craigslist or a $1000 purchase on eBay, it's not that much of a leap to go even further if you're buying a fancy piece of jewelry or a house for a million bucks. The uptick and home demand fueled by the pandemic combined with record low interest rates has made home buying extremely competitive over the last year. So much so that some millennials look to social media to shop and actually buy their first house site unseen. I saw sort of something on my Instagram feed and you know, clicked and we ended up seeing this house. Houses weren't really being shown at that time because we were in full lockdown. We became really interested in one YouTube video, 20 Z-LO photos and that is it.

12433," hitting eyeballs strictly through social media. People are not looking in the back section of the times anymore for real estate listings. Our demographic is between late 20s to mid 40s and that demographic is spending a lot of time on social media and they're doing a lot of shopping via Instagram and other social media platforms. This is Joshua Gelb and Pele Hamburger. During the pandemic, the two New York City-based developers started Neville House, a new construction project two hours north of the city. Unlike most traditional real estate listings, the pair bypassed the use of a broker and advertised their homes directly on Instagram. No fees, no commissions. You used to have to hire a broker, work with them, they would do showings on site. Now you basically put your renderings on Instagram and within an hour you have 15-20 replies saying can I come see it directly with you and let's see it tomorrow and it's just completely changed the game. Most people have that image in their head of the quick-essential upstate modern cabin set in the woods. We've definitely tried to tap into that and create something that's attainable for these people. Say you can have that, you can be swiping through Instagram and that can be your home too. There's been quite a proliferation of these direct to consumer brands. There's just tons of them out there. It's not that hard to start up a website that sells things and get things manufactured for that e-commerce platform. So like all birds with shoes, casper with mattresses or warby parker with glasses. All of that means a lot more opportunity for brands in the online shopping space. So it's natural that real estate would want to get involved as well with these big ticket items. I think that my clients text me listings, they have alerts, they find things quicker than we do sometimes because we're out and about. I'd say that the buyer is much more involved these days. Social selling is creating brand new ways to shop. So let's look at vintage clothing, for example. There are sellers on Instagram finding successful ways to sell one of a kind items. It's that fleeting nature, the ephemeral nature of social media. You post the item online and whoever's first gets that one of a kind item. Now real estate has similar scarcity to it. There's one place to buy. It's one home, one apartment, one thing. It's one of a kind. But the rise in social media real estate isn't just about the instant gratification. Researcher Andre Perry, who studies economic inclusion at the Brookings Institute, says social media has evolved from the days of online hangout spaces and mood boards to a powerful change agent. Social media is a primary source to get news and information, but it's not just about social media, it's about the movement that we're in. The racial justice uprising really gave people a sense of worth and empowerment. And so people not only are getting information about what protects people in the long run from economic shocks, things like wealth. In his research, Andre found that not only are more millennials buying homes during the pandemic, the rate of home ownership among black millennials are at historic highs. The fastest way to accumulate wealth in this country traditionally has been through home ownership. Millennials in particular are saying, hey, I want protection, I want to live longer, I want my education to go further. Let me acquire wealth and the fastest way to do that is through home ownership. When the pandemic hit many of the amenities or the comforts that came along with those living conditions were gone. Folks couldn't go to bars and fancy shops. And so you saw instead of people going out and buying clothes, they saved their money and bought property and outside of the city generally. People are moving to the suburbs, to rural areas, places where home prices are a little bit cheaper. Many home buyers are looking for houses outside the major metropolitan areas. Additionally, many home buyers are looking for direct outdoor access and added space as the uncertainty about the virus persists. Millennials are also looking to influencers not just for the latest trends and TikTok dances, but to part-.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,659,2022-10-07 23:52:49
12434," Dr. Access and added space as the uncertainty about the virus persist. Millennials are also looking to influencers not just for the latest trends and TikTok dances, but to partake in important conversations, be it about politics or personal finance or anything in between. Relic state ownership. Let's start small. Let's don't be scared to start small. Instead, instead of renting a big house in the hills in California, like most artists do by you on that's on the flat. I meet folks like Brandon Ruhl and Charlotte Main the God. You have residential real estate and you have commercial real estate. They're talking about buying homes. When I was coming up, really home buying was a mysterious shrouded process that only a few people could teach me. Now I can easily log on to clubhouse or Instagram and find literally lessons on how to purchase a home, but done with savvy and finesse. Today we're going to make a greenhouse. I am DIY-ing the entire closet. Heather, having bought her fixer-up her site on scene, also looked to internet personalities to help figure out how to modernize and to make sure her home was also an investment. It gave us a lot of confidence. They make it look super easy. How we could do all of those things ourselves. My husband just installed a laundry shoe, which is something we never would have thought of if we didn't see an influencer do that and how easy it actually is. Really simple to do it yourself project. You can do that. You have any questions go ahead and message me. And in the case of Neville House, Josh and Paley hope that buyers see these homes as potential secondary income. These young families look at these products and look at our homes and say here's a turnkey. This can serve our family, but this can also be the perfect rental. We've tried to strike a balance in the design of a home for working well as a family home. That's going to be lived in and also working as an investment. A lot of this points to how millennials can utilize and leverage social media to their benefit. But it also speaks to again this moment that folks want freedom. So millennials are really stepping up to this real estate game and taking ownership and building well. Of course, not everything is as it seems online. While social media can be a useful tool for learning, there's still a lot it can't tell you about the home buying experience or living in the suburbs for that matter. We knew going into it, budgeting for a lot of renovations. We kind of thought if we buy it at $450, we could put $300,000 into the house and really make it ours and our own. I can't wait to replace in this kitchen and update our built-in deep fryer, which was not in the listing photos. We kind of got into the house and we realized that budget was completely unrealistic. We have a lot of people who see our design on Instagram, they say, I love it. Can you come build this on my property? And then they'll send us the lot, which they bought site unseen during COVID and because of site conditions or zoning, it's virtually unbuildable. I think we all know that what you see on Instagram and what you see in real life are two very different things. So while we can definitely as brokers create these fantastic narratives, the one recommendation that I would give is do your homework. Don't believe everything you say. That's not to say that there's dishonesty or anything where people are trying to manipulate you, but not everything you see is accurate. This shift towards social media house hunting may also help to bring equilibrium to a market that has historically disadvantaged specific groups of buyers. Many of the traditional ways that people got mortgages or loans often precluded black people because they deemed us too risky for those loans. With technology, there's ways to get around that. As long as more black people get educated on racism and discrimination and lending, we're going to figure out ways to get around that racism.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,660,2022-10-07 23:56:52
