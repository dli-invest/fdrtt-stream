12763," Now face, repairing the planet. My family and I are so excited that the Prince of Wales will honor this year's Earth Shot prize winners in partnership with the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, a city that is committed to scientific excellence, environmental justice, and the fight against climate change. We're proud that President Kennedy's moonshot legacy still inspires hope, and we look forward to welcoming all of you who are working to ensure a better future here on Earth. And that's all from the Earth Shot prize innovation side. You can find complete coverage of the event, including full interviews and articles on bloomberg.com. I'm François Lackwap from New York, and this is Bloomberg. When the price of anything goes up, the consequences reach far beyond what you'd expect, but perhaps most of all, when it comes to food. In 2010, surging food prices help spark the Arab Spring. Lives were lost, regimes fell, and the consequences are still with us. Once again, food prices are rising and fast. Energy costs, broken supply chains, and surging demand were just some of the factors that have driven food prices to their first record high since the Arab Spring. And that's all before a war between two of the world's biggest food producers. Ukraine is called the Bread Basket of Europe, and taken with Russia the two account for about a quarter of global wheat trade. They produce more than half of the world's sunflower seeds in oil, nearly 20% of the barley. Now throw in rising energy prices and processing, transporting, even refrigerating food gets more expensive. Plus, fertilizer production is extremely energy intensive. Less fertilizer means lower crop yield, and prices rise even more. The pandemic revealed how complicated and fragile global trade systems are. Global agriculture, perhaps even more so. Unlike metals, for example, food goes bad. And crops take months to grow and are vulnerable to unpredictabilities like the weather. Rising food prices will be felt everywhere, but the poorest countries in the world will be hit the hardest. And as all these factors compound, the real fear is that record high will lead to record high, and ultimately to a global food crisis with vast consequences. What do you want to know today?

MUSIC It's hard to think of any athlete better known or more polarizing than Alex Rodriguez. A three-time MVP, 14-time All-Star and World Series champion, he retired in 2016 as the highest-paid player in MLB history, fourth all-time on the list of home runs. But his playing career isn't likely to be remembered by those statistics or by who he is or isn't dating. Records suspension tonight for baseball star Alex Rodriguez over his use of performance enhancing drugs. You say you did not do these PEDs that they are accusing you of doing it.

12764," You say you did not do these VDs that they are accusing you of doing it. You're correct, Mike. Best dude is unbelievable. A phony to the end. Well, it was the most painful time of my life. It may cost me the hall of fame. And that's on me. Nobody else. I think in a weird way, I'm going to look back and say that's one of the, also one of the best things that happened. Five years after his retirement, Alex Rodriguez, the CEO, is getting back into sports this time as an owner of a proboscopal team. And he wants to build more than just a franchise, but a legacy, maybe, with a dose of redemption. The mistakes made in baseball are done, and I can't go back and fix them. I want to keep a clean record of the father as a friend, as a business person. And because those mistakes, I think I have that opportunity, and I'm having a time of my life doing it. I'm going to keep a clean record of the father as a friend. And I'm going to keep a clean record of the father as a friend. I'm going to keep a clean record of the father as a friend. Hey, Rod, Alex Rodriguez is buying the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Minnesota links. The purchase price is expected to be in the range of $1.5 billion. You know, for me, I think making the transition from player to owner is something that's very exciting to me. I'm really excited to bring my experience both in business, and in sports, and in a locker room, and do really, really exciting things and bring a world championship to the city. In April 2021, Alex Rodriguez joined one of the most exclusive clubs around, folks who own a pro sports team. And while his name and his fame made the headlines, it was his business empire that allowed him to actually close the deal. The easy to remember name, A. Ride Corp, it's grown into a diversified investor and operator, taking a cue from mega firms like Blackstone and KKR. A. Ride Corp has taken a real estate portfolio and expanded into venture capital and private equity and media. And like any business in 2021, it's on SPAC. I was more lucky than smart. I started investing very small in real estate, simply as a hedge to, as my earning power would close, my real estate would not only appreciate what, but create more cash flow. And then I would take their cash flow, and I would buy more real estate, and other private equity type investments were generated more cash flow. So as my Yankee income went to zero, hopefully my real estate and my businesses will grow over time. And while players nowadays are becoming better and better business brands, few are able to achieve this scale as A. Ride Corp has in such a relatively short amount of time. But understanding how that growth happened in business, just like baseball, has to start at home. Music Part of what I love about business is you get to build things from nothing, right? Like nothing. So I had two hip surgeries, and I never wanted to be the old guy that couldn't get up, you know, the stairs, so I built a flat house, all entertainment on that side, my room here, dad and the girls on this side. But it had to be one story because A. I'm always forgetting things. And B. I wanted it to want to be like, oh my God. I can't get up the steps because it be sips. You know, walk around here, I mean, first of all, the arts are beautiful, but tons of pictures of you and the girls. And I mean, you've really made a family light for your self here. Tell me about that. Well, tell you what I'm not at home. I'm not a cleanup hitter and I'm not a CEO. It's a very close to remind me every day that I work for them. Yeah. I can see why you play baseball. People always ask me, what are you doing your life? And I say the three Bs, I do baseball, not basketball, two, business and my babies. And that's kind of, that's my happy zone. It's funny through pandemic. We spend so much time here. And in my 46 years, the toughest time in the world that I've witnessed. On the other side of that, we were in here, and we felt safe, and we felt loved. And it was like 90 days of breakfast, lunch, and dinner. With my girls, it was a dream come true. They got so sick of my dad jokes. So sick of my dancing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,990,2022-10-09 00:07:29
12765," It was like 90 days of breakfast lunch and dinner with my girls. It was a dream come true. They got so sick of my dad jokes. So sick of my dancing. And it's actually what leads you to TikTok. I've been begging, trying to bribe Alex of Duelong with me. She was daddy. You have no swag, no drip. I'm not doing anything with you. A-Rod's dancing may not get his daughter's approval, but his following on social media is huge, with nearly 4 million followers on Instagram alone. That number is larger than his new basketball team, the Yankees or the Red Sox, not to mention any other single baseball player, current or former. Who has better taste in music? Whose room is decorated nicer? What is it that makes you engage the way you do in social? You know, Jason, a lot of that came through my time during my suspension. I spent a whole year serving a suspension. And in that time, I had an opportunity to turn the lens inward. And understand why I was making some of the good choices, the poor choices, the bad choices, and understand kind of conversation, understand storytelling. And it's something that I'm enjoying. It's still fairly new. We're not experts by any means. But every time we look at companies or opportunities or partnerships is data driven and social driven. And it's been quite a tool for us. That suspension, which obviously people will forever associate you with. And there's an interesting choice you make there at that moment and then in subsequent moments to not lean out, to not retreat, but to lean in to some extent. And especially in the last couple of years, tell me about that. If you think about my career, sure I've hit home runs and been part of a world champion team. But I'm also on fifth all time in the history of strikeouts. I mean, that means that only four people in the history of mankind have failed more than me. But I think as a result, I've been PhD in failing, but also an MBA of getting back up. Looking around at his house and his selection of cars, it's hard to say that A-Rot has ever really failed. But it's striking what he has built, considering where he came from. How fascinating! Back in 1997, I was interested in the following question, which is there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called sauropod dinosaurs, which had really long skinny necks. So a podosaurus is an example. Now, is it really long skinny tails? So I made a computer model that showed that in fact the tail of these sauropod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip, a bullfip. Now the way a bullfip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. Okay. And that crack is a sonic boom. Yeah. I think the way they got a date was to impress the females by making loud booms. Innovation, money and power collide in Silicon Valley and beyond. Bloomberg technology with Emily Chang. We days at 5 p.m. in New York and 2 p.m. in San Francisco.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,991,2022-10-09 00:11:17
12766," We'd days at 5 p.m. in New York and 2 p.m. in San Francisco. I was born in New York, raised in Miami. So when I got to Miami, I was on 8 and a half, 9 years old. My father left when I was around 10. And at home, it was mom, my brother Joe, my sister, Susie. They took the role of my brother became the Secretary of Sports. My sister became the Secretary of Education. And my mom just had to make enough money to pay her bills. I think my father leaving us at 10 kind of left a huge vacant spot. And I think I needed to then kind of fill that void by having a collection of mentors. One of those earliest mentors was his baseball coach, Rich Hoffman, right here at Westminster High School. See, walk through this area a few times. Oh yeah. This brings back some pretty cool memories. If you hit a home on here, it goes to the basketball courts and the pool. And I kind of like it. It's kind of like this Fenway kind of wriggly. Yeah, exactly. Set of the green monster you have the green palms. Yeah, exactly. It's really where I really started to understand the power of mentorship and dreaming big. And if you think about it, I have one of the most important conversations with coach Rich Hoffman. And that happened at 15 the first day I walked on campus. He goes, look, Alex, you're going to come in this year. You're going to have a good year. And then you're going to the junior Olympics to represent the US. You'll do well there. You get much stronger. By that time you'll be like the top junior in the country. And then you're senior year, you're going to be the number one pick in the country. And then you're going to be off to the big leagues. Coach, you're talking to me. He goes, yeah, I'm talking to you, Alex. And Jason, I went home that night and I believe them. It just like it changed my complete vision on me and my future. And then I did everything in my power and that's how they coached down. So I had a leader today when I have young people. It's my job to not only give them the opportunity, but to push them. And push them to a level where they now see the world in a different way about themselves. That prediction came true. In the 1993 MLB draft, Rodriguez was selected first overall by the Seattle Mariners. And while his playing career was just getting started by the age of 22, he'd invest in his first piece of real estate. It was what I knew best. My mother, she was in a homeowner. She was, we were renters, right? We were tenants. And every 18 months we would move because the landlord would always raise the rent. And I remember as a young kid saying, boy, if I can ever trade places with the landlord and they can be the tenant, that would be amazing. I bought my first duplex and then I owned that for a few years. I sold it for double, about four plaques, eight plaques, 60 units, and off we went. When it came to those first investments, you know, whenever he does something, he's going in at 100%. This is Jose Gomez. Everyone calls him Pepe. Along with Jose More, he's the co-CEO of Newport Property Construction and also a childhood friend of Rodriguez. From 2004 to 2007, we ended up acquiring 5,100 units between Florida and Texas. We renovated him. He would buy him. I would renovate them. And, you know, the rest was history. Being a real estate investor, especially in high growth markets like Florida, well, it hasn't been a straight line up for the past two decades. Miami's high-rise condos are monuments to a burst property bubble, where most half of Florida mortgages are underwater. We had this run-up to 2007. Prices were going up like this, and then it just fell off a cliff. The Great Recession crushed owners and developers alike. Few were immune, except those that had other sources of income to take advantage of falling prices. Income.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,992,2022-10-09 00:15:45
12767," session crushed owners and developers alike. Few were immune, except those that had other sources of income to take advantage of falling prices. Income likes say one of the richest baseball contracts in history. Our huge advantage was that Alex had W2 income coming in from playing and we had that staying power. So we were able even when things started going, you know, south for some people we were able to grow within those difficult times. Monument capital management has done within 60 deals since 2012 worth more than $900 million. The extent of that ambition in real estate is evident here at Grand Station in downtown Miami. The 30-story residential tower complete with a sprawling amenity floor and pool has sweeping views of downtown. It's a bet on Miami's growth and it's a bet that's looking smarter as Wall Street firms and other companies look southward. People always question Miami, why do people live there? There's not any great jobs. You know, we don't have a lot of financial services here. We don't have anybody manufacturing anything, but that's changing. People see this as a very cool place to live and work. Now before it was always a cool place to live, but where are you going to work? Now it's okay, the jobs are here first. Cool place to visit in the past. Right, yeah. And now each pocket is being built out. I think our Basel years and years ago started that and then there have been a course of events that have followed that continue to enrich Miami and I would say we're still early as a city. But while Miami may be home base, Rodriguez's most aggressive current real estate project is buying, renovating and renting out single-family homes in markets across the country. And in this case, he's not just emulating some of the world's biggest investors, but also getting into business with them, including real estate legend Barry Sternleic. Just as behemoths like Blackstone have amassed single-family homes, Rodriguez, through the Tubert Capital Group, has snapped up 5,000 homes so far. We think we're still in the early endings of single-family housing. Rents are going up about 18 to 19 percent. Once we find something, then this I learned from Warren Buffett is, be disciplined, but when you find your pitch, don't go for a single or double, going and going big. And that's exactly what we've done multi-family and now a single-family house. Going big has required Rodriguez to build a team around him and he's opted for a delicate balance of homegrown and outside hires. On the one side, friends dating back to childhood and adolescence, including Aaron, Peppy and Jose. On the other newer additions such as Kelly Laferrier, Stuart Zook, David Becker, and Lisa Pire. Managing the chemistry among the small and growing team, is akin to the elusive intangibles Rodriguez saw in clubhouses when he was a player. Getting it right, well that's the difference between being a champion and an also ran. Lisa, take it away. So I think next we're going to have David on table, from Kelly. Also, and we take the easy relationship to the world so I'm glad. Cool. So teams 11 and 11 and one exciting development is the 12-17 game that's the liquor's is going to be on his hand. So we were not on these things, but we are. At the A-Write Corp offices, you'll notice the memorabilia, the pictures of famous athletes, the real-time social data being displayed on the TV wall. But you'll also see pictures of Rodriguez with some of the biggest businessmen in the world. Alex has become a sponge and he started that as an active player when he was on the road. He would go and visit the Jerry Ryan's Dwarfs of the world in his uniform and ask them business questions. And he's surrounded himself with really good smart people. The wide network is critical in sourcing deals, including in the venture world, where the A-Write portfolio has included more than 60 companies, brands like Hems and Hers, Gopuff, and UFC gyms. But having the best team doesn't mean you win every at bat. Their SPAC, Slam Corp, was recently negotiating a roughly $3 billion deal to merge with collectible company, Penini. That didn't materialize after Penini stumbled. Slam's still insert to the target. But Rodriguez's belief in taking swings, striking out and hitting big, is also the same way he would end up with his own sports franchise.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,993,2022-10-09 00:20:10

JLo and A-Rod are angling to buy the New York Mets. They're not just angling. I mean, they are in the process of putting the money together. Rodriguez along with a group that included his then-girlfriend Jennifer Lopez, entrepreneur Mark Lurian several others, mounted a bid against frontrunner and hedge fund billionaire Steven A. Cohen. These guys are all rich, you know, as far as we go, they've made millions and millions of dollars, but we're talking about billions here. The very public process ultimately landed A-Rod and JLo's consortium as the runner-up, with Cohen by the team for $2.4 billion. We have a little bit depressed about it. We don't like to lose and, you know, we really started getting really excited and thinking about what could be. And so when it just sort of came to a complete halt, it was sort of like the shock to the system. We were sort of depressed and down. Mark Lurian is a New York foreign businessman who most recently had been a senior executive at Walmart. He got in there by selling his company Jet.com to the mega retailer and stayed on to run that division. And while A-Rod's partnership with JLo would come undone, he formed a close business and personal connection with Laurie that's lasted. How's rules, man? I told you, no one's highest, man. My favorite time. We grew up in a sort of very similar way and from very, very humble beginnings. I love Mark. I love him like a brother and he's a great partner and a great friend. He slipped to my plow, I sleep at his house, and we both have this drive and this mission that I want him to win in the worst way. And I think he does the same for me. I want to show you this clip because it spoke to me a lot about the depth of your relationship. Yeah, I think this is getting a little bit deeper now, but I think it comes down to our dads. We both felt like we had something to prove in order to sort of feel love, really. And when you did something spectacular, you felt, oh, maybe. And I think he similarly had felt that too, where if you wanted to feel love, you had to do big things. What do you make of that? I never thought about it that way, but I know that when my father left at 10, it left a huge hole in my heart and my stomach. And I knew that I had to do better. And I think before therapy, it was probably better for the wrong things. I think post and current, I look at it as just my purpose.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,994,2022-10-09 00:24:15

And probably before that, I thought it wasn't. The deep connection with Lori led to a new $400 million venture fund called VCP and notably allowed them to quickly pivot to a successful deal in sports ownership. They're pursuit of the Minnesota Timberwolves and Minnesota links. He called me and he said, hey, are you serious about this? He said, I won't do it unless you're serious about it. And I said, I'm serious about it. Are you serious about it? And again, a minute conversation, we're both in. And we probably got the deal done in six or seven days. NBA ownership has radically transformed into the past decade. It's tech executives like Steve Balmer and Joe Sy and Wall Street investors like Mark Lazzari, Josh Harris and Tony Restler have snapped up teams. There's a supply demand imbalance where anyone, you know, most people if they could would own a professional sports team. And there's, you know, very high barriers to entry and, you know, very limited supply. In the case of the Timberwolves, Glenn Taylor bought the team in 1994 for $88 million. The sale to Rodriguez's group values the franchise, paired with the four-time WNBA champion links. At $1.5 billion. And that's relatively affordable. A Rod's old team, the Yankees, is worth more than $5 billion, according to several estimates. And while ownership is changing, so too are the players. I think players today want more in every sport. They're into fashion. They want to be good investors. They want to learn about venture. The NBA players today that I've been around, some of them are more prepped at 20 than some of the guys that I played with at, were 50. And meeting with our athletes and talking about business and them reaching out to me. It's great. It's humbling. And it's really impressive. And if anything, their ownership has maybe gotten too close to the players. The team being fined $250,000 for violating league rules within offseason workout in A Rod's hometown of Miami. The buying of Asphalt team instead of the Met's might accomplish a goal he thought was unreachable, actually making him cool to his daughters. I recently went to a Sixers game. And my little one Ella, who's 13, she posed that, I really like this basketball thing. Like one day, maybe I get to run the business here one day. Really? And I was like, oh my god, that's like the greatest thing I've ever heard. And she goes, you know, it's like, you know, base was a little slower. But this stuff, I can really get into it. I said, whoa, baseball's great too. It's just, you know, it's more of a thinking man's game. It's like chess, not checkers. And she goes, yeah, yeah, whatever. I don't like chess either. But she says this basketball thing, I have like real passion is like the entertainment. And I have thoughts and I have ideas. And she thinks much more like a producer, she likes dancing. And I mean, to me, that's just like, boy, that's the great thing about sports and music. It brings people together. And it certainly did that for us that night. You have built this, this amazing business. Yeah, there are people who are watching this. Just like this guy, you know, it's like that they'll always remember you for your baseball career. And a baseball career that was controversial to say the least. You could be a little bit on an island somewhere. You don't have to do this. I thought about tapping out a bunch of times. I would wake up in the middle of the night and be in tears going like, how in the world do I get pocket aces and figure out a way to screw this up? That was a very painful time for me. And I think the year's suspension allowed me to not only put lipstick on the house and paint it and fix the windows. It allowed me to tear the entire house down and start building it one brick at a time. And in that process, I became even closer to my daughters. And when I think about those mistakes and the lessons learned, I think about, okay, but you know what? That was baseball.

But clean slate when it comes to being a father, to being a partner, to being a businessman, to being a friend. So I draw some incredible motivation through something that's sought, something that I did to myself. I say to myself, in the darkest hour, boy, if I ever get another opportunity, I'm not going to screw that up again. And I'm trying my best not to do that. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. Let's just be honest. We've had sort of a shift in, are we in some sort of circulation fears? Moment, people were talking about that all day yesterday. Big, expensive cities have a lot going for them. But if you live in one, you probably notice that you're going to be a big, big, big, big city. And you're going to be a big, big, big city. But if you live in one, you probably notice that these big, expensive cities keep getting more, well, expensive. You could always move away. You might have just started working remotely, so there's really nothing keeping you there. But then again, moving is a hassle. Well, what if someone cade you 10 grand to do it? What if they threw in free office space, a bicycle, or a gym membership? Programs and cities and states around the US are doing exactly that. And they're getting a lot of interest. We've had over 50,000 applications. About 90,000 applications. We've had over 1800 applicants from all over North America. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them? Or are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns for places looking for an injection of fresh talent? That's it. Everything you need to get set for the started US trading.

The National Championship goes to Connecticut for the fourth year in a row, as the dynasty fulfills its destiny. Winners of 11 national championships, producers of Olympians, and multiple WNBA MVP's. But AZ has something that the trailblazing women of UConn's past never had. The opportunity to not only play basketball, but get paid for it. I remember just learning that you could profit off of your name and brand. I could profit off of AZ, the Basel player, not just AZ, the person, which I didn't really understand why you couldn't, because at least for me, AZ, the Basel player is also AZ, the person, like, basketball is such a huge role in my life that I didn't understand why I wouldn't be able to profit from it. It's important to understand exactly what made this all possible. In 2021, after decades of debate, lawsuits, and legislation, the NCAA prompted by a unanimous ruling by the Supreme Court, finally relented on one of its longest standing strictures, that athletes could not in any way be compensated beyond scholarships and small stipends from their schools. It would only take a few months before AZ, a freshman at the time, would sign her first major deal with Chipotle. Before the freshman even got to play a game for the Huskies, she inked her first NIL deal as a college athlete ambassador for the magnificent Mexican restaurant chain. You are on the leading edge of something that feels for those of us who've been looking at sports for a long time, like a very meaningful moment in sports. Like, the economics are changing, the role of sports in society is changing. We see that from the outside. You're inside it. You have to, does it feel momentous to you? You can tell, like, how important it is, but at the same time, like, this is all I know and call-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,997,2022-10-09 00:37:26
12772," You see that from the outside, you're inside it. You did, does it feel momentous to you? You can tell how important it is, but at the same time, this is all I know in college basso, it was NIL. So I'm still trying to find my way in it, find my groove and stuff, but I know how important it is, and the people before me paved the way and set that path for me to be able to do this, and how important it is for me to be able to take advantage of this and be able to continue this on for that piece of time. To go. While colleges and universities still can't directly compensate their athletes, those athletes can legally be paid by third parties who want to use their name, image and likeness, or NIL. AZ, advised closely by a team led by her parents and her agents, has created a portfolio anchor by relationships with Chipotle, American Eagle, sports drink, bio steel, and SC30. Brands, she already admired as a successful athlete and American teenager. I've been lucky that the deals that I've been approached with have been things that have been really good and things that have American Eagles, one of my favorite brands, I always wear their jeans. So it's one of the easiest transitions type things. Bio steel was something that I hadn't tried before, and once I did, I really liked it. [♪ music playing in background, music playing in background, On the basketball side, it's impossible to be on Yukon's campus and not feel the weight of history. Especially when you see where the team works out. Officially called the Worth Family Yukon Basketball Champion Center, it's a 78,200 square foot complex that costs $40 million. It's most striking feature. It's split right down the middle between men's and women's basketball. Seemingly identical when you walk in, except while the men's team boasts four national championships, the women's side has more than double that. And that actually understates their dominance. The team has gone undefeated in six seasons, and its players have been staples on the US Olympic team. Suburred and Diana Tarrassee are only the latest in the line of superstars, that began in the early 1990s with Rebecca Lobo. The Huskies have featured 12 AP national players of the year, including Lobo, Maya Moore, Twice, Rihanna Stewart, three times, and most recently, Paige Becker's, will get to her in a minute. Sleep is crucially important, and I think we've moved from this attitude, from its indulgence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s, and so it makes it a really exciting field, because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harness to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart. If you can spit back a lot of facts, but if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what you bring, and it figures out why you're sleeping. On TV Radio and the Web, this is Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,998,2022-10-09 00:41:58
12773," technology on TV radio and the web. This is Bloomberg. Banner's are I mean, they're overwhelming for me. You know, and I'm not, you know, standing in your shoes. What do you take from that personally? I think it can be seen for sure as like overwhelming kind of pressure to live up to the standards. But I use it kind of as motivation. This is our Yukon program. Like there's no need to compare ourselves to the past. Like we're not those players that we see on the wall. We're different players. Like I'm A. Z. I'm not super. We need to forge our own path and our own story in the Yukon books. Global goes to work in the land and a beautiful. Those former Yukon stars helped to establish the Yukon team as a product to watch. Over the last decade, meteorites moved from Connecticut public television to SNY and now include Fox Sports. With game coverage mixed with behind the scenes documentaries, Yukon has become one of the biggest platforms for women's basketball. The Yukon women's team is so well known that at the moment, it's arguably a better platform than most if not all of the professional women's teams or even the WNBA overall. Well, I don't think there's any greater female sports collegiate brand than Yukon women's basketball. That's on TV. You can follow those athletes in a way that if you compare it to the WNBA, you don't always get consistency of coverage local or international markets. You're not always able to follow those athletes. It feels so nice to be back. This is Angela Lergero. She's a former hockey player and four time Olympian. She now runs Sports Innovation Lab. That's a Boston based company that uses data science to help teams and leagues understand their fans and figure out how to better engage them. The future of sports really is how do you optimize and drive revenue in these digital spaces, these digital communities? So collegiate athletes are going to really benefit from the change in the NIL ecosystem because they are authentically themselves. They're using these platforms already and they're being entertainers. I'm not sure how to work this. I think it's recording. Fans of women's sports and female athletes want more authenticity. These fans are dying. For not just the game and the stats and the scores, they want to know what you're doing 24-7. They want to know what these female athletes think. What are they wearing? Who are they dating? What do they care about? What are their causes? And that's going to build a wave of support when those athletes graduate that they'll hopefully bring to those WNBA teams. I think that this is really an incredible opportunity for me and all of women's basketball to be able to benefit. And it's sad knowing that this is kind of our most profitable age. So I think that that's also an important part of being able to use NIL now before going pro. But dance videos and homemade toastinoes ads can only take that mission so far. AZ knows that success on the court comes first and will allow everything else to follow. And while Yukon has had a storied history, their last championship was way back in 2016. Lucky for her, she's playing with not only just a good friend and dance partner, but the best college player in the country. Paige Becker's. Paige Bucket's Becker's is also one of the biggest college students when it comes to NIL deals, striking the first NCAA athlete deal with Gatorade, as well as partnerships with StockX and CashApp. And she has been estimated to potentially bring in a million dollars in NIL deals. We do a lot of team activities, for some horse riding. Yes. This is my first one involving a live animal. During the last week of official summer workouts, AZ Paige and their teammates finished their last session, and went over to Yukon's horse barn for some team bonding. Oh, I'm so happy. I have an extra large. Right, so when you're working with the horse, as you want to try to stay calm and relaxed, you're going to make him anxious. I'm sorry, typical day in stores can pick it. So we don't play basketball. Peasants. They're well. It was a light moment.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,999,2022-10-09 00:46:06
12774," It's what we do when we don't play basketball. Peasants. So well. It was a light moment before everyone went off to hang with their families and get rested up for the season. A few weeks later, beckers would announce that her 22-23 season was over before it even started. You conwomen's basketball junior guard Paige Beckers suffered a torn ACL in her left knee and will miss the 2022-23 season. It's an injury. Azi knows all too well, having gone through her own ACL tear in 2019. While Paige's absence will test the team's depth and metal, what was on display in stores and apparent in conversations with Azi was that she and Beckers were intent on using their increasingly higher profiles, not just to benefit themselves, but their entire team. Bra paint. Now you're dinner. Wow, it's so sweet. I'm so excited. In Azi's case, that means free to vote like. Thank you. Both Azi and Paige are conscious of the inequality that still exists in NIL. While the players in this room share the benefit of playing at Yukon, not all can or will get the deals Azi and Paige have already signed. Soft more Z first and Psychator. People outside of your world are actually doing it speculate about the consequences and maybe some of the unintended consequences of NIL you think, well, you know, the really prominent players like you are going to benefit and then other players are not and so maybe there's some jealousy or envy or whatever. How do you make sure that it doesn't? We were very tight. We're a super close group. I mean, you've been to stores or not, there's not much else to do besides play basketball and hang out with each other. And I think it also is because that whatever deals we get, like, you share with each other. So I have a deal with Chipotle and my whole team whenever they want Chipotle, they let me know or American Eagle, they can get whatever they want. I think it goes both ways with whatever deals. Other people have that we're super open, always willing to share. I think I'm posting that in surround with this. This would be the last team meal for Azi before going on summer break. And when we next caught up with her, it would be about as far from a dorm room in stores that you could possibly get. Azi's out in LA this week to do a commercial shoot for a new underarmer shoot alongside both Steph and Seth Curry. Along with her is her family, including her former coaches and current business screens, her mom and dad. We make sure that one of us is at everything that she does just to give her that support. So I've been at a lot of them still blows my mind like, okay, well, you look really cute in that outfit, but it just doesn't like really, I don't know, sink in that that she's this public figure for lack of a better word. The partnership with Curry is both historic and important well beyond the deal itself. Azi was the first woman and the first college athlete to join the SC30 brand and has developed a friendship with Curry. She fully concedes to initially being a bit star struck. The market that over the past few weeks has made it clear it wants to go higher. It got a little spooked by the idea that geopel it will potentially rise it. You will shed light on dark matter.

Before you change the world, Bloomberg. It's kind of crazy. I mean, I try to keep my cool when I'm working out with him and then like with Seth and stuff on set, but in my head I'm going a little bit crazy. Yeah. I first met him at Curry Camp right after my freshman year in high school. I got invited. I was one of the first two girls invited to camp and then I was invited the next year as well and then Curry Branded out to my agent, my group, and they let me know and that was all for it. I'm working out with someone that I look up to and someone that inspires me. So I'm getting to see firsthand him in action, what he does behind the scenes. I get to challenge myself and compete a little bit with him. It's amazing. Shooting ads for unreleased apparel isn't something cameras are welcome into, but Azee is also in LA for basketball, getting private workouts with Steph Curry's own trainer, Carl Bergstrom. Azee's also been a part of Curry Camps, including this past summer in San Francisco. She also helped design a shoe for the Azee 30 line. The Curry himself wore in an NBA finals game this past season. The 2022 Bill Russell NBA finals MVP award goes to Stefan Curry. Did you know that on average women have 30% less income for retirement? The IA was one of the first brands where I kind of got to use my platform to speak out about title 9 and retirement equality. I think that's definitely something that I still want to continue to do, but that was big for me because I'm still trying to figure out what I stand for and what I support and things I want to be able to support. She's got to formulate her own understanding and opinion about life. We all have our own perspectives and that's what makes us all unique. We all have our own opinions and experiences. I'm just proud that she found the level of comfort to be able to speak on something that she had no idea existed. I didn't know existed. Retirement inequality women retired with 30% less income and retirement than men. I didn't know that was a thing and I think from being a girl dad having her come along has awakened my senses to things that my wife has experienced as a player that I've seen firsthand being a girl's basketball coach that the girls endure. It's been pretty tremendous honestly. And as a fellow girl dad, crazy involvement with an equality campaign was notable, but not surprising for AZ, who said she was drawn to his brand as much for his off-the-court persona as his championship pedigree. He is a very big family man. He can sit out with his kids with his wife, but I'm huge with my family. Like I do everything with them. They're with me here on this trip. So I think the family aspect was huge and just kind of his personality like he welcomed me in right away even when I was at camp. He made me feel part of that group and special. Just being here, like I feel like I'm really part of this brand, part of this team, part of the Curry family, and I could be more grateful. Kobe Bryant forever, of course, remember it as an NBA legend and rightly so, but it's a father of four daughters. Curry's also filled a void that AZ and others thought might be left empty after Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gigi died tragically in helicopter crash in 2020. Bryant had been arguably the biggest advocate in the world for the women's game, and without him it was unclear who would carry that torch. That was kind of a big question when Kobe died. It was like who was gonna step up and continue to like help fight for women's basketball and help kind of raise the game. And I think Steph is doing a really good job of like trying like inviting women to Miss KM and little things like that that are helping to elevate the men's game and like this deal is incredible being not just the first like NIL, the own college athlete, but also the first female sign into his brand. I don't even really know what word to use to describe that feeling when I first signed it and being here now like it means so much. AZ's connection to",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1001,2022-10-09 00:54:47
12776," Brand, I don't even really know what word to use to describe that feeling when I first signed it and being here now like it means so much. Aze's connection to and reliance on her own family was unfolded by an LA. She'd come to the West Coast with her mom, dad, and two younger brothers and her success as a burgeoning business provides some fun perks. On trips like this, I love just watching my parents reaction because they've been in the game, they've always played in college and they play professionally so seeing their reaction to kind of where I am, it's just really funny. I mean like my dad loves being around all these NBA players, my mom loves seeing all these high-level workouts so seeing like them happy, it's really fun. Aze's parents both played Division 1 basketball in college and coached her throughout her youth which she credits made her the way she is. Even if sometimes it's not so easy to grow up with two coaches for parents. Part of the reason that I am the way I am is because they didn't really compliment much so I always had something to work on, I was always working hard. I think they did a very good job obviously, I played really bad, I would hear about that but they did a really good job of separating mom and dad from coach. Like I remember when I was younger my dad would take me out to get ice cream and stuff after games. That was something when we started coaching and we were very cognizant of not having that coach role carry over. I harbor things a little more, so sometimes they'd go get ice cream and I'd be like yeah she sucked, why are you getting ice cream? It wasn't the ice cream but then he really likes ice cream too so. When I started the coach I definitely did not want to have that contentious relationship at all and so the ice cream thing became a reminder to me, a treat to like now I get to go back and be dad. Katie Fudd played at NC State and then Georgetown in the late 1990s as women's basketball was starting to gain a bit of traction and the WNBA was in its form of div years. She had to deal with inequalities that she never wanted her daughter to face. When it came time for AZ to pick a school her mom had a big influence. When AZ was getting recruited I felt very strongly in my, what is the culture? When I was at Georgetown it was kind of a men's basketball program and not really much else. It's evolved since then but in our practice time was limited on the court based on when the men practiced or you know it was just it was all based around the men. So there's a lot of schools that she was looking at where they they had some storied men's programs but how do the players interact? How does you know what's the culture on the campus like? Let's make sure that we're doing the right thing by by both the men's and the women's program. AZ's parents were able to go from being her coaches to fans in the stands but now have evolved into her advisory board on her branding deals. I think we spent the better part of the pandemic on seminars and YouTube and listening talk I probably have a four year degree and I have a cell phone NIL just because they're just making sure we understood it as well as we could to help her but also connecting with the right people. I think the fact that we have such a great relationship with her she trusts us implicitly like we're not going to put her in a situation that one she doesn't support the company or doesn't you know she wants authentic stuff and then we're not going to put her in a situation that just isn't isn't good for her. As the new season starts AZ's NIL deals existing and new will be in the background. Expectations are always high at Yukon and even more attention will be on her given backers injury. While new NIL opportunities grab headlines and attention AZ has a clear focus on what's ahead. How do you raise your NIL game? How do you grow it in a way that's authentically amazing? I think now that I have my first year kind of under my belt I have established my brand with all these other people but I think I need to be able to kind of like establish my own brand more like the easy brand and like post about myself more as well but I think just knowing that what your priorities are that my priorities right now are basketball and school because without good grades will be able to play without basketball I wouldn't have these opportunities in these deals.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1002,2022-10-09 00:59:10

Before you change the world, Bloomberg. What are the moon shots at Amazon that are capturing most of your time and attention? Well, you know, we have a unique way that we look at big new investments. And I'm not sure it's right or wrong. It just happens to be our way. And we ask ourselves when we're considering something for questions. We ask if it's successful, can it be big and move the needle in Amazon? Is it being well served today? Do we have a differentiated approach? And do we have confidence there? And if not, can we acquire quickly? If we like the answer to those questions, we'll go pursue it with a single threaded team that isn't distracted by the rest of the business. When it comes to the stock, it has fallen significantly. Do you think investors are missing something or has tech just been overvalued? I have never tried to predict what stocks might do. Anytime I've tried to a little bit, I've been wrong. I do really believe that in the short term, the stock market tends to be a voting machine and the long term it tends to be a weighing machine. We have a concept we talk about a lot of Amazon inputs and outputs. You know, in the ultimate output for a company is share price. You know, and then other big outputs are free cash flow or profit or revenue. You can't really manage the outputs. You have to manage at the input level. And that's where we spend all our time. And so if you do the right things for the business long term, things tend to work out. I think we've had very good returns for investors. And I expect that to be true again. We will never break. We will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never break. Have a wide array of things and the mountains shake. All of them will remain. We will never go. We will never go. The global appetite for data is growing faster than ever. And no matter what statistics you use to describe it, big data is big business. You believe 150 billion devices will be connected by 2025. And more than 175 zeta bytes of data will be created. Every 18 month, the data that is produced by the world is doubled. We started talking about petabytes and exabytes. And now we're talking about zeta bytes. It's a near unimaginable explosion in data. And companies just don't know how to manage and secure all this new information. There's also a growth in a nature and location of data, as well, you know, standing beyond structure data to unstructured data. We're looking at 500 plus billion in revenue in market that several years ago or a decade ago didn't really exist. And that's going to three acts through 1.5 trillion in 2030. Are there room for more players in what has been on already pretty competitive space? What you see right now is that the big players are the biggest names intact.

12778," Happen? HPE is a big name tech company with a mission to innovate and compete in the cloud. CEO Antonio Neri told Romain Bostic why he chose Taric Robiotti as CFO to drive this transformation. When you play sports you want different type of skills and capacities in many ways that they all together can deliver a better performance and it starts by will to win and when I became CEO I realized I needed a different type of CFO. Somewhat is way more strategic not just on the accounting side but really think about how we can deliver that value in a different way. Gone are the days where the CFO is just a scorekeeper. I think our role as CFO is to be the person who assist the CEO change the score. Well he had that attracted me was about the transformation experience. Obviously has more than two decades as a global leader. We both Italians by the way, by the core which I think is a benefit we can communicate the same language and we can argue against each other but always in a constructive way. Yeah. As CFO I would assume that you're always in a position where sometimes you have to say no to him. Do you say no to him? Ultimately decision making ownership is here. He's the CEO of the company. He's the boss. He's my boss. At the same time I want to make sure that I watch his back. Tarek Robiyade is HPE's chief financial officer and also overseas the company's strategic function. Being the head of strategy he does a lot of the market scanning, looking at the trends you know whether it's three five ten years and that's why we combine both the CFO with the head of strategy because in the end it has to deliver shoulder value and then we hone into what are the big trends where to play and how to whip. Think about it this way we are like biologists. We need to deeply understand the financial DNA of our company and we need to take the proactive steps that prevented it from aging. Finance is the lifeblood of any organization just like for a human being you have to have your heart functioning. We have to be there providing the information that allows us to continue to create value for our shareholders and making sure that our customers get what they want. In 2015 the Hule Packard Corporation split into two separate companies. HP Inc primarily makes devices from desktop and laptop computers to printers tablets and point of sale systems. Hule Packard Enterprise or HPE provides information technology solutions. In 2019 CEO Antonio Mary announced that the company would pivot from a focus on servers and on-site storage systems to its cloud software as a service platform green lake. HPE calls it a hybrid cloud platform not just storing data in the cloud but managing it across murray locations. When I became CEO in 2018 I said that the enterprise of the future will be edge centric meaning where we live where we work cloud enable in data driven and one of the things that we saw through the pandemic is that the enterprise became way more distributed people working everywhere. And at the same time data became the most important asset that customers have. Explain for a second the difference between the edge there why that is sort of more useful and the idea of a more centralized sort of cloud system that I thought a lot of companies at least at one point were embracing. Well if you think about we live now in a hyper connected world everything is connected to digitize your enterprise you need to be connected is cheaper to move the cloud to the data and by the way more secure right then moving data to the cloud and that's where we as a company we are creating the capability to consume cloud services at the edge in your data center on a bigger cloud. There was a view and there still is that view that the whole world is going to move to the public cloud. We think the world is fundamentally going to be hybrid. The edge is where everything happens is where people generate data or companies generate data. Think about",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1004,2022-10-09 01:07:42
12779," Fundamentally going to be hybrid. The edge is where everything happens is where people generate data or companies generate data. Think about, for example, logistics companies. How much data is being generated in harbours, in railroads, in warehouses? And the world we're living will be a world which will be much more automated than ever before. So warehouses are going to fundamentally change. They're going to be powered by robots. Those robots will be very quickly picking up the items in the warehouse that are required and then reshuffle what's in the warehouse. That actual processing requires data analysis locally where the option happens. Transmission of that data over a secured network onto a central point or multiple central points for that matter and made sense off. So that is the whole idea that we're after. With more data to organize in more places, businesses are moving swiftly to digitize their information infrastructure. Corporate spending on IT soared in 2021 and even if global growth slows, that trend is not likely to reverse. How do you operate that environment if we are facing recessionary headwinds? What we're seeing with IT spending is we're expecting flattening to single digit growth, but cloud computing will largely be unaffected by that given the explosive nature of data organizations simply need cloud. Companies that once invested heavily in devices and data center servers may now seek more flexibility from software that can be upgraded as new needs arise. That's the bet HPE is making as it pivots to software as a service. When you hear the word as a service, so many companies throw that out, something as a service. Is that just a buzz word? At the core, it's a different business model. At the heart of it, there is this contract with a service level agreement that ties the two parties for a specific solution. The solution allows the customer to manage the infrastructure and secure a specific business outcome under certain performance conditions. We manage the infrastructure on your behalf, we grow and expand the infrastructure as you need to grow and expand in turn. And so the degree of customer intimacy is a quantum leap above the transactional world. With a different business model comes a different metric for measuring success. Annualized run rate or ARR has become the focus for Tarek Robyati and his finance team. The ARR is critically important. The ARR is actually measuring the amount of our revenue that is locked in and recurring with our customer base. And to the extent that the ARR is going fast, the more robust the future of the company is. And on GreenLake, we have to grow customers. We have to grow the revenue we make from those customers. And the ARR is the annualized run rate of revenue that you have from one period to the next. If your offer has a perennial future, it translates into a growing ARR. This is the way for us to truly understand that we remain relevant for our customers over the long term. What about margins? When you hear from some of these analysts, these investors here, there's still dialed in on gross margin. Some of them are traditional metrics. Gross margin for me is the most important metric in our sector. It's fundamentally, if you think about our business, which comes from a hardware heritage moving into as a service, with hardware commoditizing, you have to have a focus on gross margins. And as you can see from our results over the past nine, ten quarters, our gross margin has been expanding very, very solidly. That actually tells you that your customers are willing to pay a premium for what you have to offer. And so what you want to see is a combination of ARR with gross margin expansion and the ARR composition becoming richer and richer with more differentiation thanks to software. That's the journey that we are on. You need to remind people that 75% of our profits are deferred, which means we don't need the imperiod profit to deliver. So that's an opportunity because we have an amazing profit pool called HP Point Next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1005,2022-10-09 01:12:03

So that's an opportunity because we have an amazing profit pool called HP.Next, now being supplemented with HP-Greelake, which we already have more than $6 billion in the balance sheet, growing at 100% in record. Supply chain challenges and geopolitical turmoil have weighed on earnings in 2022. But with demand for its software continuing to grow and a record-breaking backlog of orders, HPE has caused for optimism. Meanwhile, Surgeon inflation remains a wild part as the company tries to attract subscribers and maintain margins. We have had to think about inflation permeating across what we do. And what we purchase and whether it's goods or services, we've seen rising costs. We had to therefore be much more disciplined on pricing than ever before. This is not easy and this is also something that has to adjust because you cannot keep pricing increasing all the time. So you've got to be very dynamic in the way. You think about pricing moving forward. Coming up, why a company with deep roots in Silicon Valley just opened a new headquarters in Houston and how it designed its campus for a more flexible future. It's really incumbent on us, employers, to make sure that we create an environment where our employees feel at ease to come to work if you're supported. This is Bloomberg. Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world recalibrate. Often decades of stagnation, Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation. Corporate giants, policymakers and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that. Every week on Japan ahead, right here on Bloomberg Television. HPE Chief Financial Officer, Tarek Robyade, originally trained as a scientist, earning a master's degree in nuclear physics and electronics. He told Remain Bostic how those studies set him on his professional path. It did prepare me in terms of my analytical capabilities, but there was a moment in my career where I felt it was really important that I had home my financial skills. And then eventually I had to do an MBA majoring in finance and strategic analysis and entrepreneurship. I discovered finance as a discipline. I loved it, and ever since then, I became a finance person. Highlights from Robyade's resume include a stint with Lehman Brothers in London and later experiences CEO, first with the telecommunications firm CSL in Hong Kong, and then with Australian Financial Services Company FlexiC Group. He came to the U.S. to serve as CFO at Sprint, leading the company's turnaround efforts. I was very lucky I had the opportunity to work in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Asia, and the United States. So I'm truly a global citizen. People ask me, where is home? My answer to that question is, home is where I'm not. Home for HPE is now just outside Houston, Texas, where the company opened its new global headquarters this spring. For CEO Antonium Neri, the campus is a passion project. I love design, I love art, and I felt this was an unique opportunity for me to start with a blank sheet of paper. This was a piece of land, nothing. There was nothing here. And it's a remarkable in two years we're able to build this 500,000 square feet side with a unique experience digitally enabled in everything we do. HPE has an abandoned Silicon Valley, a number of employees and business units remain based in the Bay Area. But Neri and Robyade believe the expanded presence in Texas strengthens the company operationally, financially, and culturally. We felt that we had a lot of opportunity to streamline and make the company way more efficient. The reason to move here is to get the best of both worlds. Having a press is hitting Texas allows us to recruit and retain talent, particularly on the diverse side of the house. People don't realize that Houston, Texas is the most diverse city in the United States. In this side, we have a 25 megawatts data center.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1006,2022-10-09 01:16:21
12781," People don't realize that Houston, Texas is the most diverse city in the United States. In this side, we have a 25 megawatt data center where all the development gets done from all over the world. The energy cost is a significant cheaper here than California. I will now be able to sustain that in California. What we're seeing in a more macro environment is that corporations are looking at locations that have a healthier business environment from taxation or regulation. They're looking for places that they can find new talent. IT talent is scarce. What we're finding is that access to talent is still the biggest bottleneck to productivity. And so companies on an increasing basis, whether it's Texas or other places in the United States or even globally, are working more towards this hub and spoke model where they might have a center of excellence or a hub in one individual city outside of the main headquarters. And increasingly, we're finding that is happening outside of Silicon Valley. It was a big decision, but it actually, if you put it in the context as to why we made the decision, it actually made sense. So we had a longstanding presence here in Houston for the past, I would say, 20 some years since the compact merger. We bought a piece of land. We started building this building. And in doing so, we had to also recalibrate how we were building it because the pandemic hit us. And we thought about recreating a work environment that is very, very different, that is skated for this new structural way of working, which we call edge to office, where people don't always come to the office to work, can work remotely from their homes, their edges. But have to come back to the office for specific reasons such as team meetings, customer meetings, and in general collaboration. With regards to the hybrid work model, do you see that as something that will persist longer term when the pandemic has long gone? Yes, no question, this will persist. And I think we are witnessing right now a societal change in the way we work. You're no longer going to measure productivity in the same way as in the past. You're going to be focusing on outputs. Never mind what people do in their private times. It doesn't really matter to a company as long as the output is there. HPE launched its Edge to Office Hybrid Work Initiative in the fall of 2020. The new campus is designed without flexible model in mind. We have to admit that the pandemic has had its toll on mental health in the workforce across the world. And so it's really incumbent on us employers to make sure that we create an environment where our employees feel at ease to come to work, they feel supported, and that's why we created the environment that you see. Between this indoor with two amazing buildings and outdoor amenities, we have a truly experience for their employees that they can host customers, they can innovate, they can collaborate, they can socialize. And we have so many events. And I will say the one difference between here in California, this is way more community driven. So we have a lot of events here, like the famous chili cook event. HPE's annual chili cook-off allows Taric Robyotti to indulge in one of his favorite hobbies. The finance chief is also an avid chef. Cooking has a lot of power with finance and being a CFO. There's a lot of indirect satisfaction. You know, you only know that you're doing a good job when you see others people recognizing it, and there's nothing better than when you serve a nice meal to your friends or family who come over. I love to do that. It's hard work, but it's nice. Still ahead, how HPE's CFO is taking steps to relieve the company's supply chain pain. We have to rethink our network of manufacturing plants. We have to rethink our network of our suppliers. And he outlines the mindset that makes the chief future officer successful. If you start with a view that the world is in constant change and you have to adapt, you have to anticipate on what comes next. The strategic thinking is very key for that purpose. This is Bloomberg. Hydrogen has a very special place in the universe. It's the first element on the periodic table. It is the most abandoned element in the universe.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1007,2022-10-09 01:20:46
12782," It's the first element on the periodic table. It is the most abandoned element in the universe. And when clean energy advocates think about what can we find, which would be as easy to use as fossil fuels, they think about hydrogen. The fuel that will, when burned, only produce water. We like to imagine that if we just built enough of these and these, we could ditch fossil fuels and save the planet. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. There are some things where you just need a good old-fashioned combustible fuel. Now startups around the world are betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. We have to get interest rates higher and bring inflation back to our targets. It's better to pass this become a scarce. We are running on thin ice. No one deliberately wants to go into battle, but we sneak walk into conflict with unmatched reach and resources. From more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. Why do the biggest names in business choose Bloomberg? It's a great question. It's a great question. It's a great question. It's a great question. I get all night. Bloomberg, top experts, great questions. As HPE moves forward with its strategy to deliver software as a service and gain subscribers on the Green Lake platform, its growth and customer demand is encouraging. But supply chain disruptions have slowed the company's ability to fulfill those orders. It's a problem that's plagued many industries since the onset of the pandemic, compounded by the war in Ukraine. Nobody including HPE is going to have an easy time with the supply chain. I mean, we started the Justin Time concept in the 70s, and it's taking years for organizations to back their way out of that and find a more distributed supplier base, a more local supplier. Tarek Robyade can't wave a wand and clear the backlog all at once. He told Romain Bostic, he's focused on long-term solutions. The world is a longer flat. And that's a practical reality we have to record. And in that context, therefore, it's really important that we get close to where our customers are. And so we have to rethink our network of manufacturing plants. We have to rethink our network of our suppliers. And I think the whole world and the whole IT industry has to find a new equilibrium with supply chains that are designed for speed, resiliency, and cost, as opposed to just be inefficient and designed around cost. Our goal is to create a supply chain that is very much designed for optimal visibility at every point in time of where components are, where the working progress products are, and have the ability to shift production and materials in different contents where we operate. So, for example, we invested in a manufacturing plant in the Czech Republic because it made a lot of sense for us to have a presence in Europe. This is a really a new reality that we have to navigate. It's not like we went backwards on capacity. In fact, capacity has been added. The issues that demand has all pays any capacity that we ever imagined. So now we need to add capacity. Also, we need to transition some of the technologies to the newer nodes. And that takes time. Tarek Robyade will play a key role for HPE as it retools to face new challenges. Romain Bostek asked him what skills the CFO needs to truly succeed as a Chief Future Officer. The first quality you need to look for is CFO. It's almost stable stakes. It's integrity. And it's not about being honest or dishonest. Of course, we're all honest. But it's integrity of thought in the way you present the fact base, which is the data. If you don't have that in a CFO, stop looking, move on. That's the first and foremost thing. The second most important thing is the ability to be strategically agile. It's absolutely critical to be injecting in the work that a CFO performs a strategic thinking. The third, I would say, if you think about it in these terms.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1008,2022-10-09 01:25:08
12783," critical to be injecting in the work that the CFO performs a strategic thinking. The third, I would say, if you think about it in these terms, we are a little bit distorts of the resources of the company, for the company and for the CEO. We got to make sure that resource allocation is up to scratch and that we are allocating resources where there is the biggest return possible. And finally, we also have to be coaches. We have to coach our colleagues and team members and my job, the way I think about it is we have to shine the spotlight on their strength. But also at the same time, make sure that we understand our weaknesses and are clear about the areas that we need to improve. So a lot of the CFO job is to distill what I simply would say is tough love. It's about being tough where it matters and also being encouraging in other circumstances. What's the opportunity here for HPE over the next 10 years? The opportunity for HPE over the next 10 years is to redefine the industry. And because we firmly believe with Antonio that the future of the industry is edge to cloud. And I think that there will be a growing acceptance and it starts already. You have evidence of it that the future is hybrid and that the future of an enterprise is to become essentially a digital service provider. The pandemic has taught us that the enterprises who perform the best during that period were the ones who had digitized their business models. And for an enterprise to digitize their business models, they have to think about it edge to cloud and where the company to help them do so. What do you think is going to be the main challenge for HPE over the next 10 years? Well I would say the main challenge is ourselves. We have to really be recognizing that the opportunity is there for the taking and we have to go after it resolutely and fast. We can't really wait, be complacent and not execute aggressively to capture the opportunity. So it's not to us really. And we think with the right focus and with the right team we can get there. How do you expect your role as CFO to change over the next 10 years? My role is constantly in change mode. If you start with a view that the world is in constant change and you have to adapt, you have to anticipate on what comes next, strategic thinking is very key for that purpose. You also have to make sure that your team is geared towards it, that you understand the demands that this constant change puts on the team. And then you also have to continue to polish your stamina, build a grid that you need to continue to navigate the journey. For someone who maybe got promoted to CFO today, what would you tell them? Just for the first day on the job, what's the best advice you can give them? Enjoy it. It's wonderful. You have a unique vantage point in any company to truly understand what's going on. No one else in the company has access to the data that tells you what's going on. Have fun. For Romain Bostic, I'm Taylor Riggs. This is Limberg. So is there more pressure when you're trying to win a basketball championship than when you're trying to please investors? Where's the greater pressure? Oh, I think it's definitely trying to win a championship. It's hard because when you invest and you know this, when you're investing, you can control a lot more things. When in a basketball court, you can't control whether somebody's going to make a shot, you've got to get lucky. And what's the greater pleasure making five times your money on a distressed debt investment or winning the NBA championship? They're both fabulous. I wish I could do one each year. That would be great, but I think it was a great feeling and being right on an investment. But you've done a tremendous amount of work and you've made money for your clients, which I think is great. I think winning a championship is, it's a very surreal feeling because there's a whole city or state that is actually behind you.

What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric.

The fast-casual restaurant chain found the perfect candidate in an unexpected place. Wall Street. I had worked at Goldman Sachs for about 16 years. I was covering the restaurant sector. I was a baby and I worked together for a long time. She was an analyst covering our stock. The day that I knew I was looking for a new CFO. The day that I announced it, I went to a recruiter and I said, what about Katie Fogarty? I remember working with her. You think she might be interested in this? That same day, she had heard about it and went to her family and said, this is the job I want. Literally that same day. It was something that I always wanted to take a more of a leadership role at a company. We hit it off. Katie Fogarty spent the first part of her career asking hard questions about corporate strategy. Now she's responsible for answers. I think that there's a number of things that a cell-side research analyst can lend to a company, especially a company that is in high-growth mode. One, it's just really a very firm ability to analyze strategic decisions, to really get into the numbers, into the models, and to have a firm view of different scenarios out there. When those Wall Street executives move into the company seat, they bring an understanding, hopefully, of the fundamentals company sector, but also what it means to be a stock. The total stakeholder perspective includes shareholders. How are we measuring the incrementality of a great offer like this? Katie's skill set, so uniquely, is able to harvest in her mind so much data and information, turn it quickly into tremendous insights that end up driving our strategic priorities. That is her sweet spot.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1010,2022-10-09 01:34:08
12785," In her mind, so much data and information, turn it quickly into tremendous insights that end up driving our strategic priorities. That is her sweet spot. I look at a CFO from Wall Street as someone who can bring a breath of fresh air to a business that often can become very inbred. They're extremely grounded in data. They're curious about data. They're pushing the data. They know what to do with the data and tie that into telling the story. There's a reality check that Katie brings to the business to say, you know, I know you think this, but let me tell you what the data is really telling us here. She's still looking at data to predict the future. Only now, she's taking it a step further. Before, it was a lot of kind of sitting almost in an armchair type basis and analyzing different and now, you know, pieces of information to see where I thought the best investment dollar would be allocated. Here, it is actually driving a plan of how we can best maximize shareholder returns. It is about leveraging data analytics, driving real insights through, you know, not just your own guest data, but leveraging statistical models and really kind of figuring out where the best strategic decisions will be made over time. This is an industry that really needs that type of analysis that help the strategic vision now more than ever. And so it was incredibly exciting to start to apply that here at ShakeShack. ShakeShack began as a humble hot dog card in New York's Madison Square Park. It opened its first restaurant as a kiosk in that park in 2004. A decade later, there were more than 60 ShakeShack restaurants around the world. And in early 2015, the company went public. At the end of 2021, ShakeShack and its license partners operated nearly 400 locations in 16 countries. At least 60 more are expected to open by the end of 2022. We always feel like we're just getting started at ShakeShack somehow. You know, we kind of describe ourselves as a public startup. We have a huge footprint and white space out there that we can grow globally and we're going to continue to do that. The pace of expansion is nothing new for this company, but maybe different is the shape. ShakeShack has thrived in high density urban locations, which provided 60% of revenues before the pandemic. But returned to office patterns during COVID have been unpredictable, hampering sales growth in cities. Now ShakeShack is exploring new formats as it extends its footprint in suburbs. It is not just a reaction to COVID. This is the stuff that we've been working on before. What COVID did was accelerated the pace and excitement, frankly, for some of the things that we've been planning before. Drive through amongst them as the most important. We were right at a pivotal moment of thinking drive-throughs were obsolete and then COVID hit and it was a saving grace. When you get out into the suburban areas, drive-in becomes incredibly important because that's convenience. And if a significant percentage of your business is drive-up, you need a smaller facility. So the investment can be smaller. This is the first time the company has ever put in a drive-through. We opened up our first one in December of last year. We have six open, very exciting stuff. Drive through lanes offer long-term opportunities to build revenue and increase margins. Right now they carry a higher price tag. Overall, we've seen a rise in our build costs. We talk about 10 to 15 percent higher build costs across the board. Things are just costing more. It makes site selection ever more important. It makes all of the work that we do in real estate and that whole process incredibly more important. Since Katie Fogarty became CFO of Shake Shack in June 2021, inflation has risen at a record rate, making her job that much harder. Everything that enters our business, commodities, foods, cost of building restaurants is getting more expensive. I don't see that ending anytime soon. Now that we've got to continue to plan for it. If you look at the price of beef, if you look at the price of dairy, eggs, all of these core things, even paper and packaging, it's just meaning that everything costs us more and more and more and we're not alone. This is happening to the entire industry right now.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1011,2022-10-09 01:38:05
12786," These core things, even paper and packaging. It's just meaning that everything costs us more and more and more. And we're not alone. This is happening to the entire industry right now. The industry is also dealing with a sea change on the labor front. Hourly wages have soared and the great resignation has hit restaurants hard. Labor costs aren't going down because of the training and turnover at the 30, 60, and 90-day mark. If someone's, you know, can even figure the job out, do they stay? And that's still not under control whatsoever. So while maybe like the actual wage inflation can taper, turnover and training costs are still elevated. We've invested more than $10 million in our employees over the past year. And we're going to continue to invest more. We're testing four-day work weeks to help, you know, especially our working parents kind of juggle that balance between childcare and your work. I know I deal with that all the time. This is really a people-first company, even an inflationary environment. You're going to see us continue to lead with our people. Do you worry at all about a price wage spiral, not just here, but in the industry, in the economy? Yes. And I think that, you know, this is something that, you know, many business leaders are focused on. And, you know, time will tell kind of how all of this lands. I think the wage-price spiral continues for quite some time. I think we probably have been a lot less aggressive than we can be. And then many other companies have been. In terms of raising prices. Yes. We've taken our time. If you look at a 20-year history of pricing in this company, we've taken about 2% a year on average. We've never taken what we could. We've always taken what we should. We have to pay people more. We have been and will continue to do so. We'll take a little bit of a margin compression on that as we've had to. And I think that's the right thing. So that for the long term, Shake Check continues to be what we're building, which is the next generation's burger joint. Shake Check margins have come down from pre-pandemic levels. At the same time, the company's cash position has improved. During COVID, we actually took two opportunities to raise capital. We have a fortress balance sheet like we've never had before. Good timing, good planning. So when we use that money, we're looking for a great return. The area with the highest potential return is right in Katie Fogridi's wheelhouse. In other words, we're still coming for the 30% risk of XXXX's industrial transformation. It's amazing to sit here and think that this is a company that had, essentially, hardly any digital sales prior to the pandemic. And when the pandemic hit, we went full force on digital with the app, web, with third party delivery. And here we are now with 43% of our sales still coming from digital channels. Even as our in-shack business has developed. investment was that. Was it a home run? Is that something where you're like, Randy, this paid off big time. Well, it's something that we continue to invest in. And we continue to see opportunities to improve our app, improve that guest experience, improve the ways that we're incentivizing our guests to really lean into our digital channels. If you simply look at what the higher frequency we get from those digital guests, moving more and more of them into the channels and continuing to invest to drive frequency of that base, it's a really good recipe for a strong long-term traffic growth. Coming up, digital investments have boosted Shake Shack's business. Katie Fogartia shares me they're not done innovating.

12787," Creatures classic items with a creative twist while the ingredients and service are a significant step up from fast food. The concept was an instant success, but maintaining growth and staying relevant comes with a complex set of pressures. We've come out of the pandemic with a new world and where something that might have been an evolutionary change has been a revolutionary change. We've made changes to the way we eat, we've made changes to the way we operate, that might have taken years have been compressed into months and days. The role of CFO in a company like ours that's so dynamically growing, so constantly changing, and focused on digital is critical. Cane plays such an amazing role there. She's not just moving numbers around. You know, this is not your grandfather's CFO anymore. The digital infrastructure, the way we think about things now is a monster that needs to be fed all day long every day and is always hungry. And you could probably have 150 digital priorities today that all our teams will fight about. Ops wants this, tech wants this, marketing wants this, I want this, Katie wants that. Katie's job is to take all that prioritization, think it through, understand which one is going to have the best return on capital, and which ones have no return on capital, and you still got to do them anyway. That's the reality of the world we live in right now, and it's critical to lead that in the right way. I visited a Manhattan shack with Katie Fogarty. Our first stop inside the restaurant was an ordering kiosk. And then on the burger side, you can see the option here for the bourbon bacon jam burger with shallots on top, the avocado bacon burger as well, our beloved smoked shack. The kiosks are an investment in engagement. We just see a gas kind of sit with the menu and really appreciate and understand how they can customize their order or the different add-ons that they have. So we really do believe that this provides them with an even better experience than going to the cash register. What's the payoff? I mean the cost to put one of these in compared to how much more a customer spends on a kiosk. We do see a very nice lift off of the kiosk, and actually this is not even a very fancy kiosk technology, it's an iPad. What has more investment tied to it, it's just the constant innovations that we've had to make the kiosk functionality better and better, and we're driving towards a parody situation where the kiosk and the cash register have exactly the same price. We have exactly the same functionality, and we want the kiosks to be able to identify who you are and what you like to order when you come into the shack. Improvements like these take resources. Shakeshacks, general and administrative expenses have risen as the companies put capital behind digital initiatives and the changes ripple out from there. As our digital evolution has been underway, we've had to make a number of adjustments to the layout of our current existing shack base. We've had to rethink the flow of the shack that we're building in order to really capitalize and enable and let our digital business thrive. In many shack we've taken out cash registers, we've moved them around. A lot of times it's two or three cash registers that are just taken down to one. We've had to really rethink the way that the flow of our guest journey is in our shack. So one perfect example of it is we put in pickup shelves here at most of our restaurants. We are looking for that to go experience, can come in and pick up the order to go and they don't have to sit there and wait with everybody else who is waiting for their food ready to be made. We are constantly monitoring and identifying ways to be better in the kitchen. And it also goes down to the products and the types of offerings that we have. We never want to have something that is going to overly complicate our team members' journey. We don't want to have something that is going to slow us down operationally. So you'll see a lot of our LTOs just really be building for a menu of ingredients and allowing our teams to kind of do a little bit different with what we already have. LTO stands for Limited Time Offer. It might be a special shake flavor or partnerships like a recent venture with the Stiller Makers Mark. But Shake Shack's core offering is the burger. And it's not just any burger. The company pledges to store a premium meat that's ethically raised and costs more even when inflation is not at historic levels. I've heard a lot about the importance of the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1013,2022-10-09 01:46:47
12788," Any burger, the company pledges to source premium meat that's ethically raised and costs more, even when inflation's not at historic levels. I've heard a lot about the importance of the quality to you guys in terms of ingredients. Doesn't that get expensive, especially right now, quality beef must be rising in terms of price? I mean, we've always used premium ingredients and those premium ingredients they come at a higher price. We always have an eye on the margin, but we know also at the end of the day, you're running a very dangerous game. If you're trying to reverse engineer into something that you want from a PNL standpoint, the guests might not like it. Shake Shack's standing firm on quality, and it's also practicing transparency, announcing plans to raise menu prices by five to seven percent in the fourth quarter of 2022. Shake Shack is the best example, the definition of a fantastic value proposition. However, not all customers across this country have that change in their pocket to pay for that average ticket at lunch or dinner. And I think they're very comfortable with that, and I think it's very interesting and very different than what others are doing. I mean, it is who they are. They're not trying to escape it, they're not trying to be something they're not. And the fact of the matter is, if they picked a different path and it's fine, it would be hard to pick it back. We are serving fresh, whole muscle, hormone antibiotic-free beef. That is a totally different thing than you're going to eat at nearly all other restaurants, certainly traditional fast food. And you got to pay more for that and you should want to. And when you see things like $10 or $2 for $5, we can't do that because our ingredients cost more than that to bring it to you and you should want to pay more for that. And frankly, who am I to argue? It's all crunchy, the bacon is all crunchy. I like that. It's delicious. I might finish this. Coming up, why Shake Shack believes it's got everything to gain by going global. I mean, there's so many opportunities for us to add to our license business. We see there's a huge, white space opportunity for us. And Katie Foggerdy tells me what skills she's relied on while making the transition from Wall Street analysts to CFO. I would say just a lot of grit. I never thought it was going to be easy and it's proved to be quite the learning opportunity. This is Bloomberg. So what's the best investment advice you've ever been given by anybody? The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance, and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day. And if you keep at it and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's not just interest. It was always said above compound interest returns, compound business returns, compound human returns. They're all very additive because you learn every day. And if you keep at it, it's very, very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make selling at the wrong time? And they sell when the prices go down? Yes. Or not keeping people have conviction or they invest for the right reasons just keep at it.

Nearly 90% of Shake Shack locations in the US are company operated. Around the world, it's a different story. The business closes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1014,2022-10-09 01:51:22
12789," Nearly 90% of Shake Shack locations in the U.S. are company operated. Around the world it's a different story. The business has grown internationally by working with licensed partners to operate restaurants. That's a trend they intend to keep going. Today we have Shake Shack since 16 countries, everywhere from China to Singapore to the Philippines to London and beyond. We see it as a huge white space opportunity for us. Many restaurant brands struggle to move outside of their own core market in the United States. Perhaps it's something that's very New England and when they try to move outside of the New England area, guest reception is just not there. Or it's a West Coast brand that takes 50 years to bleed across the country. The thing about Shake Shack and the magic about it is this is a company that can sit here with only 200 restaurants in the U.S. today open up one in a Tier 2 city in China. And the guest reception for that restaurant is mind blowing. These are some of the largest open that we've ever had. We have big plans for our licensed business. It's a really asset light, cash accretive business for us. We love it and we love it when our partners overseas make a ton of money because they're going to build more restaurants so we're going to all continue to grow. I mean, there's so many opportunities for us to add to our licensed business. And certainly, I get so many text messages from people traveling the world. If there is a Shake Shack there, guess which one this one is and if there's not one, why don't you have one here? The first Shake Shack in mainland China open in 2019 and there are now more than 20. Although the government zero COVID policy is weighed on revenues, the company is committed to expanding its presence. China is a fascinating business for us. It's one of the most exciting and biggest opportunities Shake Shack has. Over the initial couple of years of the pandemic, they've faired much better than we did here and much better than most places around the world. Today, it has been erratic. It's been lockdowns. It's been closures. But here's what's amazing. The resiliency of the Chinese people, our team over there is unlike anything I've witnessed, it is one of the toughest places to do business in the world, but our brand seems to be really resonating with people over there right now and I see it as one of the biggest areas of growth we have at Shake Shack. Restaurants haven't been resonating with Wall Street recently. The sector has underperformed the S&P 500 for much of 22, but the industry is historically resilient. Restaurants are undervalued right now. As a person who has been following restaurants since I had hair, I think restaurants are probably the most flexible and most creative of businesses that we have. The routine and the social engagement happens at restaurants and that's not changing just because we may or may not go into the recession. It just isn't going to change and so the restaurant stocks will rebound. This industry is the third largest employer, you know, all the population of workers in this country. I mean, this is like the fabric of the economy. And the economy will rebound and restaurants stocks will blow up. If you want to trade in and out of Shake Shack, you know, you just may not be the time for you. If you are a believer in the brand of Shake Shack for the long term, like we are and have been, we're going to create tremendous value for our shareholders over time. We've done that. Shareholders should measure us on are we building things for the long term? And if you want to be here for the long term, my sense is Shake Shack is going to be good. One of Shake Shack's long term assets is a bright new CFO. Katie Fogarty now has a year of experience under her belt. I wanted to know what she sees when she looks ahead. What's the opportunity for Shake Shack in the next 10 years that excite to the most? I have to say it is in watching our people grow and develop. I see a very strong growth roadmap here for the company in terms of units and sales potential. What that really means at the end of the day is that our hourly team members are able to grow a career with us in a way that is unique to Shake Shack and cannot be found at many other restaurant brands. We have a number of people who start off as hourly team members and are now making six figures and have equity because they've grown up through the system and they're paying it forward by training other people to allow them to have such a great career path as well. I really, really think that this is a team that may work together. I'm glad you have stamped on to the 2016 Blue TOGETHER Which exactly reminds us of the New BB No Mom Olympics the last night when they came here. 20 did you get your crows or you'd interviews with a него? o gro n What makes them so nervous ONE One of the most common weaknesses and reasons on ships that weren't getting sponsored,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1015,2022-10-09 01:55:46
12790," because they've grown up through the system and they're paying it forward by training other people to allow them to have such a great career path as well. What's the challenge over the next 10 years that keeps you up at night? It also goes with people. It has been a very challenging staffing environment for the restaurant industry as a whole. It's been well telegraphed that you know some people have just left the industry altogether. And so you know we know when we have to high turn over we're not operating at our best. And so I do think that there's an amazing opportunity that once kind of the world stabilizes and returns you know back to normal that we have people considering the restaurant industry as more of an exciting long-term career. In terms of your role as CFO how do you see that or your role with this company changing and developing over the next 10 years? I think that you know it becomes ever more important to have a great grasp on the insights that are driving the business on the factors that are driving your business. And you know that's very important for CFO to do but also to collaborate with other business leaders within the company to help you know kind of cross-pollinate strategies. You know whatever I do in a vacuum is not going to be nearly as impactful as our entire executive leadership team coming together and acting on something. And I think that that is ever more apparent sitting on this side of the table than it was on the other side as a Wall Street analyst. Speaking of that what skill or what area of knowledge do you think has helped you the most in your first year as CFO? I would say just a lot of grit. This has been a very challenging industry for sure. I never thought it was going to be easy and it's proved to be quite the learning opportunity. Coming in every day just excited to learn something new and make a difference wherever you can knowing that I'm sitting here with a team of people growing a company that will potentially have an impact on a number of people's lives going forward. So what advice would you give someone else then who maybe is watching and gets promoted to CFO? What advice would you give to a future CFO? What advice would I give to a future CFO? I guess I would just be get into the details super super deep and really kind of understand and ask a lot of questions, peel the onion. I think a lot of people just don't go deep enough and don't ask the questions so that you actually cannot, you know, if you're not versed on what's going on you can't find group cause and you can't try to change. So you know I would say get into the details, have an open mind. It's an incredibly fun job for sure working with people who are coming, you know, everybody's aligned here to drive the future of Shake Shack. But everybody comes at it from a different angle. So it's very exciting to work with an amazing team of people. I'm Matt Miller. This is Bloomberg. I'm going to name a couple of of your babies. I don't know if I'm asking you to choose amongst your children, but you know some of the most recognizable buildings by you, of course, the Millennium Bridge, London City Hall, the Reichstag and the Great Court British Museum. What was your favorite project to do? The Reichstag does stand out because first of all it's an energy manifesto. So it transformed something that was dependent on fossil fuels. It uses all the technology to produce something which is essentially carbon neutral and there's a public building. That's a statement. It's a symbol of a city. It's a symbol of a nation. It incorporates works of art. It's recycling and existing building which as I mentioned earlier is the ultimate in sustainability. If you can give a new life to a building. It also creates public space. At the roof level it is the most visited parliament in the world. So it puts the public above the politicians who are answerable to them and that of course was made possible by the politicians. So it's a demonstration of democracy in action.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1016,2022-10-09 01:59:40

What separates a great investor from an average investor? Is it an early affinity for markets? I put a satellite dish on top of the dorm room so I would have access to real-time stock quotes. An unconventional path. What I really wanted to do was ski. So I left Wharton and I went up to Maine and became ski bump. A never-ending thirst for knowledge? It is a constant education each and every day. An acute attention to detail. I was down there for three weeks. I met every tenant. I was counting the car traffic. I was learning the business. A willingness to take a risk? If you want to produce return, you have to be willing to take risks. Where the ability to recognize a mistake and move on. I don't mind a 90% chance probability of failure if there's a 10% chance of changing the world. In how to invest, I hope to provide a glimpse into the thoughts and practices of the world's great investors and hopefully inspire a new generation of professional investors. In my pursuit of identifying the traits and skills of a great investor, I first looked into their backgrounds. I found many were raised in blue collar or middle class families. Rarely where they from fabulously wealthy families or families where there was a history of investing professionally. But their path to a career and investing varied. Some like Ron Barron, the mutual fund manager and investor with more than $50 billion on her management started investing as a teenager. After my birth, I was interested in stock market because I had friends of mine who had been given stock from the grandparents who were prosperous. In Eastman, Kodak and Polaroid. I said, I want to do that. And my father said, we can't invest in stocks. We've never done that, you know, family. And in fact, one of the ideas behind my business is the idea was I wanted to be able to have people like my parents be able to invest in the stock market. So I saw that and then he said, well, I had $1,000 at the time. And he said, well, if you show me why you want to invest in a company.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1017,2022-10-09 02:04:46
12792," So I saw that and then he said, well, I had a thousand dollars at the time and he said, well, if you show me why you want to invest in a company and you put all your money into one company, then and show me why, then I'll let you do that and open account for you. And so I did research, I would go to this brokerage firm and I would, it was called McDonald and Company or from Cleveland and they were right by Asbury Park High School. So I would go there after school, sports and girls and stocks and I would go there after school and all these guys, old guys, 40, 50 years old. They're sitting there on these green chairs and looking at a tape that hardly moved, I think the New York Stock Exchange was 25 million shares a day and maybe American was a million or two million shares a day. So look, I got a report on this Mama County National Bank and I started reading it and it was around the corner where I lived in Allenhurst outside of Asbury Park and I told my father why I wanted to invest in it and he let me invest and the stock was $10 a share, 100 shares and then the stock every day for the next six months, seven months, every day you stay the same or win up an eighth and it was printed the 15 stocks and then Asbury Park Press and everybody said the same and then it got acquired at $17 a share. So my $1,000 became 1700. I said, man, there's nothing today. I want to do that. So I was interested. Hedge Fund billionaire Ken Griffin also turned an early affinity for math and computers into an early career in stock trading. Let's talk about your background before you started Sadell. You're born in Florida? I was born in Daytona Beach. My father worked on the space program back in the 1960s but I spent my formative years in middle school and high school in Buck or Tung Florida. You were a pretty good math student and I'm told a computer nerd as well. Is that fair or unfair? Well, I appreciate the compliment because to be a computer nerd has obviously turned out to be a pretty good place to be in life and yes, I was very interested in both mathematics and programming in high school and it's defined my career and it has had a very important role in my life. So you went to Harvard College. Most students there are taking courses or their athletics but you were maybe doing that but you were also trading securities. Is that true? I started a small partnership my second year at Harvard to engage in convertible bond arbitrage which was a bit of an off the beaten path occupation for a kid in college but I had a great fast nation with markets and I had an opportunity to invest capital markets in my college days and it was an incredible opportunity. It was a really great learning experience. But in those days it wasn't common to be able to get stock prices instantly. You had to get a special terminal or special antenna to let you get the stock quotes. Is that right? So it's amazing is you know I love the line people go well that's how we've always done it and I can think back into the early days of Citadel we're always did it meant we used a fax machine which you and I of course have memories of and the fax machine was revolutionary. In the 1980s real time stock prices were actually difficult to receive and I put a satellite dish on top of the dorm room so I would have access to real time stock quotes in managing the portfolio that I manage and what did the Harvard people say? Interestingly enough back in the 80s Harvard had a general prohibition on commercial activity in your dorm rooms so I had to go to the building superintendent to get an exception to put the satellite dish on the roof of the building and fortunately he was willing to grant me that exception. But not every investor saw their future in finance early. The state tightened Sam Zell and myself studied the law became lawyers and hated it. I was always a good enough academic to get from here to there so when I wanted to go to law school I got seven A's but I didn't get very many A's before that and I basically used the four years of being an undergraduate to build a real estate business and build other businesses and I just had a great time. So you were doing some real estate on the side while you were in college and then you went to University of Michigan Law School and to please your mother or father you said I'm going to go to law school but you weren't that interested in being a lawyer? No never it's a matter of fact I ended up graduating and becoming a lawyer and I practiced for four days. Four days I didn't realize you practiced that long. Four days. Four days.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1018,2022-10-09 02:08:33
12793," Never, as a matter of fact, I ended up graduating and becoming a lawyer and I practiced for four days. Four days, I didn't realize you practiced that long. Four days. So, in the morning of the fifth day, I went to see the senior partner and as only a 24-year-old could do, I looked in and I said, I just don't think this is a good use of my time. He said, okay, there's the door. Well, actually, what he's going to do, and I said, I'm just going to go back to doing deals like I did when I was in law school and in the real estate business in Arbor. And so, he said, one, if you stay here and will do the legal work, and will invest in your deals. And so, that's what we did for a year. And then there's activist investor Nelson Peltz, who didn't see the point in studying at all. What I really wanted to do was ski. So I left Wharton and I went up to Maine and became a ski boat. What did your family say? Nelson, we really wanted you to go to Wharton and be a good student. You're one of ski. That's not what you're supposed to do. That's correct. They did say that. What did you do? You said I was skiing. My father was an amazing guy. He wasn't happy that I left Wharton. He wasn't happy that I was a ski bum. And he wasn't happy that I grew a beard. But I did all of those things. And the snow melted in late spring and came back and I had a summer job offered to me in Mount Hood, Oregon to help them teach racing to young kids in Mount Hood, Oregon. And I needed some money to get out there. I asked him if he'd give me a job on a truck a hundred bucks a week, two weeks. That was all I needed. He said, find shave your beard off and do it. I said I would. It was only temporary. So I shaved my beard off and after about a week on the job, I started telling things that I thought that were missed opportunities. And he set me up beautifully. He said, why don't you stay here and do what you want to do instead of going out to Mount Hood, Oregon? Well, I did. And that's what happened. There are also great investors like Paul of O'Lent, one of the country's most successful endowment heads who came to investing after a completely different career. I studied paper conservation, restoring prints and drawings. I worked at the New York Historical Society for a while there. I then went to work at the Palace of Fine Arts in their Conservation Lab and then I went to Los Angeles where I worked at the LA County Museum. I did study, I did a scientific work at the Getty and then I set up my own conservation studio where I worked with contemporary artists like Edward Shay, Sam Francis. And I was running my own business and I realized I needed to know a little bit about finance because I was working with very expensive works of art. I was running a studio and so I started taking a couple of business classes at UCLA and through that I got introduced to Yale School of Management. But I got into Yale School of Management at the same time I got offered a fellowship at the National Gallery of Art where you and I both serve the Lyscher Fellow and I worked in the paper conservation lab there combining paper and paintings techniques for conservation on contemporary works of art. So you did that for a while and then you went to Yale School of Management? My husband and I had been trying to have a child and it wasn't kind of works. It wasn't happening so he said, okay, well let's move to New Haven. And of course that was instant and my daughter was born after my first semester. So I took a break and while when my daughter was probably two months old I went to David Swinson and knocked on the door and said hi I want to learn about endowment because I'm going to work at a museum. And this is about David. David looked at my resume. There was no finance at all. And he took me in and I started filing and helping organize things and little by little I got projects to do. I remember he had me do a big research on soft dollars. That was one project I worked on. And little by little I became incorporated into the investment office. Coming up we hear about the extreme intelligence and intention to detail that it takes for success.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1019,2022-10-09 02:12:52
12794," Little by little I became incorporated into the investment office Coming up we hear about the extreme intelligence and intention to detail that it takes for success on Wall Street One of Sam's favorite samisms is we suffer from knowing the numbers Imagine simply climbing a cable into space. The concept is known as the space elevator. Not only could it significantly change how we leave planet earth but it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space. And there are scientists who think we could have already built it. We have the material, we have the technology, we have the lasers, we have the climbers, we have all of it. If a private entity wants to build it or a government, they can build it. It'll change society. We have no clue how colonizing in the space, how really spreading on this space really change our society over the next 50 to 200 years. It'll be completely different. We make it very transparent to the shopper before they accept an order. What the order is going to look like, how much we're going to pay them and how much the consumer is paying them. And so they can decide whether they take an order or whether they refuse it. And that's a kind of flexibility that our shoppers really value and the kind of transparency that they want. Are you seeing a labor shortage right now and what are you doing to combat that? It's different in different places or demographic of shoppers is completely different from food delivery and our right sharing. We're 70% women and half of them are moms. And that's because a lot of the job at Instacart is very different than just being in a car with strangers. It's about like going to the store, doing a good job of customer service of really picking the right products for the consumer. And we are seeing that being very appealing to women. Another trait of great investors that shouldn't surprise you is they all tend to have a high degree of intelligence. Many excelled academically. But true success as Mary Eardos, the CEO of JP Morgan Asset and Wealth Management, points out, comes from training and continuing to educate oneself. So training on Wall Street, but specifically in Wealth Management, is a very, very long process. We have 2200 analysts starting today and they're going to be working through the summer. We have 3600 analysts across JP Morgan Chase that will start at the very end in the September time period for their full time role. And we work very hard to go through in-depth training and then to work through which ones actually are good at stock investing, which ones are good at M&A transactions, which ones are good at helping people understand things in a more simplistic matter. That's a two to three year training program. But that's pretty fast. If you think 10,000 hours is about what you need to master any subject. If someone comes in and has a regular, you know, eight hour a day job, five days a week, it's going to take you about five years to have a base level mastery. On Wall Street, it's more like 12 hours a day, six days a week, that cuts you down to about two and a half years before you become mastered in something. Once they've got that under their belt, they can then join a team. And if they've been successful going through the analyst program, joining a team, then the team will work through how that works. But it is a constant education each and every day. Every morning we start with an eight o'clock meeting and I call it like a mini university. And it's not just about what you've read in the newspapers as to what happened overnight. It's about understanding how all of those components fit together in a client's portfolio. And then what might be right for you would be different than somebody else.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1020,2022-10-09 02:16:59
12795," that the location is everything. And also you might say it's local, local, local, because most people make in-beer-less-state investments kind of in the area they know. You've made investments all over the world. How do you sitting in New York know about their value of real estate in Europe or in Asia and how hard has that been to build a global business? So I think the key to that is to have a global footprint, to have hundreds of people all over the world. And it took us a long time to do it. I mean, we've been at this for 30 years and you really need talented people on the ground. You need local people who know the markets. The one thing I'd say, though, that is advantageous about real estate is so many of the trends we're seeing, particularly driven by technology, are the same around the world. So when we started buying warehouses back in 2010, and we noticed that there were these e-commerce tenants showing up, and we started buying more in the US, it wasn't a big leap of faith to say the same thing's going to happen in Canada, it's going to happen in the UK and continental Europe and across Asia. So my view is that if you have the skill set, you can evaluate plus you travel a lot, like you. I'm on planes a lot. I no longer run the real estate business day today. My colleagues Ken Kaplan and Kathleen McCarthy have done an amazing job, but they have teams around the world on the ground, and we're local in those markets. And I think that's really important. You cannot buy real estate in Mumbai the way we have flying in and flying out of New York. Next, we look at how skilled investors evaluate risk. We are 100% confident every time we make the investment, that it's going to be a big company. We are wrong a lot of the time. I'm the world of politics to the world of business. Balance of power with David Weston, views and analysis inside, from and above politics, power players weekdays. This is Bloomberg. This is Bloomberg. This is Bloomberg. This is Bloomberg. This is Bloomberg. This is Bloomberg. On TV, radio and the web. This is Bloomberg. One of the easiest paths in life is to accept and follow conventional wisdom. But what great investors have found is that path doesn't lead to easy returns. Often, the biggest wins come from going against the grain and taking a risk, especially if you are leading venture capital investor like Mark Andreessen or Venaud Kostler. Each top and venture firm has its own bar. So it has its own set of criteria for things that deals should be done or not. And then the top tier venture firms as a group have a collective bar, which is kind of is a top tier venture firm going to fund this company or not. And it's actually easier to answer that second question than it is the first question. Like after you've been in the business for a while, you tend to have a sense of like, okay, this is going to get funded by a top and venture capital firm or it's not. If it is going to get funded by a top and venture capital firm, and if my firm doesn't think it's a good idea, you do wonder who's right, right? Because the other firms are quite smart. And so this is one of the regular discussions that we have, which is like, okay, if another one of these top and firms is interested in it, that might be a very positive substantive signal. If the other top firms have looked at it and all passed, that might be a substantive negative signal. That said, some of the best deals in history have been passed on by a very large number of people. One of the classic examples, Uber was passed on by a very large number of venture capital firms. Uber was actually available to be invested in on this site called Angelist, where literally anybody with a checkbook can invest. And so every once in a while you get these outliers. And it's fundamentally a game of outliers. Like the money is made on the aberrations. And so I'd say you want to be generally open-minded and humble about your conclusions, about what all these different signals mean. Now, a famous economist, Herbstin, once said,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1021,2022-10-09 02:24:14
12796," money is made on the aberrations. And so I say you want to be generally open-minded and humble about your conclusions about what all these different signals mean. Now, a famous economist, Herb Stein, once said, if something can't keep going on forever, it won't. In other words, at some point, things settle down. Do you worry that because the economy might soften at some point if interest rates are raised or just because of the business cycle, the wonderful world of venture capital will slow down a bit. And is that a worry for you? So it's a cyclical business for sure. It has a history of boom bus cycles, basically just like any other sector of the economy. That's that, I guess I would say. We do not have a great track record in our industry of predicting these cycles. And I think most of how we either perform or fail to perform is micro-not macro, which is to say it's based on the successor failure of individual companies. And if you just look at the history of venture capital and startups, many of the best companies have been formed during the hot periods. But also many of the companies have been formed during the cold periods, right? And they're pros and cons of those periods. And so look, it's possible there's another cyclical boom and bus cycle. Our plan for that cycle would basically be to just keep going, keep working with our existing companies, help them through it, keep investing in new companies all the way through. And basically bet on these sort of micro-level fundamental technological and economic changes that continue to happen. Most of what we do is on chartered territory. I would say the one piece that works really well in our business is go for higher risk, higher consequences. So most people in business reduce risk, increase the probability of success, which is reduced risk. But at the expense of making the consequences of success relatively inconsequential, you might make two times your money or something. I, for our business, what works is I don't mind a 90% probability of failure if there's a 10% chance of changing the world. And that's very much the philosophy. It also goes where it's the right way to make huge impact. It's not just venture capitalists taking risks. Columbia's endowment head Kim Liu also says gains are not without calculated risks. I think the best investment advice I've ever received is the fact that we are in the business of taking risk. And so if you want to produce return, you have to be willing to take risk and you have to be willing to analyze and mitigate that risk the best you can. And to make sure that the return potential of an investment is equal to the risk, but you can't avoid risk. Now, what do you think the most common mistake investors make generally? I think the most common mistakes is following the herd. And just doing what everybody else is doing and not making sure that an investment is appropriate for your institution and making sure that the analysis that someone else has done is not appropriate for you or is not congruent with the way you think about the world. I think there are million ways to make money. I think there are million strategies that can work. Not every investment is consistent with your strategy. And so I think there's a lot of herd mentality. And that's a huge mistake that happens. Now sometimes risk don't pan out and mistakes are made. Now I might sit and stew over the loss for a decade or two, but a truly great investor like Cliner Perkins Chairman John Doerr has the ability to admit a mistake, cut his losses and move on. When I first came to Silicon Valley, I hung out at Stanford on the second floor of Margaret Jacks Hall. And down that hall was Andy Bechtel-Schheim, who founded Sun Microsystems, John Hennessy, who became president of Stanford, founded MIPS Jim Clark of Silicon Graphics. What I didn't do is go down into the basement. Where Len and Sandy were starting Cisco. So that was a miss on my part. More recently, I had the opportunity to invest in an electric vehicle company. And the conventional wisdom was venture capitalists ought not to invest in electric vehicle companies. Not new car companies at all. There've been 400 new car companies in the nation's history. Every one of them but one has gone bankrupt. But I was still very attracted to the market. And we had the choice of backing a brilliant car designer by the name of Henry Fisker, or a ambitious, slightly crazy entrepreneur by the name of Elon Musk, a test. Well, we made the wrong decision. But...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1022,2022-10-09 02:28:47
12797," or ambitious, slightly crazy entrepreneur by the name of Elon Musk, a test. Well, we made the wrong decision, but Tesla did very, very well, and so did electric vehicles. So when I make a mistake, I only think about it for the next 10 or 20 years. How long does it take for you to get over these things? Well, I don't obsess on these, but I won't ever forget. This is a market that over the past few weeks has made it clear. It wants to go higher. It got a little spooked by the idea that geocolatal potential rises. So as you look back on your career, what would you say is the best investment advice you've ever received? Probably the best investment advice that I never received. But that I've lived my whole life around, is surround yourself with really good people. I thought about it just today, like I do many times, you know, what makes a great investor? A great investment firm is comprised of people who are optimists and pessimists and realists. Because in the intersection of the debates that go across that wide range of personalities is where you find truth. It's part of the reason I'm so focused on freedom of expression. I see it my own four walls, the robust and fulsome debates around how we commit our capital, what defines a good idea, what businesses to build or pursue. That's what drives the success at Citadel. And I've been very fortunate in life to always had a group of friends who really push me, who make me better. And here I get to work with three and a half thousand colleagues who in their ways make me better each and every day and collectively as a team, we've had the opportunity to have an incredible impact on the financial landscape around the world.

Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world recalibrates. After decades of stagnation, Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation. Corporate giants, policymakers and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that. Every week on Japan ahead, we're right here on Bloomberg Television. Hello! Good! How are you? It's so great to see you. Thank you so much for doing this. What do you think about all this love getting into crypto? I think that that was more last year. I think it's kind of a way of that past. No, I don't think so, but I think it's like any time that, frankly, it's when a lot of other people get into crypto, right? Other audiences too. It's when it's in the news a lot. And when does that happen? A lot of times when the prices are going up.

12798," She was a federal prosecutor going after gangs and the mob before being handed for next assignment, taking down Bitcoin. Katie Han soon realized this new technology was much more than a tool used by criminals. She dove deep and became a crypto convert, swapping her prosecutor hat for a board seat at Coinbase, and became the first female general partner at Venture Firm and Recent Horowitz. Han, now a prolific crypto investor, recently launched her own fund with one and a half billion dollars to deploy. It's the largest fund ever raised by a single investor. Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0 CEO and founder of Han Ventures, Katie Han. Katie, it's so great to have you. Great to be back here in the studio with you Emily. I want to start with a vibe check. What state of the crypto cycle are we in right now? It was hot. And then it got pretty cold. Well, look Emily, zooming back because I've been in crypto for a decade if you can believe it. We've seen crypto be really hot and then all of a sudden not. And so we've seen this before. However, I think one of the things that's a little bit different now is with each new crypto cycle, more and more people come into it. And so it's more and more pronounced each cycle. And I would push back on it's not. I think it depends on what area of the ecosystem you're looking at. We think developers think crypto and Web3 is still really hot. I am seeing a lot less of those. We're all going to make it hashtags. I'm seeing a lot less of them too. Although I am spending less time on Twitter. So maybe that's why as well. But with each cycle, there are new acronyms. What hasn't happened is a crypto winter in the midst of really serious global macro conditions. So we have inflation, kind of at record highs for our generation, in our lifetime. And then we have also a war that's broken out in the Ukraine. And we have a number of other factors going on here. So that's very different. There was some serious carnage out there. So, look at Luna, three hours. What's been your takeaways from that? I don't want to sit here and tell you that algorithmic stablecoins are bad. Because I actually think they're really interesting. However, I think what happened is you had, in this case you mentioned, Luna and Tara. That was an algorithmic stablecoin that was getting pretty widespread adoption relative to what the tech could do. I didn't realize you spent your teenage years living in Egypt and learning Arabic. Tell me about your upbringing. I was always uprooted. My dad worked for a large company and we were always moving just when I would get comfortable in one space. And I think actually that's pretty important if you fast-forward and look at my career. I'm comfortable being in uncomfortable situations. I didn't know a lot about venture when I got into it initially. I didn't know a lot about crypto when I got into it initially. And I was okay asking questions. I was okay not knowing the local acronyms or the Namanclature of a particular field. And I'm, you know, I'm taken right back to my teenage years in Cairo, moving from Houston, Texas one day to downtown Maddie in Cairo the next day. You studied law? I did. You clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. That's right. You became a federal prosecutor. You were taking on prison gangs and the mafia. That must have taken a really thick skin. I was doing it at each 25. And now if I kind of take a step back and you know I think that happens at different points in your career. Like, whoa, if I would have analyzed that a little more at the time. And I'm kind of in some ways glad I didn't. I just dove right in. Because I felt it fascinating. There was a human aspect to it and people's stories. And I felt like those stories mattered. So I was drawn to criminal law and became a federal prosecutor. And I did cases involving violent crime. But then really mistrying cases, being back in the courtroom, being before the grand jury. Like the prosecutor you would see on TV going to try those murder cases. Doing those two hour closing arguments. That's right. And so moved out here to California. I died at the largest prison gang in the world at the time. Outlaw motorcycle gangs. Hostage taking. Bank robberies. Armed bank robberies. There was really not a kind of criminal case by that point in my career. I hadn't done it. I was right around that time.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1024,2022-10-09 02:37:22
12799," Psychogang's hostage taking, bank robberies, arm bank robberies, there was really not a kind of criminal case by that point in my career. I hadn't done it. It was right around that time, 2012. One of my bosses came in and said, let's have that same energy that you brought to those gang cases, to those murder cases. And let's go ahead and have you investigate this new criminal technology that we really need to look into and possibly shut this down. So you created the first cryptocurrency task force. How would you describe it? Fortunately, several of us in the government realized at the time it's not possible, also not desirable, because Bitcoin is not an entity. It's not a person. Right, it's a protocol. And it would be like saying, let's go shut down cash. Let's go shut down the internet. It's not possible. Probably wouldn't be a good idea, either. I was using crypto and technologies like the Bitcoin blockchain, because that's all that existed then. This is 2012, 2013. To actually uncover criminal activity. So I didn't think that that technology was bad. Frankly, it was a tool that helped me uncover the various activity. And by the way, it was a step level function improvement better than compliance by banks. I'll just go ahead and say it. That's a little bit controversial. But I had spent a decade subpoenaing large financial institutions. And five times out of 10 didn't get back what I needed. One case I worked on. And people always say, oh, you shut down the Silk Road. What actually happened? I was looking into something completely, not having to do with anything at all of the Silk Road, and came across some, what looked to be some kind of odd activity. And it turns out that a couple of federal agents on the Silk Road Task Force out of Washington, DC, were croaked. And that is the case that I ended up in dieting. And I ended up prosecuting those agents, and they both went to prison. So that's the aspect of what Silk Road case that I worked on. I would never, never have been able to uncover that criminal activity by those agents. Because they were federal agents, they knew how to cover their tracks. Had they not used Bitcoin blockchain. So that technology right there, if they had just used wires or cash or bank wires, we would never have uncovered that. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund from scratch? No one covers the world like Bloomberg. We have to get interest rates higher and bring inflation back to our targets. It's better to pass this, become a skier. We are running on thin ice. No one deliberately wants to go into battle, but we sneak walk into conflict with unmatched reach in resources from more than 120 countries. The moment news breaks, 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. Back in 1997, I was interested in the following question, which is there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called Saurapod dinosaurs, which had really long skinny necks. So Apatosaurus is an example. It has had really long skinny tails. So I made a computer model that showed that, in fact, the tail of these Saurapod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip, a bullfip. Now, the way a bullfip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. And that crack is a sonic boom. I think the way they got a date was to impress the females by making loud booms. So you became kind of a crypto convert after this. You joined the board of coin base. That's right. Very early on. How did you and coin base and Brian Armstrong come together? I hosted an event here in San Francisco at the Federal Reserve Bank. And I believe it was there that it wasn't just Brian. It was a lot of what I'll call legitimate actors and crypto who wanted to usher in this new wave, this new ecosystem. And then we brought together the heads of.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1025,2022-10-09 02:41:36
12800," I'm just Brian, it was a lot of what I'll call legitimate actors and crypto who wanted to usher in this new wave, this new ecosystem. And then we brought together the heads of all kinds of agencies. Really in an effort to kind of talk about building bridges, you know, the government and the crypto industry. We're never going to see eye to eye on a lot of things, but we did think there were some commonalities. Coinbase is a company that has suffered. They've been losing share. The valuation of the public markets has plummeted. Why do you think that is and how do you think it can be fixed? Yeah, well, I think again, a few things it's tied to. One, a large aspect of Coinbase's business now, of course, is trading revenue. And that's down when prices are down. And you know, the company's been very transparent about that long before going public. I mean, also, if you look at its S1, it specifically identifies that. And just how volatile crypto cycles are. So I think that's part of it. It's judged by public markets as a technology stock or as a financial services company. By the way, I think it's both. I think it's not just a financial services company. I think it's so much more. I think it's really a portal to this whole new ecosystem. You were also on the board of OpenC until recently, there's an insider trading situation or accusation going on there. Coinbase has also had employees accused of insider trading. How much is this happening within crypto companies and within the industry and how big a problem is that? Yeah. I think crypto is under the microscope. So where you have a case, two cases, three cases in crypto ecosystem, which now is a trillion dollar industry. I think multi-billion approaching trillion dollar industry, you're always going to be able to find examples like that. So I don't want to make too much out of a handful of cases. That said, the company, Coinbase, OpenC, take these things incredibly seriously. Along with your position at Coinbase, you became a partner at one of the most story venture capital firms in Silicon Valley and the Exandrys in Harowitz. What was your experience at A16Z? Here I met Chris Dixon and I met Ben Horowitz and I met Mark Andreessen and I had worked with them for just about a year, maybe a little bit over when they asked me to come and co-run their crypto funds at Andreessen Harowitz. Again, I jumped at that chance and I think really that speaks to the fact that, as I said before, things are a hell yes or there are no and it was a hell yes for me. So Andreessen Harowitz is the kind of place where if you make a partner, you don't leave. Yeah. How did Mark and Ben respond when you said? Yeah. Why don't you leave to start a crypto fund of my own? As you might know, Emily, they're an anchor. They're an anchor check into my fund and I'm very grateful for that. Mark and Chris and folks like them are also personal LPs. So I felt very supported when I shared that decision and I will say that it was not running away from Andreessen Harowitz. It was running to another opportunity. And you know, crypto is not, what do they say? It's not a spectator sport. Like you're in it, it's very young, it's 24-7, it's global and it's hustle. And at this, and that's a trade-off, it's a life trade-off. And at this point in my career and in my life, if I was going to continue to make that trade-off, I just wanted to do it and do it in a way that was really true to me. So you struck out on your own? Yes. To launch on Ventures, what gave you the courage to do that? What was the spark that lit the fire? Yeah. That got you to say, I need to do this and do this now. Sure, what I set out to do was to continue to invest in this ecosystem that I think is so broad that decision was very purposeful and the timing was very purposeful. We have an early stage fund that does seed stage, series A, even series B, and then we have what we call an acceleration fund, which is, it's not a growth fund, it's a crypto growth fund and I think those are different things. But it's later stage, it might be crypto-publics. Some kinds of public tokens were set up to hold tokens and participate in the token ecosystem or later stage companies. I mean, there are now several crypto, many crypto unicorns. Space has become really competitive. Even though you say, you know, crypto has had its kind of ups and downs, the thing is, a lot of people in some of those last cycles have seen the kind of venture style returns that can be had in crypto. And so you've had a lot of new funds enter the space. And that's driven up competition. So what differentiates on ventures then from, you know, all of these other crypto funds or even the more traditional venture capitalists like entries in Harowitz or Sequoia, they also have crypto funds now.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1026,2022-10-09 02:46:05
12801," Differentiate Tom Ventures then from you know all of these other crypto funds or even the more traditional venture capitalists like entries in Horror wits or Sequoia. They also have crypto funds. Sure. Well, I think a lot of traditional venture capital funds now have crypto funds It used to just be like a regulatory designation. It was like are you an RIA which is registered investment advisor? I would say for crypto founders today It's not enough to just be an RIA, right? They frankly I don't even know if a lot of them care. That's a regulatory designation. What crypto founders today want to know is do you live and breathe crypto? Do you inhale the discord? Are you part of the community? Do you participate in governance? Are you gonna be Staking these kind of crypto verbs out there and if you're not really in this space full time I think it's very hard to run a successful crypto fund. We don't have a hedge fund component So we're not sitting here buying and trading and selling that's a hedge fund structure and there are crypto hedge funds We're not one. We're making seven to ten year best Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund from scratch? You know, it's hard, but it's not impossible. We don't have a crystal ball I don't know I can't predict cycles But I knew that we were in a cycle where you saw so much further an excitement around the space And I already talked about what makes this different But I think one thing also is we are a nimble strike force We don't fish in the same pond. We have the crypto natives. We have a fishing execution We have operators seasoned operators who really know how to stick the landing and I think that's reflected on our culture I would say the only thing that's changed in our strategy as a result of the market correction is really more of a focus on Early stage, but we still have our late stage fund and when we see valuations, which I think will still see correct Spoiler I think we'll continue to see some corrections and So we might deploy our later stage fund a little bit more slowly It might not be on an even 50 50 cadence and that's okay Long-term our strategy hasn't changed long-term. We're committed to this space. How much do you think valuations are going to correct? You know, it's just I can't give you a one-size-fits-all answer because crypto is not a monolith You have some crypto companies that really follow more of an enterprise SaaS business model You have others that are layer one protocols. You have still others that are consumer-facing applications And I think one of the things we're seeing right now is the infrastructure layer and that's where we're spending a lot of our time By the way, and we think more and more use cases will come about when the infrastructure layers in place So my own view is we are not rushing to deploy. We're certainly not getting caught up You get VC FOMO and I try not to you know look. I think it's very easy to Get into that mindset, right? It's because it's a competitive sport It's a competitive space and I think I'd be lying if I said that that doesn't influence anyone I try to what I do and I think I do differently is I try to take stock of that. Oh, that's the FOMO mentality kicking in That's bad Again, you don't want to over-correct though. What we look for is we look for amazing founders It doesn't matter if I think valuations will correct if they're amazing founders There's a huge tam. We also look for what's your regulatory plan if you're launching a token What's your plan to comply with the law? What's your plan for security by the way? We've seen a lot of hacks in the space We want to really dive in there and make sure that the founders have been thoughtful about Especially if they're custodian customer funds keeping those funds secure if it's a cross-chain bridge What are the exploits? Have you changed your strategy at all given the downturn? Like how do you back down if any deals are decided not to do certain deals? Because the conditions have changed. Don't you raise the phone? We have decided not to do certain deals We've never backed out of a deal. We have decided not to do a few deals because because we think that pricing was ahead of progress Candidly and we might have been wrong about that Emily We might have been wrong about that, but I think if we were wrong not to do a couple of deals Better that we might have been right Because if we were wrong about that, I think we can find a way to still invest in those projects later Well, one thing I'm hearing is that a lot of dry powder has just sucked up because yeah All these funds raised a lot of money raised What what was the biggest fund ever for a single person not just a woman? Yeah, anyone. Yep. Are you confident you're gonna have to put a place to put all that money? I am but if I don't have a place to put it I'm not just going to go willing nilly deploy it one of the things that we told our LPs even during That period when we raised our fund, which was when crypto was undeniably still on a bull run?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1027,2022-10-09 02:50:25
12802," We could go willing, nearly deploy it. One of the things that we told our LPs even during that period when we raised our fund, which was when crypto was undeniably still on a bull run, we said that we are going to be pretty steadfast sticking to a tier deployment cycle. And I think one thing that's changed is that might have lengthened. It certainly hasn't shortened. But we will, again, we feel very good that we have the capital to back great teams when we see them. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind. I think we're falling behind. We're going to fall behind. We're going to fall behind. We're going to fall behind. We're going to fall behind. What about NFTs? Are you concerned about the declining demand? We are going to increasingly live in a digital world. And I happen to think that if you live in a digital world, you're going to want to own digital goods in that world. You're not just going to be satisfied to rent them, which is what we do now. We buy our content from walled gardens without digital scarcity, which is what NFTs unlock. You don't really own anything. You're subject to the whims of a platform. And I think NFTs and digitally scarce goods fundamentally change that. I think you'll see NFTs back again. But we are spending a lot of time in the infrastructure layer. Like I tell you, zero knowledge, technology, scalability. We think of that as like the plumbing. If you think of the fiber-optic cables. Remember, you couldn't have had YouTube and Netflix with dial-up. You couldn't have streamed content. The same is true of crypto use cases. We think that there will be a lot of new use cases unlocked when the infrastructure is there, when it's more efficient, when it's more user-friendly. And so we're spending a lot of our time there. President Biden issues this crypto executive order. There are a number of ports that are coming due. What do you want to see from the administration when it comes to regulation? Are you optimistic that we will get there? Yeah. We were so delighted to see that executive order. This is not something you should normally be delighted about. But why we were is because it was to us a real recognition that this is a US government saying this field isn't going anywhere. This field is growing. It's growing so much that we are going to direct every single agency in the federal government to come up with a plan here. I think we take a step forward, but then you see we're a big government. We're a big system. We have states. We have local entities. So we take a step forward with the EO. And then we take some steps back sometimes too. And I think what I see as crypto founders are confused by that. They're starting to think, well, I could go to this jurisdiction where there's a single regulator. And you don't have 50 states with different rules. It's the US government that needs to start taking stock of the fact that right now, Emily in China, there's a quarter of a billion, ECNY wallets. A quarter of a billion. We're still talking about whether there should be a government central bank digital currency. We're still studying that. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind China. And we're falling behind. What are the dangers of falling behind China and the rest of the world? This is years ahead. So I don't want people to take a headline and say, oh, I think the US dollar will be no longer the global currency reserve.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1028,2022-10-09 02:54:29
12803," There's a falling behind China and the rest of the world. This is years ahead, so I don't want people to take a headline and say, oh, I think the US dollar will be no longer the global currency, reserve global currency. I'm not saying that now. But fast forward decades, and if you no longer need to use the dollar because you have an alternative, I think that's a real problem. What would we use instead? Well, I think that there are going to be stable coins out there that people who have access to a smartphone will use. There is a demand for it. We see our 285% year-over-year growth of stable coins. So people are clearly liking the idea of this. Now, again, there have been some spectacular failures too, but not all stable coins are created the same. But I think the important thing is that we really do need to not just quash innovation. What do you think of how Gary Gensler, the chair of the SEC, and how he's approaching it? One of the things that I hear from founders is that they're very confused because they get told, come in, register. Just come in and talk to us. But you have the one company who's done the ultimate act of going in and registering coinbase, filed an S1. And still, you know, there's a lot of saber rattling still going on, I think. And again, I don't want to single out the SEC. And I don't want to suggest that anything they're doing is bad. I do think that right now there's a lot of confusion. And one of the pieces of confusion stems from the fact that, you know, and it started with the ICO, Mania, back in what, 2016, 2017, I can't even remember which year now, where the SEC was very loud about securities. A lot of them were securities, but the space has changed. And so to still view it through the ICO lens when so much has happened over the last five years in the space, I think is a mistake. What do you have to say to the skeptics out there who just don't believe in the future of Web 3? And don't see where this is going. I would say don't judge the current state of innovation by the end state of innovation. I hear from a lot of these skeptics. And by the way, I'm friends with a lot of these skeptics too. I don't only want to live in a crypto bubble. They want to see the use cases, especially if they're not technical. Well, when am I going to use it? What will I use it for? And I think one of the things that's not appreciated is how quickly the infrastructure here is catching up. And once you have really scalable blockchains that can handle a lot of the road put and are very efficient, I think that unlocks a whole lot of use cases. People are spending more time on screens. That curve is up and to the right. Whether we like it or not, that is the future. I mean, those who have kids know that kids spend more time online. They want digital things too. And I think to dismiss it, it is a bit generational. I do find not always, but it is a bit generational. If you talk to kids about being able to have money online, they instantly get that concept. They're comfortable not having to hold something in their hand to think it has value. Take us to the end state. Do Google and Amazon and Facebook and Apple still exist? I believe they will still exist. I mean, it depends what you talk about when you talk about the end state. I mean, I think that, you know, I think for decades, those companies will still be around. But the important thing is I think this new ecosystem is going to represent a challenge to them. I do think that those entities, decentralized forces are coming. And we'll cut into those entities, profits and revenues. So we have a little rapid fire section. If you could belong to any altcoin tribe, that's what it be. Gosh.

In July 2022, Atlanta hosted what might sound like a boring legal seminar. A conference on the new rules around name, image, and likeness in sports. But far from dry and academic, the first annual NIL Summit was in fact a flashy star-studded event put on at the College Football Hall of Fame. And mingling amid the biggest current and former names in sports and media, there was a crucial cohort. The player is poised to redefine what it means to be a modern college athlete. And the winner of male athlete of the year goes to Chase Griffin. Among those up-and-comers, UCLA's Chase Griffin. The UCLA quarterback is among the students becoming as well known for making deals as making plays. And even in that group, Chase stands out. My name is Chase Griffin. What's up everyone, is Chase Griffin. I'm Chase Griffin.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1030,2022-10-09 03:03:12
12805," as making plays and even in that group, Chase stands out. My name is Chase Griffin. What's up everyone? It's Chase Griffin. It's your favorite quarterback, it's favorite quarterback, Chase Griffin. When you look at it as an empowerment equity opportunity, it's really been unmatched in the sports world for any point in time since Title IX. Better a scope. After hardly a full year of name image and likeness deals being a reality, he already has more than 20 deals with major brands, venture and charitable groups. All the while bouncing, graduating undergrad in just two years and fighting for playing time on the field. Chase Griffin out of the gun. We are joined by UCLA quarterback Chase Griffin, not just UCLA quarterback, but name image likeness superstar. I am sacked for this one. This kid could actually be the president of the United States someday. Chase isn't the starting quarterback for UCLA. He's not even the backup quarterback. But back on campus in LA, his nickname is president Chase. And after spending a couple days talking about his approach to business, sports and equality, it's not shocking to think he might someday hold that office. His level of focus and maturity at this stage. I only wish I had. If you want to buy stock and human being, buy stock and Chase Griffin. When it comes to building generational wealth, it's not about the money that you make in college. I'm very excited that I made the amount of money that I made last year. I am even 10 times more excited that I know how to make that money. Somewhere on any college campuses, mostly for the athlete, tour on lighter, but still regimented schedules. The tendon classes working out, a little bit of hanging out, and then more working out on their own time. Chase is no exception. The 21-year-old is a backup, albeit an impatient one. In the topsy-turvy past couple of seasons dotted with family games and COVID protocols, he's been able to start three games for the Bruins. Griffin, gonna throw to the end zone. Wide open again, touchdown UCLA. Beating Arizona and narrowly losing to both Stanford and Oregon. That was inches away from Chase Griffin and UCLA being in cold, fledged, come backbone. For Chase, UCLA felt like destiny. He was born just a few miles away before his family moved to Texas when he was a toddler. But beyond being a sort of homecoming, the school's history of athlete activism was a massive draw. I always expected from myself to have some sort of impact, that was beneficial for more people than I interact with on a daily basis. And choosing UCLA, a lot of that went into me seeing myself as someone who reflected the same want to make things better, that so many of the people that UCLA prides itself upon be in the home for have done in the past. The legacies of former UCLA greats like Arthur Ash, Jackie Robinson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Jackie Joyner Cursey have had a wide ranging impact on society well beyond the Westwood campus. Chase reveres these people, but he's perhaps most keenly aware of the activism of a more recent Bruin alum, the basketball player Ed O'Bannon. Ed O'Bannon, who was an ace-meth player of the year National Channel, UCLA Sports Legend is also a legal hero. I think NIO could be the next installment where we look back in 30, 40, 50 years and God willing, if we give him the roses he deserves, we add Ed O'Bannon to that list of UCLA greats. O'Bannon, who played at UCLA from 91 to 95, initiated a lawsuit that's widely credited for finally opening up the possibility of college athletes being paid for use of their name image and likeness. He sued the NCAA in video game publisher EA for anti-trust violation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1031,2022-10-09 03:07:28
12806," opening up the possibility of college athletes being paid for use of their name, image and likeness. He sued the NCAA in video game publisher EA for anti-trust violations, arguing that athletes should be entitled to financial compensation when schools use their likeness for game. In 2014, a judge ruled in his favor. I don't think he was congratulating what was your call. And then, on an episode of the shop, surrounded by O'Bannon, Diana Tarrasse and LeBron James, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed the first ultimately successful legislation to allow athletes to receive endorsement deals. The Fair Pay to Play Act led other states to follow suit and ultimately led the NCAA in 2021 to relent, seemingly reluctantly. NIL payments were officially allowed as of July 1st, 2021. Today is the last day where name, image and likeness laws will not be on the books and kids will not be, if you will, not allowed to make money off of their name, image and likeness. Making money from Jersey sales and endorsement deals is a way for players to share in the massively lucrative world of college athletics. This NIL thing is the wild, wild west. The NIL change felt like many things that happened very slowly and then it happened very fast. And I wonder for you having contemplated that maybe this was coming at some point, how prepared were you? What was your mindset when the switch flipped? Right. I mean, I still think everyone's trying to get prepared for the industry. It's still sort of like a wild, wild west. I wasn't really expecting anything. I was more just thinking about honestly getting ready for that season and capitalizing on everything that was happening. When NIL hit and it turned out I had action, I was like, oh, okay, well, after this degree deal, which was fantastic, I was like, okay, I see how I can be a staple in this game and I see how I can get better over time. That's why I teamed up with my friends at Shell. I'm named Shell Dale Hit and then boost my old Dale Hit. Then you keep on building clear coverage. Like you keep on building and you get better in the meetings. And most of all, you start seeing where your value can be best placed in these new opportunities. The headlines and storylines in the aftermath of the NIL change introduced visions of instant millionaire strolling campuses across the nation. You might think the NIL athlete of the year lives in Splendor or at least in one of those athletic palaces that put most of our couch dorms to shame. Well, it's all relative to chase. All right, Jason. So here we are, World Headquarters. Yep. This is where it all happens. I live the kitchen right here. I actually really enjoy cooking. Oh, yeah. Yeah, this gas oven gets really hot really fast. I make pizzas in there. This is the best appliance since the iPhone. If I already put anything in there, I need to do these dishes right here. So no trappings of success yet. More a pretty average college dorm room. The fridge filled with leftovers, a well-used PS4. And of course, the requisite Godfather poster. It's a far cry from the lifestyle seen in some local news reports for NIL athletes during this first year. These are Robinson made headlines with an NIL deal with Lamborghini Austin. Lamborghinis tend to make more headlines than Muhammad Ali are Bruce Lee pictures. Some athletes are living in mansions driving Lamborghinis. As far as I know, you're doing either of those things. I see where you're living right here. It is with Alder respect, not a mansion. How much of that is a conscious choice? And what does it say about your approach to this? Right. I mean, first off, I look at this as my own room, the guy, everything I need. I'm cool with that. I'm cool with living below my means. I think it's important to remember that the volume of financial gain is completely overstated. And that's what it y'all is for in the media. Yeah. And someone hears about a five million or ten million dollar deal. You've got to report it. Like, oh my goodness, people are going to read this. Hey, I count two things. Like, how many kids are even getting these deals? And then for the kids that do get it, how much of that is in liquid cash and how much of it is in acid.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1032,2022-10-09 03:11:55
12807," Read this. Hey, I'd count two things. Like, how many kids are even getting these deals? And then for the kids that do get it, how much of that is in liquor cash? And how much of it is in assets? If you pay for a $2 million house out here in LA for a kid to stay in college, that's great. But as soon as they're graduated, they're not gonna have that $2 million house. I say the same thing, you know, for the kids who are driving around in Lamborghini's and stuff like that. That's awesome. That's super dope. And I know some of those kids. But, you know, someone paying for your lease is different than someone actually giving you the value of that lease every single month, you're investing in it, saving it for a long time, et cetera. I say all that just to mention that product deals and stuff like that are overhyped by the media. And they also can land kids in some trouble if they're not paying taxes on it. That's one of the distinctly unsexy and easy to overlook elements of the new rules. Even if an athlete's not getting cold hard cash from a deal, the value of any products given are subject to state and federal taxes. So suddenly, what a player sees as free gear in return for some social media posts actually equals taxable income. And that requires the same forms you'd fill out as an independent contractor getting a check. I made a fair amount in NIO deals and I invested all of it. In my opinion, NIO is great. Doing all this is great, making money now is great. But the most valuable thing I've gotten from all of this is, in the fact, I'll always know how to make money off of myself. All told, Chase has done more than 20 deals with major brands like Degree, Shell, and Boost Mobile, along with venture-stage companies, including Discord, Duffel, and Creative Juice. He's also made a point to work with charities like the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, where he's already raised funds for almost 60,000 meals. It is crucially important. And I think we've moved from this attitude, from its indulgence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s. And so it makes it a really exciting field, because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harnessed to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize sleep. That makes you smart. If you can spit back a lot of facts. But if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information.

12808," Weekdays at 5 p.m. in New York and 2 p.m. in San Francisco. This is a song by Javion. I heard the opening. I just took that opening and I pitched it slow. I think I sped it. At his desk when he's not making music, another side project, he's either networking with CEOs or investors he seeks out or who seek him out or negotiating new deals. Hey Mallory. I'll show you how you do it. I'm doing well. I'm turning on my camera right now. You have no worries. This is an average NIL deal. A brand approaches an athlete who can help spread their message to a demographic they believe the athlete can help reach. In this case, direct TV is looking to market their NFL Sunday ticket to college students. If the two posts, one post late August and one post on the first week of September and the compensation would be 1200 per post. So it would be 800 total. Are they video posts or are they picking captions? They can be either. It's up to you guys. That was pretty good. 400 above, but they had originally asked. That's a win. So yeah, I mean, at this point after I do a Zoom or something like that, I get the chill out, go back to land down if I was watching a movie or something or go to YouTube to start looking for more samples. It's a pretty simple interaction for Chase and for direct TV. He's been associated over a couple of emails and Zoom calls and papered with a contract Chase will have his dad look over before he signs. And Chase, who's made himself as much of a student of the new NIL marketplace as he has a public policy at UCLA, says he understands why it's working. And a brand ambassador with ship with an athlete is more attractive to these brands now as well as a terminal investment than even a post by a famous actor. If there's any place to learn that sports are deep in the hearts of Americans, it's on a high school football field in Texas. Friday night lights in the Lone Star State might be the great iron equivalent of Frank Sinatra's New York City, making it there means you're something special. Chase Griffin quarterback class 19, Hado Texas. And Chase didn't just make it. He excelled. Let's talk about some of the top quarterbacks into state. And when you look at that list at the top of it, you got to talk about Chase Griffin. I was lucky to play three years as a quarterback for Hado High School, which is a one horse town. We have great success. And so the town really shut down and came out and supported us every Friday night. Chase, one word to describe that finish that game. God, that's it. Coming from a town like that where football is so prioritized has its pros and cons. But I think on the pros side, I learned how to win, how to get better. And most importantly, what it's like to build a team where everyone gets better. Emulating his UCLA alumni like Robinson, Joyner Cursey and Abdul Jbar, Chase is looking at the impact NIL will have not just for him, but the athletes that will follow. When the predecessors who have come before you have changed the world and made life better for everyone today, you can't help but ask yourself how the actions that you have made better for everyone today. You can't help but ask yourself how the actions that you are taking out and the companies and brands and the NIL space that you work with are all cumulatively building something greater than any of us could foresee.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1034,2022-10-09 03:20:24
12809," I have space that you work with are all cumulatively building something greater than any of us could foresee. I've actually, I've never moderated. So this will be my first time. It should be fun. I know my handwriting's terrible. The last day the conference chase was asked to co-moderate a panel with Monique Nelson, the CEO for UNI World Group. All right, I'm excited to be here. UNI World Group is one of the longest standing multicultural advertising and marketing agencies in the United States. The firm works with brands like Ford, Home Depot, and Johnson & Johnson to help reach the black and brown communities. And they have big ambitions in NIL. For UNI World Group, the idea of this was pretty epic in that because we serve the undervalued, overlooked, and the underserved. We knew that this particular group of people would fall into that category. And we plan on being the premier practice for NIL athletes that are looking to do purpose-driven, media, advertising, community level engagement work. UWG launched a program called The NIL to help black student athletes partner with major brands. But to help them understand how to do that, they brought on chase to serve as a student athlete executive in residence. For me, I do nothing without tremendous amounts of data for all of our clients. I really wanted to be thoughtful about this practice being very athlete-centric. If I were to build it or anyone on my team were to build it, it would not have the athlete at the core. When you're 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, the best way to have credibility is confidence. And the only way for confidence to be authentic. I'm actually learning on the job. I'm learning about the brand side of NIL, but I'm also trying to make sure that empowerment equity is built in, especially for black student athletes in the NIL world. ROI. Return on investment. Both Chase and UWG see NIL deals as something much more than making money for students. It's also a potential investment in a community long overlooked. Think we're getting ready to stop boxes trying to feed the people of L.A. A piece of each of Chase's NIL deals go to his belief brand campaign, which has raised more than $13,000 for meals for the L.A. Food Bank backpack program. But athletes giving back is only one side. I'm here with legal zoom to give you five tips on the NIL game plan. UWG and Chase believe having brands investing in the athletes, especially athletes of color, can be a force multiplier for these historically marginalized communities. When you look at the revenue, J.A. and rating sports for the bomb estimate, 88% of those athletes are black. So when you're doing stuff to empower student athletes in the NIL space, you're also helping to deliver on your promise. Now student athletes are not the only ones who should receive this help by any means. But statistically, by doing that, you're going to be delivering on your mission. Additionally, student athletes on average come from lower levels of income. So you're also delivering on that promise. And a lot of these student athletes are first generation, their first gen college students. Some of them first gen high school diploma. Some of them first time receiving the amount of money that they receive in their families. This has been a wild first year in NIL. We all knew that there would be bags of cash around, right? There's always been bags of cash. There's cash everywhere. What we know is that that's not sustainable. We know that athletics has an expiration date on it. So for us, inclusion ultimately means this is just a part of you. It is a tremendous part of you and we're going to celebrate that part of you. But we also know that you're bigger than that. So we want to empower you to live past your expiration date for this part of your life. And quite honestly, have equity in everything that you have poured yourself into as an NIL athlete.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1035,2022-10-09 03:24:46
12810," It's your expiration date for this part of your life and quite honestly have equity in everything that you have poured yourself into as an NIL athlete. It may still be the Wild West days for the NIL industry, but in the first year, about a billion dollars in business was done with NCAA athletes. For the early leaders in the NIL space like Chase, they're striking a precedent for athletes that follow them. And that's important because collegiate athletes don't have that much time to profit. Only an estimated 2% of NCAA athletes go on to the pros. Even the hardest working are often limited by things they can't control. For Chase, it's been his height. I'm 5'10 now in high school after my sophomore year went up through for 3,000 yards. I was probably like 5'6"", 5'5"". I mean, I get arguably say I'm one of the best in the history of Texas high school football. But you know, I've gone through the height test where they'll call you out of class, shake your hand, look at you up and down. And be like nice to meet you, you go back to class. It's a sad but timeless story for student athletes. And for Chase, his story is something he's not chied away from, but embraced when it comes to his NIL deals. I'm frequently the smallest person on the football field, but I always strive to be the most impactful. My middle school coach taught me that I would never play in high school. Chase's deals with degrees breaking limits team and clear covers inspired underdogs allowed him to capitalize financially from football. Even the last season, he never saw the field for UCLA. I play football because I love a game. I play the football because I'm a good competitor. I love to compete and I play football because I'm good at it. At the end of the day, I don't play football for my livelihood, which is important to remember when it comes down to identity. I myself, Chase Griffin, as long as I'm that, I got something in this world. As he moves into the new season and focuses more on football than business, Chase doesn't seem much of a differentiation between the two in terms of his mindset. I wouldn't be surprised if I wasn't playing football in five years and it was running in Fortune 500 company, but I also wouldn't be surprised if I was winning a Super Bowl five, ten years from now. And either way, I'm going to keep on working at the tools that would align myself and my future with both. At the end of the day, you're always going to have yourself. If you can make profit off of yourself and know where you add value, in any world you're in, you'll be able to adapt and find ways to generate wealth through yourself. Part of what I love about business is you get to build things from nothing. I don't have any investors. All this is all money and this is me just building it. It's pretty much full service shadow banking with nobody in charge. And you're one of the most fascinating entrepreneurs because you all started with the young. What did you learn? Did you always think that you'd be an entrepreneur? Probably, yes. I think, which is a bit sad. From age what? Five? I'm not sure. I come from a family of entrepreneurs, so even I probably can spell the word and still can't do it. It's sort of in my blood. It's really fun starting a business.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1036,2022-10-09 03:29:04
12811," I come from a family of entrepreneurs, so even I probably can spell the word and still can't do it. It's sort of in my blood. But it's, it's, it's, it's really fun starting your business. It's, and fun growing your business. I feel it's a real privilege. And I started my business officially at 18, but I think I knew I wanted to do it very differently from about 15. But I'm sure it's, you know, you, if you're surrounded by it, it feels very natural. So, um, so yes, it's, it's fun. And it started how you started by making, you went to Florence. It was an Italy and you started handbags. Yeah. So I, I knew I was actually given a handbag by my mother when I was about 61 of her old handbags. And I remember how it made me feel. And I think fashion is fascinating for the mood changing, the confidence boosting aspects. And there's a tribal aspects of what fashion does. And so I went at 18 to Florence knowing that was the home of, of, of, of Leatherguss, which is what interested me. I just wanted to learn actually, and be surrounded by craftsmen who are making things as important. And that's going to be very interesting, I think, over the next sort of 10 years. I think the on-shoring of craft and manufacturing is going to be fascinating. Actually, I mean, I watched the off-shoring and literally saw it. And I think we're going to be seeing that coming back to local. We have to. When we're all looking at our objectives in terms of carbon, you know, proximity is going to be key. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. Let's just be honest. We've had sort of a shift in our, we had some sort of circulation fears moment. People were talking about that all day yesterday. We will never break. We will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never break. Have a wide array of things and the mountains shake. All of them remain. We will never. Don't have we will never. No. Today is the most significant day in the history of the NCAA. The last day on planet earth in the United States of America in college athletics where name, image, and likeness laws will not be on the books and kids will be not allowed to make money off of their name, image, and likeness. Today's the last day that amateurism has at least a shadow meaning in our culture. The most seismic change in college sports happened in 2021 and its aftershocks are still ricocheting across the landscape. Non pro athletes getting paid for use of their name, image, and likeness until last year banned by the NCAA is now allowed and it's changing the face of sports and business radically. According to open and doors, brands spent almost a billion dollars in the first year of the new rules and that number is only going to grow. But some of the biggest winners, they may surprise you. Top female athletes are caching in and women's basketball players are standing center stage. Your heels, you want your heels to go down. You took a pre-ride poop. NIO really is pretty surreal. I don't think I've really wrapped my head around the concept that I am making money just doing the thing that I love. In her sophomore year, AZ Fudds already signed deals with Chipotle.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1037,2022-10-09 03:33:23
12812," Just doing the thing that I love. Starting her sophomore year, Aisy Fudds already signed deals with Chipotle, American Eagle and others, earning tens of thousands of dollars, leveraging her on-court prowess, and off-court social media following. She's also getting massive investment from the pro game as well, becoming one of the first athletes to sign with Steph Curry's SC30 Inc. The two even designed a shoot together. One Steph Curry would wear during his 2021 NBA Finals MVP performance. It's an investment directly into a future player, but also the future of women's basketball. And especially for the women's game, NIL deals may not only benefit the students, but the pro game as well. What I'm gonna call Carly knows everything. Hey, hi Carly. I have my TV mounted on the wall in my room, and I'm wondering if I'm moving back into the same room. Can I just take the TV off and leave the mound? Kind of all the little things that I said I have too much of. Um, AZFUD can almost trick you into thinking she's just a regular college student. You can't judge me by what you see here today. We just finished our summer session, so I'm about to move out. I got to completely move out to remove in the exact same apartment. Sorry to stress me out. I gotta carry this back. Who's gonna help you move all the big stuff now? Oh, well, you see, I leave tomorrow. So I will. Oh, be probably playing at all nighter, but not if my mom is watching this. I will be going to sleep early and getting my rest. Don't let a messy dorm room and procrastination fool you, though. It's very clear, very quick, that there is nothing ordinary about her. FUD was the class of 2021's number one consensus recruit while she was playing for St. John's College High School out of DC. Now she's playing for one of the most storied and winning programs in any sporting history, the University of Connecticut Huskies. The National Championship goes to Connecticut for the fourth year in a row, as the dynasty fulfills its destiny. Winners of 11 national championships, producers of Olympians, and multiple WNBA MVP's. But AZ has something that the trailblazing women of UConn's past never had, the opportunity to not only play basketball, but get paid for it. I remember just learning that you could profit off of your name and brand, and I could profit off of AZ, the basketball player, not just AZ, the person, which I didn't really understand why you couldn't, because at least for me, AZ, the basketball player is also AZ, the person, like basketball is such a huge role in my life that I didn't understand why I wouldn't be able to profit from it. It's a board and I understand exactly what made this all possible. In 2021, after decades of debate, lawsuits, and legislation, the NCAA, prompted by a unanimous ruling by the Supreme Court, finally relented on one of its longest standing strictures, that athletes could not in any way be compensated beyond scholarships and small stipends from their schools. It would only take a few months before AZ, a freshman at the time, would sign her first major deal with Chipotle. Before the freshman even got to play a game for the Huskies, she angst her first NIL deal as a college athlete ambassador for the magnificent Mexican restaurant chain. You are on the leading edge of something that feels, for those of us who've been looking at sports for a long time, like a very meaningful moment in sports. Like the economics are changing, the role of sports in society is changing. We see that from the outside. You're inside it. Does it feel momentous to you? You can tell how important it is, but at the same time, this is all I know in college basso, it's NIL. So I'm still trying to find my way in it, find my groove and stuff. But I know how important it is, and the people before me paved the way and set that path for me to be able to do this, and how important it is for me to be able to take advantage of this, and be able to continue this on for that piece of time.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1038,2022-10-09 03:37:56
12813," Like the people before me paved the way and set that path for me to be able to do this and how important it is for me to be able to take advantage of this and be able to continue this on for the athletes to come. While colleges and universities still can't directly come and say their athletes, those athletes can legally be paid by third parties who want to use their name, image and likeness or NIL. AZ, advised closely by a team led by her parents and her agents, has created a portfolio anchored by relationships with Chipotle, American Eagle, sports drink, bio steel and SC30. Brands she already admired as a successful athlete and American teenager. I've been lucky that the deals that I've been approached with have been things that have been really good and things that I've liked. American Eagle is one of my favorite brands, I always wear their jeans so it's one of the easiest transitions type things. Bio steel was something that I hadn't tried before and once I did I really liked it. On the basketball side, it's impossible to be on Yukon's campus and not feel the weight of history, especially when you see where the team works out. Officially called the Worth Family Yukon Basketball Champion Center, it's a 78,200 square foot complex that costs $40 million. It's most striking feature, it's split right down the middle between men's and women's basketball. Seemingly identical when you walk in except while the men's team boasts four national championships, the women's side has more than double that. And that actually understates their dominance, the team has gone undefeated in six seasons and its players have been staples on the US Olympic team. Suburred and Diana Tarrassee are only the latest in the line of superstars that began in the early 1990s with Rebecca Lobo. The Huskies have featured 12 AP national players of the year including Lobo, Maya Moore, Twice, Rihanna Stewart, three times, and most recently Paige Becker's will get to her in a minute. Hydrogen has a very special place in the universe. It's the first element on the periodic table. It is the most abandoned element in the universe. And when clean energy advocates think about what can we find which would be as easy to use as fossil fuels they think about hydrogen. The fuel that will when burn only produce water. We like to imagine that if we just built enough of these and these we could ditch fossil fuels and save the planet. Unfortunately it's not that simple. There are some things we just need a good old fashioned combustible fuel. Now startups around the world are betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century.

12814," as like overwhelming kind of pressure to live up to the standards. But I use it kind of as motivation. This is our UConn program. Like there's no need to compare ourselves to the past. Like we're not those players that we see on the wall. We're different players. Like I'm A.C. I'm not super. We need to forge our own path and our own story in the UConn books. Bobo goes to work in the land and a beautiful... Those former UConn stars helped to establish the UConn team as a product to watch. Over the last decade, meteorites moved from Connecticut public television to SNY and now include Fox Sports. With game coverage mixed with behind-the-scenes documentaries, UConn has become one of the biggest platforms for women's basketball. The UConn women's team is so well known that at the moment, it's arguably a better platform than most, if not all, of the professional women's teams or even the WNBA overall. Well, I don't think there's any creator, female sports collegiate brand than UConn women's basketball. That's on TV, you can follow those athletes. In a way that if you're in parent to the WNBA, you don't always get consistency of coverage, local or international markets. You're not always able to follow those athletes. It feels so nice to be back. This is Angela Lergero. She's a former hockey player and four-time Olympian. She now runs Sports Innovation Lab. That's a Boston-based company that uses data science to help teams and leagues understand their fans and figure out how to better engage them. The future of sports really is how do you optimize and drive revenue in these digital spaces, these digital communities? So collegiate athletes are, I think, are going to really benefit from the change in the NIL ecosystem because they're authentically themselves. They're using these platforms already and they're being entertainers. I'm not sure how to work this. I think it's recording. Fans of women's sports and female athletes want more authenticity. These fans are dying. For not just the game and the stats and the scores, they want to know what you're doing 24-7. They want to know what these female athletes think. What are they wearing? What are they dating? What do they care about? What are their causes? And that's going to build a wave of support when those athletes graduate that they'll hopefully bring to those WNBA teams. I think that this is really an incredible opportunity for me and all of women's basketball to be able to benefit. And it's sad knowing that this is kind of our most profitable age. So I think that that's also an important part of being able to use NIL now before going pro. The world away from us. I can't let it go. I can't let it go. But dance videos and homemade toastinos ads can only take that mission so far. AZ knows that success on the court comes first and will allow everything else to follow. And while Yukon has had a storied history, their last championship was way back in 2016. Lucky for her, she's playing with not only just a good friend and dance partner, but the best college player in the country, Paige Becker's. Paige Bucket's Becker's is also one of the biggest college students when it comes to NIL deals, striking the first NCAA athlete deal with Gatorade, as well as partnerships with StockX and Cash App. And she has been estimated to potentially bring in a million dollars in NIL deals. We do a lot of teaming too, but for some horse riding. Yes. This is my first one involving a live animal. During the last week of official summer workouts, AZ, Paige and their teammates finished their last session and went over to Yukon's horse barn for some team bonding. Oh, I'm so proud of you. I have an extra large. So when you're working with the horse, as you want to try to stay calm and relaxed, you're going to make him anxious. I'm sorry. The typical day in stores can pick it. So we deal and we don't play basketball. Peasants. So well. It was a light moment before everyone went off to hang with their families and get rested up for the season.

12815," before it even started. You conwomen's basketball junior guard, Paige Becker's suffered a torn ACL in her left knee and will miss the 2022-23 season. It's an injury, AZ knows all too well, having gone through her own ACL tear in 2019. While Paige's absence will test the team's depth and metal, what was on display in stores and apparent in conversations with AZ was that she and Becker's were intent on using their increasingly higher profiles, not just to benefit themselves, but their entire team. Bra paint. Now you, Danny. How did you feel sweet? I'm so excited. In AZ's case, that means freech of Pope leg. Thank you. I thought it was. Both AZ and Paige are conscious of the inequality that still exists in NIL. While the players in this room share the benefit of playing at Yukon, not all can or will get the deals AZ and Paige have already signed. So far as the first, since I catered. People outside of your world have actually doing it speculated about the consequences and maybe some of the unintended consequences of NIL, you think, well, the really prominent players like you are going to benefit and then other players are not. And so maybe there's some jealousy or envy or whatever. How do you make sure that it doesn't? We were very tight. We're a super close group. I mean, you've been to stores or not. There's not much else to do besides play basketball and hang out with each other. And I think it also is because that whatever deals we get, you share with each other. So I have a deal with Chipotle and my whole team. Whenever they watch Chipotle, they let me know. We're American Eagle. They can get whatever they want. I think it goes both ways with whatever deals. Other people have that we're super open. Always willing to share. I think I'm posting an answer around about this. This would be the last team meal for AZ before going on summer break. And when we next caught up with her, it would be about as far from a dorm room in stores that you could possibly get. AZ's out in LA this week to do a commercial shoot for a new underarmer shoot alongside both Steph and Seth Curry. Along with her is her family, including her former coaches and current business screens, her mom and dad. We make sure that one of us is at everything that she does, just to give her that support. So I've been at a lot of them. Still blows my mind like, okay, well, you look really cute in that outfit, but it just doesn't really, I don't know, sink in that she's this public figure for lack of a better word. The partnership with Curry is both historic and important well beyond the deal itself. AZ was the first woman and the first college athlete to join the SC30 brand and has developed a friendship with Curry. She fully concedes to initially being a bit star-struck.

12816," That's kind of crazy. I mean, I try to keep my cool when I'm working out with him and then like with Seth and Seth on set, but in my head I'm going a little bit crazy. Yeah. I first met him at Curry Camp right after my freshman year in high school. I got invited. I was one of the first two girls invited to camp and then I was invited the next year as well and then Curry Brand reached out to my agent, my group, and they let me know and I was all for it. I'm working out with someone that I look up to and someone that inspires me so getting to see firsthand like him in action, like what he does behind the scenes. Like I get to challenge myself and compete a little bit with him. It's amazing. Shooting ads for unreleased apparel isn't something cameras were welcome into, but Aze is also in LA for basketball, getting private workouts with Steph Curry's own trainer, Carl Bergstrom. Aze has also been a part of Curry Camps, including this past summer in San Francisco. She also helped design a shoe for the SC30 line, the Curry himself wore in an NBA finals game this past season. The 2022 Bill Russell NBA finals MVP award goes to Steph in Curry. Did you know that on average women have 30% less income for retirement? The IA was one of the first brands where I kind of got to use my platform to speak out about like Title IX and retirement equality. I think that's definitely something that I still want to continue to do, but that was big for me because I'm still trying to figure out what I stand for and what I support and things I want to be able to support. She's got to formulate her own understanding and opinion about life. We all have our own perspectives and that's what makes us all unique. We all have our own opinions and experiences and I'm just proud that she found the level of comfort to be able to speak on something that she had no idea existed. I didn't know existed. Retirement inequality women retired with 30% less income and retirement than men. I didn't know that was a thing and I think from being a girl dad having her come along has awakened my senses to things that my wife has experienced as a player that I've seen first hand being a girl's basketball coach that the girls endure. It's been pretty tremendous honestly. And as a fellow girl dad, crazy involvement with an equality campaign was notable, but not surprising for AZ, who said she was drawn to his brand as much for his off-the-court persona as his championship pedigree. He is a very big family man. You can see that with his kids with his wife and I'm huge with my family. Like I do everything with them. They're with me here on this trip. So I think the family aspect was huge and just kind of his personality like he welcomed me in right away even when I was at camp. He made me feel part of that group and special. Just being here, like I feel like I'm really part of this part of this brand, part of this team, part of the Curry family and I could be more grateful. Kobe Bryant forever, of course, remember, does an NBA legend and rightfully so, but it's a father of four daughters. Curry's also filled a void that AZ and others thought might be left empty after Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gigi died tragically in helicopter crash in 2020. Brian had been arguably the biggest advocate in the world for the women's game and without him it was unclear who would carry that torch. That was kind of a big question when Kobe died. It was like who was going to step up and continue to help fight for women's basketball and help kind of raise the game. And I think Steph is doing a really good job of trying to invite a women to his KM and little things like that that are helping elevate the women's game and this deal is incredible being not just the first NIL, the own college athlete but also the first female scientist was brand. I don't even really know what word to use to describe that feeling when I first signed it and being here now like it means so much. AZ's connection to and reliance on her own family was on full display in LA. She'd come to the West Coast with her mom, dad and two younger brothers and her success as a burgeoning business provides some fun perks. On trips like this, I love just watching my parents reaction because they've been in the game, they've always played in college and they play professionally.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1042,2022-10-09 03:55:13
12817," Some fun perks on trips like this. I love just watching my parents reaction because they've been in the game. They've always played in college and they play professionally. So seeing their reaction to kind of where I am, it's just really funny. I mean, like my dad loves being around all these NBA players. My mom loves seeing all these high level workouts. So I was seeing like them happy. It's really fun. A C's parents both played Division 1 basketball in college and coached her throughout her youth, which she credits made her the way she is. Even if sometimes it's not so easy to grow up with two coaches for parents. Part of the reason that I am the way I am is because they didn't really compliment much. So I always had something to work on. I was always working hard. I think they did a very good job. Obviously, my playing really bad. I would hear about that, but they did a really good job of separating mom and dad from coach. Yeah. Like I remember when I was younger, my dad would take me off to get ice cream and some after games. That was something when we started coaching and we were very cognizant of not having that coach role carry over. I harbor things a little more. So sometimes they'd go get ice cream and I'd be like, yeah, she's soft. Why are you getting ice cream? It wasn't the ice cream. But then he really likes ice cream too. So when I started the coach, I definitely did not want to have that contentious relationship at all. And so the ice cream thing became a reminder to me. It's a treat to like now I get to go back and be dead. Katie Fudd played at NC State and then Georgetown in the late 1990s. As women's basketball was starting to gain a bit of traction and the WNBA was in its form of years. She had to deal with inequalities that she never wanted her daughter to face. When it came time for AZ to pick a school, her mom had a big influence. When AZ was getting recruited, I felt very strongly about what is the culture. When I was at Georgetown, it was kind of a men's basketball program and not really much else. It's evolved since then. But in our practice time was limited on the court based on when the men practiced or you know it was just it was just all based around the men. So there's a lot of schools that she was looking at where they they had some storied men's programs. But how do the players interact? How does you know what's the culture on the campus like? Let's make sure that we're we're doing the right thing by by both the men's and the women's program. AZ's parents were able to go from being her coaches to fans in the stands but now have evolved into her advisory board on her branding deals. I think we spent the better part of the pandemic on seminars and YouTube and listening talk I probably have a four-year degree and I have a cell phone NIL just because they just make it sure we understood it as well as we could to help her but also connecting with the right people. I think the fact that we have such a great relationship with our she trusts us implicitly like we're not going to put her in a situation that one she doesn't support the company or doesn't you know it too wants authentic stuff and then we're not going to put her in a situation that just isn't isn't good for her. As the new season starts AZ's NIL deals existing in new will be in the background. Expectations are always high at Yukon and even more attention will be on her given Becker's injury. While new NIL opportunities grab headlines and attention AZ has a clear focus on what to have. How do you raise your NIL game? How do you grow it in a way that's authentically easy? I think now that I have my first year kind of under my belt I have established my brand with all these other people but I think I need to be able to kind of like establish my own brand more like the AZ brand and like post about myself more as well but I think just knowing that what your priorities are that my priorities right now are basketball and school because without good grades will be able to play and without basketball I wouldn't have these opportunities in these deals.

12818," Possibilities. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. So what happens is that we create some icons and call them tags and they have a signal within them. When you stare at that, your eye responds to it in a particular way. The way in which that eye response occurs is a signal that we pick up on the visual cortex of the brain at the back of the brain. The sensor is looking for the signals we create here that come through the eyeball, through the brain and then onto the visual cortex. Once we've got it there as a signal, we can grab that, we understand what that signal looks like and we can turn that into a command or whatever we're trying to control. There's multiple places where we think this technology could be applied, perhaps in, I don't know, driving or commanding, and then ground vehicles or unmanned naval vessels, perhaps providing a menu selection and control within a control room environment, maybe an innu clear power station, all those kind of things are perhaps in the baguette of this technology. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the road today won't electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building's across America burn fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the all electric, we want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels, we want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. As fall sets in, a decided turn in the air for the new British government's designs for the economy for Elon Musk's designs on Twitter and most decidedly for Mr. Putin's designs on Ukraine. This is Bloomberg Wall Street week. I'm David West. This week's Special Contributor Larry Summers on whether the jobs market is starting to show some signs of loosening. I think we are headed for a collision of some kind or other. And we've just got to manage that collision carefully. And Brad DeLong of Berkeley on what the broad sweep of economic history may be telling us about where we are headed next. People say that the United States has very little to teach them that we don't have any greater grasp on how to deploy and use these technologies to create a good society. We had our fair share of about faces this week with the Bank of England's quick intervention to save the guilt market as explained by former MPC member Kristen Forbes of MIT. It seems that they are worried that because of the big market moves, there could be some margin calls, some pressures for force selling that could cause the guilt market to freeze up. And British Prime Minister Liz Truss giving up at least part of her economic program. It was becoming a distraction. That's why we immediately changed that policy and that's the kind of government we are. But as ugly as the situation was in UK markets, it was nothing compared with the setbacks for Russian forces in eastern and southern Ukraine. With President Putin's efforts to quote Annex territory that his forces didn't even control. Which Admiral John Kirby of the NSC looks at as an indication that Mr. Putin just may be.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1044,2022-10-09 04:03:39
12819," Putin's efforts to quote Annex territory that his forces didn't even control, which Admiral John Kirby of the NSC looks at as an indication that Mr. Putin just may be coming to understand how difficult his situation really is. The Annexation Announcements, as well as his announcement of partial mobilization, certainly shows the degree to which Mr. Putin knows how much he's struggling inside Ukraine. And OPEC plus weighed in with its own changes. The cutting production caps by 2 million barrels a day, or about 7 percent, putting even more pressure on Europe and the rest of the world already worried about energy. Well, we were disappointed that OPEC made this decision. As the president mentioned, we think it's unnecessary if you look at the global environment where supply continues to be the predominant challenge. Then there's Elon Musk. He offered $44 billion for Twitter back in April, then decided to re-nig. He did not sued, and on the eve of his deposition returned to his original offer. Even it looks like he's going to be way overpaying. In many ways, this is almost the most expected outcome of all, which is settling on the eve of trial just before deposition of the main players, Elon Musk himself. He doesn't want to be deposed. He has probably some embarrassing text messages and conflicting statements, and all of that would make for a very unpleasant deposition. But after all the back and forth this week, US jobs numbers actually came in surprisingly on course, adding 263,000 new jobs just slightly more than expected, with workers paid 5 percent more than they were last year. In a reduction in the unemployment rate, to 3.5 percent, which made for a rough day in equities on Friday, but actually a pretty good week overall for equities, for the S&P 500 adding 1.5 percent to end the week at 3639, and the NASDAQ eaked out a gain of 3.4 percent. Elon Musk also had a topsy-turvy week, but ended up with the 10-year yield of a relatively modest 5-basis points to 3.88. Here to walk us through this week and what got us here are Aaron Brown, portfolio manager at PIMCO, and Chris Ellman, chief investment officer at CalSTRS. So Chris, let me start with you. Boy, given what we're seeing right now, are we looking at a long cold winter, would you say? Unfortunately, David, I think we are. I think the Fed, you know, with these employment numbers, the Fed knows that they have to continue this pace of aggressive tightening, and they're going to do so the next week and the next week after that, and I think, which is the street is pricing in, but I think after that, they're going to have to keep it up, and that's going to be into the winter, and it's going to be a tough time. So what do you say, Aaron? Is it going to be a rough winter? I think it is going to be a rough winter. I think that their bands of uncertainty are quite wide for next year. The Fed is tightening into an economic slowdown, and we haven't even seen the real impact of that slowdown yet. We're just starting to see signs of a gradual slowing, but likely we'll continue to see that into next year, and we think that we're heading into a recession into early 2023. And at that same point, just given the level of inflation, the Federal Reserve is now really challenged to be able to arrest that inflation, get it under control, despite what happens to the economy. So I think that really poses a challenge for the Fed, and we'll likely see something that's fairly unprecedented, which has continued financial conditions tightening and Fed tightening into an economic slowdown, even if it really leads to a harder landing than what the Fed's anticipating. And Aaron, I'd push back a little bit. I actually think we're in a recession right now. It's not a very strong one, and it doesn't hurt a lot. I was just with employment growing. But we did have a negative GDP in the second quarter, third quarter is mild. To me, anything below 1% in the USA feels like a recession. But so what you're saying is, you think it's going to be a really, we'll actually have a good traditional hard negative recession with rising unemployment, which is exactly what Powell has said. I mean, that's his forecast. Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, my, our view at PIMCO is that we'll likely see unemployment rise to about 5% by the end of 2023. And so right now we're sort of seeing some of those early signs, but we really haven't seen the full brunt of financial condition tightening yet. That's more to come. So we are going to continue to see us slow down.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1045,2022-10-09 04:08:16
12820," addition tightening yet that's more to come so we are going to continue to see a slowdown and I think that's really going to hit in the first quarter of next year and into the second quarter of 2023. Chris, given where we're out of inflation right now, the concerns about inflation, if we are heading an intersection or even are already in one, matter how long it is or how short it is, what are the tools the Fed has to use because typically you turn to the Fed and say, okay, start cutting interest rates. Doesn't look like they're going to do that in a likelihood. No, they're going to raise interest rates. They only have one tool. They have, well, they have their mouth. They can jawbone the market, which is what they're doing. They have the dot plot, which is going to indicate or direct the market, but they're really the only tool they have is shorter interest rates than the Fed funds rate. And that's what they're using aggressively. I mean, good grief. 75 basis points. Those are big bounces. You know through history. You've got to go way back before you have that aggressive tightening of monetary policy and they have to shrink the balance sheet. So as they move through that, you know, he's already said he's going to hurt employment. Yet we have stronger numbers. I think the numbers, there's something strange in the numbers this week just like last month, but we'll see how that balances out. We're going to have a tougher time. And you know, I think the question is going to be about corporate earnings. You got CPI next week. And then you got the bank starting to roll out with their earnings. Aaron, as the market priced in the diminishment of earnings to this point, corporate earnings? No, I don't think that they have what you've seen since the beginning of the year is equities have de-rated, largely driven by the market multiple. So you've seen the market multiple for the S&P 500, de-rate from about 21 and a half times to about 16 times today. Keep in mind that traditionally in recessions, the market multiple is somewhere between 14 and 16 times. So we're just at the upper end of where we typically are in recessions and we think that you could see a little bit more de-rating from there. That's not really the challenge for the market. The challenge for the market is that when you look at corporate earnings for next year, the market's pricing them to be up 7.5 percent for consensus. Our forward-looking models are expecting them to be down about 9 percent. So that's north of a 15 percent differential versus what the market's pricing for next year and what we think it's likely to be. Also, historically during recessions, earnings fall about 27 percent on average. So there's real downside risks to our forecast and certainly to the market's forecast. And I think that's where you're going to see the real pressure point for the market in early next year. What's driving that is margins. We're at record high margins right now. The street is expecting that margins are going to expand further from here. So we've even higher than and hit new record highs. We've never seen that in a recession before. So I think the market's really mispriced and that's where the pain's going to come from. Aaron, I've got to ask you if we're already down 23 percent so far this year. How much lower do you think we can go? Do you see a support level on the S&P? I think that in a moderate recession, the market probably bottoms out about 30 to 50. There is downside risk if we see further a more severe or harder landing from there. But 30 to 50 is still down about 14 percent. So I do think that there's still room for the market to fall further. Where are you looking for in terms of your estimates? Yeah, no, I agree 3250. But I mean, that's a negative 36 on the year, which is you're like me. We have asset allocation portfolios. Where do you hide in that kind of a negative market? You've got bonds with the rates rising. So you're going to have continued negative returns out of bonds and then a negative 30 out of stocks. That's a rough calendar year. Where do you hide? Well, I think that I think there have been actually market opportunities that have arisen since the start of this year. Cash rate right now, two-year bonds are yielding north of 4 percent. Now that's not a sexy return by any sort of stretch of the imagination. But if you can lock in 4 percent, add a little bit of spread on top of that, an IG corporates that give you an additional 2 percent or so. That's about a 6 percent return over the next couple of years. That's high quality paper that you can invest in. So I wouldn't sort of rule cash out as a-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1046,2022-10-09 04:12:38
12821," About a 6% return over the next couple of years, that's high quality paper that you can invest in. So I wouldn't, you know, sort of rule cash out as an option. I think that that's somewhere where you can hide and really not expect that much volatility and really consistent returns and sort of hide out there until we see the markets bottom and you can start incrementally moving back into risk. But we can't, I think you need to keep in mind as an investor that if the core of your allocation of your portfolio, which is sort of cash and core fixed income, is unstable, then you really can invest in the outer ring asset. So, you know, we really have to stabilize rates in order to move out the risk curve into other asset classes. Right now, cash is a pretty good option. Okay, we're gonna pick up exactly that question. Where do you hide in this environment? When Chris Aylman and Aaron Brown will be staying with us. We're gonna ask for them for some investment advice. We could use it, that's for sure. That's next on Wall Street Week here on Bloomberg. So, what's the best investment advice you've ever been given by anybody? The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance, and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day. And if you keep at it and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's not just interest. It was always said about compound interest returns, compound business returns, compound human returns. They're all very additive because you'll learn every day. And if you keep at it, it's very, very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make? Selling it the wrong time. And they sell when the prices go down? Yes, or not keeping. But people have conviction or they invest for the, if they invest for the right reasons, just keep at it. The facts on unemployment seem clear enough, or at least as clear as that changing social definition ever can be, the situation is getting a little better, but not much. The government announced today that the overall unemployment rate last month was 6.9%. The official unemployment rate has been stuck within a tenth of 7% for six months. And that scarcely represents the massive reduction of unemployment, but at least some folks thought they heard Jimmy Carter promise a year ago. That was Louis Royek-Huy's, our on Wall Street week back in October of 1977, when the unemployment rate was twice what it is today. And we were trying to get it down rather than focusing on inflation, whatever that ends up meaning for employment. And if that seems like a galaxy far, far away, well, maybe that's no accident. The top movie this week back in 1977 was Star Wars. And the top song on the charts was, you got it, the Star Wars theme. Still with us, our Aaron Brown at Pimco, and Chris ailment of Calcester. So Aaron, let me turn to you and pick up on where we were talking just now with Chris, but where you hide, if you're really an asset allocator, you said cash is one alternative. Are there things though that involve at least some risk that you go to, and how much it depends on what you think the recovery is going to look like whenever it comes? So I'm going to flip.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1047,2022-10-09 04:16:41
12822," You said cash is one alternative. Are there things though that involve at least some risk that you go to and how much it depends on what you think the recovery is going to look like whenever it comes? So I'm going to flip that sort of question and answer the second question first, which is unlike prior recessions that we see in very recent history. So think of the global financial crisis or even the pandemic of 2020. I don't think this is going to be a V-shaped recovery. I think this is going to be more of a prolonged sort of stalling of the economy and more of an L-shaped recovery than what we've seen in the past. And the reason for that is because inflation is high and it's likely to persist at high levels, you're not going to come in and see the fed start cutting as the unemployment rises like we've seen in the past. Instead, because the fed is moved from a dual mandate fed to a single mandate fed, really just focus on getting the inflation rate down, you'll likely see, you won't see this sort of immediate relief that we've seen in recent history. And so that does change a little bit the landscape of how you think about investing. Historically, as we start to get closer to what we expect, the bottom level of the S&P 500 to be, we start to scale risk back up, start to move back into equity investments to catch that recovery to the upside. And this time around, I think you have to be a little bit more patient. So instead, what we're really looking at is fixed income investments that we think are going to be able to sort of stand at the test of time, be able to sort of hide out in a safe haven assets. So beyond just looking at cash, we're looking at high quality investment-grade corporates, we're looking at municipalities, municipal bonds, particularly for those who are, can take advantage of the tax advantages, tax advantage bonds. We think offer good value there at a sort of after-tax yield of six and a half percent. In addition, we also like some mortgage agency bonds and structured credit bonds as well. And then sort of high quality equities that are defensive equities, high free cash flow, dividend growth, strong balance sheets. We also think do well in this environment. But it is a sort of challenging time for investors where you have to see more towards fixed income in order to have stability of return as opposed to looking for us to quick snapback in equities. But I posed the question to Chris, because I know he also manages a diversified portfolio. Chris, where are you looking at what type of sort of diversification are you looking at in order to sort of hide out over the next couple of quarters? Aaron, you know, I've got the benefit of being able to go into private security. So I've got a good size real estate portfolio. We have a large private equity portfolio. Sure, it's going to have write downs. But its value is a bit more stable than we see in the public markets. We have a cash position. But the problem is for us, cash is not outperforming inflation. So the old adage cash is trash is still true. We do like a private credit. You were kind of hitting on that that variable rate debt, short term debt with high quality. And I think collateral is going to be key. Because as you said, we're going to have a long, rough winter. So you don't want to be loaning money to everybody. You have to do care about governance. But it is tough in this environment. I mean, if the economy is slowing and inflation is still strong, that's stagflation. And you look back in the 70s, I got to say, I love that suit that Lou had. I don't know where you get that back in the 70s. But I'm stunned by it. But you look back in that time period, returns in the 77 were terrible. There were hard places to it. It was just a very tough time to hide anywhere. So I'm curious though, exactly, about when you go into fixed income. Do you think the price is attractive now in some fixed income, Chris? Well, I agree with Aaron. I'm going to go short. I'm not going to go long fixed income and take duration exposure, short term credits. I mean, you've been holding credit for two to three years, and then it's money good. And as she said, you're going to put it in a spread product. So you pick up a couple of basis points by being in a corporate, you're OK. There's still a lot of money, David, international money that wants to come into this market, non-US rather, that wants to come into the market. You saw it in this week where it suddenly comes rushing in. So.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1048,2022-10-09 04:21:29
12823," David, international money that wants to come into this market, non-US rather, that wants to come into the market. You saw it in this week where suddenly comes rushing in. So I would give the advice to the average investors. You've got a slowly average cost in. You're not going to be able to call the bottom. As much as Aaron, I think there's a support number, it may not hit that at all. And the market's going to just bounce along. And in Aaron's example of an L, an L goes on forever. It's just flat. I hope we don't have to live in a flat recession for years and years. But I think this is going to be a tough market to find any kind of growth opportunities. So you want a protection and a return of your money rather than a return on your money. Aaron, one of the big developments this week was OPEC Plus and what they did. It certainly seemed to stun the white hats at the time. What does that tell us about geopolitical risk generally? And specifically energy. And it looks like oil prices are going to stay up there for a while. I think that's one of the things that the market's really mispricing. Right now, if you look at the forward curve for oil, the risk is really in this very short term, where the market expects that oil is going to be elevated for the short term. But it really has an extrapolated or extended that expectation out the next one to two years. And I think that there's a real value in the back end of the curve for oil. Because I think that these oil challenges are going to persist much longer than what the market's anticipating. One of the reasons for that is, first, we saw out of oil OPEC Plus this week their intention to keep prices elevated. But I think the other challenges is that we really haven't invested here in the US or on a global basis on energy infrastructure. So that capacity is really constrained over the next couple of years. Even if we wanted to expand capacity or oil producers wanted to expand capacity, they don't have the ability to do so in the immediate term. And that's going to keep oil prices elevated. So the risk for oil, then the risk for the energy complex broadly isn't just this winter, but it's next winter as well. And next winter's challenges are going to be even more difficult, particularly on the shores of Europe, than what we're experiencing this winter. And so that's what I think the challenge is. And why I think this is something that's going to persist much longer than what the market's currently priced in. And David, it's running into the challenge of climate change. I'm looking at decades, not a short-term trade in carbon. And I'm glad that we're having a constraint on the ability to expand hydrocarbons and burning carbon. But you're right. People want heat. And Europe heats itself. Whether we like it or not, it doesn't heat itself a solar and wind. It's got to do it through fossil fuels. And that's matching and running into it is I had to reduce the use of fossil fuels. And I agree with Aaron. I'm hearing the same thing that Europe has enough oil and natural gas for this year in their supplies. But if it's a really cold winter, they're very worried about next year. So you're going to have climate change crashing into this challenge of OPEC and inflation and energy prices certainly over the next couple of years. Europe has a lot of challenges, Aaron, right now. Not just energy. It goes beyond that. Does that make the US relative, the most attractive place for you? I don't know if it's the most attractive place, but it's one of the more attractive places, particularly vis-a-vis Europe. And the challenge that Europe has is that they're starting from a lower productivity, lower and weaker growth rate to start out. They also didn't fully recover in the same way that the US did post-COVID. And they now have wider fiscal deficits. They're going to have to spend more money in order to insulate their economy from a harder hit because of energy. And that's going to create real challenges at the same time where the economy is rapidly slowing. And so our view is that while the US is going into recession, the recession in Europe is going to hit harder and is likely to be more prolonged. Thank you so much to Aaron Brown and Chris Aelman. When we come back, we're going to take a look at what's happening next week on Global Wall Street. And this is Bloomberg.

12826," kind or other and we just got to manage that collision carefully and I think the sooner we start managing for a slope, managing for some slowdown, the better we're going to do. I think Chairman Powell was way late to come to that recognition but he now has that recognition and he should be supported in that. So what do you think, Chair Powell and the Federal Reserve will make of these numbers? How will it affect what they do in early November? I don't think these numbers are going to change what the Fed does. You know, you never know what's going to happen and certainly there's risk of some kind of financially traumatic event but I think the chances of something that is large enough to divert the Fed are really quite low. So I'd be expecting that the market which is anticipating 75 basis points in November and is anticipating 50 more in December, that would correspond to my best guess at this moment as well and I think that kind of thing is going to be appropriate if we achieve disinflation. Larry, there's another strain of discussion. I've seen certainly this week in fact there was even some Fed staff work at the New York Fed suggesting that we better be careful because in fact the rate that we may need and already get down to 2 percent may be so high it will cause financial instability. There is a really safety and soundness issue. What do you make of that? Is it possible the Fed will have to choose between financial stability in the one hand and getting inflation down on the other? First, I think that should be the occasion for some sole searching. If we have an economy where we think there's going to be substantial financial breakage because the Fed lifts the Fed funds rate to 4.5 percent then we have an inadequately supervised financial system and an insufficiently active financial regulator. If anyone believes that along with whatever monetary policy implication they draw they better tell us how we think how they think we ought to be repairing the regulation of the financial system. David, my sense is that you can never rule out these kinds of risks but the Fed has more than one instrument. It has instruments for specific guaranteed lending. We've seen that used a number of times and each time we're surprised by how much the economy retains its robustness. In retrospect we cut interest rates too much and kept them too low when we were supporting the financial system after COVID. In retrospect we kept interest rates too low and blew up a bubble when we were supporting the economy with low interest rates after Asia and LTCM. In retrospect we were surprised and amazed by how rapidly the economy grew when the Fed did what was necessary after the 1987 stock market crash. So we need to regulate right to preserve financial stability. We need to have a very strong firefighting force in order to respond if and when financial accidents happen. But I think it's a real mistake to suggest that somehow we shouldn't do the monetary policies that are necessary to avoid inflation becoming entrenched because of concerns about financial stability. David the people who are still on team transitory they're always saying that expectations aren't entrenched. The more it's true that expectations are not yet entrenched despite high inflation. It seems to me that more important it is to move vigorously now with respect to the Fed.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1052,2022-10-09 04:38:18
12827," not yet entrenched, despite high inflation. Seems to me the more important it is to move vigorously now with respect to inflation so they don't become entrenched. If they were already entrenched, we could discuss the right timing of a disinflation. But if we have the big advantage in disinflation of expectations that are not yet entrenched, surely we should be acting on inflation while we have that advantage. Larry, another big development this week was the OPEC plus decision to reduce production limits by 2 million barrels a day. Something that I think it's fair to say was set the Biden administration back a bit. He'd gone over there and asked the crown prince not to do that. It wasn't very pretty. So apart from perhaps any embarrassment on my cause, does it have larger macroeconomic effects for a globe that we are warned by WTO, maybe headed toward a global recession? There's nothing good in this. Certainly it's not what we wanted to see. Actually it's a lot less than 2 million barrels because many of the countries that reduced their quota weren't hitting their quota before. So the reduction in the ceiling didn't really matter. And you didn't see a hugely dramatic move in oil markets in a way that was proportionate to the headlines that you saw. But certainly the risks are up. And it just points up the importance. And we always do a scramble about the immediate when these things happen. And we don't forget about the medium term. Look, we made a mistake by canceling the Keystone pipeline. We made a mistake by slowing down all kinds of permitting activity. We made a mistake by being hostile as a country to natural gas. We made a mistake in the Congress a few weeks ago when we didn't pass the mansion program of expanding permitting. We crucially need regulatory relief, where we're not going to get renewables online fast, and we're not going to get the transmission lines that are necessary for renewables to become a large part of our energy fast. So the real lesson on this is we need a different kind of energy strategy than the one that we've had. We need a strategy that is balanced rather than an unbalanced strategy of total hostility to fossil fuels, or God knows the kind of total strategy of favoring fossil fuels that we had, even egregious favoritism towards Saudi Arabia that we saw during the Trump administration. We need to find a balance. And I think we're making our way in that direction. Larry, it's always so helpful to have you on each week. And I would say, Larry, some of us are staying with us, as we bring in Professor Brad DeLong, Professor of Economics from UC Berkeley, on his new book, Slouching Toward Utopia.

Not only could it significantly change how we leave planet Earth, but it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space. And they're a scientist who think we could have already built it. We have the material, we have the technology, we have the lasers, we have the climbers, we have all of it. If a private entity wants to build it, or a government, they can build it. It'll change society. We have no clue how colonizing in the space, how really spreading on the space, really change our society over the next 50 to 200 years. It'll be completely different.

Our very special contributor, Larry Summers of Harvard, has stayed with us because we're going to bring in now Professor of Economics from UC Berkeley, he's Brad DeLong, the author of a new book, Slouching Toward Utopia, an economic history of the 20th century. So, Professor, welcome for joining us. It's really good to have you here. I've read this fascinating and really sort of protein book. It's really quite a book. Let's set it up first because it's a history of the 20th century. But you don't necessarily define the 20th century as from 1900 to 2000. You start in 1870 and you end up in 2010. Why? Well, the big thing that happens happens in 1870, right? Before 1870, the world's poor, and there's no prospect for the world being anything other than poor. After 1870, every single generation, humanity's technical competence doubles, and then doubles again in the following generation. And such an enormous pace of technological advance raises the possibility for the first time of a world in which we can bake a sufficiently large economic pie for everyone to have enough. And that was nothing that humanity had ever seen before. One of the remarkable things, Brad, that you highlight is that it really wasn't very different to live in the United Kingdom in the 19th century than it had been to live in the ancient world 2000 years before. Say something about the acceleration of growth that you see is happening in the 20th century. Well, you know, I mean, it was British economist John Stuart Mill, right? He was writing in 1871 about how all the industrial revolution had done, was it had created a somewhat larger middle class, and it had allowed manufacturers and the rich to earn greater fortunes, but that the overwhelming mass of humanity was still confined to the same life of drudgery and imprisonment than they had been before, that they had been in before, and before all the way back into deep time. It was very clear by 1900 that things had changed. You know, John Maynard Keynes writing in 1919 looks back and says starting in 1870, he entered economic Eldorado, and that now our chief task after World War I was figuring out why we tried to blow it up and try to get desperately back to what was good was going on after 1870. Fortunately, we eventually did, and so things rolled through up until our day. First of all, it gives us a sense of what happened in 1870 that brought all this about. There were some three driving forces in your book. But everyone has an idea about just what it is that's made us as a civilization so wealthy that makes our economy so productive. And the different people have different things, and they all go back, some of them back even to say the year 1070, and it turns out that the law applies to a German M.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1054,2022-10-09 04:47:04
12829," People have different things and they all go back. Some of them back even to say the year 1070 when it turns out that the law applies to a German emperor standing in the snow outside of the castle that elies on his tool, but instead it could be that the law relies to everybody. But you get three things that fall into place in 1870 that set technological progress into a much higher gear than ever before. And they are the industrial research lab so that you can rationalize and routinize the discovery and development of technology. And then the corporation as we know it, which rationalizes the development and deployment of technology. You know, to combine that with the globalized economy, with the telegraph and the I railroad and the iron hold ocean going steamship and all of a sudden the incentives to deploy technology worldwide for production are so overwhelming and people turn their minds to how to do this that everything explodes in a way it never had before. Brad, much of the academic discussion of your book has centered on this idea of a pivot point in 1870. But I want to ask about a different judgment you make, which is that there was this major era and that the major era ended in 2010. I would have thought that the world was growing, it was becoming more integrated with technology. There were important political struggles. That was the stuff of history through the 20th century, much better in the second half of the century than in the first half of the century. The end of the Cold War was a very different war than World War One or World War Two. It was cold. But I would have thought that was a continuing process with substantial challenges. And yet you see us as now being in a quite different era. What's different about the era we're in than the era you wrote the history of other than more of the kind of progress and change that you saw as happening every generation. Well, I'm pleased you disagree here and I'm very pleased you disagree on our historic idea, I had optimist here about our future. Because look, I've been losing arguments in person with you for 42 years, even when I think I'm right afterwards. And here I'm genuinely uncertain, and I actually very much hope you are really right this time. My thinking was, I've been listening to our friend John Furnald about how the underlying pace of technological progress has more or less halved since 2005 compared to what we were used to beforehand, saving those years from 1975 to 1990 when technology was crawling toward a more energy efficient and environmentally friendly configuration rather than focusing on labor saving. But after 2000, after 2000, we seem to have a substantial loss of social and economic knowledge about how to run things. Things about financial regulation that I thought were entrenched that were known in the bones turned out to have been completely forgotten in 2008. Things about the proper tools for macroeconomic policy that I thought were ingrained in the bone were also forgotten after 2010. And I remember UNI whimpering in 2012 that no, for the more expansionary fiscal policy, was not then a thing that ran any risks whatsoever. Combined that with the fact that from 1870 on to 2010, you know, first you had Britain in the United States and then the United States as the countries that people were looking to for examples as you know as Leon Trotsky liked to say as the furnace where the future is being forged. You know, but now you go to China, you go to India, you even go to Indonesia and what you find is that people say that the United States.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1055,2022-10-09 04:51:16
12830," being forged. But now you go to China, you go to India, you even go to Indonesia. And what you find is that people say that the United States has very little to teach them. That we don't have any greater grasp on how to deploy and use these technologies to create a good society. And are in fact a society, our society that is more trouble. We're more trouble than theirs are. Brad, if that is right, how much of it because of a running out of ideas and how much of it is running out of cohesion. One of the themes in your book is the sort of polls if I can put it that way between Hayek on the one hand, the market is king and Pallani and the others, the market has to serve people. How much of the problems we're in right now are because we're lacking cohesion because of the dispersion in wealth and income? I think we're definitely lacking cohesion. I think dispersion and wealth and income creates work of cohesion. I am struck by comparing the United States around 1900 with the United States today, that around in 1900, politics was as fierce and mean as it is today. That is, theodore Roosevelt denounced William Jennings Bryan as the puppet of a alien European socialist, John Peter Altgill, the governor of Illinois, who had not only been born in Europe, but also had dared to pardon anarchists. But there seems to be a very different flavor, right? That is, I think it's Ezra Klein talks about it, that somehow that our media and our communications today focuses first on establishing, you know, who are your enemies? Do you share any enemies with me? And if you share enemies with me, I will listen to. So as I say, it's a remarkable book. It's slouching toward Utopia, an economic history of the 20th century. Thank you so much for bringing it. We only really touch upon it today. I urge everybody to read it is really worth the effort. Thank you so much. Let's professor Brad DeLon of UC Berkeley. And of course, to our very special contributor Larry Summers of Harvard. Coming up, staying the course or turning tail, we'll reflect on some big about faces this week. This is Wall Street week on Bloomberg. Markets are preparing to close, but the day is not over yet. Talk that is now up about 45 percent. A lot of volatility, right? You need the power of the Bloomberg terminal to get you market moving data before anyone else. There's numbers much higher than expected. Upgraded today to overweight. You need top analysts to bring you exclusive global insight into cross-asset markets. The mini-bond market. This coin ain't lying along today. It's going to be short term.

12831," being steady and being stubborn. We've all admired those leaders through the years who have stuck to their guns when times got tough. British leaders like Winston Churchill and the darkest days of World War II. We feel like in the hills. We shall never surrender. And Churchill's successor, Margaret Thatcher, who was known for sticking to her guns no matter what. He wanted the council of ministers to be the Senate. No. No. No. And American leaders like President Reagan at the Brennan Bird Gate demanding that the Soviet Union tear down the Berlin Wall when it seemed that that was the farthest thing for Mr. Gorbachev's mind. Mr. Gorbachev opened this gate. Mr. Gorbachev tear down this wall. And those were the times when the steadfast were ultimately proven right by history. What happens when bold proclamations don't hold up quite as well, such as George Herbert Walker Bush's insistence he would never ever raise taxes. And I'll push again and I'll say to them, read my lips. And then there are those bold pronouncements that have yet to be proven out one way or the other. Like President Xi's insistence that his zero COVID policy is the right one for his country. If you just look at the COVID zero protocols, it requires all people returning from abroad to have 10 days of quarantine. Or President Putin insisting that he will ultimately still prevail in Ukraine. If he thinks he's losing and may lose his office and even life, then he can become completely unpredictable. But this week, this week we saw something a bit different. Big bold pronouncements being completely reversed, not long after they were made. A big one was, of course, Elon Musk's change of mind again on whether he pony up $44 billion for Twitter. We're now hearing that Elon Musk and Twitter, of course, that resolution really said to be sticking on the contingency of getting that debt financing. And that is going to be the key clause that we're focused on going forward. But at least Mr. Musk took a few months for his change of heart. We're in Great Britain, we saw a new government lay out a new budget that included big tax cuts starting with the top tax bracket. We love the tax cutting, but not at this time. This is just absolutely the wrong time to do this. Bringing immediate and violent reaction in the markets. Just trying to get the markets behind those two latter factors probably significantly more difficult. And the Bank of England stepping in for the rescue. So suddenly, the Bank of England finds itself in the ECB situation. So Prime Minister Truss' newly minted Chancellor of the Czech Republic had to admit publicly that they had been wrong, clearly and dramatically wrong, at least on those top tax rates. And it came only days after he and Prime Minister Truss had gone so big and so bold. I think it was a distraction. And I think it was the wrong thing to do. One can hardly fault a government for listening to its people, even if the listening might have come better before the deciding. But whatever the right answer, the one thing for certain is that at least in this respect, Ms. Truss is no Margaret Thatcher. To those waiting with baited breaths for that favor of media catchphrase that you turn, I have only one thing to say. You turn if you want to. The ladies not for turning. That does it for this episode of Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. And this is Bloomberg. See you next week.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1057,2022-10-09 05:00:04
12832,"itat We make it very transparent to the shopper before they accept an order. What the order is going to look like, how much work on a paysam and how much like the consumer is paying them. So they can decide whether they take an order or whether they refuse it. And that's a kind of flexibility. That's what the shoppers really value and the kind of transparency that they want. Are you seeing a labor shortage right now? And what are you doing to combat that? It's different in different places. Our demographic of shoppers is completely different from food delivery and our right sharing, where 70% women and half of them are moms. And that's because a lot of the job at Instacart is very different than just being in the car restrangers. It's about like going to the store, doing a good job of customer service, of really picking the right products for the consumer. And we are seeing that being very appealing to women. What separates a great investor from an average investor? Is it an early affinity for markets? I put a satellite dish on top of the dorm room so I would have access to real-time stock quotes. In unconventional path, what I really wanted to do was ski. So I left Wharton and I went up to Maine and became a ski bump. A never ending thirst for knowledge? It is a constant education each and every day. And acute attention to detail. I was down there for three weeks, I met every tenant, I was counting the car traffic, I was learning the business. A willingness to take a risk? If you want to produce return, you have to be willing to take risk. Where the ability to recognize a mistake and move on. I don't mind a 90% chance probability of failure if there's a 10% chance of changing the world. In how to invest, I hope to provide a glimpse into the thoughts and practices of the world's great investors and hopefully inspire a new generation of professional investors. In my pursuit of identifying the traits and skills of a great investor, I first looked into their backgrounds. I found many were raised in blue collar or middle class families. Rarely where they from fabulously wealthy families or families where there was a history of investing professionally. But their path to a career and investing varied. Some like Ron Barron, the mutual fund manager and investor with more than $50 billion on her management started investing as a teenager. After my birth, I was interested in stock market because I had friends of mine who had been given stock from the grandparents who were prosperous. In Eastman, Kodak and Polaroid. And I said, I want to do that. And my father said, we can't invest in stocks. We've never done that, you know, family. And in fact, one of the ideas behind my business is the idea was I wanted to be able to have my people like my parents be able to invest in the stock market. So I saw that and then he said, well, I had $1,000 at the time. And he said, well, if you show me why you want to invest in a company and you put all your money into one company, then and show me why, then I'll let you do that and open account for you. And so I did research, I would go to this brokerage firm and I was called McDonald's Company there from Cleveland and they were right by Asbury Park High School. So I would go there after school.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1058,2022-10-09 05:04:23
12833," I go to this brokerage firm and it was called McDonald Company or Cleveland and they were right by Asbury Park High School. So I go there after school, sports and girls and stocks and I go there after school and all these guys, old guys, 40, 50 years old. They're sitting there on these green chairs and looking at the tape that hardly moved. I think the New York Stock Exchange was 25 million shares a day and maybe American was a million or two million shares a day. So look at it and I got a report on this mom with county national bank and I started reading it and it was around the corner where I lived in Allenhurst outside of Asbury Park and I told my father why I wanted to invest in it and he let me invest and the stock was $10 a share, 100 shares and then the stock every day for the next six months, seven months, every day you just stayed the same or went up and ate and it was printed the 15 stocks in the Asbury Park press. And everybody stayed the same and then it got acquired at $17 a share. So my $1000 became $1700. I said, man, there's nothing today. I want to do that. So I was interested. Hedge Fund billionaire Ken Griffin also turned an early affinity for math and computers into an early career in stock trading. Let's talk about your background before you started Sadeel. You're born in Florida? I was born in Daytona Beach. My father worked on the space program back in the 1960s. But I spent my formative years in middle school and high school in Buck, Riton, Florida. And you were a pretty good math student and I'm told a computer nerd as well. Is that fair or unfair? Well, I appreciate the compliment because to be a computer nerd has obviously turned out to be a pretty good place to be in life. And yes, I was very interested in both mathematics and programming in high school. And it's defined my career and it has had a very important role in my life. So you went to Harvard College. Most students there are taking courses or their athletics, but you were maybe doing that. But you were also trading securities. Is that true? That is true. I started up a small partnership my second year at Harvard to engage in convertible bond arbitrage, which was a bit of a off the beaten path occupation for a kid in college. But I had a great fascination with markets and I had an opportunity to invest capital markets in my college days. And it was an incredible opportunity. It was a really great learning experience. But in those days, it wasn't common to be able to get stock prices instantly. You had to get a special terminal or special intended to let you get the stock quotes. Is that right? So it's amazing is, you know, I love the line people go, well, that's how we've always done it. And I get to think back into the early days of Citadel. We're always did it meant we used a fax machine, which you and I of course have been resolved. And the fax machine was revolutionary. In the 1980s, real time stock prices were actually difficult to receive. And I put a satellite dish on top of the dorm room. So I would have access to real time stock quotes in managing the portfolio that I managed. And what did the Harvard people say? Interestingly enough, back in the 80s, Harvard had a general prohibition on commercial activity in your dorm rooms. So I had to go to the building superintendent to get an exception to put this satellite dish on the roof of the building. And fortunately, he was willing to grant me that exception. But not every investor saw their future in finance early. Real estate, Titan, Sam Zell and myself studied the law, became lawyers and hated it. I was always a good enough academic to get from here to there. So when I wanted to go to law school, I got seven A's. But I didn't get very many A's before that. And I basically used the four years of being an undergraduate to build a real estate business and build other businesses. And I just had a great time. So you were doing some real estate on the side while you were in college. And then you went to University of Michigan Law School. And to please your mother or father, you said, I'm going to go to law school. But you weren't that interested in being a lawyer? No. Never. As a matter of fact, I ended up graduating and becoming a lawyer and I practiced for four days. Four days. I didn't realize you practiced that long. Four days. And so, in the morning of the fifth day, I went to see the senior partner and as only a 24 year old could do, I looked in and I said, I just don't think this is a good use of my time. And you said, okay, there's the door? No, actually, what he said is, what are you going to do? And I said, I'm just going to go back to doing deals like I did when I was in law school.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1059,2022-10-09 05:09:03
12834," He said, okay, there's the door. Well, actually, what he said is, what are you going to do? And I said, I'm just going to go back to doing deals like I did when I was in law school and in the real estate business in Arbor. And so he said, why don't you stay here and we'll do the legal work and we'll invest in your deals. And so that's what we did for a year. And then there's activist investor Nelson Peltz, who didn't see the point in studying at all. What I really wanted to do was ski. So I left Wharton and I went up to Maine and became a ski bum. What did your family say? Nelson, we really wanted you to go to Wharton and be a good student. You're one of ski. I mean, that's not what you're supposed to do. That's correct. They did say that. What did you do? You said I went skiing. My father was an amazing guy. He wasn't happy that I left Wharton. He wasn't happy that I was a ski bum. And he wasn't happy that I grew a beard. But I did all of those things. And the snow melted in late spring and came back and I had a summer job offered to me in Mount Hood, Oregon to help them teach racing to young kids in Mount Hood, Oregon. And I needed some money to get out there. I asked him if he'd give me a job on a truck a hundred bucks a week, two weeks. That was all I needed. He said, find, shave your beard off and do it. I said, I would. It was only temporary. So I shaved my beard off. And after about a week on the job, I started telling him things that I thought that were missed opportunities. And he set me up beautifully. He said, why don't you stay here and do what you want to do instead of going out to Mount Hood, Oregon? Well, I did. And that's what happened. There are also great investors like Paul of O'Lent, one of the country's most successful endowment heads who came to investing after a completely different career. I studied paper conservation, restoring prints and drawings. I worked at the New York Historical Society for a while there. I then went to work at the Palace of Fine Arts in their Conservation Lab and then I went to Los Angeles where I worked at the LA County Museum. I did study, I did a scientific work at the Getty. And then I set up my own conservation studio where I worked with contemporary artists like Sam Edrige, Sam Francis. And I was running my own business and I realized I needed to know a little bit about finance because I was working with very expensive works of art. I was running a studio. And so I started taking a couple of business classes at UCLA and through that I got introduced to Yale School of Management. But I got into Yale School of Management at the same time I got offered a fellowship at the National Gallery of Art where you and I both serve the Lyscher Fellow and I worked in the paper conservation lab there combining paper and paintings techniques for conservation on contemporary works of art. So you did that for a while and then you went to Yale School of Management? My husband and I had been trying to have a child and it wasn't kind of works. It wasn't happening so he said, okay, well let's move to New Haven. And of course that was instant and my daughter was born after my first semester. So I took a break and while one of my daughter was probably two months old I went to David Swenson and knocked on the door and said hi, I want to learn about endowment because I'm going to work in a museum. And this is about David. David looked at my resume. There was no finance at all. And he took me in and I started filing and helping organize things and little by little I got projects to do. I remember he had me do a big research on soft dollars. That was one project I worked on. And little by little I became incorporated into the investment office. Coming up we hear about the extreme intelligence and intention to detail that it takes for success on Wall Street. One of Sam's favorite samisms is we suffer from knowing the numbers. Back in 1997 I was interested in the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1060,2022-10-09 05:13:08
12835," Back in 1997, I was interested in the following question, which is there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called sauropod dinosaurs, which had really long skinny necks. So apodosaurus is an example. Now, it's had really long skinny tails. So I made a computer model that showed that in fact, the tail of these sauropod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip, a bullfip. Now, the way a bullfip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. And that crack is a sonic boom. I think the way they got a date was to impress the females by making loud booms. Big expensive cities have a lot going for them, but if you live in one, you probably notice that these big expensive cities keep getting more well expensive. You could always move away. You might have just started working remotely, so there's really nothing keeping you there. But then again, moving is a hassle. Well, what if someone paid you 10 grand to do it? What if they threw in free office space, a bicycle, or a gym membership? Programs and cities and states around the US are doing exactly that, and they're getting a lot of interest. We've had over 50,000 applications. About 90,000 applications. We've had over 1800 applicants from all over North America. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them? Or are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns for places looking for an injection of fresh talent? Another trait of great investors that shouldn't surprise you is they all tend to have a high degree of intelligence, many excelled academically. But true success as Mary Erdo's, the CEO of JPMorgan Asset and Wealth Management, points out, comes from training and continuing to educate oneself. So training on Wall Street, but specifically in Wealth Management, is a very, very long process. We have 2,200 analysts starting today, and they're going to be working through the summer. We have 3,600 analysts across JPMorgan Chase that will start at the very end in the September time period for their full-time role. And we work very hard to go through in-depth training and then to work through which ones actually are good at stock investing, which ones are good at M&A transactions, which ones are good at helping people understand things in a more simplistic matter. That's a 2-3 year training program. But that's pretty fast. If you think 10,000 hours is about what you need to master any subject. If someone comes in and has a regular, you know, 8-hour, day job, 5 days a week, it's going to take you about 5 years to have a base level mastery. On Wall Street, it's more like 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, that cuts you down to about 2 and a half years before you become mastered in something. Once they've got that under their belt, they can then join a team. And if they've been successful going through the analyst program, joining a team, then the team will work through how that works. But it is a constant education each and every day. Every morning, we start with an 8 o'clock meeting, and I call it like a mini-university. And it's not just about what you've read in the newspapers as to what happened overnight. It's about understanding how all of those components fit together in a client's portfolio. And then what might be right for you would be different than somebody else. And you're synthesizing all that information every morning. And then you're going out and you're figuring out how to apply it to each situation. Dawn Fitzpatrick, the investment chief for George Soros, is of a similar mindset to Erdos. For her, the constant pursuit of new ideas and new voices keep her ahead of the game. So I read a lot.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1061,2022-10-09 05:17:21
12836," George Soros is of a similar mindset to Urdos. For her, the constant pursuit of new ideas and new voices keep her ahead of the game. So I read a lot. You know, in the morning, I'll skim through two or three different papers. During my days, I'm meeting with a lot of smart investors and smart people running companies. You learn a lot from there. I talk to peers. But I think part of the trick of this big business is being able to really aggregate and assimilate information. And one of the other tricks of this industry is trying to find sources of information that are different than the other people in the business because you don't want to get crowd thinking. I think that happens a lot in this business. Everyone's talking of the same people. And a view becomes consensus that might not be really grounded as well as it should be in facts. Attention to detail also sets great investors apart as described by two real estate legends, Sam Zell and John Gray. You know, one of Sam's favorite samisms is we suffer from knowing the numbers. I think we've managed to tip throw through the tulips for the last 50 years by never allowing ourselves to get swept up in the enthusiasm of whatever the current event might be. And I think by maintaining that level of discipline, yeah, we've made mistakes. And that's to be expected. But we've all been, quote, controllable. No one mistake was ever catastrophic. The first deal I worked on was a shopping center in Chesapeake, Virginia. The Great Bridge Shopping Center. It was a $6 million transaction. We borrowed four, so it was a $2 million equity check. And you would have thought I was buying the island of Manhattan. I mean, I was down there for three weeks. I met every tenant. I was counting the car traffic. I was learning the business. And it was an amazing experience because I was the chief bottle washer. I was the waiter. I was the matrede. Because we were this tiny little business. And I was learning it firsthand. Now, one of the most famous things in the real estate world is location, location, location. Meaning that the location is everything. And also, you might say it's local, local, local. Because most people make in real estate investments, kind of in the area they know. You've made investments all over the world. How do you sitting in New York know about their value of real estate in Europe or in Asia? And how hard has that been to build a global business? So I think the key to that is to have a global footprint, to have hundreds of people all over the world. And it took us a long time to do it. I mean, we've been at this for 30 years. And you really need talented people on the ground. You need local people who know the markets. The one thing I'd say, though, that is advantageous about real estate is so many of the trends we're seeing, particularly driven by technology, are the same around the world. So when we started buying warehouse is back in 2010. And we noticed that there were these e-commerce tenants showing up. And we started buying more in the US. It wasn't a big leap of faith to say the same thing's going to happen in Canada. It's going to happen in the UK and continental Europe and across Asia. So my view is that if you have the skill set, you can evaluate. Plus, you travel a lot. Like you, I'm on planes a lot. I no longer run the real estate business day today. My colleagues Ken Kaplan and Kathleen McCarthy have done an amazing job. But they have teams around the world on the ground. And we're local in those markets. And I think that's really important. You cannot buy real estate in Mumbai, the way we have, flying in and flying out of New York. Next, we look at how skilled investors evaluate risk. We are 100% confident every time we make the investment. That it's going to be a big company. We are wrong a lot of the time.

This is Bloomberg Daybreak with Lake. Welcome to Deadbreak Australia. This is Bloomberg. On TV Radio and the Web. This is Bloomberg. One of the easiest paths in life is to accept and follow conventional wisdom. But what great investors have found is that path doesn't lead to easy returns. Often the biggest wins come from going against the grain and taking a risk. Especially if you are leading venture capital investor like Mark Andreessen or Vinod Kostler. Each top and venture firm has its own bar. So it has its own set of criteria for things that you should be done or not. And then the top tier venture firms as a group have a collective bar. And then the top tier venture firm is going to fund this company or not. It is easier to answer that second question than it is the first question. After you have been in the business for a while, you tend to have a sense of like, this is going to get funded by a top and venture capital firm or it is not. If it is going to get funded by a top and venture capital firm and if my firm doesn't think it is a good idea, you do wonder who is right. Because the other firms are quite smart. This is one of the regular discussions that we have. If another one of these top and firms is interested in it, that might be a very positive substantive signal. That said, some of the best deals in history have been passed on by a very large number of people. One of the class examples, Uber was passed on by a very large number of venture capital firms. Uber was actually available to be invested in on this site called Angelist, where literally anybody with a checkbook can invest. And so every once in a while you get these outliers. And it is fundamentally a game of outliers. Like the money is made on the aberrations. And so I would say you want to be generally open-minded and humble about your conclusions about what all these different signals mean. Now a famous economist, Herb Stein, once said, if something can't keep going on forever, it won't. In other words, at some point things settle down. Do you worry that because the economy might soften at some point if interest rates are raised, or just because of the business cycle, the wonderful world of venture capital will slow down a bit. And is that a worry for you? So it's a cyclical business for sure. It has a history of boom bus cycles, you know, basically just like any other sector of the economy. That said, I guess I would say we do not have a great time to talk about it. And I think most of how we either perform or fail to perform is micro-not macro, which is to say it's based on the successor failure of individual companies. And if you just look at the history of venture capital and startups, many of the best companies have been formed during the hot periods. But also many of the companies have been formed during the cold periods, right? And they're pros and cons of those periods. And so look, it's possible there's another cyclical boom and bus cycle, you know, our plan for that cycle would basically be to just keep going, keep working with our existing companies, help them through it, keep investing in new companies all the way through. And basically bet on these sort of micro-level fundamental technological and economic changes that continue to happen. Most of what we do is uncharted territory. I would say the one piece that works really well in our business is go for higher risk, higher consequences. So most people in business reduce risk, increase the probability of success, which is reduce risk. But at the expense of making the consequences of success relatively inconsequential, you might make two times your money or something. I, for our business, what works is I don't mind a 90% probability of failure if there's a 10% chance of changing the world. And that's very much the philosophy. It also goes with, it's the right way to make huge impact. It's not just venture capitalists taking risks. Columbia's endowment head Kim Liu also says gains are not without...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1063,2022-10-09 05:26:10
12838," a great way to make huge impact. It's not just venture capitalists taking risks. Columbia's endowment head Kim Liu also says gains are not without calculated risks. I think the best investment advice I've ever received is the fact that we are in the business of taking risk. And so if you want to produce return, you have to be willing to take risk and you have to be willing to analyze and mitigate that risk the best you can and to make sure that the return potential of an investment is equal to the risk, but you can't avoid risk. Now what do you think the most common mistake investors make generally? I think the most common mistakes is following the herd and just doing what everybody else is doing and not making sure that an investment is appropriate for your institution and making sure that the analysis that someone else has done is not appropriate for you or is not congruent with the way you think about the world. I think there are million ways to make money. I think there are million strategies that can work. Not every investment has come system with your strategy. And so I think there's a lot of herd mentality and that's a huge mistake that happens. Now sometimes risk don't pan out and mistakes are made. Now I might sit and stew over the loss for a decade or two but a truly great investor like Kleiner Perkins Chairman John Doerr has the ability to admit a mistake, cut his losses and move on. When I first came to Silicon Valley, I hung out at Stanford on the second floor of Margaret Jack's Hall. And down that hall was Andy Bechtel-Schheim who founded Sun Microsystems, John Hennessy, who became president of Stanford, founded MIPS Jim Clark of Silicon Graphics. What I didn't do is go down into the basement. Where Len and Sandy were starting Cisco. So that was a miss on my part. More recently I had the opportunity to invest in an electric vehicle company. And the conventional wisdom was venture capitalists ought not to invest in electric vehicle companies. Not new car companies at all. There have been 400 new car companies in the nation's history. Every one of them but one has gone bankrupt. But I was still very attracted to the market. And we had the choice of backing a brilliant car designer by the name of Henry Fisker, or ambitious, slightly crazy entrepreneur by the name of Elon Musk. It test well, we made the wrong decision. But Tesla did very, very well. And so did electric vehicles. So when I make a mistake, I only think about it for the next 10 or 20 years. How long does it take for you to get over these things? Well, I don't obsess on these, but I won't ever forget. This is a market that over the past few weeks has made it clear. It wants to go higher. It got a little spooked by the idea that geocalitual potential rises. What do Formula One cars and your local supermarket have in common? Well, strange as it sounds, they might both be using the same technology. A lot of innovation has trickled down from the world of high tech engines, and it hasn't just found a new life in road cars. F1 cars have long been thought of as the peak of cool. And technology in them is also helping to pull down our produce aisles. Engineers from Williams are using their knowledge from nine constructors championships, working with company Aerofoil to help reduce the energy consumption of supermarkets. The device they're building is based on the design of an F1 cars rear wing. It attaches to fridges to keep more cool air in the unit. They estimate it can reduce supermarket energy consumption by 25%. One innovation from F1 is also helping hybrids reduce their carbon footprint. That's curves or the kinetic energy recovery system. In common parlance, it's known as regenerative braking and works by storing energy of the car decelerating in a battery for later use. If that's not enough, F1 is now looking at curves or a thermal energy recovery system, looking to harness the heat produced from braking and the engine exhaust. That could allow cars to generate the same power using 30% less fuel. So while F1 may have a reputation as a gas guzzler, some of its innovations in the name of speed are helping in the everyday fight against climate change.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1064,2022-10-09 05:30:38

What do you think about all this celebs getting into? We're so incredibly. I think that that I think was more than just a few years ago. I think that was more last year. I think it's kind of a way of that past. No, I don't think so, but I think it's like any time that frankly it's when a lot of other people get into crypto right? Other audiences too. It's when it's in the news a lot. When does that happen? A lot of times when the prices are going up. She was a federal prosecutor going after gangs and the mob before being handed her next assignment. Taking down Bitcoin. Kedi Han soon realized this new technology was much more than a tool used by criminals. She dove deep and became a crypto convert, swapping her prosecutor hat for a board seat at Coinbase. It became the first female general partner, adventure firm and recent Horowitz. Han, now a prolific crypto investor, recently launched her own fund with one and a half billion dollars to deploy. It's the largest fund ever raised by a single investor. Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0 CEO and founder of Han Ventures, Kedi Han. Kedi Han. Kedi, it's so great to have you. Great to be back here in the studio with you Emily. I want to start with a vibe check. Okay. What state of the crypto cycle are we in right now? It was hot. Yeah. And then it got pretty cold. Well, look, Emily, zooming back because I've been in crypto for a decade if you can believe it. We've seen crypto be really hot and then all of a sudden not. And so we've seen this before. However, I think one of the things that I've been doing a little bit different now is with each new crypto cycle, more and more people come into it. And so it's more and more pronounced each cycle. And I would push back on it's not. I think it depends on what area of the ecosystem you're looking at. We think developers think crypto and what three is still really hot. I am seeing a lot less of those we're all going to make it hashtags. I am seeing a lot less of them too, although I am spending less time on Twitter. So maybe that's why. There are new acronyms. What hasn't happened is a crypto winter in the midst of really serious global macro conditions. So we have inflation, kind of at record highs for our generation and on our lifetime. And then we have also a war that's broken out in the Ukraine. And we have a number of other factors going on here. So that's very different. There was some serious carnage out there. Yeah. começar luna.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1065,2022-10-09 05:35:35
12840," A war that's broken out in the Ukraine, and we have a number of other factors going on here. So that's very different. There was some serious carnage out there. Yeah. Saucius, Luna, three-houros. What's been your takeaways from what? Yeah. I don't want to sit here and tell you that algorithmic stablecoins are bad, because I actually think they're really interesting. However, I think what happened is you had, in this case you mentioned Luna and Tara, you know, that was an algorithmic stablecoin that was getting pretty widespread adoption relative to what the tech could do. I didn't realize you spent your teenage years living in Egypt and learning Arabic. Yeah. Tell me about your upbringing. I was always uprooted. My dad worked for a large company, and we were always moving just when I would get comfortable in one space. And I think actually that's pretty important. If you fast-forward and look at my career, I'm comfortable being in uncomfortable situations. You know, I didn't know a lot about venture when I got into it initially. I didn't know a lot about crypto when I got into it initially. And I was okay asking questions. I was okay not knowing the local acronyms or the Namanclature of a particular field. And I'm, you know, I'm taken right back to my teenage years in Cairo, moving from Houston, Texas one day to downtown Maddie in Cairo the next day. You studied law? I did. You clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. That's right. You became a federal prosecutor. You were taking on prison gangs and the mafia. That must have taken a really thick skin. I was doing it at each 25. And now if I kind of take a step back and you know, I think that happens at different points in your career. Like, whoa, if I would have analyzed that a little more at the time, and I'm kind of in some ways glad I didn't. I just dove right in. Because I felt it fascinating. There was a human aspect to it. And people's stories. And I felt like those stories mattered. So I was drawn to criminal law and became a federal prosecutor. And I did cases involving violent crime, but then really mistrying cases, being back in the courtroom, being before the grand jury. Like the prosecutor you would see on TV going to try those murder cases. Doing those two hour closing arguments. That's right. And so moved out here to California. I died at the largest prison gang in the world at the time. Outlaw motorcycle gangs hostage taking. Bank robberies, armed bank robberies. There was really not a kind of criminal case by that point in my career. I hadn't done it. It was right around that time, 2012. One of my bosses came in and said, let's have that same energy that you brought to those gang cases, to those murder cases. And let's go ahead and have you investigate this new criminal technology that we really need to look into and possibly shut this down. So you created the first cryptocurrency task force. How would you describe it? Fortunately, several of us in the government realized at the time it's not possible, also not desirable, because Bitcoin is not an entity. It's not a person. It's a protocol. And it would be like saying, let's go shut down cash. Let's go shut down the internet. It's not possible. Probably wouldn't be a good idea, either. I was using crypto and technologies like the Bitcoin blockchain, because that's all it existed then. This is 2012, 2013, to actually uncover criminal activity. So I didn't think that that technology was bad. Frankly, it was a tool that helped me uncover the various activity. And by the way, it was a step level function improvement better than compliance by banks. I'll just go ahead and say it. That's a little bit controversial. But I had spent a decade subpoenaing large financial institutions, and five times out of 10 didn't get back what I needed. One case I worked on, and people always say, oh, you shut down the Silk Road. What actually happened? I was looking into something completely, not having to do with anything at all of the Silk Road and came across some, what looked to be some kind of odd activity. And it turns out that a couple of federal agents on the Silk Road Task Force out of Washington, DC were croaked. And that is the case that I ended up in dining, and I ended prosecuting those agents, and they both went to prison. So that's the aspect of what the Silk Road case that I worked on. I would never, never have been able to uncover that criminal activity by those agents, because they were federal agents they knew how to cover their tracks had they not use Bitcoin blockchain. Right? So that's it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1066,2022-10-09 05:39:24
12841," Cover that criminal activity by those agents, because they were federal agents, they knew how to cover their tracks. Had they not used Bitcoin blockchain. Right, so that technology right there, if they had just used wires or cash or even bank wires, we would never have uncovered that. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund in front of scratch? You will put a woman on Mars. You will bring forth global cooling. You will be the first chief crypto officer. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer, disrupt, before you change the world, Bloomberg. The leap is crucially important. And I think we've moved from this attitude, from its and indulgence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s. And so it makes that a really exciting field, because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harnessed to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize. That makes you smart. If you can spit back a lot of facts. But if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what you bring figures out while you're sleeping. So you became kind of a crypto convert after this. You joined the board of coinbase. That's right. Very early on. How did you and coinbase and Brian Armstrong come together? I hosted an event here in San Francisco at the Federal Reserve Bank. And I believe it was there that it wasn't just Brian. It was a lot of what I'll call legitimate actors and crypto, who wanted to usher in this new wave, this new ecosystem. And then we brought together the heads of all kinds of agencies, really in an effort to kind of talk about building bridges. The government and the crypto industry, we're never going to see eye to eye on a lot of things. But we did think there were some commonalities. Coinbase is a company that has suffered. They've been losing share. The valuation of the public markets has plummeted. Why do you think that is? And how do you think it can be fixed? Yeah. Well, I think again, a few things it's tied to. One, a large aspect of Coinbase's business now, of course, is trading revenue. And that's down when prices are down. And the company's been very transparent about that long before going public. I mean, also, if you look at its S1, it specifically identifies that. And just how volatile crypto cycles are. So I think that's part of it. It's judged by public markets as a technology stock, or as a financial services company. By the way, I think it's both. I think it's not just a financial services company. I think it's so much more. I think it's really a portal to this whole new ecosystem. You were also on the board of OpenC until recently, there's an insider trading situation or accusation going on there. Coinbase has also had employees accused of insider trading. How much is this happening within crypto companies? And within the industry? And how big a problem is? Yeah. I think crypto is under the microscope. So where you have a case, two cases, three cases, in crypto ecosystem, which now is a trillion dollar industry, I think multi-billion approaching trillion dollar industry, you're always going to be able to find examples like that. So I don't want to make too much out of a handful of cases. That said, the company Coinbase OpenC take these things incredibly seriously. Along with your position at Coinbase, you became a partner at one of the most story venture capital for unsolic and valiant for these Andries and Horowitz. What was your experience at A16Z-like? There I met Chris Dixon, and I met Ben Horowitz, and I met Mark Andrieson, and I had worked with them for just about a year, maybe a little bit over when they asked me to come and co-run their crypto funds.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1067,2022-10-09 05:43:34
12842," It's when I met Mark Andreessen and I had worked with them for just about a year, maybe a little bit over when they asked me to come and co-run their crypto funds at Andreessen Hearts. Again, I jumped at that chance and I think really that speaks to the fact that as I said before things are a hell yes or there are no and it was a hell yes for me. So Andreessen Hearts is the kind of place where if you make partner you don't leave. Yeah. How did Mark and Ben respond when you said, yeah, why don't you start a crypto fund of my own? As you might know Emily, they're an anchor. They're an anchor check into my fund and I'm very grateful for that. Mark and Chris and folks like them are also personal LPs. So I felt very supported when I shared that decision and I will say that it was not running away from Andreessen Hearts. It was running to another opportunity. And you know crypto is not, what do they say it's not a spectator sport or it's like you're in it, it's excuse very young, it's 24-7, it's global and it's hustle. And that's a trade-off, it's a life trade-off and at this point in my career and in my life if I was going to continue to make that trade-off I just wanted to do it and do it in a way that was really true to me. So you struck out on your own, to launch on ventures, what gave you the courage to do that, what was the spark that lit the fire? Yeah, that got you to say, I need to do this and do this now. Sure, what I set out to do was to continue to invest in this ecosystem that I think is so broad that decision was very purposeful and the timing was very purposeful. We have an early stage fund that does seed stage, series A, even series B and then we have what we call an acceleration fund which is, it's not a growth fund, it's a crypto growth fund and I think those are different things. But it's later stage, it might be crypto publics, certain kinds of public tokens were set up to hold tokens and participate in the token ecosystem or later stage companies. I mean, there are now several crypto, many crypto unicorns. The space has become really competitive. Even though you say, you know, crypto's had its kind of ups and downs, the thing is, a lot of people in some of those last cycles have seen the kind of venture style returns that can be having crypto. And so you've had a lot of new funds enter the space and that's driven up competition. So what differentiates on ventures then from, you know, all of these other crypto funds or even the more traditional venture capitalists like entries in Harrowitz or Sequoia, they also have crypto funds now. Well, I think a lot of traditional venture capital funds now have crypto funds. It used to just be like a regulatory designation. It was like, are you an RIA, which is registered investment advisor? I would say for crypto founders today, it's not enough to just be an RIA, right? They, frankly, I don't even know if a lot of them care. That's a regulatory designation. What crypto founders today want to know is, do you live and breathe crypto? Do you inhale the discord? Are you part of the community? Do you participate in governance? Are you going to be staking these kind of crypto verbs out there? And if you're not really in this space full time, I think it's very hard to run a successful crypto fund. We don't have a hedge fund component. So we're not sitting here buying and trading and selling. That's a hedge fund structure. And there are crypto hedge funds. We're not one. We're making seven to ten year bets. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund from scratch? You know, it's hard, but it's not impossible. We don't have a crystal ball. I don't know. I can't predict cycles, but I knew that we were in a cycle where you saw so much for an excitement around the space. And I already talked about what makes this different, but I think one thing also is we are an embell strike force. We don't fish in the same pond. We have the crypto natives. We have a fishing execution. We have operators, seasoned operators who really know how to stick the landing. And I think that's reflected on our culture. I would say the only thing that's changed in our strategy as a result of the market correction is really more of a focus on early stage, but we still have our late stage fund. And when we see valuations, which I think will still see correct, spoiler. I think we'll continue to see some corrections. And so we might deploy our later stage fund a little bit more slowly. It might not be on an even 50 50 cadence. And that's okay. Long term or strategy hasn't changed. Long term or committed to the space. How much do you think valuations are going to correct? You know, it's just I can't give you a one size fits all answer because crypto is not a monolith. You have some crypto companies that really follow more of an enterprise.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1068,2022-10-09 05:48:12
12843," How much do you think valuations are going to correct? You know, it's just, I can't give you a one-size-fits-all answer because crypto is not a monolith. You have some crypto companies that really follow more of an enterprise SaaS business model. You have others that are layer one protocols. You have still others that are consumer-facing applications. And I think one of the things we're seeing right now is the infrastructure layer. And that's where we're spending a lot of our time, by the way. And we think more and more use cases will come about when the infrastructure layers in place. So my own view is we are not rushing to deploy. We're certainly not getting caught up. Do you get VC FOMO and have you avoid that? You know, look, I think it's very easy to get into that mindset, right? It's because it's a competitive sport. It's a competitive space. And I think I'd be lying if I said that that doesn't influence anyone. I try to, what I do, and I think I do differently, is I try to take stock of that. Oh, that's the FOMO mentality kicking in. That's bad. Again, you don't want to over-correct, though. What we look for is we look for amazing founders. It doesn't matter if I think valuations will correct. If they're amazing founders, there's a huge tam. We also look for what's your regulatory plan? If you're launching a token, what's your plan to comply with the law? What's your plan for security, by the way? We've seen a lot of hacks in the space. We want to really dive in there and make sure that the founders have been thoughtful about, especially if they're custodian customer funds, keeping those funds secure. If it's a cross-chain bridge, what are the exploits? Have you changed your strategy at all, given the downturn? What? Have you backed out of any deals or decided not to do certain deals? Because the conditions have changed. Don't you raise the phone? We have decided not to do certain deals. We've never backed out of a deal. We have decided not to do a few deals. Because we think that pricing was ahead of progress, candidly. And we might have been wrong about that, Emily. We might have been wrong about that. But I think if we were wrong not to do a couple of deals, better that we might have been right. Because if we were wrong about that, I think we can find a way to still invest in those projects later. Well, one thing I'm hearing is that a lot of dry powder has just stepped up. Because all these funds raised a lot of money raised. What was the biggest fund ever for a single person, not just a woman? Anyone? Are you confident you're going to have a place to put all that money? I am, but if I don't have a place to put it, I'm not just going to go willing, nearly deploy it. One of the things that we told our LPs, even during the period when we raised our fund, which was when crypto was undeniably still on a bull run, we said that we are going to be pretty steadfast sticking to a tier deployment cycle. And I think one thing that's changed is that might have lengthened. It certainly hasn't shortened. But we will, again, we feel very good that we have the capital to back great teams when we see them. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind. We're falling behind. Welcome to the world of decentralized finance, Bloomberg's covering all things crypto, the people, the transactions, and the technology, Bloomberg crypto Tuesdays. What about NFTs? Are you concerned about the declining demand? We are going to increasingly live in a digital world. And I happen to think that if you live in a digital world, you're going to want to own digital.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1069,2022-10-09 05:52:12
12844," Are you concerned about the declining demand? We are going to increasingly live in a digital world. And I happen to think that if you live in a digital world, you're going to want to own digital goods in that world. You're not just going to be satisfied to rent them, which is what we do now. We buy our content from walled gardens without digital scarcity, which is what NFTs unlock. You don't really own anything. You're subject to the whims of a platform. And I think NFTs and digitally scarce goods fundamentally change that. I think you'll see NFTs back again. But we are spending a lot of time in the infrastructure layer. Like I tell you, zero knowledge, technology, scalability. We think of that as the plumbing. If you think of the fiber-hubbic cables. Remember, you couldn't have had YouTube and Netflix with dial-up. You couldn't have streamed content. The same is true of crypto use cases. We think that there will be a lot of new use cases unlocked when the infrastructure is there, when it's more efficient, when it's more user-friendly. And so we're spending a lot of our time there. President Biden issues this crypto executive order. There are a number of ports that are coming due. What do you want to see from the administration when it comes to regulation? And are you optimistic that we will get there? Yeah. We were so delighted to see that executive order. This is not something you should normally be delighted about. But why we were is because it was to us a real recognition that this is a US government saying, this field isn't going anywhere. This field is growing. It's growing so much that we are going to direct every single agency in the federal government to come up with a plan here. I think we take a step forward, but then you see we're a big government. We're a big system. We have states. We have local entities. So we take a step forward with the EO. And then we take some steps back sometimes, too. And I think what I see is crypto founders are confused by that. They're starting to think, well, I could go to this jurisdiction where there's a single regulator. And you don't have 50 states with different rules. It's the US government that needs to start taking stock of the fact that right now, Emily in China, there's a quarter of a billion, ECNY wallets, a quarter of a billion. We're still talking about whether there should be a government central bank digital currency. We're still studying that. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind China. And we're falling behind. What are the dangers of falling behind China and the rest of the world? This is years ahead. So I don't want people to take a headline and say, oh, I think the US dollar will be no longer the global currency, reserve global currency. I'm not saying that now. But fast forward decades. And if you no longer need to use the dollar because you have an alternative, I think that's a real problem. What would we use instead? Well, I think that there are going to be stable coins out there that people who have access to a smartphone will use. There is a demand for it. We see our 285% year-over-year growth of stable coins. So people are clearly liking the idea of this. Now, again, there have been some spectacular failures, too. But not all stable coins are created the same. But I think the important thing is that we really do need to not just quash innovation. What do you think of how Gary Gensler, the chair of the SEC, and how he's approaching it? One of the things that I hear from founders is that they're very confused because they get told, come in, register, just come in and talk to us. But you have the one company who's done the ultimate act of going in and registering coinbase, file the S1. And still, there's a lot of saber rattling still going on, I think. And again, I don't want to single out the SEC. And I don't want to suggest that anything they're doing is bad. I do think, though, that right now there's a lot of confusion. And one of the pieces of confusion stems from the fact that it started with the ICO mania back in 2016, 2017. I can't even remember which year now, where the SEC was very loud about securities. A lot of them were securities. But the space has changed. And so to still view it through the ICO lens, when so much has happened over the last five years in the space, I think is a mistake. What do you have to say to the skeptics out there who just don't believe in the future of Wem 3? And don't see where this is going. I would say don't judge the current state of innovation by the end state of innovation. I hear from a lot of these skeptics. And by the way, I'm friends with a lot of these skeptics, too. I don't only want to live in a crypto bubble. They want to see the use cases, especially if they're not technical. And look up, two, three. We're really. From the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1070,2022-10-09 05:57:01
12845," From a lot of these skeptics, and by the way, I'm friends with a lot of these skeptics, too. I don't only want to live in a crypto bubble, they want to see the use cases, especially if they're not technical. Well, when am I going to use it? What will I use it for? And I think one of the things that's not appreciated is how quickly the infrastructure here is catching up. And once you have really scalable blockchains that can handle a lot of thorough put and are very efficient, I think that unlocks a whole lot of use cases. People are spending more time on screens. That curve is up and to the right, whether we like it or not, that is the future. I mean, those who have kids know that kids spend more time online. They want digital things, too. And I think to dismiss it, it is a bit generational. I do find not always, but it is a bit generational. If you talk to kids about being able to have money online, they instantly get that concept. They're comfortable not having to hold something in their hand to think it has value. Take us to the end state. Do Google and Amazon and Facebook and Apple still exist? I believe they will still exist. I mean, it depends what you talk about when you talk about the end state. I mean, I think that, you know, I think for decades, those companies will still be around. But the important thing is I think this new ecosystem is going to represent a challenge to them. I do think that those entities, decentralized forces are coming and we'll cut into those entities, profits and revenues. So we have a little rapid fire section. If you could belong to any altcoin tribe, that's what it be. Gosh. There is no way I'm answering that because I will get trolled on Twitter by every other altcoin tribe. I'm a crypto maximalist. I'm a crypto maximalist. All right. Well, I'm not picking one. Booker podcast, you're binging now. Okay. I'm, yes, I am. Gosh, I'm binging on We crashed. Something that brings you simple joy. You know, one of the things that I love and I've missed being away from this summer is swimming. I just love, I find like some of my best thoughts come to me while I'm moving. Career philosophy. Yeah. Do a job where you know 50% of the job and where you're going to learn 50% of the job. Again, that goes back to no growth in the comfort zone, no comfort in the growth zone.

12847," A receptive environment for change and the accountability that comes with guardianship. In many nations the foundation for this approach has been flayed for us long ago if we choose to listen. Where I come from, I'll tear down New Zealand, a beautiful place to must visit. Our indigenous people hold a world view that every single living and non-living thing is connected. Our people, our plants, our animals, descendants of Ranganui the Sky Father and Papa Tuanuku the Earth's Mother and their Children. And so it follows that people and nature are kin, a family. And we must care for one another in the spirit of Kaitiaki Tanga, which translates into guardianship by the people of the land for the next generation. In short, kō ahō te tāau kō te tāau kō ahō. I am the environment and the environment is me. Our life source, our economy, our future. Now I've seen this in action first hand many times, not least in my own backyard, the Pacific where the ocean is a source of protein, income, culture and connection. Now that it is a source of challenge as it rises up and begins to inundate small island nations. It can be confronting to hear and see the stories of just how real these challenges are, but none of us are here because we have given up, but because we believe there is a way to change the future. We are not only part of the nature, but we are nature. Nature is living element. For indigenous people, nature is whole. Our planet is alive. The rivers are her blood. The trees are her hair. The soil, her skin, the wind, her breeze. And indigenous peoples, our planet they know, they are the doctor. We are protecting 80% of the world's biodiversity. Because our way of life do not harm nature at the opposite. We are strengthening ecosystems. We improve biodiversity by cooperating with the birds and trees, listening to the winds, observing the cloud, learning from even the little insect. We protect nature by setting up our own limits. We don't take more that mother earth can give and we give back. We protect the sacred trees. We don't destroy the field of the medicinal plants. We choose, precisely, the animal that we can kill to just keep the balance of the ecosystem. As all of us know in this fight, no one can afford to sit on the sidelines. No one can claim that climate change is somebody else's problem, or to forget of for future generations to address. We are all affected by a warming planet. We see that every day. And decisions being made right now will determine our shared tomorrow. So we must choose and we must act as united nations ourselves. Our progress depends on collective action, on collective ingenuity. If we stick together, we can make fixing the climate the greatest project and greatest achievement of our lifetimes. We have the science, we have the solutions. Now all the world needs is political will. Together we can create a future where rampant carbon is removed from the atmosphere, where green buildings and green business transform the levability of communities, where easy access to renewable energy enables greater equity, where sustainable agriculture feeds a growing global population. The needs are urgent and the costs of inaction are worse than any nightmare. But let us not be driven by, let us be driven by hope not fear, by optimism not despair. Because hope is not passive. Hope is the ultimate source of renewable energy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1073,2022-10-09 06:09:19
12848," by optimism not despair because hope is not passive. Hope is the ultimate source of renewable energy, pushing us forward every day to try and try again. Today, the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit in partnership with Mike Bloomberg and Bloomberg Philanthropies will ask each and every one of us what we can do to accelerate progress to repair our planet this decade. And offer solutions on how to collaborate to drive this ambitious but essential climate agenda. We will continue to drive impact around system-changing climate solutions and amplify the Earth Shop Prize's call to accelerate progress to repair our planet through collaboration and innovation. But most importantly, we will remind ourselves what can be achieved when we turn pessimism to optimism and optimism into action. Coming up, more from the panelists and finalists here at the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit. This is Bloomberg. Hydrogen has a very special place in the Universe. It's the first element on the periodic table. It is the most abandoned element in the Universe. And when clean energy advocates think about what can we find which would be as easy to use as fossil fuels they think about hydrogen. The fuel that will, when burned, only produce water. We like to imagine that if we just built enough of these and these, we could ditch fossil fuels and save the planet. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. There are some things where you just need good old-fashioned combustible fuel. Now startups around the world are betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century. Welcome back to the best of the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit. The guests featured ranged from heads of state to leaders of grassroots environmental organizations. Well, amongst them was philanthropist and Microsoft founder Bill Gates. Yeah, it's too bad you can't do things overnight in either mitigation adaptation. You know, when I last went through Europe, people were, the leaders were all saying, hey, give me technologies so I can tell Putin to get lost. And I said, hey, in five years you're going to be able to call him up. And they were like, no, we'd like it. No. It's the year alone. Okay, that, how's your planning permission regime and all the, you know, planning for that future grid? Seeds typically between the timing start and they get out in the farmers fields is about eight years. Now we have a pipeline of innovations. You know, we've been funding the CG system for 20 years now. It's funded about a billion year. It's if people care at all about adaptation, that thing will be funded at two billion a year. I mean, there won't be anything close to the impact of climate-related seeds, climate-related maize, rice, wheat, sort of a millet. And thank goodness.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1074,2022-10-09 06:13:40
12849," to the impact of climate-related seeds, climate-related maize, rice, wheat, sort of a millet. And thank goodness, because of human genetics, we know how to do the editing, thank goodness because of AI, we know how to find the alleles, because of drones, we can measure stuff in the field. So there's huge advance in terms of how the whole seed ecosystem moves at full speed. The timing is very tricky here. The warming doesn't stop the day you get to zero emissions. There's a lag in this system, it's about a 20-year lag. So you haven't seen that Earth Tempestor's not equilibrated to the atmospheric CO2 content. So when you get to zero, that's not, it's not like 2051, take my air conditioner away. No, it starts quite a bit later. And so you have to look at what the peak is, and you can't just plan for, okay, 2030, 2030 is where your maize production in central Africa is down 25%. By 2050, it's down 70%. And you will have switched in most of those areas from a fairly heat sensitive crop to sorghum. Now sorghum productivity is super low. So we'll get people to do better maize for these next 15 years. And then they are going to have to switch to sorghum. It is tough when you see the floods impact us down. I mean, nobody expected that. You know, if the goal of climate was to make us pay attention, wow, that is way beyond expectation. So some adaptation money literally will just be disafter recovery money. The boundary of what's what is also pretty confusing. I mean, what is food aid? If climate is causing some food production losses, all world food program money is that all climate adaptation money? It's certainly the need for it's going up. That's a system that's about 6.5 billion a year. So relative to the systemic solution, which is the research piece, it's relatively larger. But the demand for that piece, which is the acute, you know, half a pack, Pakistani rice got flushed away. And so you're going to have malnutrition problems if you don't go in for that. That's also a type of adaptation. And, you know, so I do think, you know, we're going to bring some rigor to this because the pressure now, you know, the goal of doubling the adaptation money from, they say 20 billion here to 40 billion here. The pressure on that is still peanuts. No, it's very small. I mean, literally, yeah, if you start sticking food aid in there, you know, you can use it up very quickly, rebuilding after hurricanes. I mean, we had hurricanes before, but, you know, the cost there are absolutely gigantic. You know, there are ways of stopping wildfires. There are ways of dealing with sea level rise. So the innovation agenda, not just on seeds, the innovation agenda is going full speed on, on mitigation. That's where, you know, there's 100 companies break through energies funded. And by mitigation, you mean mostly energy. You mean everything to do with energy. You mean generation of energy. You mean batteries. You mean transport. You mean all of the new. You know, there are new levels that are already traditional. But more that need to come on. So is that's the package that you're talking about mitigation? Yeah. Are you also talking about agriculture as mitigation? Yeah. So every every emissions, you know, the world tends to focus on past near cars and like Christy. That's not a third of emissions. And so the focus on the easiest third. You know, now 4% of new cars are electric. You know, so that's the field that we're further still long. About 4% of energy generation is wind and solar. And as you triple the size of your grid, you want that to be say, you know, some people would say 100%. Other people might say 70 to 80%. You know, the amount you have to build were, you know, not within a factor of five of the build rate of those.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1075,2022-10-09 06:18:11
12850," But we're not within a factor of five of the build rate of those. But those are the easy sectors. Cement, clean cement costs over twice as much as the way we make cement today. And it's not, it's partly the heating energy. It's partly the basic thing, remember in chemistry, when you take calcium carbonate and heat it, you get calcium, that's what makes cement. But the thing that goes away, that's CO2. And so we have to have a way of making cement, which a number of these innovative. And a steel and iron. Yep. There's a whole family of hard to obeyed sectors. That's true. If you get a dead industrial sector, if you get green hydrogen that's cheap enough, it actually solves quite a large number of those. Some of the industrial processes you go straight to electricity, and some you go through, you do your reduction using the hydrogen, where you would have used some hydrocarbon concept before. For steel, we actually have companies doing both. We have electricity steel and others doing electricity is the way of replacing the blast furnace. And then we have others that take hydrogen. And if you get the hydrogen cheap enough, you get the super-magic thing, which is that the green product doesn't cost more, that's called green premium equals zero. And then your adoption scale is utterly different. If we tried to subsidize steel and cement, say rich countries say, OK, we want to get rid of that, which those two are 15% of emissions, that's greater than all foreign aid budgets put together. So over 200 billion foreign aid never will pass that number. It's just not politically possible. It's a number that's at about 170 and going down today. Coming up, but more from the panelists and finalists here at the Earth's Shop Prize Innovation side. This is Bloomberg. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total US greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Buildings across America burn fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy, the electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels, we want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of US greenhouse gas emissions. Markets are preparing to close, but the day is not over yet. It's talked about about 45%. A lot of volatility, right? You need the power of the Bloomberg terminal to get you market moving data before anyone else. There's numbers much higher than expected. Upgraded today to overweight. You need top analysts to bring you exclusive global insight into cross-asset markets. The mini-bond market is a really big focus. Bitcoin ain't going along today. It's going to be short term. Bloomberg markets the close weekdays on Bloomberg. Welcome back to the Earth Shop prize innovation summit. Finalists of the annual award appeared alongside special guests, including worldwide business leaders, philanthropists, and non-governmental activists. Now while the 2022 finalists have been announced, our panelists have their eyes on the future and here's what they had to say. This is the Earth Shop Decade. We are in a race to repair and regenerate the planet. Some will focus on policy. Some will focus on activism. We are focused on supporting the game changers, the innovators, the on-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1076,2022-10-09 06:22:37
12851," some policy, some more focus on activism. We are focused on supporting the game changes, the innovators, the entrepreneurs and the problem solvers. We believe in the power of human ingenuity, grit and determination to create solutions that if scaled could repair the planet. We have only 8% of the ocean protected today. And our first shot is, as Pati said, 30 by 30, 30% of the ocean at least, 30% of the ocean protected by 2030. And we know that if we protect the right 30%, not only will we prevent the extinction of many marine species, but also we will produce more fish. There's going to be these protected areas are going to produce a spillover that will exceed the foregone catch. So we're going to have more fish to eat, food security, livelihoods for people. And we know that for every dollar that we invest in a protected area in a marine reserve that produces $10 in economic output and creates more jobs. So it's a triple win for marine life, for food security and for climate, and of course for the economy. So that's the goal, the mission, to in the next eight years. And that's where the air shot is pretty crazy. In the next eight years, we need to quadruple all the ocean protection that has ever happened in human history. Are you optimistic that can be done? I am optimistic there's no choice. I've seen firsthand the potential that a breakthrough idea can hold. And if we start seeing more of these transformative solutions across all the challenges facing our planet and suddenly our earth shot won't seem so improbable, the work will be difficult. It'll take extraordinary resources, determination, partnership. But we've got all the essentials right here in this room. So what is the challenge? It's the speed, scale, and cost of making these green hydrogen generators. Well, that's exactly what we are working on. Because to make green hydrogen the fuel source of the future, it needs to be cheaper than fossil fuels. And that means, electrolyzers are going to need to be really, really cheap. If you want to take a solution around the globe as quickly as possible, you need to make it standardized, mass-produced commodity. A product that is easy to make and quick to build and cheap as well. And so, while some believe electrolyzers need to be large machines, we believe the electrolyzer should be a standardized, mass-producible product that can make green hydrogen anywhere for anyone. In 2030, we imagine millions and millions of projects on restore. And not just places on earth where we see nature being brought back, but all of the other nodes that are key to ensuring success. So the technology providers, the nurseries, the seed banks, the funders, the government incentive programs, so that we have an ecosystem that really allows us to leverage the many, many connections within the nature-based solution space. And in 2030, we have been focused on another key area, which is cities, and cities require data and insights to take action on climate and to preserve nature, to create more nature and tree canopy. So we've set a goal that we want to- We need more nature in cities, exactly. Exactly, right. And so we've been partnering with cities like Los Angeles to give them insights utilizing AI and geomapping on where all the places that you can create more tree canopy, which reduces urban heat islands, improves air quality sequesters carbon. So we want to bring data and solutions to bringing nature into cities, as well as, of course, preserving and restoring nature. And so one of the goals that we've set is we want to enable over 500 cities around the world. I know we're going to hear from the mayor of Paris after this to reduce a gigaton of carbon emissions by 2030. And so that's through data, tools, and sites, whether that's evolving transportation systems or planting new tree canopy. So that's a big bold target that we want to see achieved by 2030. Anyway, I guess I'm in the wrong place. I came here to invite all of you to the grouch convention.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1077,2022-10-09 06:26:57

But it turns out you're all about my least favorite thing. Helping. Oh. You've got me, Oscar. I do like helping people learn how to reuse repurpose and recycle. Together, everyone in this room can build a world where nothing goes to waste. And that includes even you. Me? Sorry, Mike. I got to get going to that convention, but just between us. Yes. I do have a recycling bin right next to my can. But no, I think it out OK. It'll ruin my image. But my father believed in the power of the idea. And over time, the vision, the purpose, the courage, it embodied, has inspired each generation to take on its own challenges, not because they're easy, but because they're hard. President Kennedy understood that the effort to land on the moon would bring out the best in us that everyone would have to contribute, that it would require innovation, creativity, teamwork, commitment, and faith. And that world would be better because of it. The Earth Shot Prize has inspired the same spirit of optimism and ingenuity on a global scale to tackle the most pressing challenge we now face, repairing the planet. My family and I are so excited that the Prince of Wales will honor this year's Earth Shot Prize winners in partnership with the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, a city that is committed to scientific excellence, environmental justice, and the fight against climate change. We're proud that President Kennedy's moonshot legacy still inspires hope, and we look forward to welcoming all of you who are working to ensure a better future here on Earth.

Very stressful, very stressful. Especially, we are a small company, in a way, and you have to fight people who have those huge companies who put you 27 lawyers on your back for something which is yours is very stressful.

That thing, I could have definitely if you avoid it. But it's done. Did you realize at the time when you started the company that you would become so successful and actually so big? No. No. You know, when I started the company, I wanted to have a shop in Paris, which is my hometown. And I wanted to do pretty shoes for pretty girls. That was my goal. And now you look back and you say, actually, I still make pretty shoes, but for many more women. Yeah, absolutely. Do you think you would've been so successful without the Red Soul? I think the Red Soul definitely, of course, participates to my work, but also to the fame of my shoes because it's instantly recognizable. But then, you know, the design is very important. But definitely, when you have such a strong sign of recognition, it participates to, yeah. Bloomberg has enhanced search on the terminal to deliver what you need when you need it.

Music In 2021, Shake Shack was looking to hire a new chief financial officer. The fast casual restaurant chain found the perfect candidate in an unexpected place. Wall Street. I had worked at Goldman Sachs for about 16 years. I was covering the restaurant sector. Katie and I worked together for a long time. She was an analyst covering our stock. The day that I knew I was looking for a new CFO, the day that I announced it, I went to a recruiter and I said, what about Katie for a career? I remember working with her. You think she might be interested in this? That same day, she had heard about it and went to her family and said, this is the job I want. Literally that same day. It was something that I always wanted to take a more of a leadership role at a company. We hit it off. Katie Fogourney spent the first part of her career asking hard questions about corporate strategy. Now she's responsible for answers. I think that there's a number of things that a cell-side research analyst can lend to a company, especially a company that is in high growth mode. One, it's just really a very firm ability to analyze strategic decisions, to really get into the numbers, into the models, and to have a firm view of different scenarios out there. When those Wall Street executives move into the company seat, they bring an understanding, hopefully, of the fundamentals, company sector, but also what it means to be a stock. The total stakeholder perspective includes shareholders. How are we measuring the incrementality of a great offer like this? Katie's skill set, so uniquely, is able to harvest in her mind so much data and information, turn it quickly into tremendous insights. That end up driving our strategic priorities. That is her sweet spot. I look at a CFO from Wall Street, as someone who can bring a breath of fresh air to a business that often can become very in-bred. They're extremely grounded in data. They're curious about data. They're pushing the data. They know what to do with the data and tie that into telling the story. The reality check that Katie brings to the business to say, you know, I know you think this, but let me tell you what the data is really telling us here. She's still looking at data to predict the future. Only now, she's taking it a step further. Before, it was a lot of kind of sitting almost in an armchair type basis and analyzing different, you know, pieces of information to see where I thought the best investment dollar would be allocated. Here, it is actually driving a plan of how we can best maximize shareholder returns. It is about leveraging data analytics, driving real insights through, you know, not just your own guest data, but leveraging statistical models and really kind of figuring out where the best strategic decisions will be made over time. This is an industry that really needs that type of analysis that help the strategic vision now more than ever, and so it was incredibly exciting to start to apply that here at Shake Shack. Shake Shack. Shake Shack began as a humble hot dog card in New York's Madison Square Park. It opened its first restaurant as a kiosk in that park in 2004. A decade later, there were more than 60 Shake Shack restaurants around the world.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1079,2022-10-09 06:35:32
12854," part in New York's Madison Square Park. It opened its first restaurant as a kiosk in that park in 2004. A decade later, there were more than 60 Shake Shack restaurants around the world. And in early 2015, the company went public. At the end of 2021, Shake Shack and its license partners operated nearly 400 locations in 16 countries. At least 60 more are expected to open by the end of 2022. We always feel like we're just getting started at Shake Shack. Somehow, you know, we kind of describe ourselves as a public startup. We have a huge footprint and white space out there that we can grow globally. And we're going to continue to do that. The pace of expansion is nothing new for this company, but maybe different is the shape. Shake Shack has thrived in high-density urban locations, which provided 60% of revenues before the pandemic. But returned to office patterns during COVID have been unpredictable hampering sales growth in cities. Now Shake Shack is exploring new formats as it extends its footprint in suburbs. It is not just a reaction to COVID. This is stuff that we've been working on before. What COVID did was accelerated the pace and excitement, frankly, for some of the things that we've been planning before. Drive through amongst them as the most important. We were right at a pivotal moment of thinking drive-throughs were obsolete and then COVID hit and it was a saving grace. When you get out into the suburban areas, drive-in becomes incredibly important because that's convenience. And if a significant percentage of your business is drive-up, you need a smaller facility. So the investment can be smaller. This is the first time the company has ever put in a drive-through. We opened up our first one in December of last year. We have six open, very exciting stuff. Drive-through lanes offer long-term opportunities to build revenue and increase margins. But right now they carry a higher price tag. Overall, we've seen a rise in our build costs. We talk about 10 to 15 percent higher build costs across the board. Things are just costing more. It makes site selection ever more important. It makes all of the work that we do in real estate and that whole process incredibly more important. Since Katie Fogarty became CFO of Shake Shack in June 2021, inflation has risen at a record rate, making her job that much harder. Everything that enters our business, commodities, foods, cost of building restaurants is getting more expensive. I don't see that ending anytime soon. And we've got to continue to plan for it. If you look at the price of beef, if you look at the price of dairy, eggs, all of these core things, even paper and packaging. It's just meaning that everything costs us more and more and more and we're not alone. This is happening to the entire industry right now. The industry is also dealing with a sea change on the labor front. Our lewages have soared and the great resignation has hit restaurants hard. Labor costs aren't going down because of the training and turnover at the 30, 60 and 90 day mark. If someone's, you know, can even figure the job out, do they stay? And that's still not under control whatsoever. So while maybe like the actual wage inflation can deeper turnover and training costs are still elevated. We've invested more than $10 million in our employees over the past year and we're going to continue to invest more. We're testing four day work weeks to help, you know, especially our working parents kind of juggle that balance between childcare and your work. I know I deal with that all the time. This is really a people first company. In even an inflationary environment, you're going to see us continue to lead with our people. Do you worry at all about a price wage spiral, not just here, but in the industry, in the economy? Yes. And I think that, you know, this is something that, you know, many business leaders are focused on and, you know, time will tell kind of how all of this lands. I think the wage price spiral continues for quite some time. And I think we probably have been a lot less aggressive than we can be and than many other companies have been in terms of raising prices. Yes. We've taken our time. If you look at a 20 year history of pricing in this company, we've taken about 2% a year on average. We've never taken what we could. We've always taken what we should. We have to pay people more. We have been and will continue to do so. We'll take a little bit of a margin compression on that as we've had to. And I think that's the right thing. So that for the long term, Big Jack continues to be what we're building, which is the next generation's burger joint.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1080,2022-10-09 06:39:53
12855," The role of CFO in a company like ours that's so dynamically growing, so constantly changing, and focused on digital is critical. Candy plays such an amazing role there. She's not just moving numbers around. You know, this is not your grandfather's CFO anymore. The digital infrastructure, the way we think about things now, is a monster that needs to be fed all day long every day and is always hungry. And you could probably have 150 digital priorities today that all our teams will fight about. Ops wants this, tech wants this, marketing wants this, I want this, Katie wants that. Katie's job is to take all that prioritization, think it through, understand which one is going to have the best return on capital, and which ones have no return on capital, and you still got to do them anyway. That's the reality of the world we live in right now, and it's critical to lead that in the right way. I visited a Manhattan shack with Katie Fogarty. Our first stop inside the restaurant was an ordering kiosk. And on the burger side, you can see the option here for the bourbon bacon jam burger, with shallots on top, the avocado bacon burger as well, our beloved smoked shack. The kiosk is our investment in engagement. We just see a gas kind of sit with the menu and really appreciate and understand how they can customize their order for the different add-ons that they have. So we really do believe that this provides them with an even better experience than going to the cash register. What's the payoff? I mean the cost to put one of these in compared to how much more a customer spends on a kiosk. We do see a very nice lift off of the kiosk. And actually this is not even a very fancy kiosk technology, it's an iPad. What has more investment tied to it, it's just the constant innovations that we've had to make the kiosk functionality better and better. And we're driving towards a parody situation where the kiosk and the cash register have exactly the same functionality. And we want the kiosk to be able to identify who you are and what you like to order when you come into the shack. Improvements like these take resources. Shake Shacks, General and Administrative Expenses have risen as the companies put capital behind digital initiatives and the changes ripple out from there. As our digital evolution has been underway, we've had to make a number of adjustments to the layout of our current existing shack base and really rethink the flow of the shack that we're building in order to really capitalize and enable and let our digital business thrive. And many Shacks we've taken out cash registers, we've moved them around. A lot of times it's two or three cash registers that are just taken down to one. We've had to really rethink the way that the flow of our guest journey is in our shack. So one perfect example of it is we put in pickup shelves here at most of our restaurants. Guests who are looking for that to go experience can come in and pick up the order to go and they don't have to sit there and wait with everybody else who is waiting for their food ready to be made. We are constantly monitoring and identifying ways to be better in the kitchen. And it also goes down to the products and the types of offerings that we have. You know, we never want to have something that is going to overly complicate our team members' journey. We don't want to have something that's going to slow us down operationally. So you'll see a lot of our LTOs just really be building a four-menu ingredients and allowing our teams to kind of do a little bit different with what we already have. LTO stands for limited time offer. It might be a special shake flavor or partnerships like a recent venture with the Stiller Makers Mark. But Shake Shack's core offering is the burger. And it's not just any burger. The company pledges to source premium meat that's ethically raised and costs more even when inflation's not at historic levels. I've heard a lot about the importance of the quality to you guys in terms of ingredients. Doesn't that get expensive, especially right now? Quality beef must be rising in terms of price. I mean, we've always used premium ingredients and those premium ingredients that come at a higher price. We always have an eye on the margin. But we know also at the end of the day, you're running a very dangerous game. If you're trying to reverse engineer into something that, you know, you want from a P&L standpoint, the guests might not like it. Shake Shack's standing firm on quality.

12856," From a P&L standpoint, the guests might not like it. Shake Shack's standing firm on quality, and it's also practicing transparency, announcing plans to raise menu prices by 5% to 7% in the fourth quarter of 2022. Shake Shack is the best example, the definition of a fantastic value proposition. However, not all customers across this country have, you know, that change in their pocket to pay for that average ticket at lunch or dinner. And I think they're very comfortable with that. And I think it's very interesting and very different than what others are doing. I mean, it is who they are. They're not trying to escape it. They're not trying to be something they're not. And the fact of the matter is if they picked a different path and it's fine, it would be hard to pivot back. We are serving fresh, whole muscle, hormone antibiotic free beef. That is a totally different thing than you're going to eat at nearly all other restaurants, certainly traditional fast food. And you got to pay more for that and you should want to. And when you see things like $10 or $2 for $5, we can't do that because our ingredients cost more than that to bring it to you and you should want to pay more for that. And frankly, who am I to argue? It's a little crunchy, it's bacon, it's a crunchy. I like that. It's delicious. I might finish this. Coming up, why Shake Shack believes it's got everything to gain by going global. I mean, there's so many opportunities for us to add to our license business. We see it as a huge, white space opportunity for us. And Katie Fogarty tells me what skills she's relied on while making the transition from Wall Street analyst to CFO. I would say just a lot of grit. I never thought it was going to be easy and it's proved to be quite the learning opportunity. This is Bloomberg. So what's the best investment advice you've ever been given by anybody? The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day. And if you keep at it and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's not just interest. It was always said about compound interest returns, compound business returns, compound human returns. They're all very additive because you'll learn every day. And if you keep at it, it's very, very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make selling at the wrong time? And they sell when the prices go down? Yes. Not keeping, but people have conviction or they invest for the, if they invest for the right reasons, just keep at it. You will put a woman on Mars. You will bring forth global cooling. You will be the first chief crypto officer. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer, disrupt. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. Nearly 90% of Shake Shack locations in the US are company operated. Around the world it's a different story. The business has grown internationally by working with licensed partners to operate restaurants. That's a trend they intend to keep going. Today we have Shake Shack since 16 countries, everywhere from China to Singapore to the Philippines to London and beyond. We see it as a huge, white space opportunity for us. Many restaurant brands struggle to move outside of their own core market in the United States. Perhaps it's something that's a very new England. And when they try to move outside of the new England area, guest reception is just not there.

12857," Perhaps it's something that's very New England, and when they try to move outside of the New England area, guest reception is just not there. Or it's a West Coast brand that takes 50 years to bleed across the country. The thing about Shake Shack and the magic about it is this is a company that can sit here with only 200 restaurants in the US today, open up one in a Tier 2 city in China. And the guest reception for that restaurant is mind blowing. These are some of the largest opens that we've ever had. We have big plans for our license business. It's a really asset light, cash accretive business for us. We love it. And we love it when our partners overseas make a ton of money, because they're going to build more restaurants. We're going to all continue to grow. I mean, there's so many opportunities for us to add to our license business. And certainly, I get so many text messages from people traveling the world. If there is a Shake Shack there, guess which one this one is. And if there's not one, why don't you have one here? The first Shake Shack in mainland China opened in 2019. And there are now more than 20. Although the government's zero COVID policy is weighed on revenues, the company is committed to expanding its presence. China's a fascinating business for us. It's one of the most exciting and biggest opportunities Shake Shack has. Over the initial couple of years of the pandemic, they've faired much better than we did here and much better than most places around the world. Today, it has been erratic. It's been lockdowns. It's been closures. But here's what's amazing. The resiliency of the Chinese people, our team over there, is unlike anything I've witnessed. It is one of the toughest places to do business in the world. But our brand seems to be really resonating with people over there right now. And I see it as one of the biggest areas of growth we have at Shake Shack. Restaurants haven't been resonating with Wall Street recently. The sector has underperformed the S&P 500 for much of 22. But the industry is historically resilient. Restaurants are undervalued right now. As a person who has been following restaurants since I had hair, I think restaurants are probably the most flexible and most creative of businesses that we have. The routine and the social engagement happens at restaurants. And that's not changing just because we may or may not go into the recession. It just isn't going to change. And so the restaurant sucks will rebound. This industry is the third largest employer, all the population of workers in this country. This is the fabric of the economy. And the economy will rebound. And restaurants sucks will blow up. If you want to trade in and out of Shake Shack, this may not be the time for you. If you are a believer in the brand of Shake Shack for the long term, like we are and have been, we're going to create tremendous value for our shareholders over time. We've done that. Shareholders should measure us on are we building things for the long term? And if you want to be here for the long term, my sense is Shake Shack's going to be good, bet. One of Shake Shack's long term assets is a bright new CFO. Katie Fogarty now has a year of experience under her belt. I wanted to know what she sees when she looks ahead. What's the opportunity for Shake Shack in the next 10 years that excites you the most? I have to say it is in watching our people grow and develop. I see a very strong growth roadmap here for the company in terms of units and sales potential. But what that really means at the end of the day is that our hourly team members are able to grow a career with us in a way that is unique to Shake Shack and cannot be found at many other restaurant brands. We have a number of people who start off as hourly team members and are now making six figures and have equity because they've grown up through the system and they're paying it forward by training other people to allow them to have such a great career path as well. What's the challenge over the next 10 years that keeps you up at night? It also goes with people. It has been a very challenging staffing environment for the restaurant industry as a whole. It's been well telegraphed that some people have just left the industry altogether. And so we know when we have high turnover, we're not operating at our best. And so I do think that there's an amazing opportunity that once kind of the world stabilizes and returns back to normal, that we have people considering the restaurant industry as more of an exciting long-term career. in terms of your role as C.A.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1084,2022-10-09 06:59:27
12858," that we have people considering the restaurant industry as more of an exciting long-term career. In terms of your role as CFO, how do you see that or your role with this company changing and developing over the next 10 years? I think that it becomes ever more important to have a great grasp on the insights that are driving the business, on the factors that are driving your business. And that's very important for CFO to do, but also to collaborate with other business leaders within the company to help kind of cross-pollinate strategies. Whatever I do in a vacuum is not going to be nearly as impactful as our entire executive leadership team coming together and acting on something. And I think that that is ever more apparent sitting on this side of the table than it was on the other side as a Wall Street analyst. Speaking of that, what skill or what area of knowledge do you think has helped you the most in your first year as CFO? I would say just a lot of grit. This has been a very challenging industry for sure. I never thought it was going to be easy and it's proved to be quite the learning opportunity. Coming in every day just excited to learn something new and make a difference wherever you can, knowing that I'm sitting here with a team of people, growing a company that will potentially have an impact on a number of people's lives going forward. So what advice would you give someone else then who maybe is watching and gets promoted to CFO? What advice would you give to a future CFO? What advice would I give to a future CFO? I guess I would just be get into the details super, super deep. And really kind of understand and ask a lot of questions. Peel the onion. I think a lot of people just don't go deep enough and don't ask the questions so that you actually cannot, you know, if you're not versed on what's going on, you can't find root cause and you can't try to change. So, you know, I would say get into the details, have an open mind. It's an incredibly fun job for sure. Working with people who are coming, you know, everybody's aligned here to drive the future of Shake Shack, but everybody comes at it from a different angle. So it's very exciting to work with an amazing team of people. I'm Matt Miller. This is Bloomberg. We don't have enough women founder CEOs who are getting funding. So basically less than 2% of VC funds go to women, less than 1% go to women of color. And so in this innovation space, I said to myself, what's the best way to use capital to move things for women? And that's when I started to say, okay, I actually need to move some money into the venture capital space. And I want to do it smartly. I mean, the first goal is to make money. I'm not putting my money out as a social impact. I'm putting it out to make money. But I wanted to go behind funds like aspect ventures that's run by Theresa Gauch and Jennifer Fonsdatt who are looking at these opportunities. And they have a thesis around my gosh. There are so many opportunities there. If we go towards funding some of these women businesses. Some LPs have said to me, all we care about is returns. Some of the best investors may not be the best people, but they have the best returns. What do you have to say to those people? I have to say you're investing in what you know. And so you need to look at what trends are coming in the nation and how you're going to address them. Women are 85% of consumer dollars spent. Women control 70% of financial decisions in the house. So if you're not investing in products that go towards females or a women led company, you're missing an opportunity because you just don't see it.

You got me, Bid. Very good game. Well played. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Welcome everybody to the inaugural NIL Summit and NIL Awards. This is the NIL Summit. The NIL Summit was in fact a flashy star-studded event put on at the college football hall of fame. Among those current and former names in sports and media, there was a crucial cohort, the player's poised to redefine what it means to be a modern college athlete. And the winner of male athlete of the year goes to Chase Griffin. Among those up-and-comers, UCLA's Chase Griffin. The UCLA quarterback is among the students becoming as well known for making deals as making plays. And even in that group, Chase stands out. My name is Chase Griffin. What's up, everyone? It's Chase Griffin. It's your favorite quarterback, it's favorite quarterback, Chase Griffin. When you look at it as an empowerment equity opportunity, it's really been unmatched in the sports world for any point in time since Title IX. Let's go. After hardly a full year of name-image and likeness deals being a reality, he already has more than 20 deals with major brands, venture and charitable groups, all the while balancing graduating undergrad in just two years and fighting for playing time on the field. Chase Griffin out of the gun. We are joined by UCLA quarterback Chase Griffin, not just UCLA quarterback, but name-image likeness superstar. Why am I so excited for this one? This kid could actually be the president of the United States someday. Chase isn't the starting quarterback for UCLA, he's not even the backup quarterback. But back on campus in LA, his nickname is President Chase. And after spending a couple days talking about his approach to business, sports and equality, it's not shocking to think he might someday hold that office. His level of focus and maturity at the stage, I only wish I had. If you want to buy stock and human being, buy stock and Chase Griffin. When it comes to building generational wealth, it's not about the money that you make in college. I'm very excited that I made the amount of money that I made last year. I am even ten times more excited that I know how to make that money. Some are on any college campuses mostly.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1085,2022-10-09 07:06:15
12860," Some are on any college campuses mostly for the athletes who are on lighter but still regimented schedules. Attending classes working out, a little bit of hanging out, and then more working out on their own time. Chase is no exception. The 21-year-old is a backup, albeit an impatient one. In the topsy-turvy past couple of seasons dotted with fan-less games and COVID protocols, he's been able to start three games for the Bruins. Meeting Arizona and narrowly losing to both Stanford and Oregon. For Chase, UCLA felt like destiny. He was born just a few miles away before his family moved to Texas when he was a toddler. But beyond being a sort of homecoming, the school's history of athlete activism was a massive draw. I always expected from myself to have some sort of impact that was beneficial for more people than I interact with on a daily basis. And choosing UCLA, a lot of that went into me seeing myself as someone who reflected the same want to make things better, that so many of the people that UCLA prides itself upon be in the home for have done in the past. The legacies of former UCLA greats like Arthur Ash, Jackie Robinson, Karim Abdul Jabbar, and Jackie Joyner Kursi have had a wide-ranging impact on society well beyond the Westwood campus. Chase reveres these people, but he's perhaps most keenly aware of the activism of a more recent Bruin alum, the basketball player at O'Bannon. And who played at UCLA from 91 to 95 initiated a lawsuit that's widely credited for finally opening up the possibility of college athletes being paid for use of their name, image, and likeness. He sued the NCAA in video game publisher EA for anti-trust violations, arguing that athletes should be entitled to financial compensation when schools used their likeness for gain. In 2014, a judge ruled in his favor. And then on an episode of the shop, surrounded by O'Bannon, Diana Terossi, and LeBron James, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed the first ultimately successful legislation to allow athletes to receive endorsement deals. The fair pay to play act led other states to follow suit and ultimately led the NCAA in 2021 to relent, seemingly reluctantly. NIL payments were officially allowed as of July 1, 2021. Today is the last day where name, image, and likeness laws will not be on the books, and kids will not be, if you will, not allowed to make money off of their name, image, and likeness. Making money from Jersey sales and endorsement deals is a way for players to share in the massively lucrative world of college athletics. This NIL thing is the wild, wild West. The NIL change felt like many things that happened very slowly and then it happened very fast. And I wonder for you having contemplated that maybe this was coming at some point, how prepared were you, what was your mindset when the switch flipped? Right. I mean, I still think everyone's trying to get prepared for the industry. It's still sort of like a wild, wild West. I wasn't really expecting anything. I was more just thinking about honestly getting ready for that season.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1086,2022-10-09 07:09:53
12861," I wasn't really expecting anything. I was more just thinking about honestly getting ready for that season and capitalizing on everything that was happening. When NIO hit and it turned out I had action and I was like, oh okay, well after this degree deal which was fantastic. I was like, okay, I see how I can be a staple in this game and I see how I can get better over time. That's why I teamed up with my friends at Shell. I'm not a Shell deal hit and then boost my old deal hit. Then you keep on building clear cover. Like you keep on building and you get better in the meetings and most of all you start seeing where your value can be best placed in these new opportunities. The headlines and storylines in the aftermath of the NIO change introduce visions of instant millionaire strolling campuses across the nation. You might think the NIO athlete of the year lives in Splendor or at least in one of those athletic halices that put most of our coach dorms to shame. Well, it's all relative to chase. All right, Jason. So here we are, World Headquarters. Yep, this is where it all happens. So there's the kitchen right here. I actually really enjoy cooking. Oh yeah. Yeah, this gas oven gets really hot really fast. I make pizzas in there. This is the best appliance since the iPhone. Air Friday you put anything in there. I need to do these dishes right here. Yeah. So no trappings of success yet more a pretty average college dorm room. The fridge filled with leftovers, a well-used PS4 and of course, the requisite Godfather poster. It's a far cry from the lifestyle seen in some local news reports for NIO athletes during this first year. These are Robinson made headlines with an NIO deal with Lamborghini Austin. Lamborghini's tend to make more headlines than Muhammad Ali are Bruce Lee pictures. Some athletes are living in mansions driving Lamborghinis. As far as I know, you're doing either of those things. I see where you're living right here. It is with all the respect not a mansion. How much of that is a conscious choice and what does it say about sort of your approach to this? Right. I mean, first off, I look at this is like is my own room a guy? Everything I need. I'm cool with that. I'm cool with living below my knees. I think it's important to remember that the volume of financial gain is completely overstated. That's what it y'all is following. The media and someone here's about a five million or ten million dollar deal. You've got to report it like oh my goodness people are going to read this. I'd count two things like how many kids are even getting these deals and then for the kids that do get it, how much of that is in liquor cash and how much of it is in assets. If you pay for a two million dollar house out here in LA for a kid to stay in the college, that's great. But as soon as they're graduated, they're not going to have that two million dollars. I say the same thing, you know, for the kids who are driving around in Lamborghinis and stuff like that. That's awesome. That's super dope and I know some of those kids. But, you know, someone paying for your lease is different than someone actually giving you the value of that lease every single month. You're investing in saving it for a long pay, etc. I say all that just to mention that product deals and stuff like that are overhyped by the media and they also can land kids in some trouble if they're not paying taxes on it. That's one of the distinctly unsexy and easy to overlook elements of the new rules. Even if an athlete's not getting cold hard cash from a deal, the value of any products given are subject to state and federal taxes. So suddenly, what a player sees as free gear in return for some social media posts actually equals taxable income. And that requires the same forms you'd fill out as an independent contractor getting a check. I made a fair amount in NIO deals and I invested all of it. In my opinion, NIO is great. Doing all this is great. Making money now is great, but the most valuable thing I've gotten from all of this is in fact, I'll always know how to make money off of myself. All told, Chase has done more than 20 deals with major brands like Degree, Shell, and Boost Mobile, along with venture-stage companies including Discord, Duffel, and Creative Juice. He's a-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1087,2022-10-09 07:14:44

He's also made a point to work with charities like the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, where he's already raised funds for almost 60,000 meals. Imagine simply climbing a cable into space. The concept is known as the space elevator. Not only could it significantly change how we leave planet Earth, but it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space.

In this case, direct TV is looking to market their NFL Sunday ticket to college students.

Are they video posts or are they picking captions? They can be either. It's up to you guys. That was pretty good. 400 above, but they had originally asked. So that's a win.

12863," That's a win. So yeah, I mean, at this point, after I do a Zoom or something like that, I had to chill out, go back to land down if I was watching a movie or something, or, you know, go to YouTube, just start looking for more samples. It's a pretty simple interaction for Chase and for Direct TV. He's been working over a couple of emails in Zoom calls and papered with a contract Chase will have his dad look over before he signs. And Chase, who's made himself as much of a student of the new NIL marketplace as he has a public policy at UCLA, says he understands why it's working. A brand ambassador with ship with an athlete is more attractive to these brands and hours of terminal investment than even a post by a famous actor. If there's any place to learn that sports are deep in the hearts of Americans, it's on a high school football field in Texas. Friday night lights in the Lone Star State might be the great iron equivalent of Frank Sinatra's New York City, making it there needs your something special. Let's talk about some of the top quarterbacks in the state and when you look at that list at the top of it, you got to talk about Chase Griffin. I was lucky to play three years as a quarterback for Hado High School, which is a one horse town. We have great success. And so the town really shut down and came out and supported us every Friday night. Chase, one word to describe that finish that I can. God, that's it. Coming from a town like that where football is so prioritized, it has pros and cons, but I think on the pros side, I learned how to win, how to get better, and most importantly, what it's like to build a team where everyone gets better. Emulating his UCLA alumni like Robinson, Joyner Cursey and Abdul Jabbar, Chase is looking at the impact NIL will have not just for him, but the athletes that will follow. When the predecessors who have come before you have changed the world and made life better for everyone today, you can't help but ask yourself how the actions that you're taking now and the companies and brands and the NIL space that you work with are all cumulatively building something greater than any of us could foresee. I've actually, I've never moderated. So this will be my first time. It should be fun. I know my handwriting is terrible. The last day the conference chase was asked to co-moderate a panel with Monique Nelson, the CEO for UNI World Group. All right, I'm excited to be here. UNI World Group is one of the longest standing multicultural advertising and marketing agencies in the United States. The firm works with brands like Ford, Home Depot and Johnson and Johnson to help reach the Black and Brown communities, and they have big ambitions in NIL. For UNI World Group, the idea of this was pretty epic in that because we serve the undervalued overlooked and the underserved, we knew that this particular group of people would fall into that category. And we plan on being the premier practice for NIL athletes that are looking to do purpose-driven, media advertising, community level engagement work. UWG launched a program called the NIL to help Black student athletes partner with major brands. But to help them understand how to do that, they brought on chase to serve as a student athlete executive in residence. For me, I do nothing without tremendous amounts of data for all of our clients. I really wanted to be thoughtful about this practice being very athlete-centric. I repeat,我 goals by working in the press agency for the vanilla design purpose.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1089,2022-10-09 07:23:23
12864," Without tremendous amounts of data for all of our clients, I really wanted to be thoughtful about this practice being very athlete-centric. If I were to build it or anyone on my team were to build it, it would not have the athlete at the core. When you're 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, the best way to have credibility is confidence and the only way for confidence to be authentic. I'm actually learning on the job. I'm learning about the brand side of NIO, but I'm also trying to make sure that empowerment equity is built in, especially for black student athletes in the NIO world. ROI. Return on investment. Both Chase and UWG see NIO deals as something much more than making money for students. It's also a potential investment in a community long overlooked. Think we're getting ready to stop boxes, trying to feed the people of L.A. A piece of each of Chase's NIO deals go to his belief brand campaign, which has raised more than $13,000 for meals for the L.A. Food Bank backpack program. But athletes giving back is only one side. I'm here with legal zoom to give you five tips on the NIO game plan. UWG and Chase believe having brands investing in the athletes, especially athletes of color, can be a force multiplier for these historically marginalized communities. When you look at the revenue, JTN rating sports for the bomb ass, 88% of those athletes are black. So when you're doing stuff to empower student athletes in the NIO space, you're also helping to deliver on your promise. Most student athletes are not the only ones who should receive this help by any means. But statistically, by doing that, you're going to be delivering on your mission. Additionally, student athletes on average come from lower levels of income. So you're also delivering on that promise. And a lot of these student athletes are first generation, their first gen college students. Some of them first gen high school diploma. Some of them first time receiving the amount of money that they receive in their families. This has been a wild first year in NIO. We all knew that there would be bags of cash around, right? There's always been bags of cash. There's cash everywhere. What we know is that that's not sustainable. We know that athletics has an expiration date on it. So for us, inclusion ultimately means this is just a part of you. It is a tremendous part of you. And we are going to celebrate that part of you. But we also know that you're bigger than that. So we want to empower you to live past your expiration date for this part of your life. And quite honestly, have equity in everything that you have poured yourself into as an NIO athlete. It may still be the Wild West days for the NIO industry. But in the first year, about a billion dollars in business was done with NCAA athletes. For the early leaders in the NIO space like Chase, they're striking a precedent for athletes that follow them. And that's important because collegiate athletes don't have that much time to profit. Only an estimated 2% of NCAA athletes go on to the pros. Even the hardest working are often limited by things they can't control. For Chase, it's been his height. I'm 5'10 now in high school after my sophomore year went up through for 3000 yards. I was probably like 5'6, 5'5. I mean, I could argue we say I'm one of the best in the history of Texas high school football. But I've gone through the height test where they'll call you out of class, shake your hand, look at you up and down. And be like, nice to meet you, you go back to class. It's a sad but timeless story for student athletes. And for Chase, his story is something he's not shyed away from, but embraced when it comes to his NIO deals. I'm frequently the smallest person on the football field, but I always strive to be the most impactful. My middle school coach taught me that I would never play in high school. Chase's deals with degrees breaking limits team and clear covers inspired underdogs allowed him to capitalize financially from football.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1090,2022-10-09 07:27:44
12865," I would never play in high school. Chase's deals with degrees breaking limits team and clear covers inspired underdogs allowed him to capitalize financially from football. Even the last season, he never saw the field for UCLA. I play football because I love the game. I play the football because I'm a good competitor. I love to compete and I play football because I'm good at it. At the end of the day, I don't play football for my livelihood, which is important to remember when it comes down to identity. I myself chase Griffin as long as I'm that. I got something in this world. As he moves into the new season and focuses more on football than business, Chase doesn't see much of a differentiation between the two in terms of his mindset. I wouldn't be surprised if I wasn't playing football in five years and it was running in the Fortune 500 company, but I also want to be surprised if I was winning a Superbowl five-ten years from now. Either way, I'm going to keep on working at the tools that would align myself and my future with both. At the end of the day, you're always going to have yourself. If you can make profit off of yourself and know where you add value in any world you're in, you'll be able to adapt and find ways to generate wealth through yourself. Part of what I love about business is you get to build things from nothing. I don't have any investors. All this is all money and this is me just building. It's pretty much full service shadow banking with nobody in charge. When the price of anything goes up, the consequences reach far beyond what you'd expect, but perhaps most of all when it comes to food. In 2010, surging food prices helped spark the Arab Spring. Lives were lost, regimes fell and the consequences are still with us. Once again, food prices are rising and fast. Energy costs, broken supply chains and surging demand were just some of the factors that have driven food prices to their first record high since the Arab Spring. That's all before a war between two of the world's biggest food producers. Ukraine is called the Bread Basket of Europe and taken with Russia the two account for about a quarter of global wheat trade. They produce more than half of the world's sunflower seeds in oil, nearly 20% of the barley. Now throw in rising energy prices and processing, transporting, even refrigerating food gets more expensive, plus fertilizer production is extremely energy intensive. Less fertilizer means lower crop yield and prices rise even more. The pandemic revealed how complicated and fragile global trade systems are. Global agriculture, perhaps even more so. Unlike metals, for example, food goes bad. And crops take months to grow and are vulnerable to unpredictabilities like the weather. Rising food prices will be felt everywhere, but the poorest countries in the world will be hit the hardest. And as all these factors compound, the real fear is that record high will lead to record high and ultimately to a global food crisis with vast consequences.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1091,2022-10-09 07:31:42
12866," This is the market that over the past few weeks has made it clear it wants to go higher. It got a little spooked by the idea that geolphe will protect the rises. We make it very transparent to the shopper before they accept an order. But the order is going to look like how much work on the pays them and how much consumer is paying them. And so they can decide whether they take an order or whether they refuse it. And that's a kind of flexibility. That's our shoppers really value and the kind of transparency that they want. Are you seeing a labor shortage right now? And what are you doing to come back at? It's different in different places. Our demographic of shoppers is completely different from food delivery and our right sharing where 70% women and half of them are moms.

Hello and welcome to Emma Barnett meets. And this week I'm meeting the space experts and physicist Professor Brian Cox. And I'm really looking forward to asking him about how he gets his head around the vastness of space and to explain it to all of us or try to anyway. How he also goes about his daily life when he knows how insignificant we really are and what he makes of NASA's new telescope and those amazing images. Welcome to the programme. Thank you so much for coming to talk to me and to all of our viewers. And I actually wanted to start with a new NASA telescope. Well come to your particular project in a moment. But it's named after the man who ran the agency in the 60s and oversaw the first man mission to the Moon, James Webb. What do you make of what we're seeing so far? Because it's pretty incredible. Yeah, it's a remarkable instrument. I mean, you think of the predecessor, which is the Hubble Space Telescope. I think it's almost impossible to imagine a world without that. Even if you don't know, the images that we're familiar with at the universe, many of them, the spectacular galaxies in star-forming regions, they're from Hubble. But the web is a significant step forward. And technically, one of the most important things is it can see what we call longer wavelength light, or infrared light. And that's important because if you think about, we want to see the first galaxies forming. So we want to understand how the first stars and galaxies formed in the universe. And so what you do is you look far out into the universe. And because light travels quite slowly across cosmic distances, let's say you have a galaxy that's the most distant one you can see with an naked eye, is about two million light years away. So that means that the light has been traveling for two million years to reach us. And it's a remarkable thing, actually, to think when you look, it's called the Andromeda Galaxy. And if you know where you're looking, you can just catch you out of the corner of your eye. If you think about it, you're seeing that as it was two million years ago. Yes, although I don't. Because it takes a light two million years to travel. I don't like being late to information. So that makes me feel very out of date. Well, it's remarkable. I mean, it began its journey before we had evolved on Earth. So in the time it took, and that's the nearest neighbouring galaxy, the web looks so far out that it's capturing light that's been traveling for over 13 billion years. But the universe has been expanding. And so the light has been stretching. And so for the most distant galaxies, we're looking back, back in time, almost to the big bang. And the Hubble was not sensitive to that light. So the web can see the formation of the first galaxies. It's essentially looking all the way back to very close to the beginning of time. And that's very important, because we're not entirely sure exactly how those first galaxies form. The idea of what you just talked about in terms of how much time this has taken and what what a large number of batteries.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1092,2022-10-09 07:36:41
12867," very important because we're not entirely sure exactly how those first galaxies form. The idea of what you just talked about in terms of how much time this is taking and what it's covering, do you think we will ever be able to see the Big Bang? Well, we almost can. It's not the web telescope. There's something called the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation, which is light that was emitted in the universe and it's a very precise number. It's 380,000 years after the Big Bang, which is not very long at all, right? The universe is 13.8 billion years old. So we can see that. It's microwaves because it's been stretched so much by the expansion of the universe. Going back, the problem with light is that in those earliest times, the universe was so hot and so dense that light couldn't travel through it. So it's opaque. So you can't use light to go back earlier than that. But what we can potentially do, not yet. We're not good enough yet. But the technology we use to now to detect colliding black holes, which is another remarkable thing, but I'll leave that one aside for now. But we have the technology to do that. And that technology possibly could allow us to probe right back to this thing, the Big Bang. And again, whether or not that's the origin of time, we can talk about as well. Brian, you've dedicated your life to explaining the scale of the universe to people. You have a new world tour and show called Horizons. What's the goal? Are you trying to teach people new things and understand the world they're living in better or what are you aiming for? Well, actually, all those things. So it works, I hope, on different levels. So I talk about cosmology. We've spoken about what we call the large scale structure of the universe, other galaxies, and how they formed, how the universe evolves since the Big Bang. But also, I've got very interested in my academic work in black holes. And black holes, and they're really evocacy things. I think everyone's heard of these strange things, these totally collapsed stars from which nothing apparently can escape. But in the past few years, past few decades, really, beginning work that Stephen Hawking really began back in the 1970s or many others. And we've begun to suspect there's a lot more to them. And they've started forcing us to reassess our understanding of what space and time are. And that's a really weird sentence you might think, well, space is the arena in which we live in time just ticks. But it really isn't. It looks like, from studying these things, there are building blocks of space and building blocks of time. And what I say in the show is, that's a mind-blowing idea. And I talk about that. But the key point is, is a great quote from Einstein, a beautiful story that Einstein told about when he was a little boy, he was six or seven years old. And his dad gave him a compass. And so he looked at the compass and he saw, well, there's this thing, this needle, and it always points north, points in this direction. So there's something invisible that I can't see that underlies our reality that's making this needle point north. And he said, later in life, it was my first encounter with an idea, which is, if you look at nature carefully and really pay attention and you're lucky, you can catch your glimpse of something deeply hidden. It's a beautiful phrase, something deeply hidden, which is the deep structure of reality. That's what our reality is. And so black holes, they're kind of a metaphor in a way. I talk about them as resettistones in the sky. They're the things that, by studying them, and you say, why would we study these things? Well, in studying these things, we're beginning to get a deep, a deep picture of what our reality actually is. That's a remarkable idea. But it's a beautiful idea that runs through all of science. How do you define a black hole? Well, it's in Einstein's theory, which again is a remarkable thing. It's published in 1915, over 100 years old. But it's just a region of space from which even light can't escape.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1093,2022-10-09 07:40:40

12871," Left largely to a very small group of rich men. You're right. The idea that the technology is used. If all it was useful, it was to send a few very, very rich people into space on a joyride, then there will be a real criticism there. But that's not all the technology is useful. So I think it's important to understand that the space industry is about operating initially in near-earth orbits. And we've already industrialized that. We all use it every day. I mean, we all switch on our sat nav in the car, satellite navigation. It requires infrastructure in orbit. A lot of the stuff we know about climate change, resource use and so on. That's coming from satellites. So I think you have to look at the space industry as a whole, really, and then say, well, it's not just about the same argument was made for intercontinental travel by aircraft. When the first aircraft were built, it was extremely expensive and the preserve of the rich. But of course, within a few decades, it had democratised travel. And we all take advantage of that every day. So I think that's the right way to look at space. It's not to focus on particular bits of it that we might not like for moral reasons or whatever it is. So it's actually, I really do advocate for the facts of looking at the whole industry, which is tremendously important now. It is. I mean, I am interested though that you did say, and correct me if I'm wrong, that all political leaders should go to space, perhaps for some perspective. And I did say that. Do you still think that? Most of them should come back. Most of them. They're the last part of that quote. Yeah. And yeah, it was, that was, it was based on an idea, which is very famous idea called the overview effect, which is well known that astronauts change their view of the, or always as far as I'm aware. Anyway, when they come back, they have a more positive view of the value of this planet and are very much more focused on preserving it as a beautiful place. Perhaps a unique place in a galaxy, as I said. So I felt that, and I do feel that, that having had the, the good fortune of speaking to many astronauts, that that experience, if the people who make the decisions, the big decisions of our future could have that experience, I think would be good investments. It's extremely hard arguments to make, you know, that we could, we should actually spend money allowing, you know, in our case at the moment, in our prime minister, right? So in the UK, you'd say, well, we just spend money sending Boris Johnson into space and bringing him back safely to earth again, because it would change his view. No, I don't think I win that argument. But, but I think there's a serious point there, which is that it does seem to change people for the better when they see our earth as it really is, which is a fragile thing against the blackness of space. So I think it's an argument that I would, I would try to make, I would lose it, because it's very expensive. Do you want to go? Are you willing to go? I would love to, because as I said, I'd love to share that experience of seeing our world from space. I think it's really unarguably, it appears to be a life changing experience, and it seems to change individuals for the better. You won't be scared. Well, I don't know. I mean, I remember one of my great heroes, John Young, who flew on the Apollo missions, walked on the moon, test flew the first space shuttle, and he said that anyone who sits on top of however many thousands of tons of liquid hydrogen, helium, liquid hydrogen, oxygen, and isn't a bit worried, doesn't understand the problem. So it's probably right. Do you have people come and talk to you about faith? Do they talk to you about how religion and that side of life fits into your level of knowledge? Because I know you've travelled around the world talking to people. Yeah, a lot. It comes up as a question, because cosmology is the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1097,2022-10-09 07:58:56
12872," traveled around the world talking to people? Yeah, a lot. It comes up as a question, because cosmology is the, it's a science of origins. And actually with the study of black holes, I mentioned, we're even beginning now to think about what space and time are. So naturally, I say in the show, actually, I say when we talk about this, it's the moment of creation, if there was. So we're asking, was there a moment of creation? And that's the correct language to use, I think. Or it's the vocative language, but it's really what we're talking about. Did everything come into being? Or has it always been here? We actually don't even know the answer to that question, really. So yeah, I can ask you a lot, because I think cosmology is a challenging science that challenges us to think about these things. We often associate that with theology or philosophy. And I think that's a good thing, because something I very strongly believe in is that segmenting or making little canisters and putting different bits of human experience or different music and art and theology and philosophy and science and segmenting them all is just the wrong way to look at it. What we're doing is a deep level, trying to understand what it means to be human in this tremendous, potentially infinite universe. And so I, those questions get asked. And ultimately, I say, I'm quite straightforward. I say, I'm not a religious person myself, but the correct thing to say, even about the question did the universe have a beginning in time, is we don't know. We don't know. And that's it.

12873," When you think of cutting edge technology at sea, you might be thinking of stuff like this. But there's an incoming revolution on the high seas that isn't quite as sexy but could be significantly more impactful. Transition shipping is the key component of global trade. About 80% of all the world's goods are transported at sea at some point. But there's a significant unseen cost to the modern era of global commerce. About 3% of all the world's fuel to emissions come from shipping. 3% may not sound like a lot, but that's roughly comparable to the entire CO2 output of Germany. Since reducing trade isn't a likely option, what about a technological improvement? To help reduce the emissions from these well-stocked maritime behemoths? As fall sets in, a decided turn in the air for the new British government's designs for the economy for Elon Musk's designs on Twitter and most decidedly for Mr. Putin's designs on Ukraine. This is Bloomberg Wall Street week. I'm David Weston. This week's Special Contributor Larry Summers on whether the jobs market is starting to show some signs of loosening. I think we are headed for a collision of some kind or other and we've just got to manage that collision carefully. And Brad DeLong of Berkeley on what the broad suite of economic history may be telling us about where we are headed next. People say that the United States has very little to teach them. But we don't have any greater grasp on how to deploy and use these technologies to create a good society. We had our fair share of about faces this week with the Bank of England's quick intervention to save the guilt market as explained by former MPC member Kristen Forbes of MIT. It seems that they are worried that because of the big market moves, there could be some margin calls, some pressures for force selling that could cause the guilt market to freeze up. And British Prime Minister Liz Truss giving up at least part of her economic program. It was becoming a distraction. So that's why we immediately changed that policy and that's the kind of government we are. But as ugly as the situation was in UK markets, it was nothing compared with the setbacks for Russian forces in eastern and southern Ukraine, with President Putin's efforts to quote Annex territory that his forces didn't even control. Which Admiral John Kirby at the NSC looks at as an indication that Mr. Putin just may be coming to understand how difficult his situation really is. The Annexation Announcements as well as his announcement of partial mobilization certainly shows the degree to which Mr. Putin knows how much he's struggling inside Ukraine. And OPEC plus weighed in with its own changes. Cutting production caps by 2 million barrels a day or about 7 percent, putting even more pressure on Europe and the rest of the world already worried about energy. Well, we were disappointed that OPEC made this decision. As the president mentioned, we think it's unnecessary if you look at the global environment where supply continues to be the predominant challenge. Then there's Elon Musk. He offered $44 billion for Twitter back in April, then decided to renegade, got sued, and on the eve of his deposition, returned to his original offer. Even it looks like he's going to be way overpaying. In many ways, this is almost the most expected outcome of all, which is settling on the eve of trial just before deposition of the main players, Elon Musk himself. He doesn't want to be deposed. He has probably some embarrassing text messages and conflicting statements and all of that would make for a very unpleasant decision. But after all the back and forth this week, US jobs numbers actually came in surprisingly on course, adding 263,000 new jobs just slightly more than expected, with workers paid 5 percent more than they were last year.

12874," A inequities on Friday, but actually a pretty good week overall for equities. The S&P 500 adding 1.5% to end the week at 3639 and the NASDAQ eaked out a gain of 3.4%. Bonds also had a topsy-turvy week, but ended up with the 10-year yield of a relatively modest 5 basis points to 3.88. Here to walk us through this week and what got us here are Aaron Brown, Portfolio Manager at PIMCO and Chris Ellman, Chief Investment Officer at CalSTRS. Chris, let me start with you. Boy, given what we're seeing right now, are we looking at a long cold winter, would you say? Unfortunately, David, I think we are. I think the Fed, you know, with these employment numbers, the Fed knows that they have to continue this pace of aggressive tightening and they're going to do so the next meeting and the next running after that. And I think which is the street is pricing in, but I think after that they're going to have to keep it up and that's going to be into the winter and it's going to be a tough time. So what do you say, Aaron? Is it going to be a rough winter? I think it is going to be a rough winter. I think that their bans of uncertainty are quite wide for next year. The Fed is tightening into an economic slowdown and we haven't even seen the real impact of that slowdown yet. We're just starting to see signs of a gradual slowing, but likely we'll continue to see that into next year and we think that we're heading into a recession into early 2023. And at that same point, just given the level of inflation, the Federal Reserve is now really challenged to be able to arrest that inflation, get it under control, despite what happens to the economy. So I think that really poses a challenge for the Fed and we'll likely see something that's fairly unprecedented, which is continued financial conditions tightening and Fed tightening into an economic slowdown, even if it really leads to a harder landing than what the Fed's anticipating. And Aaron, I'd push back a little bit. I actually think we're in a recession right now. It's not a very strong one and it doesn't hurt a lot. I haven't seen with employment growing, you know, but we did have a negative GDP in the second quarter, third quarter is mild. To me, anything below 1% in the USA feels like a recession. But so what you're saying is you think it's going to be a really will actually have a good traditional hard negative recession with rising unemployment, which is exactly what Powell has said. I mean, that's his forecast. Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, my our view at PIMCO is that we'll likely see unemployment rise to about 5% by the end of 2023. And so right now, we're sort of seeing some of those early signs, but we really haven't seen the full brunt of financial condition tightening yet. That's more to come. So we are going to continue to see a slowdown. And I think that's really going to hit in the first quarter of next year and into the second quarter of 2023. Chris, given where we're out of inflation right now, the concern is about inflation, if we are heading to an intersection or even are already in one, no matter how long it is or how short it is, what are the tools the Fed has to use? Because typically you turn to the Fed and say, okay, start cutting interest rates. Doesn't look like they're going to do that in a likelihood. No, they're going to raise interest rates. They only have one tool. They have, well, they have their mouth. They can job on the market, which is what they're doing. They have the dot plot, which is going to indicate or direct the market. But the really, the only tool they have is short term interest rates in the Fed funds rate. And that's what they're using aggressively. I mean, good grief. 75 basis points. Those are big bounces. You know, through history, you've got to go way back before you have that aggressive tightening of monetary policy. And they have to shrink the balance sheet. So as they move through that, you know, he's already said he's going to hurt employment. Yet we have stronger numbers. I think the numbers, there's something strange in the numbers this week, just like last month. But we'll see how that balances out. We're going to have a tougher time. And, you know, I think the question is going to be about corporate earnings. You got CPI next week. And then you got the bank starting to roll out with their earnings. Aaron, has the market priced in the diminishment of earnings at this point, corporate earnings? No, I don't think that they have. What you've seen since the beginning of the year is equities have de-rated, largely driven by the market multiple. So you've seen the market multiple for the S&P 500, de-rate from about 21 and a half times to about 16 times today.

So we're just at the upper end of where we typically are in recessions and we think that you could see a little bit more derating from there. That's not really the challenge for the market. The challenge for the market is that when you look at corporate earnings for next year, the market's pricing them to be up 7.5% for consensus. R-forward looking models are expecting them to be down about 9%. So that's north of a 15% differential versus what the market's pricing for next year and what we think it's likely to be. Also, historically, during recessions, earnings fall about 27% on average. So there's real downside risks to R-Forecast and certainly to the market's forecast. And I think that's where you're going to see the real pressure point for the market in early next year. What's driving that is margins. We're at record high margins right now. Street is expecting that margins are going to expand further from here. So even higher than and hit new record highs, we've never seen that in a recession before. So I think the market's really mispriced and that's where the pain's going to come from. Aaron, I've got to ask you if we're already down 23% so far this year. How much lower do you think we can go? Do you see a support level on the S&P? I think that in a moderate recession, the market probably bottoms out about 30 to 50. There is downside risk if we see further, sort of a more severe or harder landing from there. But 30 to 50 is still down about 14%, 15%. So I do think that there's still room for the market to fall further. Where are you looking for in terms of your estimates? Yeah, no, I agree 3250. But I mean, that's a negative 36 on the year, which is you're like me. We have asset allocation portfolios. Where do you hide in that kind of a negative market? You've got bonds with the rates rising. So you're going to have continued negative returns out of bonds and then a negative 30 out of stocks. That's a rough calendar year. Where do you hide? Well, I think that I think there have been actually market opportunities that have arisen since the start of this year. Cash rate right now. Two-year bonds are yielding north of 4%. Now that's not a sexy return by any sort of stretch of the imagination. But if you can lock in 4%, add a little bit of spread on top of that, an IG corporates that give you an additional 2% or so. That's about a 6% return over the next couple of years. That's high quality paper that you can invest in. So I wouldn't sort of rule cash out as an option. I think that that's somewhere where you can hide and really not expect that much volatility and really consistent returns and sort of hide out there until we see the markets bottom and you can start incrementally moving back into risk. But I think you need to keep in mind as an investor that if the core of your allocation of your portfolio, which is sort of cash and poor fixed income, is unstable, then you really can invest in the outer ring assets. So we really have to stabilize rates in order to move out the risk curve into other asset classes. Right now, cash is a pretty good option. OK, we're going to pick up exactly that question. Where do you hide in this environment? Chris Aillmann and Aaron Brown will be staying with us. We're going to ask for them for some investment advice. We could use it, that's for sure. That's next on Wall Street Week here on Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1101,2022-10-09 08:15:34
12876," Back in 1997, I was interested in the following question, which is there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called Saurapod dinosaurs, which had really long skinny necks. So Apodosaurus is an example. Now it's had really long skinny tails. So I made a computer model that showed that in fact the tail of these Saurapod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip, a bull whip. Now the way a bull whip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. And that crack is a sonic boom. I think the way they got a date was to impress the females by making loud booms. The facts on unemployment seem clear enough, or at least as clear as that changing social definition ever can be, the situation is getting a little better, but not much. The government announced today that the overall unemployment rate last month was 6.9%. The official unemployment rate has been stuck within a tenth of 7% for 6 months, and that scarcely represents the massive reduction of unemployment, that at least some folks thought they heard Jimmy Carter promise a year ago. That was Louis Royce-Huyesr on Wall Street Week back in October of 1977, when the unemployment rate was twice what it is today, and we were trying to get it down rather than focusing on inflation, whatever that ends up meaning for employment. And if that seems like a galaxy far far away, well maybe that's no accident. The top movie this week back in 1977 was Star Wars, and the top song on the charts was, you got it, the Star Wars theme. Still with us, our Aaron Brown and Pymco and Chris Alman of Calstere. So Aaron, let me turn to you and pick up on where we were talking just now with Chris, but where you hide, if you're really an asset allocator, you said cash is one alternative. Are there things though that involve at least some risk that you go to, and how much it depends on what you think the recovery is going to look like whenever it comes. So I'm going to flip that sort of question and answer the second question first, which is unlike prior recessions that we've seen in very recent history, so think of the global financial crisis or even the pandemic of 2020, I don't think this is going to be a V-shaped recovery. I think this is going to be more of a prolonged sort of stalling of the economy and more of an L-shaped recovery than what we've seen in the past. And the reason for that is because inflation is high and it's likely to persist at high levels, you're not going to come in and see the Fed start cutting as the unemployment rises like we've seen in the past. Instead, because the Fed has moved from a dual mandate Fed to a single mandate Fed, really just focus on getting the inflation rate down, you'll likely see, you won't see the sort of immediate relief that we've seen in recent history. And so that does change a little bit the landscape of how you think about investing. Historically, as we start to get closer to what we expect the bottom level of the S&P 500 to be, we start to scale risk back up, start to move back into equity investments to catch that recovery to the upside. And this time around, I think you have to be a little bit more patient. So instead, what we're really looking at is fixing come investments that we think are going to be able to sort of stand at the test of time, be able to sort of hide out in a safe haven assets. So beyond just looking at cash, we're looking at high quality investment grade corporates, we're looking at municipalities, municipal bonds, particularly for those who are, can take advantage of the tax advantages, tax advantage bonds. We think offer good value there at a sort of after tax yield of 6.5%. In addition, we also like",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1102,2022-10-09 08:19:39
12877," The tax advantages, tax advantage bonds, we think offer good value there at a sort of after tax yield of six and a half percent. In addition, we also like some mortgage agency bonds and structured credit bonds as well. And then sort of high quality equities that are defensive equities, high free cash flow, dividend growth, strong balance sheets. We also think do well in this environment. But it is a sort of challenging time for investors where you have to see more towards fixed income in order to have stability of return as opposed to looking for a quick snapback inequities. But I posed the question to Chris because I know he also manages a diversified portfolio. Chris, where are you looking at what type of sort of diversification that are you looking at in order to sort of hide out over the next couple of quarters? Aaron, you know, I've got the benefit of being able to go into private security. So I've got a good size real estate portfolio. We have a large private equity portfolio. Sure, it's going to have write downs, but its value is a bit more stable than we see in the public markets. We have a cash position, but the problem is for us, cash is not outperforming inflation. So the old adage cash is trash is still true. We do like a private credit. You were kind of hitting on that, that variable rate, that short term debt with high quality. And I think collateral is going to be key because as you said, we're going to have a long rough winter. So you don't want to be lowing money to everybody after you do care about governance. But it is tough in this environment. I mean, if the economy is slowing and inflation is still strong, that's stagflation. And you look back in the 70s, I got to say, I love that suit that Lou had. I don't know where you get that back in the 70s, but I'm stunned by it. But you look back in that time period, returns in 77 were terrible. There were hard places to, it was just a very tough time to hide anywhere. Yeah, so I'm curious though, exactly about when you go into fixed income. Do you think the price is attractive now in some fixed income, Chris? Well, I agree with Aaron, I'm going to go short. I'm not going to go long fixed income and take duration exposure, short term credits. I mean, you've been holding credit for two to three years, and then it's money good. And as she said, you're going to put it in a spread product, so you pick up a couple of basis points by being in a corporate, you're okay. There's still a lot of money, David, an international money that wants to come into this market, non-US rather, that wants to come into the market. You saw it in this week where suddenly comes rushing in. So I would give the advice to the average investors. You've got a slowly average cost in. You're not going to be able to call the bottom. As much as Aaron, I think there's a support number, it may not hit that at all. And the market's going to just bounce along. And in Aaron's example of an L, an L goes on forever. It's just flat. I hope we don't have to live in a flat recession for years and years, but I think this is going to be a tough market to find any kind of growth opportunities. So you want a protection and a return of your money rather than a return on your money. Aaron, one of the big developments this week was OPEC Plus and what they did. It certainly seemed to stun the white hats at the time. What does it tell us about geopolitical risk generally? And specifically energy. And it looks like oil prices are going to stay up there for a while. I think that's one of the things that the market's really miss pricing. Right now, if you look at the forward curve for oil, the risk is really in this very short term, where the market expects that oil is going to be elevated for the short term, but it really hasn't extrapolated or extended that expectation out the next one to two years. And I think that there's a real value in sort of the back end of the curve for oil, because I think that these oil challenges are going to persist much longer than what the market's anticipating. One of the reasons for that is, first we saw at OPEC Plus this week their intention to keep prices elevated. But I think the other challenges is that we really haven't invested here in the US or on a global basis on energy infrastructure. So that capacity is really constrained over the next couple of years. Even if we wanted to expand capacity or if oil producers wanted to expand capacity, they don't have the ability to do so. And that's going to keep oil prices elevated. So the risk for oil, then the risk for the energy complex.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1103,2022-10-09 08:24:40
12878," They don't have the ability to do so in the immediate term. And that's going to keep oil prices elevated. So the risk for oil, then the risk for the energy complex broadly isn't just this winter, but it's next winter as well. And next winter's challenges are going to be even more difficult, particularly on the shores of Europe, than what we're experiencing this winter. And so that's what I think the challenge is. And why I think this is something that's going to persist much longer than what the market's currently priced in. And David, it's running into the challenge of climate change. You know, I'm looking at decades, not a short-term trade in carbon. And I'm glad that we're having a constraint on the ability to expand hydrocarbons and burning carbon. But you're right. People want heat. And Europe heats itself. Whether we like it or not, it doesn't heat itself a solar and wind. It's got to do it through fossil fuels. And that's matching and running into it as I were to reduce the use of fossil fuels. And I agree with Aaron, I'm hearing the same thing that Europe has enough oil and natural gas for this year in their supplies. But if it's a really cold winter, they're very worried about next year. So you're going to have climate change crashing into this challenge of OPEC and inflation and energy prices, certainly over the next couple of years. Europe has a lot of challenges, Aaron, right now. Not just energy, it goes beyond that. Does that make the US relative the most attractive place to be for you? I don't know if it's the most attractive place, but it's one of the more attractive places, particularly vis-a-vis Europe. And the challenge that Europe has is that they're starting from a lower productivity, lower and weaker growth rate to start out. They also didn't fully recover in the same way that the US did post-COVID. And they now have wider fiscal deficits. They're going to have to spend more money in order to insulate their economy from a harder hit because of energy. And that's going to create real challenges at the same time where the economy's rapidly slowing. And so our view is that, while the US is going to recession, the recession in Europe is going to hit harder and is likely to be more prolonged. Thank you so much to Aaron Brown and Chris Aelman. When we come back, we're going to take a look at what's happening next week on Global Wall Street. And this is Bloomberg. We're going to take a look at what's happening next week. What are the biggest names in business? Choose Bloomberg. Great question. Great question. Great question. And the question I get all night. Bloomberg, top experts, great questions. The markets are preparing to close, but the day is not over yet. Stock that is down up about 45%. A lot of volatility, right? You need the power of the Bloomberg terminal to get you market moving data before anyone else. Is numbers much higher than expected? I'll create a today to overweight. You need top analysts to bring you exclusive global insight into cross-asset markets. The meaning bond market is a really big focus. Bitcoin ain't buying it all today. It's going to be a short term.

12879," And next week on Global Wall Street. China stocks reopening is the big story in Asia this week. Exchanges on the mainland have been shut for the past five straight sessions that's to mark the golden week holiday. So we could see a pop at the open given the moves that we saw in Chinese assets in offshore markets. And that would be of course welcome news for officials in Beijing because President Xi Jinping is just days away from securing a third term as Communist Party leader. That's at the 20th party Congress starting October 16th. Otherwise travel restrictions or the easing of those is the major theme as well. Japan will further loosen controls from Tuesday and Taiwan from Thursday. For Europe next week there's a big risk lingering in the markets and that's the end of the B.O.E. short term program to backstop bond markets. They of course announce that they would be purchasing long-daded bonds after concerns that a huge spike up in yields in the long end of the curve meant that there would be danger for pension funds. So the B.O.E. has been doing this buying program. It's set to end on Friday on October 14th. There could be jitters in this market. What it means to no longer have a B.O.E. backstopping a political story really of the UK government which has been doing various U-turns. So all of that will be in focus this week. All eyes next week will be on the latest batches of U.S. inflation data. Produced surprises will be released on Wednesday with the headline figure projected to have fallen year over year for a third straight month. Meanwhile the consumer price index released on Thursday is once again expected to show conflicting signals with a deceleration in the headline number from a year ago but the core measure of CPI which strips out food and energy is forecast to re-accelerate its pace of growth rather than fall. There's also a part of the release of the minutes from the Fed September meeting and whether there was any serious discussion about slowing or even halting the tightening of monetary policy. And earning season is finally here. The latest round of quarterly reports kick-off with Pepsi, JP Morgan, city group Morgan Stanley, Delta Airlines and United Health among the Notables. David? Coming up we'll wrap up the week with our special contributing Larry Somerso Harvard. Let's go ahead next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. Here's what's going on. Big expensive cities have a lot going for them. But if you live in one you probably notice that these big expensive cities keep getting more well expensive. You could always move away. You might have just started working remotely so there's really nothing keeping you there. But then again moving is a hassle. Well, what if someone paid you 10 grand to do it? What if they threw in free office space, a bicycle or a gym membership? Programs and cities and states around the US are doing exactly that and they're getting a lot of interest. We've had over 50,000 applications. About 90,000 applications. We've had over 1800 applicants from all over North America. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them? Or are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns for places looking for an injection of the fresh talent?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1105,2022-10-09 08:32:39
12880," Or are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them? Or are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns for places looking for an injection of fresh talent? This is Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. Every week we turn to Larry Summers of Harvard are very special contributor here on Wall Street Week to help us sum up the major events of the week and once again we welcome back Larry Summers. So Larry, I think we should start with the jobs numbers out on Friday in the United States. I mean some say not too hot, not too cold. Some people say isn't this good, at least it's not getting worse. I guess my real question is, I may not be getting worse, but there are danger just in the inflation where many where it is. We have 5% year over year increasing wages. I think these numbers were about what we expected and the sensible judgment was that we've got an inflation problem. Core inflation figures look artificially good, they're better than median inflation and yet core inflation ran at a 7% rate last month and that was more than for the quarter and the quarter was more than for the half year and the half year was more than for the whole year. So we're not in a controlled place with respect to inflation and there wasn't really anything in this report to suggest that we were coming into a controlled place. The monthly wage number was relatively favorable, but it was pretty clearly distorted by the fact that you had a lot more workers coming in and leisure and hospitality. And those are low wage workers, the workers where wages are most flexible are going up more rapidly. So I don't think this is a number that changed the picture that we've got an economy that is too strong to be an economy where inflation is going down. But that is maintaining its robustness, but I think we are headed for a collision of some kind or other and we've just got to manage that collision carefully. And I think the sooner we start managing for some slow down, the better we're going to do. I think Chairman Powell was way late to come to that recognition, but he now has that recognition and he should be supported in that. So what do you think, Chair Powell, and the Federal Reserve will make of these numbers? How will it affect what they do in early November? I don't think these numbers are going to change what the Fed does. You know, you never know what's going to happen and certainly there's risk of some kind of financially traumatic event, but I think the chances of something that is large enough to divert the Fed are really quite low. So I'd be expecting that the market, which is anticipating 75 basis points in November and is anticipating 50 more in December, that would correspond to my best guess at this moment as well. And I think that kind of thing is going to be appropriate if we achieve disinflation. Okay, there's another strain of discussion. I've seen certainly this week, in fact there was even some Fed staff work at the New York Fed suggesting that we better be careful because in fact the rate that we may need, you know, or to get down to 2%, maybe so high, it will cause financial instability. There is a really safety and soundness issue. What do you make of that? Is it possible the Fed will have to choose between financial stability in the one hand and getting inflation down on the other? First, I think that should be the occasion for some sole searching. If we have an economy where we think there's going to be substantial financial breakage because the Fed lifts the Fed funds.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1106,2022-10-09 08:36:46
12881," If we have an economy where we think there's going to be substantial financial breakage because the Fed lifts the Fed funds rate to 4.5 percent, then we have an inadequately supervised financial system and an insufficiently active financial regulator. And so if anyone believes that along with whatever monetary policy implication they draw, they'd better tell us how we think, how they think we ought to be repairing the regulation of the financial system. David might sense is that you can never rule out these kinds of risks. But the Fed has more than one instrument. It has instruments for specific guarantee lending. We've seen that used a number of times and each time we're surprised by how much the economy retains its robustness. In retrospect, we cut interest rates too much and kept them too low when we were supporting the financial system after COVID. In retrospect, we kept interest rates too low and blew up a bubble when we were supporting the economy with low interest rates after Asia and LTCM. In retrospect, we were surprised, amazed by how rapidly the economy grew when the Fed did what was necessary after the 1987 stock market crash. So we need to regulate right to preserve financial stability. We need to have a very strong firefighting force in order to respond if and when financial accidents happen. But I think it's a real mistake to suggest that somehow we shouldn't do the monetary policies that are necessary to avoid inflation becoming entrenched because of concerns about financial stability. You know, David, the people who are still on team transitory, they're always saying that expectations aren't entrenched. The more it's true that expectations are not yet entrenched, despite high inflation. It seems to me that more important it is to move vigorously now with respect to inflation so they don't become entrenched. If they were already entrenched, we could discuss the right timing of a disinflation. But if we have the big advantage in disinflation of expectations that are not yet entrenched, surely we should be acting on inflation while we have that advantage. Larry, another big development this week was the OPEC plus decision to reduce production limits by 2 million barrels a day. Something that I think it's fair to say was set the Biden administration back a bit. He'd gone over there and asked the Crown Prince not to do that. It wasn't very pretty. So apart from perhaps any embarrassment on my cause, does it have larger macroeconomic effects for a globe that we are warned by WTO? No, maybe headed toward a global recession. There's nothing good in this. Certainly it's not what we wanted to see. Actually it's a lot less than 2 million barrels because many of the countries that reduced their quota weren't hitting their quota before. So the reduction in the ceiling didn't really matter. And you didn't see a hugely dramatic move in oil markets in a way that was proportionate to the headlines that you saw. But certainly the risks are up and it just points up the importance. And we always do a scramble about the immediate when these things happen. And we don't forget about the medium term. Look, we made a mistake by canceling the keystone pipeline. We made a mistake by slowing down all kinds of permitting.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1107,2022-10-09 08:40:58
12882," Medium term. Look, we made a mistake by canceling the Keystone pipeline. We made a mistake by slowing down all kinds of permitting activity. We made a mistake by being hostile as a country to natural gas. We made a mistake in the Congress a few weeks ago when we didn't pass the expansion program of expanding permitting. We crucially need regulatory relief where we're not going to get renewables online fast and we're not going to get the transmission lines that are necessary for renewables to become a large part of our energy fast. So the real lesson on this is we need a different kind of energy strategy than the one that we've had. We need a strategy that is balanced rather than an unbalanced strategy of total hostility to fossil fuels or God knows the kind of total strategy of favoring fossil fuels that we had and even even egregious favoritism towards Saudi Arabia that we saw during the Trump administration. We need to find a balance and I think we're making our way in that direction. Larry is always so helpful to have you on each week and I would say, Larry, some of you are staying with us as we bring in Professor Brad DeLong, Professor economics from UC Berkeley and his new book, Slouching Toward Utopia. That's an economic history of the 20th century. That's coming up next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. It is crucially important and I think we've moved from this attitude from its indulgence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s and so it makes that a really exciting field because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harness to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts. But if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what your brain figures out while you're sleeping. Innovation, money and power collide in Silicon Valley and beyond. Bloomberg Technology with Emily Chang. Weekdays at 5 p.m. in New York and 2 p.m. in San Francisco. This is Walter E. I'm David Weston. Our very special contributor Larry Summers of Harvard has stayed with us because we're going to bring in now Professor of Economics from UC Berkeley. He's Brad DeLong. The author of a new book, Slouching Toward Utopia, an economic history of the 20th century. So Professor, welcome for joining us. It's really good to have you here. I've read this fascinating and really sort of protein book. It's really quite a book. Let's set it up first because it's a history of the 20th century. But you don't necessarily define the 20th century as from 1900 to 2000.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1108,2022-10-09 08:45:21
12883," Fastening and really sort of protein book. It's really quite a book. Let's set it up first because it's a history of the 20th century. But you don't necessarily define the 20th century as from 1900 to 2000. You started in 1870, you end up in 2010. Why? Well, the big thing that happens happens in 1870, right? Before 1870, the world's poor, and there's no prospect for the world being anything other than poor. After 1870, every single generation, humanity's technical competence doubles, and then doubles again in the following generation. And such an enormous pace of technological advance raises the possibility for the first time of a world in which we can bake a sufficiently large economic pie for everyone to have enough. And that was nothing that humanity had ever seen before. One of the remarkable things, Brad, that you highlight is that it really wasn't very different to live in the United Kingdom in the 19th century than it had been to live in the ancient world 2000 years before. Say something about the acceleration of growth that you see is happening in the 20th century. Well, you know, I mean, it was British economist John Stuart Mill, right? He was writing in 1871 about how all the industrial revolution had done was it had created a somewhat larger middle class, and it had allowed manufacturers and the rich to earn greater fortunes, but that the overwhelming mass of humanity was still confined to the same life of drudgery and imprisonment than they had been before, that they had been in before, and before all the way back into deep time. It was very clear by 1900 that things had changed. You know, John Maynard Keynes writing in 1919 looks back and says starting in 1870, we entered economic Eldorado and that now our chief task after World War I was figuring out why we tried to blow it up and try to get desperately back to what was good was going on after 1870. Fortunately, we eventually did, and so things rolled through up until our day. Was it along? Give us a sense of what happened in 1870 that brought all this about. There were some three driving forces in your book. Well, you know, everyone has an idea about just what it is that's made us as a civilization so wealthy that makes our economy so productive. And the different people have different things and they all go back. Some of them back even to say the year 1070 when it turns out that the law applies to a German emperor standing in the snow outside of the castle that allows him to his tool, but instead it could be that the law relies to everybody. But you get three things that fall into place in 1870 that set technological progress into a much higher gear than ever before. And they are the industrial research lab so that you can rationalize and routinize the discovery and development of technology. And then the corporation, as we know it, which rationalizes the development and deployment of technology. You know, to combine that with the globalized economy, with the telegraph and the I railroad and the iron hold ocean going steamship, and all of a sudden the incentives to deploy technology worldwide for production are so overwhelming and people turn their minds to how to do this that everything explodes in a way it never had before. Brad. What's the academic discussion of your book has centered on this idea of a pivot point in 1870? But I want to ask about a different judgment you make, which is that there was this major era and that the major era ended in 2010. I would have thought that the world was growing, it was becoming more integrated with technology. There were important political struggles. That was the stuff of history through the 20th century, much better in the second half of the century than in the first half of the century.

12884," to the 20th century, much better in the second half of the century, than in the first half of the century. The Cold War was a very different war than World War I or World War II. It was cold, but I would have thought that was a continuing process with substantial challenges. And yet you see us as now being in a quite different era. What's different about the era we're in than the era you wrote the history of other than more of the kind of progress and change that you saw as happening every generation? Well, I'm pleased you disagree here, and I'm very pleased you disagree on our historic Iod optimist here about our future. Because look, I've been losing arguments in person with you for 42 years, even when I think I'm right afterwards. And here I'm genuinely uncertain, and I actually very much hope you are. Really right this time. My thinking was, I've been listening to our friend John Furnald about how the underlying pace of technological progress has more or less halved since 2005 compared to what we were used to beforehand. Save in those years from 1975 to 1990, when technology was crawling toward a more energy efficient and environmentally friendly. Configuration rather than focusing on labor saving. But after 2000, and after 2000, we seem to have a substantial loss of social and economic knowledge about how to run things. Things about financial regulation that I thought were entrenched, that were known in the bones turned out to have been completely forgotten in 2008. Things about the proper tools for macroeconomic policy, that I thought were ingrained in the bone were also forgotten after 2010. And I remember UNI whimpering in 2012 that no, for the more expansionary fiscal policy, was not then a thing that ran any risks whatsoever. Combined that with the fact that from 1870 on to 2010, the first you had Britain in the United States, and then the United States as the countries that people were looking to, for examples, as you always Leon Trotsky liked to say, as the furnace where the future is being forged. But now you go to China, you go to India, you even go to Indonesia. And what you find is that people say that the United States has very little to teach them, that we don't have any greater grasp on how to deploy and use these technologies to create a good society. And are in fact the society, our society that is more trouble. We're more trouble than theirs are. Brad, if that is right, how much of it because of a running out of ideas, and how much of it is running out of cohesion? One of the themes in your book is the sort of polls if I can put it that way, between Hayek on the one hand, the market is king, and Polani and the others, the market has to serve people. How much of the problems we're in right now are because we're lacking cohesion, because of the dispersion in wealth and income? I think we're definitely lacking cohesion. I think dispersion and wealth and income creates work of cohesion. I am struck by comparing the United States around 1900 with the United States today, that around in 1900 politics was as fierce and mean as it is today. That is, theodore Roosevelt denouncing William Jennings Bryan as the puppet of an alien European socialist, John Peter Altgill, the governor of Illinois, who had not only been born in Europe, but also had dared to pardon anarchists. But there seems to be a very different flavor, that is, I think it's Ezra Klein talks about it, that somehow, that our media and our communications today focuses first on establishing, who are your enemies? Do you share any enemies with me? And if you share enemies with me, I will listen to. So as I say, it's a remarkable book. It's slouching toward an economic history of the 20th century.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1110,2022-10-09 08:54:19
12885," Do you share any enemies with me? And if you share enemies with me, I will listen to. So as I say, it's a remarkable book. It's slouching toward Utopia and economic history of the 20th century. Thank you so much for bringing it. We only really touch upon it today. I urge everybody to read it. It's really worth the effort. Thank you so much. Let's Professor Brad DeLon of UC Berkeley. And of course, to our very special contributor, Larry Summers of Harvard. Coming up, staying the course or turning tail, we'll reflect on some big about faces this week. This is Wall Street week on Bloomberg. What do you get your news on TV? On the radio. On the radio. On Bloomberg Radio. On the web. On the web. On the Bloomberg Terminal. On the Bloomberg apps. The line up. The news that affects your business. Here's what I'm watching. You do not want to miss this story. How are we thinking about those dynamics? Is our business. Bloomberg TV and radio. The world is listening. Bloomberg has enhanced search on the terminal to deliver what you need when you need it. Now you can simply type phrases in everyday English in the command line. Compare financials. Find people. Analyze markets. You can enter phrases or ask questions. What do you want to know today? Ask a question or visit search go to find answers now. Welcome to the world of decentralized finance. Bloomberg's covering all things crypto. The people. The transactions. And the technology. Bloomberg crypto Tuesdays. Finally, one more thought. The fine line between being steady and being stubborn. We've all admired those leaders through the years who have stuck to their guns when times got tough. British leaders like Winston Churchill and the darkest days of World War II. And Churchill's successor Margaret Thatcher, who was known for sticking to her guns no matter what. He wanted the council of ministers to be the Senate. No. No. No. And American leaders, like President Reagan at the Brennan-Burgate, demanding that the Soviet Union tear down the Berlin Wall when it seemed that that was the farthest thing from Mr. Gorbachev's mind. Mr. Gorbachev opened this gate. Mr. Gorbachev teared down this wall. But those were the times when the steadfast were ultimately proven right by history. What happens when bold proclamations don't hold up quite as well, such as George Herbert Walker Bush's insistence he would never, ever raise taxes. And I'll push again and I'll say to them, read my lips. And then there are those bold pronouncements that have yet to be proven out one way or the other. Like President Xi's insistence that his zero COVID policy is the right one for his country. If you just look at the COVID zero protocols, it requires all people returning from abroad to have 10 days of quarantine. Or President Putin insisting that he will ultimately still prevail in Ukraine. If he thinks he's losing and may lose his office and even life, then he could become completely unpredictable. But this week, this week we saw something a bit different. Big bold pronouncements being completely reversed, not long after they were made.

12886," But this week, this week we saw something a bit different. Big, bold pronounciens being completely reversed, not long after they were made. A big one was, of course, Elon Musk's change of mind, again, on whether he'd pony up $44 billion for Twitter. We're now hearing that Elon Musk and Twitter, of course, that resolution really said to be sticking on the contingency of getting that debt financing. And that is going to be the key clause that we're focused on going forward. But at least Mr. Musk took a few months for his change of heart. We're in Great Britain. We saw a new government lay out a new budget that included big tax cuts starting with the top tax bracket. We love the tax cutting, but not at this time. This is just absolutely the wrong time to do this. Bringing immediate and violent reaction in the markets. Just trying to get the markets behind those two latter factors, probably significantly more difficult. And the Bank of England stepping in for the rescue. So suddenly, the Bank of England finds itself in the ECB situation. So Prime Minister Truss' newly minted Chancellor of the Czech Republic had to admit publicly that they had been wrong, clearly and dramatically wrong, at least on those top tax rates. And it came only days after he and Prime Minister Truss had gone so big and so bold. I think it was a distraction. And I think it was the wrong thing to do. One can hardly fault a government for listening to its people, even if the listening might have come better before the deciding. But whatever the right answer, the one thing for certain is that, at least in this respect, Ms. Truss is no Margaret Thatcher. To those waiting with baited breaths for that favor of media catchphrase that you turn, I have only one thing to say. You turn if you want to. The ladies not for turning. That does it for this episode of Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. And this is Bloomberg. See you next week.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1112,2022-10-09 09:03:06
12887," Everything you need to get set for the start of U.S. traded Bloomberg the open with Jonathan Terrell. Filling down in the numbers and preparing you as only Bloomberg can weekdays on Bloomberg. It's hard to think of any athlete better known or more polarizing than Alex Rodriguez. He's done it again! He swatted the ball out of a rose head. He joins the 3000 hit club! A three time MVP, 14 time All-Star and World Series champion. He retired in 2016 as the highest paid player in MLB history. Fourth all time on the list of home runs. But his playing career isn't likely to be remembered by those statistics or by who he is or isn't dating. Record suspension tonight for baseball star Alex Rodriguez over his use of performance enhancing drugs. Who said you did not do these P.Ds that they are choosing you to do it? You're correct Mike. Best dude is unbelievable! A Fony to the end! Well it was the most painful time of my life. It may cost me the Hall of Fame and that's on me. Nobody else. I think in a weird way I'm going to look back and say that's one of the best things that happened. Five years after his retirement Alex Rodriguez this CEO is getting back into sports. This time as an owner of a pro basketball team. And he wants to build more than just a franchise but a legacy maybe with a dose of redemption. The mistakes made in baseball are done and I can't go back and fix them. I want to keep a clean record of the father as a friend or the business person. And because of those mistakes I think I have that opportunity and I'm having the time of my life doing it. A Rod Alex Rodriguez is buying the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Minnesota links. The purchase price is expected to be in the range of $1.5 billion. You know for me I think making the transition from player to owner something that's very exciting to me. I'm really excited to bring my experience both in business and in sports and in locker room. And do really really exciting things and bring a war championship to the city. In April 2021 Alex Rodriguez joined one of the most exclusive clubs around. Folks who own a pro sports team. And while his name and his fame made the headlines it was his business empire that allowed him to actually close the deal. The easy to remember name A Rod Corp. It's grown into a diversified investor and operator taking a cue from mega firms like Blackstone and KKR. A Rod Corp has taken a real estate portfolio and expanded into venture capital and private equity and media. And like any business in 2021 it's own SPAC. I was more lucky than smart. I started investing very small in real estate. I was only as a hedge to as my earning power would close my real estate would not only appreciate what's but create more cash flow. And then I would take their cash flow and I would buy more real estate and other private equity type investments were generated more cash flow. So as my Yankee income went to zero. Hopefully my real estate and my businesses would grow over time. And while players nowadays are becoming better and better business brands. Few are able to achieve the scale as A Rod Corp has in such a relatively short amount of time. But understanding how that growth happened in business just like baseball has to start at home. Part of what I love about business is you get to build things from nothing right like nothing. So I had two hip surgeries and I never wanted to be the old guy that couldn't get up you know this there. So I build a flat house all entertainment on that side. My room here dad and the girls on this side. But it had to be one story because I am always forgetting things. And I wanted to be like oh my god. I can't get up the steps because it be sips. You know I walk around here I mean first of all the arts beautiful but the teachers of you and the girls.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1113,2022-10-09 09:07:35
12888," Steps because it be sips. You know, walk around here, I mean, first of all, the arts are beautiful, but tons of pictures of you and the girls and I mean, you've really made a family life for yourself here. Tell me about that. Well, tell you what I'm not at home. I'm not a cleanup hitter and I'm not a CEO. The growth remind me every day that I work for them. Yeah. I can see why you think it's all. People always ask me, what are you doing in your life? And I say the three Bs I do baseball and I'll basketball too, business and my babies and that's kind of, that's my happy zone. It's funny through pandemic. We spent so much time here and in my 46 years, the toughest time in the world that I've witnessed. On the other side of that, we were in here and we felt safe and we felt loved and it was like 90 days of breakfast, lunch and dinner with my girls. It was a dream come true. They got so sick of my dad jokes. So sick of my dancing. It's actually at least you take time. I've been begging trying to bribe out what you're doing with me. She was daddy. You have no swag, no drip. I'm not doing anything with you. A. Rod's dancing may not get his daughter's approval, but his following on social media is huge with nearly 4 million followers on Instagram alone. That number is larger than his new basketball team. The Yankees or the Red Sox, not to mention any other single baseball player, current or former. Who has better taste in music? Whose dream is decorated nicer? What is it that makes you engage the way you do in social? You know Jason, a lot of that came through my time during my suspension. You know, I spent a whole year serving a suspension and in that time, I had an opportunity to turn the lens inward and understand why I was making some of the good choices, the poor choices, the bad choices, and understand kind of conversation, understand storytelling. And it's something that I'm enjoying is still fairly new. We're not experts by any means. But every time we look at companies or opportunities or partnerships, is data driven and social driven and it's been quite a tool for us. That suspension, which obviously people will forever associate you with, and there's an interesting choice you make there at that moment and then in subsequent moments to not lean out, to not retreat, but to lean in to some extent. And especially in the last couple of years, tell me about that. If you think about my career, sure I've hit home runs and been part of a world championship team, but I'm also, I'm fifth all time in the history of strikeouts. I mean, that means that only four people in the history of mankind have failed more than me. But I think as a result, I've been, you know, PhD in failing, but also an MBA of getting back up. Looking around at his house and his selection of cars, it's hard to say that A-Rod has ever really failed, but it's striking what he has built considering where he came from. hydrogen has a very special place in the universe. It's the first element on the periodic table. It is the most abandoned element in the universe. And when clean energy advocates think about what can we find, which would be as easy to use as fossil fuels, they think about it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1114,2022-10-09 09:11:43
12889," And when clean energy advocates think about what can we find which would be as easy to use as fossil fuels they think about hydrogen. The fuel that will when burn only produce water. We like to imagine that if we just built enough of these and these we could ditch fossil fuels and save the planet. Unfortunately it's not that simple. There are some things where you just need good old fashioned combustible fuel. Now startups around the world are betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century. I was born in New York, raised in Miami so when I got to Miami I was around 8 and a half and 9 years old. My father left when I was around 10 and at home it was mom, my brother Joe and my sister Shouzi. They took the role of like my brother became like the secretary of sports. My sister became the secretary of education and my mom just had to make enough money to pay her bills. I think my father leaving us at 10 kind of left a huge vacant spot and I think I needed to then kind of fill that void by having a collection of mentors. One of those earliest mentors was his baseball coach Rich Hoffman right here at Westminster High School. See Vox do this this area a few times. This brings back some pretty cool memories. If you hit a home one here goes to the basketball courts and the pool. I kind of like it. It's kind of like this Fenway. It's really where I really started to understand the power of mentorship and dreaming big. If you think about it I have one of the most important conversations with coach Rich Hoffman and that happened at 15 the first day of walk on campus. He goes look Alex you're gonna come in this year you're gonna have a good year and then you're going to the junior Olympics to represent the US. You do well there you get much stronger by that time you'll be like the top junior in the country and then your senior year you're gonna be the number one pick in the country and then you're gonna be off to the big leagues. Coach you're talking to me. I was talking to you Alex and Jason I went home that night and I believed him. It just like it changed my complete vision on me and my future and then I did everything in my power and that's how they coached down. So the leader today when I have young people it's my job to not only give them the opportunity but to push them and push them to a level where they now see the world in a different way about themselves. That prediction came true in the 1993 MLB draft Rodriguez was selected first overall by the Seattle Mariners and while his playing career was just getting started by the age of 22 he'd invest in his first piece of real estate. It was what I knew best my mother she was in a homeowner she was we were renters right we were tenants and every 18 months we would move because the landlord would always raise the rents. And I remember as a young kid saying boy if I can ever trade places with the landlord and they can be the tenant that would be amazing. I bought my first two blacks and then I owned that for a few years I sold it for double by four blacks eight blacks 60 units and and off we went. When it came to those first investments you know whenever he does something he's going in at a hundred percent. This is how",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1115,2022-10-09 09:15:43
12890," 60 units and and off we went. When it came to those first investments, you know, whenever he does something, he's going in at 100%. This is Jose Gomez. Everyone calls him Pepe. Along with Jose More, he's the co-CEO of Newport Property Construction and also a childhood friend of Rodriguez. From 2004 to 2007, we ended up acquiring 5100 units between Florida and Texas. We renovated him. He would buy him. I would renovate them and, and you know, the rest was history. Being a real estate investor, especially in high growth markets like Florida, well, it hasn't been a straight line up for the past two decades. Miami's high-rise condos and monuments to a burst property bubble while most half of Florida mortgages are underwater. We had this run up to 2007. Prices were going up like this and then it just fell off a cliff. The Great Recession crushed owners and developers alike. Few were immune, except those that had other sources of income to take advantage of falling prices. Income likes say one of the richest baseball contracts in history. Our huge advantage was that Alex had W2 income coming in from playing and we had that staying power. So we were able even when things started going, you know, south for some people, we were able to grow within those difficult times. Monument capital management has done within 60 deals since 2012 worth more than $900 million. The extent of that ambition in real estate is evident here at Grand Station in downtown Miami. The 30-story residential tower complete with a sprawling amenity floor in pool has sweeping views of downtown. It's a bet on Miami's growth and it's a bet that's looking smarter as Wall Street firms and other companies look southward. People always question Miami, why do people live there? There's not any great jobs. You know, we don't have a lot of financial services here. We don't have anybody manufacturing anything, but that's changing. People see this as a very cool place to live and work. Now, before it was always a cool place to live, but where are you gonna work? Now it's okay, the jobs are here first. Cool place to visit in the past. Right, yeah. And now each pocket is being built out. I think our Basel years and years ago started that. And then there have been a course of events that have followed that continue to enrich Miami. And I would say we're still early as a city. But while Miami may be home base, Rodriguez's most aggressive current real estate project is buying, renovating, and renting out single-family homes in markets across the country. And in this case, he's not just emulating some of the world's biggest investors, but also getting into business with them, including real estate legend Barry Sterneley. Just as behemoths like Blackstone who've been mass single-family homes, Rodriguez, through the Tyber Capital Group, has snapped up 5,000 homes so far. We think we're still in the early endings of single-family housing. Rents are going up about 18 to 19 percent. Once we find something, then this I learned from Warren Buffett is it'll be disciplined, but when you find your pitch, don't go for a single or a double, going and going big. And that's exactly what we've done multi-family. And now a single-family house. Going big has required Rodriguez to build a team around him, and he's opted for a delicate balance of homegrown and outside hires. On the one side, friends dating back to childhood and adolescence, including Aaron, Pepe, and Jose, on the other newer editions, such as Kelly LaFerieir, Stuart Zook, David Becker, and Lisa Pire. Managing the chemistry among the small and growing team is akin to the elusive intantables Rodriguez saw in clubhouses when he was a player. Getting it right, well, that's the difference between being a champion and an also ran. Lisa, take it away. Sure. So I think next we're going to have David on table from Kelly, and we take you as your relationship to the world's end of the club. Cool. So teams 11 and 11, and one exciting development is the 12-17 game in selectors is going to be on ESPN. So we were not on the ESPN table in New York. At the A-Write Corp offices, you'll notice the memorabilia, the pictures of famous athletes, the real-time social data being displayed on the TV wall.

12891," The famous athletes, the real-time social data being displayed on the TV wall. But you'll also see pictures of Rodriguez with some of the biggest businessmen in the world. Alex has become a sponge and he started that as an active player. When he was on the road, he would go and visit the jury rhinestones of the world in his uniform and ask them business questions. And he's surrounded himself with really good smart people. The wide network is critical and sourcing deals, including in the venture world, where the A-Rod portfolio has included more than 60 companies, brands like Hems and Hers, GoPuff and UFC Gems. But having the best team doesn't mean you win every at bat. Their SPAC slam-corp was recently negotiating a roughly $3 billion deal to merge with collectible company, Penini. That didn't materialize after Penini stumbled. Slam's still in search of a target. But Rodriguez's belief in taking swings, striking out and hitting big is also the same way he would end up with his own sports franchise. I'm not going to let you go. However you get your new Bloomberg DayBreaks with Lake. Welcome to Debraka, Australia. This is Bloomberg Technology. This is Bloomberg Rees. On TV, Radio and the Web, this is Bloomberg. Watch Bloomberg's surveillance early edition for the news you need when you need it. The Matt Miller with Kayleigh Lines in New York and N-Edwards in London. Australia's central bank raises interest rates twice as much as Bulkars. Then surveillance for in-depth analysis. Well, outside Tom Kane and Lisa Brownbottes, I'm Jonathan Ferro, the RPA, Fronts and Sensor. How does Japan get away with not raising rates? Can it sustain its normal at a time when everybody else is facing a very different reality? Bloomberg's surveillance. Be informed. Be prepared. I'll be right ahead of the game. J-Lo and A-Rod are angling to buy the New York Metz. They're not just angling. I mean, they are in the process of putting the money together. Rodriguez along with a group that included his then-girlfriend Jennifer Lopez, entrepreneur Mark Lurian several others, mounted a bid against Frontrunner and hedge fund billionaire Stephen A. Cohen. These guys are all rich, you know, as far as we go, they've made millions and millions of dollars, but we're talking about billions here. The very public process ultimately landed A-Rod and J-Lo's consortium as the runner-up, with Cohen by the team for $2.4 billion. We have a little bit depressed about it. We don't like to lose and, you know, we really started getting really excited and thinking about what could be. And so when it just sort of came to a complete halt, it was sort of like the shock to the system. We were sort of depressed and down. Mark Lurian is a New York-born businessman who most recently had been a senior executive at Walmart. He got in there by selling his company jet.com to the mega retailer and stayed on to run that division. And while A-Rod's partnership with J-Lo would come undone, he formed a close business and personal connection with Laurie that's lasting. How rules, man, I told you, no one's highest, man. You're my favorite tie. We grew up in a sort of very similar way and from very, very humble beginnings. I love Mark. I love him like a brother and he's a great partner and a great friend. And, you know, he slipped in my plow, I sleep at his house, and we both have this drive in this mission that I want him to win in the worst way and I think he does the same for me. I want to show you this clip because it spoke to me a lot about the depth of your relationship. Yeah, I think this is getting a little bit deeper now, but I think it comes down to our dads, you know, we both.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1117,2022-10-09 09:25:27
12892," depth of your relationship? Yeah, I think this is getting a little bit deeper now, but I think it comes down to our dads. They both felt like we had something to prove in order to sort of feel love, really. And when you did something spectacular, you felt, oh, maybe, you know, like, and I think he similarly had felt that too, where if you wanted to feel love, you had to do big things. Mm-hmm. What do you make of that? I never thought about it that way, but I know that when my father left at 10, it left a huge hole in my heart and my stomach, and I knew that I had to do better. And I think before therapy, it was probably better for the wrong things. I think post and current, I look at it as just my purpose. But I also know that I'm enough now, and probably before that I, that I wasn't. The deep connection with Lori led to a new $400 million venture fund called VCP, and notably allowed them to quickly pivot to a successful deal in sports ownership. They're pursuit of the Minnesota Timberwolves and Minnesota links. He called me and he said, hey, are you serious about this? He said, I won't do it unless you're serious about it. And I said, I'm serious about it, are you serious about it? And again, a minute conversation, we're both in, and we've probably got the deal done in six or seven days. NBA ownership has radically transformed into the past decade. It's tech executives like Steve Balmer and Joe Sy and Wall Street investors like Mark Lazari, Josh Harris and Tony Restler have snapped up teams. There's a supply demand imbalance where, and you want, you know, most people, if they could, would own a professional sports team. And there's, you know, very high barriers to entry and, you know, very limited supply. In the case of the Timberwolves, Glenn Taylor bought the team in 1994 for $88 million. The sale to Rodriguez's group values the franchise, paired with the four time WNBA champion links, at $1.5 billion. And that's relatively affordable. A Rod's old team, the Yankees, is worth more than $5 billion, according to several estimates. And while ownership is changing, so too are the players. I think players today want more in every sport. They're into fashion. They want to be good investors. They want to learn about venture. The NBA players today that I've been around, some of them are more prepped at 20 than some of the guys that I played with at, were 50. And meeting with our athletes and talking about business and them reaching out to me, it's great, it's humbling. And it's really impressive. And if anything, their ownership has maybe gotten too close to the players. The team being fined $250,000 for violating league rules within off-season workout in A Rod's hometown of Miami. But buying a basketball team instead of the Met's might accomplish a goal he thought was unreachable, actually making him cool to his daughters. I recently went to a Sixers game. And my little one Ella, who's 13, she goes, that is really like this basketball thing. Like one day, maybe I get to run the business here one day. Really? And I was like, oh my god, that's like the greatest thing I've ever heard. And she goes, you know, it's like, you know, base was a little slower, but this stuff, I can really get into it. It's like, whoa, baseball's great too. It's more of a thinking man's game. It's like chess, not checkers. And she goes, yeah, yeah, whatever. I don't like chess either. But she says, this basketball thing, I have like real passion is like the entertainment. And I have thoughts and I have ideas. And she thinks much more like a producer. She likes dancing. And I mean, to me, that's just like, boy, that's the great thing about sports and music. It brings people together. And it certainly did that for us that night. You have built this, this amazing business. There are people who are watching this, just like this guy. You know, it's like that they'll always remember you for your baseball career.

12893," like this guy, you know, it's like that they'll always remember you for your baseball career and a baseball career that was controversial to say the least. You could be a little bit on an island somewhere. You don't have to do this. I thought about tapping out a bunch of times. I would wake up in the middle of the night and me and tears going like, how in the world do I get pocket aces and figure out a way to screw this up? That was a very painful time for me. And I think the year suspension allowed me to not only put lipstick on the house and paint it and fix the windows, it allowed me to tear the entire house down and start building it one brick at a time. And in that process, I became even closer to my daughters. And when I think about those mistakes and the lessons learned, I think about, okay, but you know what? That was baseball and I had good moments and I had very tough moments. But clean slate when it comes to being a father, to being a partner, to being a businessman, to being a friend. So I draw some incredible motivation through something that sucked, something that I did to myself. I say to myself in the darkest hour, boy, if I ever get another opportunity, I'm not going to screw that up again. And I'm trying my best not to do that. So really a reminder, isn't it just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see some pressure on the UI and we did see some pressure on the futures. That is now being reversed. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total US greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71% building to cross America burn fossil fuels to operate? What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels, we want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of US greenhouse gas emissions.

12894," Is it an early affinity for markets? I put a satellite dish on top of the dorm room, so I would have access to real-time stock quotes. An unconventional path. What I really wanted to do was ski. So I left Wharton and I went up the main and became ski boat. A never-ending thirst for knowledge? It is a constant education each and every day. An acute attention to detail. I was down there for three weeks. I met every tenant. I was counting the car traffic. I was learning the business. A willingness to take a risk? If you want to produce return, you have to be willing to take risk. Where the ability to recognize a mistake and move on. I don't mind a 90% chance probability of failure. If there's a 10% chance of changing the world. In how to invest, I hope to provide a glimpse into the thoughts and practices of the world's great investors. And hopefully inspire a new generation of professional investors. In my pursuit of identifying the traits and skills of a great investor, I first looked into their backgrounds. I found many were raised in blue collar or middle class families. Rarely where they from fabulously wealthy families or families where there was a history of investing professionally. But their path to a career and investing varied. Some like Ron Barron, the mutual fund manager and investor with more than $50 billion on her management, started investing as a teenager. After my birth, I was interested in stock market because I had friends of mine who had been given stock from the grandparents who were prosperous. In Eastman, Kodak and Polaroid. I said, I want to do that. And my father said, we can't invest in stocks. We've never done that, you know, family. And in fact, one of the ideas behind my business is the idea was I wanted to be able to have people like my parents be able to invest in the stock market. So I saw that and then he said, well, I had $1,000 at the time. And he said, well, if you show me why you want to invest in a company and you put all your money into one company, then show me why. Then I'll let you do that and open account for you. And so I did research, I would go to this brokerage firm. And it was called McDonald's Company or from Cleveland. And they were right by Asbury Park High School. So I'd go there after school, sports and girls and stocks. And I would go there after school and all these guys, old guys, 40, 50 years old. They're sitting there on these green chairs and looking at the tape that hardly moved. I think the New York Stock Exchange was 25 million shares a day and maybe American was a million or two million shares a day. So I look at it and I got a report on this mom with County National Bank. And I start reading it and it was around the corner in where I lived in Allenhurst outside of Asbury Park. And I told my father why I want to invest in it and he let me invest. And the stock was $10 a share, 100 shares. And then the stock every day for the next six months, seven months, every day you just stayed the same or went up an eighth. And it was printed the 15 stocks and then Asbury Park press. And everybody said the same. And then it got acquired at $17 a share. So my $1,000 became $1,700. I said, man, there's nothing today. I don't want to do that. So I was interested. Hedge Fund billionaire Ken Griffin also turned an early affinity for math and computers into an early career in stock trading. Let's talk about your background before you started Sadeil. You're born in Florida? I was born in Daytona Beach. My father worked on the space program back in the 1960s. But I spent my formative years in middle school and high school in Bucke or Tongue, Florida. And you were a pretty good math student and I'm told a computer nerd as well. Is that fair or unfair? I appreciate the compliment because to be a computer nerd has obviously turned out to be a pretty good place to be in life. And yes, I was very interested in both mathematics and programming in high school. And it's defined my career and has had a very important role in my life. So you went to Harvard College. Most students there are taking courses or their athletics, but you were going to be doing that. But you were also trading securities. Is that true? That is true. I started up a small partnership my second year at Harvard to engage in convertible bond arbitrage, which was a bit of an off the beaten path occupation for a kid in college. But I had a great fast nation with markets and I had an opportunity to invest capital markets in my college days. And it was an incredible opportunity. It was a really great learning experience. But in those days I was...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1120,2022-10-09 09:38:17
12895," And I had an opportunity to invest capital markets in my college days. And it was an incredible opportunity. It was a really great learning experience. But in those days, it wasn't common to be able to get stock prices instantly. You had to get a special terminal or special antenna to let you get the stock quotes. Is that right? So it's amazing is, you know, I love the line people go, well, that's how we've always done it. And I get to think back into the early days of Citadel. We always did it meant we used a fax machine, which you and I of course have memories of. And the fax machine was revolutionary. In the 1980s, real-time stock prices were actually difficult to receive. And I put a satellite dish on top of the dorm room. So I would have access to real-time stock quotes in managing the portfolio that I managed. And what did the Harvard people say? Interestingly enough, back in the 80s, Harvard had a general prohibition on commercial activity in your dorm rooms. So I had to go to the building superintendent to get an exception to put the satellite dish on the roof of the building. And fortunately, he was willing to grant me that exception. But not every investor saw their future in finance early. Real estate, Titan, Sam Zell, and myself studied the law, became lawyers and hated it. I was always a good enough academic to get from here to there. So when I wanted to go to law school, I got seven A's. But I didn't get very many A's before that. And I basically used the four years of being an undergraduate to build a real estate business and build other businesses. And I just had a great time. So you were doing some real estate on the side while you were in college. And then you went to University of Michigan Law School. And to please your mother or father, you said I'm going to go to law school. But you weren't that interested in being a lawyer? No. Never. As a matter of fact, I ended up graduating and becoming a lawyer and I practiced for four days. Four days. I didn't realize you practiced that long. Four days. And so, in the morning of the fifth day, I went to see the senior partner and as only a 24-year-old could do, I looked in and said, I just don't think this is a good use of my time. He said, okay, there's the door. Well, actually, what he said is, what are you going to do? And I said, I'm just going to go back to doing deals like I did when I was in law school and in the real estate business in Arbor. And so he said, one of you stay here and we'll do the legal work and we'll invest in your deals. And so that's what we did for a year. And then there's activist investor Nelson Peltz, who didn't see the point in studying it all. What I really wanted to do was ski. So I left Wharton and I went up to Maine and became a ski boat. And then, you know, when you're a family, say, Nelson, we really wanted you to go to Wharton and be a good student. You're one of ski. I mean, that's not what you're supposed to do. That's correct. They did say that. What did you do? You said I was skiing. My father was an amazing guy. He wasn't happy that I left Wharton. He wasn't happy that I was a ski bum. And he wasn't happy that I grew a beard. But I did all of those things. There's no melted in late spring and came back and I had a summer job offered to me in Mount Hood, Oregon, to help them teach racing to young kids in Mount Hood, Oregon. And I needed some money to get out there. I asked him if he'd give me a job on a truck, a hundred bucks a week, two weeks. That was all I needed. He said, find, shave your beard off and do it. I said, I would. It was only temporary. So I shaved my beard off. And after about a week on the job, I started telling things that I thought that were missed opportunities. And he set me up beautifully. He said, why don't you stay here and do what you want to do instead of going out to Mount Hood, Oregon? Well, I did. And that's what happened. There are also great investors like Paul of O'Lent, one of the country's most successful endowment heads who came to investing after a completely different career. I studied paper conservation, restoring prints and drawings. I worked at the New York Historical Society for a while there. I then went to work at the Palace of Fine Arts in their Conservation Lab. And then I went to Los Angeles, where I worked at the LA County Museum. I worked at the LA County Museum.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1121,2022-10-09 09:42:32
12896," Well, there I then went to work at the Palace of Fine Arts in their Conservation Lab and then I went to Los Angeles where I worked at the LA County Museum. I did study, I did a scientific work at the Getty and then I set up my own conservation studio where I worked with contemporary artists like Sam Edruchet, Sam Francis and I was running my own business and I realized I needed to know a little bit about finance because I was working with very expensive works of art. I was running a studio and so I started taking a couple business classes at UCLA and through that I got introduced to Yale School of Management. And I got into Yale School of Management at the same time I got offered a fellowship at the National Gallery of Art where you and I both serve. The Lyscher Fellow and I worked in the Paper Conservation Lab there combining paper and paintings techniques for conservation on contemporary works of art. So you did that for a while and then you went to Yale School of Management? My husband and I had been trying to have a child and it wasn't kind of works, you know, it wasn't happening. So he said, okay, well let's move to New Haven. And of course that was instant and my daughter was born after my first semester. So I took a break and while when my daughter was probably two months old I went to David Swenson and knocked on the door and said hi, I want to learn about endowment because I'm going to work at a museum. And this is about David. David looked at my resume, there was no finance at all. And he took me in and I started filing and helping organize things and little by little I got projects to do. I remember he had me do a big research on soft dollars so that was one project I worked on. And little by little I became incorporated into the investment office. Coming up we hear about the extreme intelligence and intention to detail that it takes for success on Wall Street. One of Sam's favorite samisms is we suffer from knowing the numbers. So what's the best investment advice you've ever put in given by anybody? The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance, and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day and if you keep at it and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's not just interest. It was always said about compound interest returns, compound business returns, compound human returns. They're all very additive because you learn every day. And if you keep at it, it's very, very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make? Selling it the wrong time. And they sell when the prices go down? Yes, or not keeping. But people have conviction or if they invest for the right reasons, just keep at it. OK, so you're moving in on me quick. Just trying to me with your fancy hands. I'm going to deal with your knight because it's really bothering me. My knight? Yeah. He's a troublemaker. Yeah. What did you get up to this weekend? You know, just robot stuff. A lot of chess. I was practicing for you. I know you're pretty good. Ooh, I don't like that. I will take this. Oh, put it over here here. Not cool. Not cool. All right. I will. I will concede. I can see. You've got me, Bid. Very good game. Well played. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Another trait of great investors that shouldn't surprise you is they all tend to have a high degree of intelligence, many excelled academically. But true success.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1122,2022-10-09 09:46:26
12897," Another trait of great investors that shouldn't surprise you is they all tend to have a high degree of intelligence. Many excelled academically, but true success as Mary Eardos, the CEO of JPMorgan Asset and Wealth Management, points out comes from training and continuing to educate oneself. So training on Wall Street, but specifically in Wealth Management, is a very, very long process. We have 2200 analysts starting today and they're going to be working through the summer. We have 3600 analysts across JPMorgan Chase that will start at the very end in the September time period for their full time role. And we work very hard to go through in-depth training and then to work through which ones actually are good at stock investing, and ones are good at M&A transactions, which ones are good at helping people understand things in a more simplistic matter. That's a two to three year training program, but that's pretty fast. If you think 10,000 hours is about what you need to master any subject. If someone comes in and has a regular, you know, eight hour a day job, five days a week, it's going to take you about five years to have a base level mastery. On Wall Street, it's more like 12 hours a day, six days a week, that cuts you down to about two and a half years before you become mastered in something. Once they've got that under their belt, they can then join a team. And if they've been successful going through the analyst program, joining a team, then the team will work through how that works. But it is a constant education each and every day. Every morning we start with an eight o'clock meeting and I call it like a mini university. And it's not just about what you've read in the newspapers as to what happened overnight. It's about understanding how all of those components fit together in a client's portfolio. And then what might be right for you would be different than somebody else. And you're synthesizing all that information every morning. And then you're going out and you're figuring out how to apply it to each situation. Dawn Fitzpatrick, the investment chief for George Soros, is of a similar mindset to Erdos. For her, the constant pursuit of new ideas and new voices keep her ahead of the game. So I read a lot, you know, in the morning I'll skim through two or three different papers. During my days I'm meeting with a lot of smart investors and smart people running companies. You learn a lot from there. I talk to peers. But I think part of the trick of this big business is being able to really aggregate and assimilate information. And one of the other tricks of this industry is trying to find sources of information that are different than the other people in the business. Because you don't want to get crowd thinking. I think that happens a lot in this business. Everyone's talking to the same people. And a view becomes consensus that might not be really grounded as well as it should be in facts. Attention to detail also sets great investors apart as described by two real estate legends, Sam Zell and John Gray. You know, one of Sam's favorite samisms is we suffer from knowing the numbers. I think we've managed to tip throw through the tulips for the last 50 years by never allowing ourselves to get swept up in the enthusiasm of whatever the current event might be. And I think by maintaining that level of discipline, yeah, we made mistakes. And that's to be expected. But we've all been, quote, controllable. No one mistake was ever catastrophic. The first deal I worked on was a shopping center in Chesapeake, Virginia. The Great Bridge Shopping Center. It was a $6 million transaction. We borrowed four. So it was a $2 million equity check. And you would have thought I was buying the island of Manhattan. I mean, I was down there for three weeks. I met every tenant. I was counting the car traffic. I was learning the business. And it was an amazing experience because I was the chief bottle washer. I was the waiter. I was the matredee. Because we were this tiny little business and I was learning it firsthand. Now one of the most famous things in the real estate world is location, location, location.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1123,2022-10-09 09:50:53
12898," I was the waiter, I was the matrede, because we were this tiny little business and I was learning it firsthand. Now one of the most famous sayings in the real estate world is location, location, location, meaning that the location is everything. And also you might say it's local, local, local, because most people make in real estate investments kind of in the area they know. You've made investments all over the world. How do you, sitting in New York, know about the value of real estate in Europe or in Asia and how hard is that been to build a global business? So I think the key to that is to have a global footprint, to have hundreds of people all over the world. And it took us a long time to do it. I mean, we've been at this for 30 years and you really need talented people on the ground. You need local people who know the markets. The one thing I'd say though that is advantageous about real estate is so many of the trends we're seeing, particularly driven by technology, are the same around the world. So when we started buying warehouse is back in 2010 and we noticed that there were these e-commerce tenants showing up and we started buying more in the US. It wasn't a big leap of faith to say the same thing's gonna happen in Canada. It's gonna happen in the UK and continental Europe and across Asia. So my view is that if you have the skill set, you can evaluate plus you travel a lot. Like you, I'm on planes a lot. I no longer run the real estate business day today. My colleagues Ken Kaplan and Kathleen McCarthy have done an amazing job. But they have teams around the world on the ground and we're local in those markets and I think that's really important. You cannot buy real estate in Mumbai the way we have flying in and flying out of New York. Next we look at how skilled investors evaluate risk. We are 100% confident every time we make the investment that it's gonna be a big company. We are wrong a lot of the time. We are not going to be able to do that. Access the financial world on demand.

One of the easiest paths in life is to accept and follow conventional wisdom. But what great investors have found is that path doesn't lead to easy returns. Often the biggest winds come from going against the grain and taking a risk, especially if you are leading venture capital investor like Mark Andreessen or Venod Kostler. Each top and venture firm has its own bar. So it has its own set of criteria for things that deals should be done or not. And then the top to your venture firms as a group have a collective bar, which is a top to your venture firm going to fund this company or not. It's actually easier to answer that second question than it is the first question. After you've been in the business for a while, you tend to have a sense of like, OK, this is going to get funded by a top and venture capital firm or it's not. If it is going to get funded by a top and venture capital firm, and if my firm doesn't think it's a good idea, you do wonder like who's right, because the other firms are quite smart. And so this is one of the regular discussions that we have, which is like, OK, if another one of these top and firms is interested in it, that might be a very positive substantive signal. If the other top firms have looked at it and all passed, that might be a substantive negative signal. That said, some of the best deals in history have been passed on by a very large number of people. One of the classic examples, Uber was passed on by a very large number of venture capital firms. Uber was actually available to be invested in on this site called Angelist, where literally anybody with a checkbook can invest. And so every once in a while you get these outliers. And it's fundamentally a game of outliers, like the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1124,2022-10-09 09:55:23
12899," Uber was actually available to be invested in on this site called Angelist where literally anybody with a checkbook can invest And so every once in a while you get these outliers and it's fundamentally a game of outliers Like the money is made on the aberrations And so I say you want to be generally open-minded and humble about your conclusions about what all these different signals mean Now a famous economist Herb Stein once said if something can't keep going on forever It won't in other words at some point things settle down Do you worry that because the economy might soften at some point of interest rates are raised or just because of the business cycle The wonderful world of venture capital will slow down a bit and is that a worry for you? So it's a cyclical business for sure. It has a history of boom bus cycles You know basically just like any other sector of the economy That's that I guess I would say we we do not have a great track record in our industry of predicting these cycles And I think most of what we I think most of how we either perform or fail to perform is Micro not macro which which is to say it's based on the successor failure of individual companies And if you just look at the history of of venture capital and startups many of the best companies have been formed during the hot periods But also many of the companies have been formed during the cold periods right and they're there pros and cons of those periods And so look it's it's possible There's another cyclical boom and bus cycle You know our our plan for that cycle would be basically be to just keep going Keep working with our existing companies help them through it keep investing in new companies all the way through And basically bet on these sort of micro level fundamental technological and economic changes that continue to happen Most of what we do is uncharted territory. I would say the one piece That works really well in our business is go for higher risk higher Consequences so most people in business Reduced risk increase the probability of success which is reduced risk But at the expense of making the consequences of success relatively inconsequential you might make two times your money or something I For our business what works is I don't mind the 90% chance probability of failure If there's a 10% chance of changing the world and that's very much the philosophy it also goes with It's it's the right way to make huge impact It's not just venture capitalist taking risks Columbia's endowment head Kim Liu also says gains are not without calculated risks I think the best investment advice I've ever received is the fact that we are in the business of taking risk And so if you want to produce return you have to be willing to take risk and you have to be willing To analyze and mitigate that risk the best you can and to make sure that the return Potential of an investment is equal to the risk, but you can't avoid risk now What do you think the most common mistake investors make generally? I think the most common mistakes is following the herd and just doing what everybody else is doing and not making sure that an Investment is appropriate for your institution and making sure that the analysis that someone else is Has done is not appropriate for you or is not congruent with the way you think about the world I think there are million ways to make money. I think there are million strategies that can work Not every investment is consistent with your strategy And so I think there's a lot of herd mentality And that's a huge mistake that happens Now sometimes risk don't pan out and mistakes are made Now I might sit and stew over the loss for a decade or two But a truly great investor like Kleiner Perkins chairman John Doer has the ability to admit a mistake Cut his losses and move on When I first came to Silicon Valley I hung out at Stanford on the second floor of Margaret Jacks Hall And down that hall was Andy Bechtel-Sheim who founded Sun Microsystems John Hennessy Who became president of Stanford founded MIPS Jim Clark of Silicon Graphics What I didn't do is go down into the basement where Len and Sandy were starting Cisco So that was a miss on my part More recently I had the opportunity to invest in an electric vehicle company And the conventional wisdom was venture capitalist ought not to invest in electric vehicle companies Not new car companies at all. There've been 400 new car companies in the nation's history Every one of them, but one has gone bankrupt But I was still very attracted to the market And we had the choice of backing a brilliant car designer by the name of Henry Fisker",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1125,2022-10-09 09:59:34
12900," I was still very attracted to the market and we had the choice of backing a brilliant card designer by the name of Henry Fisker or ambitious slightly crazy entrepreneur and by the name of Elon Musk. Well, we made the wrong decision but Tesla did very, very well and so did electric vehicles. So when I make a mistake, I only think about it for the next 10 or 20 years. How long does it take for you to get over these things? Well, I don't obsess on these but I won't ever forget. This is a market that over the past few weeks has made it clear it wants to go higher. It got a little spooked by the idea that geocolatal potential rises. What are the moon shots at Amazon that are capturing most of your time and attention? Well, you know, we have a unique way that we look at big new investments and I'm not sure it's right or wrong, it just happens to be our way and we ask ourselves when we're considering something for questions. We ask if it's successful can it be big and move the needle in Amazon? Is it being well served today? Do we have a differentiated approach and do we have confidence there and if not can we acquire it quickly? If we like the answer to those questions, we'll go pursue it with a single thread team that isn't distracted by the rest of the business. When it comes to the stock it has fallen significantly. Do you think investors are missing something or has tech just been overvalued? I have never tried to predict what stocks might do. In any time I've tried to a little bit, I've been wrong. I do really believe that in the short term, the stock market tends to be a voting machine and the long term it tends to be a waiting machine. We have a concept we talk about a lot of Amazon inputs and outputs. The ultimate output for a company is share price. Then other big outputs are free cash flow or profit or revenue. You can't really manage the outputs. You have to manage at the input level and that's where we spend all our time. If you do the right things for the business long term, things tend to work out. I think we've had very good returns for investors and I expect that to be true again. You will put a woman on Mars. You will bring forth global cooling. You will be the first chief crypto officer.

Before you change the world, Bloomberg. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. Let's just be honest. We've had sort of a shift in our way in some sort of sideflation fears. Moment people were talking about that all day yesterday. I've talked to you about my own sort of fear of my kids playing too much. A friend was like, try to think of it like he's like a painting. Like show it, ask him to show it to you. Like the same way you would treat a painting. Yeah. I want to see what you made. Yeah, that's right. So make it a family. Mm-hmm. Do you have kids? I have two daughters. Do they play? Yeah, they're older now. But they, not a lot. Because like growing up, I think it was always the thing that dad did.

12901," He's in charge of one of the top gaming consoles in the world. Microsoft Xbox, a $16 billion business, home to Minecraft, Halo, and perhaps soon, Call of Duty. If a $70 billion deal to buy Activision goes through, the executive behind that deal is Phil Spencer. And if he has his way, he hopes the gaming industry will level up in the next 20 years, and be less of a battle between rival consoles and more home to platforms that reach every potential gamer on the planet. Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer. So we're going to start by going in the way back machine. A little bit. Did some research. You worked at a computer mart in Vancouver, Washington, where you were selling and playing a lot of computer games in the 80s. I'm thinking like stranger things. Stranger things resonates with my, yeah, definitely growing up my inner geekdom is there. I'm going to need some photographic evidence of this. What were your most played games in the 80s? So it's funny when I started growing up playing video games, most of it was going to the arcades. Now most people won't remember these days of like going to a store where you put quarters and play. Robatron was one of my favorites in the arcades. I would go play that. And then probably more in the 70s and the 80s, I remember my dad bringing a video game, the Atari 2600 with the cartridge at home. And I was kind of the beginning of it and it just kept playing. And it's still with me. You started out at Microsoft as an intern in 1988. How would you compare Microsoft's history on games under Bill Gates versus Steve Balmer, versus Sachin Adela? Yeah, I think like many things at Microsoft back in the 80s, we started in video games as much out of kind of a defensive. We were worried that other companies might be putting the home PC in place. And the avenue to get there was through video games and game consoles. So we said, okay, we're going to go start our own game console because if anybody's going to build a computer from the home, we wanted it to be Microsoft. I think through Steve's years, it was more about growing the business and how do we bring kind of business leadership into this group of Ragtag people who are out there just having fun building video games as part of Xbox. I think with Satya, when I first took this job, and I got this job as head of Xbox about two months after Satya Nadella became the CEO of Microsoft. Well, and when Satya started, there were activist investors targeting the company. Yeah. The stock hadn't been doing well. They were targeting Xbox. Absolutely, yeah. At the time, absolutely right, that there was a question, why are we in video games? In fact, one of his first questions to me was, because he had come from the cloud part of the business being in the cloud, he didn't actually understand why we're in video games. Not as a negative, just as literally, why is Microsoft at the time $1 trillion market cap company? Why are we in the video game business? And he challenged us. Let's go figure out why we're in the video game space and see if it makes sense. And if it does, let's be all in. And if it doesn't, we'd make other decisions. Early in that journey is when, after it came about months after this moment. So I might have a kid or two that would mind craft. And it really caused us as a team to think about, okay, if you're going to go spend $2.5 billion on this blocky Java-based game, how does this fit into the mission of this company? Let's talk about that strategy. Was the idea to tie gaming to the cloud? Was that the clincher? If you think about a game like Minecraft or Fortnite or Roblox, these are games that play on iPads, they play on Xboxes, PlayStation's, PCs. The games were going from per device to per user. And cloud would be an enabler for that. But we didn't start with how do we fit cloud into video games. We were just kind of watching the trends of creators and where they were building. And saw this transformation of games being ubiquitous. How does this all, as you see it, connect to Microsoft's future? The cool thing I see going on now, and it does fit with the investments Microsoft's making in Azure and other places, is today the world, anybody.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1127,2022-10-09 10:08:30
12902, Sure. The cool thing I see going on now and it does fit with the investments Microsoft's making in Azure and other places is today the world anybody's a creator and video games are going through that same transformation where if I rewind to my childhood and playing video games I walked into like an egghead software and there was a line of boxes we might go create the best game in the world but there was no way for us to get it in front of an actual person who might want to go play because we couldn't get shelf-space all these things. Today we see gamers on our creators on our platform from all over the globe who can create a game that can literally reach billions of people through our distribution capability to a player a game is a game and you can deliver that game through the cloud to anybody who has a device that's capable of reaching the internet. I hear you're still an avid gamer. How often do you play games like how many hours? I go to bed early so I got a bed at 10 it's Seattle at 10 o'clock people who play with me online they tease me about how militant I am at 10 o'clock I'm out. I probably play 15 hours a week. As I understand it you do your own deals you don't necessarily need permission from Satcha to do a deal is that true? No there's definitely it depends on the amount of the money in the deal but when we think about some of our bigger deals we go to the board and so Satin Adela Amy Hood the CFO have been incredibly supportive as Xbox for one of the biggest consumer businesses in the company we're a brand that makes Microsoft relevant to a whole generation that probably doesn't think about a lot of other Microsoft products in their day-to-day life. Activision specifically is facing a lot of challenges here there have been lawsuits there have been employee walkouts how much did that concern you when you're thinking about this deal. You will shed light on dark matter you will make aging optional you will turn 5G up to 11 because when you subscribe to Bloomberg you won't just get news you'll get insight into limitless possibilities knowledge and inspiration to feed your ambition so before you invent pioneer disrupt before you change the world Bloomberg imagine simply climbing a cable into space the concept is known as the space elevator not only could it significantly change how we leave planet earth but it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space and their scientists think we could have already built it we have the material we have the technology we have the lasers we have the climbers we have all of it if a private entity wants to build it or a government they could build it it'll change society we have no clue how colonizing in the space how really spreading on this space really change our society over the next 50 to 200 years it'll be completely different well you're in the process of a potentially monster deal 70 billion dollar acquisition of Activision talk to us about how this deal came together when we were thinking about on that idea of what are we capable of doing today and where do we need to go the biggest gaming platform on the planet is mobile phones one and a half billion people play mobile phones and I guess regretfully as Microsoft it's not a place where we have a native platform as gaming coming from console and PC we don't have a lot of creative capability that has built hit mobile games one thing about the video game space is if you've been around maybe too long you know most of the creators out there so you kind of no teams that could be a good fit in terms of what we were trying to do but we really started the discussions internally at least on Activision Blizzard around the capability they had on mobile and then PC with Blizzard those are the two things that were really driving,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1128,2022-10-09 10:12:17
12903," really started the discussions internally at least on Activision Blizzard around the capability they had on mobile and then PC with Blizzard. Those are the two things that we're really driving our interest. Big Tech is under a lot of regulatory scrutiny. Big Tech deals are under scrutiny. What's the status of the deal? What have your conversations with regulators been like? I kind of come at this that big deals should be scrutinized. I think that's the role of regulators why they're in place. I feel good about the progress that we've been making. Asking good, hard questions about, okay, what is our intent? What does this mean? If you play it out over five years, is this constricting a market? I feel good about it. Microsoft had its time in the antitrust spotlight. Now the spotlight's on Google and Meta and Apple and Amazon. How is it that Microsoft has skirted the spotlight? Your competitors might say it's unfair. Well, I think your point about us having grown through that time, I might call that the adolescent ears for us as we were kind of learning. I think it's an important consideration that we did learn a lot as a company through that time and what it meant. And I think that sticks with us today. You've been a really big advocate of cross-platform play and this idea that gamer should be allowed to play whatever games they want on whatever platform they want. Why is that so important to you? Maybe you happen in your household to buy an Xbox and I buy a PlayStation and our kids want to play together and they can't because we bought the wrong piece of plastic to plug into our television. It's just seems that these artificial constraints that the industry might put up for near-term kind of business dynamics in the long run. If you take a business that is at 3 billion people growing to 4 billion people over the next decade and saying how do we continue to grow this business? Fruitsing friction for our customers as an industry has to be at the top. So how far does this go? Does this mean that Activision gave that call of duty? You'll be able to play on any platform and perpetuity? I don't know what that means and forever. Like when you think about how long and it's not for any kind of nefarious business reason. It's just like what do we even platforms mean 10 years ago? Like I think the definition of some of these things might change over time but our expectation is we want more people to play. So I know you're working with Sony on some things for the benefit of gamers. Can you talk to us about that a little bit? We have a pretty big publishing footprint on PlayStation as well as Nintendo which means we have good relationships with those platforms because we're they're a big part of our business and we're a big part of their business. I think our long-term ambition of where we see this industry growing is also shared. I think the area where things get stuck a little bit it's in the kind of near-mid-term competition. If somebody walks into a store and they have one $500 bill they're either going to walk out with a switch which is what most people buy or they're going to walk out with a PlayStation 5 or they're going to walk out with an Xbox or maybe somebody will go buy a Windows PC. But in that world of somebody's got to make a decision for one platform over another in the beginning. That is where I think we get stuck in some of the kind of near-term competition. I don't think that's bad. It's just the dynamic of each of us pushing each other to build the best product for our customers. Now while you've been working to make the gaming industry more collaborative the gaming industry has historically been tough for women, for diverse voices. When you look back on gamer gate do you think you did enough? I can always look back at any incident for me and think about things that in hindsight I should have done more I should have done better. I'm proud of how our team evolves, how our leadership team evolves. Now there are societal issues around us, the gaming industry is not immune to those. People in my position sitting here as kind of old white guys head of gaming platforms not in more than norm than I should be and I talk about 3 billion people who play video games. If you say your audience is 3 billion people then the demographic is the planet's demographic. I want our team to reflect the customer that we aspire to earn. I know that our teams ship their culture with every product they ship. Well Activision specifically is facing a lot of challenges here. There have been lawsuits, there have been employee walkouts, there have been accusations of sexual harassment, sexual assault, how much did that concern you when you were thinking about this deal? We had access to data from the company before we...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1129,2022-10-09 10:17:13
12904," Accusations of sexual harassment, sexual assault, how much did that concern you when you were thinking about this deal? We had access to data from the company before we announced the acquisition to see what the actual numbers were in terms of reports. We definitely as a team signed up to say just like we're on our own journey with Xbox, that we're going to expand that journey if this deal closes. It's a lot of people and a lot of people that will feel very dedicated to and committed to building a great workplace environment for them. That's true of any of our studios. But it's obviously a conversation that you're going to have, you think about the board of Microsoft, and when they're thinking about the deal and they're typing into their search engine, Activision, what are the headlines that they're coming back, and there were questions that we had. We've learned from this, we will continue to learn, and we're committed to that journey, not only for the betterment of our teams, but our customers, the creators on our platform. We think it's critical to our business success that we make progress here. Is Bobby Codic going to stay on? Yeah, I'm not in a position to make comments about their leadership team. We're in the regulatory phase and how that will close. When the deal closes, then we have say in how they're managed and how it goes, but until that point, I'm not really in a position to say. There have been very specific allegations of Bobby being aware of things. That happened and not reporting it to the board. What has he communicated to you about what he knew, what he didn't know? The discussions we've had were about the teams where they're at. Can they make the progress they need to make? Because the closing is a long process. Are they putting in the work that they need to put in to move along their journey? And I believe they're committed to that. When I look at the work that they're doing now, there's always more that can be done. Activision has divisions that are unionizing. I don't know, Microsoft has said they'll recognize those unions. What does that look like? I've never run an organization that has unions in it. But what I can say in working through this is we recognize workers needs to feel safe and heard and compensated fairly in order to do great work. The thought was important to make a public statement on that front for workers that are there that are making decisions about their employment and how they want to understand what it would mean if Microsoft was able to close the deal. When I think about the environment on any of our teams, I build from a perspective of people building a workplace where people feel like they can do their best work in a sustainable way. And they could see this as a long-term career for themselves. So if Xbox employees decided to unionize with Microsoft, support that? We knew when we made the public statement that it wasn't that it would have a broader impact than just the impact at what would potentially happen on the close of Activision Blizzard. My view on metaverse has been in the metaverse for 30 years. Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world recalibrates. Often decades of stagnation, Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation. Corporate giants, policymakers and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that. Every week on Japan ahead, right here on Bloomberg Television. We will never break, we will never break, build on a foundation strong enough to stay. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. We have to get interest rates higher and bring inflation back to our target. We are the fastest to become a scarce. We are running on thin ice. No one deliberately wants to go into battle, but we sleep walk into conflict. With unmatched reach and resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, you are global business authority.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1130,2022-10-09 10:21:10
12905," The moment news breaks, 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. So let's talk about some of the broader trends. You and I talked a lot during the pandemic, gameplay surge. Yeah. During the pandemic, we were all stuck at home. Has that changed? It has changed. We've seen gameplay hours come down a bit, which I will say I think is a good thing. People should get outside. People should moderate. Long-term growth trajectory for the business is incredibly durable and strong. You have adults now that have grown up playing like myself, and it's become a more normal part of how people entertain and how families spend time. As the economy has tightened for consumers, as gas prices are higher, people are worried about what their home economic situation looks like. We're seeing gameplay hours kind of stay strong. I think from a value perspective, gaming's a good value for people at a time of kind of economic constriction. People bought Minecraft. They can continue to go play Minecraft. What about supply chain? What challenges are you still seeing? Are all the consoles that you want to have made in time for the holidays going to be here? I still think demand will outstrip supply for us this holiday. We will see when we get into 2023. You'll start to see more that supply is catching up with demand, and maybe actually see one in the store when you walk in. What's the future of the console? I mean, our console is going to be around in 10 years. If even Microsoft is sort of de-emphasizing. I equate in my head gaming on console to gaming on a television, but absolutely people are playing on more screens. And I think for us as a platform, if we don't adopt that, as part of our strategy, we're kind of pushing against what our customers are asking for. We talked a bit about kids earlier, and as a mom, I'm always slightly terrified that my kids are playing too much. Video games are ruining their brains. They're going to be exposed to all this bad stuff. That's all the positive. You're a very pro game for kids. And I wonder how do you support that? As a parent, you know what's best for your kid first. Like, I'm not going to say what's best for any individual's kids. What we can say in the research backs this up, that gaming can be a great on-ramp for kids into STEM education, as they think about, well, how are these games built? I also think the community power of gaming is something that doesn't get talked about enough. Last night, I was playing Escape Room on Xbox with one of my friends. And while the conversation might start about how are we going to escape from this room, then we're talking about his daughter who's looking at colleges. And we just talk about life, like people will, when they're in the same place. And I think that ability for gaming, whether it's with kids or adults, to bring people from different backgrounds, different geographies, different socioeconomic, different religion, different genders, together, and shared experiences, is pretty unique out there. And I think building those connections that video games can enable, maybe this is too altruistic, but there aren't enough of those things in the world today. Which brings me to the metaverse. You know, obviously, Sasha came on my show. I hope that this is the next big thing that happens off to the mobile internet. Facebook changed its name, to meta. Some gamers don't even want this whole metaverse thing. My view on metaverse is gamers have been in the metaverse for 30 years. When you're playing games, if you're playing a world of warcraft game, you're playing in Roblox. You're playing in a racing game where everybody's in a shared world. These 3D shared worlds that gamers have been playing in for years and years. I think what we've found is there's more connection, as I was talking about before, because we have shared purpose. It's not at all surprising to me that gamers might look at metaverse and think, well, I don't really get it, because we've already, I already have an avatar of myself. And I can already go into a shared world. And I can already sit there and have voice conversations with people anywhere. But I do think the skills that we have as game designers and game creators make a ton of sense in a lot of enterprise experiences. And this is why Satti gets excited about it. What about crypto? Play to earn is all the rage right now. Play to earn specifically is something I'm cautious about. It creates a worker force out of players for certain players to kind of monetize. And now to be fair for us in the game industry.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1131,2022-10-09 10:25:56
12906," It creates a worker force out of players for certain players to kind of monetize. Now, to be fair for us in the game industry, this has existed for years and years. There have been gold farmers of people who literally just spend their time doing some menial task in a game to accrue some currency that they could sell to some other rich player and for real money so that that person doesn't have to spend their time. But now you find games that are starting to build that into the economy of the game itself. We made some comments in Minecraft about how we view NFTs in this space because we saw people doing things that we thought were exploitive in our product and we said we don't want that. I think sometimes it's hammer looking for a nail when these technologies come up. But the actual human use or player use in our case of these technologies, I think there could be some interesting things. So let's talk about your priorities looking forward. You're in the middle of trying to do this really big deal. Are we going to see you keep doing deals? Are you still on the look out for new studios or new geographic locations where you want to build out Microsoft's gaming presence? Definitely on the second part, geographic expansion is critically important. We've hired our first people in Nigeria now as part of our team. We have teams in India, teams in South America. Again, when I talk about 3 billion gamers, I'll just use Africa for a second. 1.2 billion people in the continent. Average age is what? 20 or 21. It's very, very likely that the next big hit games that we're going to see are not from the traditional locations, not from the traditional people. And I think that's fantastic. So geographic expansion is critical. Cloud is important to that as we put our data centers in places and we can not only distribute the games but allow creators to use our cloud development platforms to build games without having to have the local hardware right there in their house or in their office to go build. I think that is important. So we're going to do a little rapid fire. Okay. So what are you playing now? Cult of the Lamb. Most important meeting you've ever played a game in? You're trying to give me trouble, but it's games. Have you ever just played a game in a meeting with Sasha? It's easier on teams calls because they can't see your screen. You're not in the same room with people. I have played games. Sauti has caught me playing games before. And yeah, I'd say Sauti, a meeting. I plead the fifth. What's your favorite thing to do when you're not gaming? Have all things snowboard with my family? You have a lot of gaming fans. Who do you fan over? One of the things I'd love to go do is find a game I've never heard of and go spend time with it and then talk to the creators about it. I think creating something, putting it out there is such a brave thing to do. If you could see any band in their prime, who would it be? Wow. So I'm a punk rock fan, so I'd probably go back and say like the Ramones. Best piece of advice for your 20s. When I think about at least my career, not the only lens I have, there have been a number of times when others have made bets on me that I probably didn't think I was ready for, including the job I'm in now. And to listen to the others around you when they are making a bet on you, when they're pulling you to go do things, at least for me who was probably reticent, maybe a little imposter syndrome kicking in on was I really ready for something. But understand that others around you when they're encouraging you, that they're probably doing it for good reason. How do you balance work life and play? My little 15 minute commute back and forth is my transition zone of I'm now at work, I'm now at home. I don't even have a home office because when I'm home, I'm not at work. It's just always been my thing is that segmentation with my family and what I do. It doesn't mean I've never responded to a mail when I'm at home. But I'm very regimented that way. When COVID happened, it didn't work. And it didn't work emotionally, it didn't work, output wise, like motivation. And I was pretty transparent about that with the people around me and how I had to change things. Does that mean you want everyone else to come back to the office? No, people have to work in the way that works for them. What does the gaming industry look like in five years and what does it look like in 20 years? We're going to see video games really gain their space in telling stories that really change people's perspective on others lived experience. And I think that's a pretty cool thing. All right, thank you. I like you. I like you.

12908," Haking down Bitcoin. Katie Han soon realized this new technology was much more than a tool used by criminals. She dove deep and became a crypto convert, swapping her prosecutor hat for a board seat at Coinbase, and became the first female general partner, Adventure firm and recent Horowitz. Han, now a prolific crypto investor, recently launched her own fund with one and a half billion dollars to deploy. It's the largest fund ever raised by a single investor. Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, CEO and founder of Han Ventures, Katie Han. Katie, it's so great to have you. Great to be back here in the studio with you, Emily. I want to start with a vibe check. Okay. What state of the crypto cycle are we in right now? It was hot. Yep. And then it got pretty cold. Well, look, Emily, zooming back, because I've been in crypto for a decade, if you can believe it. We've seen crypto be really hot, and then all of a sudden not. And so we've seen this before. However, I think one of the things that's a little bit different now is with each new crypto cycle, more and more people come into it. And so it's more and more pronounced each cycle. And I would push back on it's not. I think it depends on what area of the ecosystem you're looking at. We think developers think crypto, and Web3 is still really hot. I am seeing a lot less of those. We're all going to make it hashtags. I am seeing a lot less of them too, although I am spending less time on Twitter, so maybe that's why as well. But with each cycle, there are new acronyms. What hasn't happened is a crypto winter in the midst of kind of really serious global macro conditions. So we have inflation, kind of at record highs for our generation, and on our lifetime. And then we have also a war that's broken out in the Ukraine. And we have a number of other factors going on here. So that's very different. There was some serious carnage out there. So I see this. Luna, three hours. What's been your takeaways from what? Yeah. I don't want to sit here and tell you that algorithmic stablecoins are bad because I actually think they're really interesting. However, I think what happened is you had, in this case, you mentioned Luna and Tara. You know, that was an algorithmic stablecoin that was getting pretty widespread adoption relative to what the tech could do. I didn't realize you spent your teenage years living in Egypt and learning Arabic. Yeah. Tell me about your upbringing. I was always uprooted. My dad worked for a large company and we were always moving just when I would get comfortable in one space. And I think actually that's pretty important if you fast-forward and look at my career. I'm comfortable being in uncomfortable situations. You know, I didn't know a lot about venture when I got into it initially. I didn't know a lot about crypto when I got into it initially. And I was okay asking questions. I was okay not knowing the local acronyms or the Namanclature of a particular field. And I'm, you know, I'm taken right back to my teenage years in Cairo, moving from Houston, Texas one day to downtown Maddie in Cairo the next day. You studied law. I did. You clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. That's right. You became a federal prosecutor. You were taking on prison gangs and the mafia. That must have taken a really thick skin. I was doing it at age 25. And now if I kind of take a step back and you know, I think that happens at different points in your career. Like, whoa, if I would have analyzed that a little more at the time. And I'm kind of in some ways glad I didn't. And I just dove right in because I found it fascinating. There was a human aspect to it and people's stories. And I felt like those stories mattered. So I was drawn to criminal law and became a federal prosecutor. And I did cases involving violent crime. But then really mistrying cases, being back in the courtroom, being before the grand jury. Like the prosecutor you would see on TV going to try those murder cases. Doing those two hour closing arguments. That's right. And so moved out here to California. I mean, died at the largest prison gang in the world at the time. Outlaw motorcycle gangs, hostage taking, bank robberies, armed bank robberies. There was really not a kind of criminal case by that point in my career. I hadn't done it. It was right around that time. 2012. One of my bosses came in and said, let's have that same energy that you brought to those gang cases, to those murder cases.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1134,2022-10-09 10:39:04
12909," 2012, one of my bosses came in and said, let's have that same energy that you brought to those gang cases, to those murder cases, and let's go ahead and have you investigate this new criminal technology that we really need to look into and possibly shut this down. So you created the first cryptocurrency task force? How would you describe it? Fortunately, several of us in the government realized at the time it's not possible, also not desirable because Bitcoin is not an entity, it's not a person, right, it's a protocol. And it would be like saying, let's go shut down cash, let's go shut down the internet, it's not possible, probably wouldn't be a good idea either. I was using crypto and technologies like the Bitcoin blockchain, because that's all the things that existed then, this is 2012, 2013, to actually uncover criminal activity. So I didn't think that that technology was bad. Frankly, it was a tool that helped me uncover the various activity. And by the way, it was a step level function improvement better than compliance by banks. I'll just go ahead and say it, that's a little bit controversial, but I had spent a decade subpoenaing large financial institutions, and five times out of ten didn't get back what I needed. One case I worked on and people always say, oh, you shut down the Silk Road. What actually happened? I was looking into something completely, not having to do with anything at all of the Silk Road and came across some, what looked to be some kind of odd activity. And it turns out that a couple of federal agents on the Silk Road Task Force out of Washington DC were cropped. And that is the case that I ended up in Diting, and I ended up prosecuting those agents, and they both went to prison. So that's the aspect of what the Silk Road case that I worked on. I would never, never have been able to uncover that criminal activity by those agents, because they were federal agents, they knew how to cover their tracks, had they not use Bitcoin blockchain. Right? So that technology right there, if they had just used wires or cash or even bank wires, we would never have uncovered that. I tell hard is it to launch a crypto fund from scratch.

Back in 1997, I was interested in the following question, which is there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called Saurapod dinosaurs, which had really long skinny necks. So Apatosaurus is an example. I also had really long skinny tails. So I made a computer model that showed that in fact the tail of these Saurapod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip, a bull whip. The way a bull whip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. And that crack is a sonic boom. I think the way they got a date was to impress the females by making loud booms. So you became kind of a crypto convert after this. You joined the board of coin base. That's right. That's very early on. How did you and coin base and Brian Armstrong come together? I hosted an event here in San Francisco at the Federal Reserve Bank and believe it was there that it wasn't just Brian. It was a lot of what I'll call legitimate actors and crypto who wanted to usher in this new wave, this new ecosystem. And then we brought together the heads of all kinds of agencies. Really in an effort to kind of talk about building bridges, you know, the government and the crypto industry. We're never going to see eye to eye on a lot of things, but we did think there were some on L left at home with some ownership. That's some way from美味. For them are getting pretty close to each other.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1135,2022-10-09 10:43:10
12910," The government and the crypto industry, we're never going to see eye to eye on a lot of things, but we did think there were some commonalities. Coinbase is a company that has suffered, they've been losing share, the valuation of public markets has plummeted. Why do you think that is and how do you think it can be fixed? Yeah, well I think again a few things it's tied to. One, a large aspect of Coinbase's business now, of course, is trading revenue. And that's down when prices are down. And you know, the company's been very transparent about that long before going public. I mean, also if you look at its S1, it specifically identifies that. And just how volatile crypto cycles are. So I think that's part of it. It's judged by public markets as a technology stock or as a financial services company. By the way, I think it's both. I think it's not just a financial services company. I think it's so much more. I think it's really a portal to this whole new ecosystem. You were also on the board of OpenC until recently there's an insider trading situation or accusation going on their Coinbase has also had employees accused of insider trading. How much is this happening within crypto companies and within the industry and how big a problem is? Yeah, I think crypto is under the microscope. So where you have a case, two cases, three cases in crypto ecosystem, which now is a trillion dollar industry. I think multi-billion approaching trillion dollar industry, you're always going to be able to find examples like that. So I don't want to make too much out of a handful of cases. That said, the company Coinbase OpenC, take these things incredibly seriously. Along with your position at Coinbase, you became a partner at one of the most storied venture capital for American Valley in the United States. That is Andrewson Horowitz. What was your experience at A16Z? There I met Chris Dixon and I met Ben Horowitz and I met Mark Andrewsson and I had worked with them for just about a year, maybe a little bit over when they asked me to come and co-run their crypto funds at Andrewson Horowitz. Again, I jumped at that chance and I think really that speaks to the fact that as I said before, things are a hell yes or there are no and it was a hell yes for me. So Andrewson Horowitz is the kind of place where if you make a partner, you don't leave. Yeah. How did Mark and Ben respond when you said, yeah, why don't you start a crypto fund of my own? As you might know, Emily, they're an anchor. They're an anchor check into my fund and I'm very grateful for that. Mark and Chris and folks like them are also personal LPs. So I felt very supported when I shared that decision and I will say that it was not running away from Andrewson Horowitz. It was running to another opportunity. And you know, crypto is not, what do they say? It's not a spectator sport. It's like, you're in it. It's excuse very young. It's 24-7. It's global and it's hustle and at this, and that's a trade-off. It's a life trade-off. And at this point in my career and in my life, if I was going to continue to make that trade-off, I just wanted to do it and do it in a way that was really true to me. So you struck out on your own? Yes. To launch on ventures, what gave you the courage to do that? What was the spark that lit the fire? Yeah. That got you to say, I need to do this and do this now. Sure. What I set out to do was to continue to invest in this ecosystem that I think is so broad that decision was very purposeful and the timing was very purposeful. We have an early stage fund that does seed stage, series A, even series B. And then we have what we call an acceleration fund, which is, it's not a growth fund. It's a crypto growth fund. And I think those are different things. But it's later stage. It might be crypto-publics. Certain kinds of public tokens were set up to hold tokens and participate in the token ecosystem. Or later stage companies. I mean, you know, there are now several crypto, many crypto unicorns. Space has become really competitive. Even though you say, you know, crypto's had its kind of ups and downs. The thing is, a lot of people in some of those last cycles have seen the kind of venture style returns that can be had in crypto. And so you've had a lot of new funds enter the space. And that's driven up competition. So what differentiates on ventures then? From, you know, all of these other crypto funds or even the more traditional venture capitalists like entries in Harowitz or Sequoia. They also have crypto funds. Sure. I think a lot of traditional venture capital funds now have crypto funds. It used to just be like a regulatory designation. It was like, are you an RIA, which is registered investment advisor? I would say for crypto founders today, it's not enough to just be an RIA.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1136,2022-10-09 10:47:58
12911," Regulatory designation. It was like, are you an RIA, which is registered investment advisor? I would say for crypto founders today, it's not enough to just be an RIA, right? They, frankly, I don't even know if a lot of them care. That's a regulatory designation. What crypto founders today want to know is, do you live and breathe crypto? Do you inhale the discourse? Are you part of the community? Do you participate in governance? Are you going to be staking these kind of crypto verbs out there? If you're not really in this space full time, I think it's very hard to run a successful crypto fund. We don't have a hedge fund component. So we're not sitting here buying and trading and selling. That's a hedge fund structure. And there are crypto hedge funds. We're not one. We're making seven to ten year bets. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund from scratch? You know, it's hard, but it's not impossible. We don't have a crystal ball. I don't know. I can't predict cycles, but I knew that we were in a cycle where you saw so much for a river and excitement around the space. And I already talked about what makes this different, but I think one thing also is we are a nimble strike force. We don't fish in the same pond. We have the crypto natives. We have a fishing execution. We have operators, seasoned operators who really know how to stick the landing. And I think that's reflected on our culture. I would say the only thing that's changed in our strategy as a result of the market correction is really more of a focus on early stage, but we still have our late stage fund. And when we see valuations, which I think will still see correct, spoiler, I think we'll continue to see some corrections. And so we might deploy our later stage fund a little bit more slowly. It might not be on an even 50-50 cadence, and that's okay. Long-term, our strategy hasn't changed. Long-term, we're committed to this space. How much do you think valuations are going to correct? You know, it's just, I can't give you a one-size-fits-all answer because crypto is not a monolith. We have some crypto companies that really follow more of an enterprise SaaS business model. You have others that are layer one protocols. You have still others that are consumer-facing applications. And I think one of the things we're seeing right now is the infrastructure layer. And that's where we're spending a lot of our time, by the way. And we think more and more use cases will come about when the infrastructure layers in place. So my own view is we are not rushing to deploy. We're certainly not getting caught up. We're going to get VC FOMO and have you not deploy that. You know, look, I think it's very easy to get into that mindset, right? It's because it's a competitive sport. It's a competitive space. And I think I'd be lying if I said that that doesn't influence anyone. I try to, what I do, and I think I do differently, is I try to take stock of that. Oh, that's the FOMO mentality kicking in. That's bad. Again, you don't want to over-crack, though. What we look for is we look for amazing founders. It doesn't matter if I think valuations will correct if they're amazing founders. There's a huge tam. We also look for what's your regulatory plan? If you're launching a token, what's your plan to comply with the law? What's your plan for security, by the way? We've seen a lot of hacks in the space. We want to really dive in there and make sure that the founders have been thoughtful about, especially if they're custodian customer funds, keeping those funds secure. If it's a cross-chain bridge, what are the exploits? Have you changed your strategy at all, given the downturn? What? We don't have any deals or decided not to do certain deals. Because the conditions have changed, don't you raise the fund? We have decided not to do certain deals. We've never backed out of a deal. We have decided not to do a few deals because we think that pricing was ahead of progress candidly. And we might have been wrong about that, Emily. We might have been wrong about that. But I think if we were wrong not to do a couple of deals, better that we might have been right. Because if we were wrong about that, I think we can find a way to still invest in those projects later. Well, one thing I'm hearing is that a lot of dry powder has just sacked up because all these funds raised a lot of money raised. What was the biggest fund ever for a single person, not just a woman? Anyone? Are you confident you're going to have a place to put all that money? I am, but if I don't have a place to put it, I'm not just going to go willing, nearly deploy it. One of the things that we told our LPs even during the period when we raised our fund, which was when crypto was undeniably still on a bull run. We said that we are going to be pretty steadfast sticking to a tier deployment cycle. And I think one thing that's changed is that might have lengthened. It certainly hasn't shortened. But we will again, we feel very good.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1137,2022-10-09 10:52:24
12912," And you know, I think one thing that's changed is that might have lengthened. It certainly hasn't shortened. But we will, again, we have, we feel very good that we have the capital to back great teams when we see them. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind. I mean, we're falling behind. Watch Bloomberg surveillance early edition for the news you need when you need it. I'm Matt Miller with Kayleigh Limes in New York and Edwards in London. Australia's central bank raises interest rates twice as much as Paul Coffin. Then surveillance for in-depth analysis. Outside some keen and Lisa Brownbottes, I'm Jonathan Ferro, the MPI, Fronts and Senses. How does Japan get away with not raising rates? Can it sustain its normal at a time when everybody else is facing a very different way out? Bloomberg surveillance. Be informed. Be prepared. Be ahead of the game. We're going to be in the next generation. Money and power collide in Silicon Valley and beyond. Bloomberg technology with Emily Chang. Weekdays at 5 p.m. in New York and 2 p.m. in San Francisco. Access the financial world on demand. We're going to be in the next generation. We're going to be in the next generation. We're going to be in the next generation. To be concerned about the declining demand. We're going to increasingly live in a digital world. You're not going to be satisfied to rent them. We buy our content from Walg Gardens without digital scarcity. You don't really own anything. You're subject to the whims of a platform. I think NFTs and digital scarce goods fundamentally change that. I think you'll see NFTs back again. We are spending a lot of time in the infrastructure layer. I tell you zero-knowledge, technology, scalability. We think of that as the plumbing. If you think of the fiber-optic cables. Remember, you couldn't have had YouTube and Netflix with dial-up. You couldn't have streamed content. The same is true of crypto use cases. We think there will be a lot of new use cases unlocked when the infrastructure is there. When it's more efficient, when it's more user-friendly. We're spending a lot of our time there. President Biden issues this crypto executive order. There are a number of ports that are coming due. What do you want to see from the administration when it comes to regulation? Are you optimistic that we will get there? We were so delighted to see that executive order. This is not something you should normally be delighted about. But why we were is because it was to us a real recognition that this is a US government saying this field isn't going anywhere. This field is growing. It's growing so much that we are going to direct every single agency in the federal government to come up with a plan here. I think we take a step forward, but then you see we're a big government. We're a big system. We have states. We have local entities. So we take a step forward with the EO. And then we take some steps back sometimes too. And I think what I see as crypto founders are confused by that. They're starting to think, well, I could go to this jurisdiction where there's a single regulator. And you don't have 50 states with different rules. It's the US government that needs to start taking stock of the fact that right now, Emily in China, there's a quarter of a billion ECNY wallets, a quarter of a billion. We're still talking about whether there should be a government central bank digital currency. We're still studying that. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. We're falling behind. And we're falling behind. What are the dangers of falling behind China? The rest of the world. This is years ahead. So I don't want people to take a headline and say, oh, I think the US dollar will be no longer the global currency, reserve global currency. I'm not saying that now. But fast forward decades. And if you no longer need to use the dollar because you have an alternative, I think that's a real problem. What would we use instead? Well, I think that there are going to be stable coins out there.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1138,2022-10-09 10:56:34
12913," Well, I think that there are going to be stable coins out there that people who have access to a smartphone will use. There is a demand for it. We see all 285 percent year over your growth of stable coins. So people are clearly liking the idea of this. Now, again, there have been some spectacular failures too, but not all stable coins are created the same. But I think the important thing is that we really do need to not just squash innovation. What do you think of how Gary Gensler, the chair of the SEC, and how he's approaching it? One of the things that I hear from founders is that they're very confused because they get told, come in, register, just come in and talk to us. But you have the one company who's done the ultimate act of going in and registering coinbase, filed an S1. And still, you know, there's a lot of saber rattling still going on, I think. And again, I don't want to single out the SEC. And I don't want to suggest that anything they're doing is bad. I do think that right now there's a lot of confusion. And one of the pieces of confusion stems from the fact that, you know, and it started with the ICO, Mania back in 2016, 2017. I can't even remember which year now, where the SEC was very loud about securities. A lot of them were securities, but the space has changed. And so to still view it through the ICO lens when so much has happened over the last five years in the space, I think is a mistake. What do you have to say to the skeptics out there who just don't believe in the future of Web 3? And don't see where this is going. I would say don't judge the current state of innovation by the end state of innovation. I hear from a lot of these skeptics. And by the way, I'm friends with a lot of these skeptics too. I don't only want to live in a crypto bubble. They want to see the use cases, especially if they're not technical. Well, when am I going to use it? What will I use it for? And I think one of the things that's not appreciated is how quickly the infrastructure here is catching up. And once you have kind of a, once you have really scalable blockchains that can handle a lot of thorough put and are very efficient, I think that unlocks a whole lot of use cases. People are spending more time on screens. That curve is up and to the right. Whether we like it or not, that is the future. I mean, those who have kids know that kids spend more time online. They want digital things too. And I think to dismiss it, it is a bit generational. I do find not always, but it is a bit generational. If you talk to kids about being able to have money online, they instantly get that concept. They're comfortable not having to hold something in their hand to think it has value. Take us to the end state. Do Google and Amazon and Facebook and Apple still exist? I believe they will still exist. I mean, it depends what you talk about when you talk about the end state. I mean, I think that, you know, I think for decades, those companies will still be around. But the important thing is I think this new ecosystem is going to represent a challenge to them. I do think that those entities, decentralized forces are coming and we'll cut into those entities, profits and revenues. So we have a little rapid fire section. If you could belong to any altcoin tribe. So it would be. Gosh. There is no way I'm answering that because I will get trolled on Twitter by every other altcoin tribe. I'm a crypto maximalist. I'm a crypto maximalist. I'm not picking one. Booker podcast. You're binging now. Okay. I'm I yes. I am. Gosh. I'm binging on wheat crashed. Something that brings you simple joy. You know, one of the things that I love and I've missed being away from this summer is swimming. I just love I find like some of my best thoughts come to me while I'm moving career philosophy. Yeah. Do a job where you know 50% of the job and where you're going to learn 50% of the job. Again, that goes back to no growth in the comfort zone, no comfort in the growth zone.

We are protecting 80% of the world's biodiversity because our way of life do not harm nature at the opposite. We are strengthening ecosystems. We improve biodiversity by cooperating with the birds and trees, listening to the winds, observing the cloud, learning from even the little insect. We protect nature by setting up our own limits. We don't take more that mother earth can give and we give back. We protect the sacred trees. We don't destroy the field of the medicinal plants. We choose, pre-susely, the animal that we can kill to just keep the balance of the ecosystem. As all of us know in this fight, no one can afford to sit on the sidelines. No one can claim that climate change is somebody else's problem or shrug it off for future generations to address. We're all affected by a warming planet. We see that every day. And decisions being made right now will determine our shared tomorrow. So we must choose and we must act as united nations ourselves. Our progress depends on collective action, on collective ingenuity. If we stick together, we can make fixing the climate the greatest project and greatest achievement of our lifetimes. We have the science, we have the solutions. Now all the world needs is political will. Together we can create a future where rampant carbon is removed from the atmosphere, where green buildings and green business transform the levability of communities. Where easy access to renewable energy enables greater equity. Where sustainable agriculture feeds a growing global population. The needs are urgent and the costs of inaction are worse than any nightmare. But let us not be driven by, let us be driven by hope not fear, by optimism not despair. Because hope is not passive. Hope is the ultimate source of renewable energy pushing us forward every day to try and try again. Today, the earth shop prize innovation summit in partnership with Mike Bloomberg and Bloomberg Philanthropies will ask each and every one of us what we can do to accelerate progress to repair our planet this decade. And offer solutions on how to collaborate to drive this ambitious but essential climate agenda. We will continue to drive impact around system changing climate solutions and amplify the earth shop prizes call to accelerate progress to repair our planet through collaboration and innovation. But most importantly, we will remind ourselves what can be achieved when we turn pessimism to optimism and optimism into action. Coming up, more from the panelists and finalists here at the earth shop prize innovation summit, this is Bloomberg. It is crucially important and I think we've moved from this attitude from its indulgence a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s and so it makes it a really exciting field because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harness to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts but if you want to be wise, you really want wisdom, you got to know.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1141,2022-10-09 11:11:58

You will shed light on dark matter. You will make aging optional. You will turn 5G up to 11. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer, disrupt. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. Welcome back to the best of the earth shot prize innovation summit. The guests featured ranged from heads of state to leaders of grassroots environmental organizations. Well, amongst them was philanthropist and Microsoft founder Bill Gates. Yeah, it's too bad you can't do things overnight in either mitigation adaptation. You know, when I last went through Europe, people were the leaders were all saying, hey, give me technology. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. People are the leaders were all saying, hey, give me technologies. So I can tell Putin to get lost. I said, hey, in five years, you're going to be able to call him up. They were like, no, we'd like it. No. What I mean is you're going to be able to call him up. We're going to do it. Usually between the time you start and they get out in the farmers' fields, it's about eight years. Now, we have a pipeline of innovations. You know, we've been funding this CG system for 20 years now. It's funded about a billion a year. It's if people care at all about adaptation, that thing will be funded at two billion a year. I mean, there won't be anything close to the impact of climate related seeds, rice, wheat, sort of a millet. And thank goodness because of human genetics we know how to do the editing, thank goodness because of AI, we know how to find the alleles, because of drones, we can measure stuff in the field. So there's huge advance in terms of how the whole seed ecosystem moves at full speed. The timing is very tricky here. The warming doesn't stop the day you get to zero emissions. There's a lag in this system. It's about a 20-year lag. So you haven't seen that Earth temperatures not equilibrated to the atmospheric CO2 content. So when you get to zero, that's not, it's not like 2051, take my air conditioner away. No, it starts quite a bit later. And so you have to look at what the peak is and you can't just plan for okay, 2030, 2030s where your main production in central Africa is down 25%. By 2050, it's down 70%. And you will have switched in most of those areas from a fairly heat sensitive crop to sorghum. Now sorghum productivity is super low. So we'll get people to do better maize for these next 15 years and then they are going to have to switch to sorghum. It is tough when you see the floods in Pakistan. I mean nobody expected that. You know, if the goal of climate was to make us pay attention, wow, that is way beyond expectation. So some adaptation money literally will just be disafter recovery money. The boundary of what's what is also pretty confusing. I mean, what is food aid? You know, if climate's causing some food production losses, all world food program money, is that all climate adaptation?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1142,2022-10-09 11:17:58
12917," If climate's causing some food production losses, all world-proof program money, is that all climate adaptation money? It's certainly the need for it's going up. That's a system that's about six and a half billion a year. So relative to the systemic solution, which is the research piece, it's relatively larger, but the demand for that piece, which is the acute half a Pakistani rice got flushed away. And so you're going to have malnutrition problems if you don't go in for that. That's also a type of adaptation. And so I do think, we're going to bring some rigor to this because the pressure now, the goal of doubling the adaptation money from, they say 20 billion here to 40 billion here. The pressure on that is the- Still peanuts. No, it's very small. I mean, literally, yeah, if you start sticking food aid in there, you can use it up very quickly, rebuilding after hurricanes. I mean, we had hurricanes before, but the costs there are absolutely gigantic. You know, there are ways of stopping wildfires, there are ways of dealing with sea level rise. So the innovation agenda, not just on seeds, the innovation agenda is going full speed on mitigation. That's where, you know, there's a hundred companies break through energy funded. There's- So by mitigation, you mean mostly energy. You mean everything to do with energy. You mean generation of energy, you mean batteries, you mean transport, you mean all of the new, and there are some renewables that are already traditional, but more that need to come on. So that's the package that you're talking about mitigation. Or are you also talking about agriculture as mitigation? Yeah, so every area of emissions, you know, the world tends to focus on passing your cars in electricity. That's not a third of emissions. And so the focus on the easiest third, you know, now 4% of new cars are electric, you know, so that's the field that we're furthest along. About 4% of energy generation is wind and solar. And as you triple the size of your grid, and you want that to be say, you know, some people would say 100%, other people might say 70 to 80%. You know, the amount you have to build, we're, you know, not within a factor of five of the build rate of those, but those are the easy sectors. Cement, you know, clean cement costs over twice as much as the way we make cement today. And it's not, it's partly the heating energy. It's partly the basic thing, you know, remember in chemistry, when you take calcium carbonate, and heat it, you get calcium, that's what makes cement. That, the thing that goes away, that's CO2. And so we have to have a way of making cement, which a number of these innovative. And steel and iron. Yep. There's a whole family of hard to obey sectors. That's true. You get a vet industrial sector. If you get green hydrogen that's cheap enough, it actually solves quite a large number of those. Some of the industrial processes you go straight to electricity, and some you go through, you do your reduction using the hydrogen, where you would have used some hydrocarbon concept before. For steel, we actually have companies doing both. We have electricity, steel, and others doing electricity is the way of replacing the blast furnace. And then we have others that take hydrogen. And if you get the hydrogen cheap enough, you get the supermatchic thing, which is that the green product doesn't cost more, that's called green premium equals zero. And then your adoption scale is utterly different. If we tried to subsidize steel and cement, say rich countries say, okay, we want to get rid of that, which those two are 15% of emissions, that's greater than all foreign aid budgets put together. It's over 200 billion foreign aid, never will pass that number. It's just not politically possible. It's a number that's at about.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1143,2022-10-09 11:20:57

Coming up, but more from the panelists and finalists here at the earth's shop prize innovation summit. This is Bloomberg. We will never break. We will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never break. Have a wide array of zips and the mountains shake. All of will remain. We will never. We will never. No. Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world recalibrates. The decades of stagnation, Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation. Corporate giants, policymakers and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that. Every week on Japan ahead, right here on Bloomberg Television. Welcome back to the earth's shop prize innovation summit. Finalists of the annual award appeared alongside special guests, including worldwide business leaders, philanthropists and non-governmental activists. Now while the 2022 finalists have been announced, our panelists have their eyes on the future and here's what they have to say. This is the earth's short decade. We are in a race to repair and regenerate the planet. Some will focus on policy, some will focus on activism. We are focused on supporting the game changes, the innovators, the entrepreneurs and the problem solvers. We believe in the power of human ingenuity, grit and determination to create solutions that if scaled could repair the planet. We have only 8% of the ocean protected today and our earth's shot is 30% of the ocean at least, 30% of the ocean protected by 2030. We know that if we protect the right 30%, not only we will prevent the extinction of many marine species, but also we will produce more fish. This will be this protected area, it will produce a spillover that will exceed the foreground. We will have more fish to eat, food security, livelihoods for people. We know that for every dollar that we invest in protected area in a marine reserve that produces 10 dollars in economic output and creates more jobs. It's a triple win for marine life, for food security and for climate and of course for the economy. That's the goal, the mission to in the next 8 years and that's where the earth shot is really crazy. In the next 8 years we need to quadruple all the ocean protection that has ever happened in human history. Are you optimistic that I can be done? I am optimistic there's no choice. I've seen firsthand the potential that a breakthrough idea can hold and if we start seeing more of these transformative solutions across all the challenges facing our planet and suddenly our earth shot won't seem so improbable. The work will be difficult, it'll take extraordinary resources, determination, partnership.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1144,2022-10-09 11:24:40
12919," that then suddenly our earth shot won't seem so improbable. The work will be difficult. It'll take extraordinary resources, determination, partnership. But we've got all the essentials right here in this room. So what is the challenge? It's the speed, scale, and cost of making these green hydrogen generators. Well, that's exactly what we are working on. Because to make green hydrogen the fuel source of the future, it needs to be cheaper than fossil fuels. And that means, electrolyzers are going to need to be really, really cheap. If you want to take a solution around the globe as quickly as possible, you need to make it standardized, mass-produced commodity. A product that is easy to make and quick to build and cheap as well. And so while some believe electrolyzers need to be large machines, we believe the electrolyzer should be a standardized, mass-producible product that can make green hydrogen anywhere for anyone. In 2030, we imagine millions and millions of projects on restore. And not just places on earth where we see nature being brought back, but all of the other nodes that are key to ensuring success. So the technology providers, the nurseries, the seed banks, the funders, the government incentive programs, so that we have an ecosystem that really allows us to leverage the many, many connections within the nature-based solution space. And in 2030, we have been focused on another key area, which is cities. And cities require data and insights to take action on climate and to preserve nature, to create more nature and tree canopy. So we've set a goal that we want to- We have more nature in cities, exactly. Exactly. Right. And we've been partnering with cities like Los Angeles to give them insights utilizing AI and geo-mapping on where all the places that you can create more tree canopy, which reduces urban heat islands, improves air quality sequesters carbon. So we want to bring data and solutions to bringing nature into cities as well as, of course, preserving and restoring nature. And so one of the goals that we've set is we want to enable over 500 cities around the world. I know we're going to hear from the mayor of Paris after this to reduce a gigaton of carbon emissions by 2030. And so that's through data, tools, insights, whether that's evolving transportation systems or planting new tree canopy. So that's a big bold target that we want to see achieved by 2030. Anyway, I guess I'm in the wrong place. I came here to invite all of you to the Grouch Convention. But it turns out you're all about my least favorite thing, helping. Oh, you've got me, Oscar. I do like helping people learn how to reuse repurpose and recycle. Together, everyone in this room can build a world where nothing goes to waste. And that includes even you. Me? Sorry, my guy. I got to get going to that convention. But just between us. Yes? I do have a recycling bin right next to my can. But don't let that get out OK. It'll ruin my image. But my father believed in the power of the idea. And over time, the vision, the purpose, the courage, it embodied has inspired each generation to take on its own challenges, not because they're easy, but because they're hard. President Kennedy understood that the effort to land on the moon would bring out the best in us that everyone would have to contribute, that it would require innovation, creativity, teamwork, commitment, and faith. And that world would be better because of it. The Earth Shot Prize has inspired the same spirit of optimism and ingenuity on a global scale to tackle the most pressing challenge we now face, repairing the planet.

I'm Francing Lackwap from New York, and this is Bloomberg. So, is there more pressure when you're trying to win a basketball championship than when you're trying to please investors? Where's the greater pressure? Oh, I think it's definitely trying to win a championship. It's hard because when you invest and you know this, when you're investing, you can control a lot more things. When in a basketball court, you can't control whether somebody's going to make a shot, you've got to get lucky. And what's the greater pleasure making five times your money on a distressed debt investment or winning the NBA championship? They're both fabulous. I wish I could do one each year. That would be great. But I think there's a great feeling in being right on an investment that you've done a tremendous amount of work and you've made money for your clients, which I think is great. I think winning a championship is, it's a very surreal feeling because there's a whole city or state that is actually behind you. You know, we had 70,000 people at the finals and we had them all outside. We had 17,000 in stands and then literally like 60,000 people outside. And when we won, like just the joy that you had brought to the city was phenomenal. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. We have to get interest rates higher and bring inflation back to our targets. It's better to pass this become a skier. We are running on thin ice. No one deliberately wants to go into battle, but we sneak walk into conflict with unmatched reach and resources. From more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. Water represents one of the biggest threats posed by climate change. That's because rising seas stronger storms and heavier rainfall could massively increase flooding by the end of the century. It's already starting to happen and it's very likely to get worse. It's easy to feel overwhelmed looking at footage like this. It seems like no one has any idea what to do about this problem. So we're just going to see more and more damaging floods year after year. But there is one place where it's possible to imagine a very different future. When you look at the city of Rotterdam, the water is in our genes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1146,2022-10-09 11:33:14
12921," When you look at the city of Rosadam, the water is in our genes, you could say we are already working for a thousand years on this topic. Keeping the water out isn't a new challenge for the Netherlands. It's a battle they've been fighting for centuries. So when the effects of climate change started to crop up, they were like, yeah, let's do this, we're ready. We traveled to Rotterdam to find out how this city is getting ready for the future, and whether the ingenious stuff they've come up with will ultimately be enough to save them. And hopefully the rest of us too. When you look at Holland or the Netherlands, the name the Netherlands already says that we are a low-lining country. One third of this country is below sea level and two third is vulnerable to flooding. Back in the day, the only things keeping the water at bay were the dicks, which are basically just raised mounds of earth. Once every few decades, the water would overwhelm the dicks and cause catastrophic flooding, and that was just the way things were. Until one day in 1953, all that suddenly changed. A powerful storm struck the southern coast, overwhelming dicks that had been badly damaged in the Second World War. On the morning of February 1st, 1953, Koso's father and brother woke him up and told him what had happened. They say, oh, everything was water and your mother and sister, I don't, I have to see. In 1953, almost 2,000 people died and that was the moment for us we said this can have happened again. That's the time we started making our first barrier. The flood galvanized the Dutch government to build the world's most powerful flood defense system, the Delta Works. It was a series of modernized dams and storm surge barriers that took more than 40 years to complete. And the final act of the Delta Works is the barrier over here, the Maasland barrier, made to protect Rotterdam. We're looking at the biggest movable storm surge barrier in the world. This is the same size the Eiffel Tower, so you're looking in an Eiffel Tower laying on its side. Most of the time, the barrier stays open so ships can pass through. When a storm comes along, it snaps shut, preventing the storm surge from traveling up river and flooding Rotterdam. The movable design was radical when it was completed in 1997 and it's inspired similar structures in flood-prone cities around the world. Did you look at St. Petersburg on Russia? A small version of this barrier has been made over there and maybe in the future in front of Manhattan, the thing in about the way to protect that also. So this was the first one and now smaller versions are coming all over the world. But the barrier on its own isn't enough to keep Rotterdam from flooding. Talking about climate change, we see an increase of more intensive rainfall. We already are facing now intense more skilled flooding, so we need more places where we can store this water. Our nowed Mullinar is also working to keep Rotterdam dry.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1147,2022-10-09 11:37:48
12922," Our places where we can store this water. Our nowed Molinar is also working to keep Router Dam dry, not by keeping the water out, but by giving it a place to go. This is the water square. And it is actually, you could say, a symbol for our approach, how to become climate adaptive. So under normal circumstances, this square can be used as, for example, a well-skabal field. But on days like this, its stores access rainwater and keeps it from flooding the streets. So it's a multifunctional solution. We want to add quality to the urban space, but in this way, we are also adding water storage. This is the first water square that we have been developing, but it's part of a bigger package of measures. An interesting one close by here is what we call the Duck Park, or the rooftop park, which is a kind of a long levy of one kilometer. And on top of it, a huge green park, its storing excess of rainwater because of the green roof. Looking at the challenges related to climate change, a lot of people think it's going to cost us a lot of space and money. And we try to show that we can use it to work on a better city. In some ways, the Dutch are just as baffled as the rest of us about climate change. For one thing, there's the question of what happens when sea levels rise beyond a certain point. The Maslant barrier was built to withstand one meter of sea level rise, and a redesigned barrier could potentially handle even more than that. But there's only so much that even Dutch engineering can do. Beyond two meters, it's difficult. We are working on new scenarios. Supposed it will be more than two meters, four meters, five meters. Then what people ask me, will you be moving on a certain moment and time to the higher grounds in the Netherlands? I can't imagine that that will be a decision. For survivors like coasts, on the other hand, it's not so hard to imagine the worst. Nobody will realize that there will be a end of nightlife here. I think they all will be refugees. I think in 300 years, rather than we'll still be here. But when sea level rise four or five meters, we all have to find additional solutions. Any idea what does it be? Maybe on a larger scale, investing in floating districts, floating cities. And that brings us to our final and most radical solution. My name is Kuhn Althaus. I'm an water architect. For the last 15 years, we've been building floating homes in cities that face climate change and sea level rise. So we have the floating home, which has a floating foundation, and it can move up and down with the fluctuation of the river. But to keep it on one spot, we have these kind of stilts. The water will come up, you will see it at the house. We'll move up, up, up, up. And if the water goes down, it just guides us back. 100 years ago, you see cities start to grow up with high-rise buildings because they saw the space in the air. Well, we see the city has to grow on the water. It's not only about houses, it's about floating apartment buildings, floating roads, floating parks, all the kind of urban components you need to make your city more waterproof. Who knows? Maybe someday we'll all live in floating houses. Or maybe something entirely new will come along. Preparing for climate change is a tough challenge. But for the innovators of Rotterdam, it's a process of adaptation that never ends. It's not finished our project, it keeps on going, it's an ongoing process. I feel safe, my children will feel safe, and my grandchildren will also feel safe. But after that, you have to think again.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1148,2022-10-09 11:42:32
12923," That's what feels right. But after that, you have to think again. MUSIC MUSIC Part of what I love about business is you get to build things from nothing. I don't have any investors. All this is all money in. This is me just building. It's pretty much full service shadow banking with nobody in charge. MUSIC No one covers the world like Bloomberg.

It is crucially important and I think we've moved from this attitude, from its indulgence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s, and so it makes it a really exciting field because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harnessed to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts, but if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what you bring figures out while you're sleeping. The Brown and a ship, 32 million people here in Tokyo, brace themselves for the worst. 8.9 magnitude. Now we know that's a big number. It was the fifth largest earthquake in history. But the real damage comes from the ferocious tsunami that was unleashed. In some areas, the waves reached 40 meters in height. Sweeping up everything in its path, including cars and ships, unable to withstand the strength and the power of the surging water. Japan is located in the Pacific earthquake belt. This means the country is struck by some of the strongest earthquakes and tsunamis in the world. In the past decade, about 30 tropical storms have also hit the country each year. These natural disasters kill on average 100 to 200 people per year and take a huge toll on the country's economy. But learning from painful experience, Japan has built one of the world's best natural disaster response systems, which includes regular disaster preparedness drills and early warning alerts. Japanese engineers and architects have also pushed the boundaries of technology and design to create resilient disaster proof buildings. This is the world's largest disaster disaster disaster disaster. This is Tokyo's",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1149,2022-10-09 11:46:29
12924," buildings. This is Tokyo Skytree. At 634 meters it's the world's tallest tower. Designed for broadcasting and observation the base of Skytree occupies a relatively small plot of land that isn't ideal for such a tall structure. Designed for such a tall structure is a very impressive structure. It's also very small but the wind is the most severe situation. This plan is about 8kg away from the sea. It's very close to the sea. Even at a low point there was a very strong wind. Adsuo Konishi and his colleagues designed a steel trust tower. So instead of fighting against the wind it can simply pass through the gaps between the trusses. This is a huge building that was not used in ordinary buildings. The reason why we were able to use this tower was because we were able to use it in different ways. To stabilize the tower the team used a traditional Japanese design called Shinbashira that dates back over a thousand years. This is the flexible central pillar of a Japanese pagoda which stabilizes the tiered wooden structure during an earthquake or typhoon in a similar way to a tree trunk supporting its branches. Shinbashira has been found at the center of the world's oldest wooden structure made from a tree felled in 594 AD. For Skytree the team designed a 375 meter tall concrete core column connected to the tower's steel out of frame by a series of flexible oil dampers, devices that control unwanted vibrations. The swaying of the core column and out of frame in opposite directions reduced the vibration of the entire tower by up to 50% during an earthquake and 30% during strong winds. This is the center of Shinbashira. Shinbashira is a very high-rise building. This is the concrete core column. This is the tower of the iron tower. This space is used to put Shinbashira in the tower and make the entire tower move. But since the tower moves too much, it is attached here. To make it more stable, the oil dampers and red devices are set here. The core column is set on six seismic isolators made of rubber. These absorb unwanted movement and work together with the oil dampers at various heights. This is the first place Shinbashira was built. The first place Shinbashira was built was the first concrete core column. Shinbashira was built in a very high place. This building was built to make the floor move. The top part of Skytree is a broadcasting antenna. To ensure high quality, the antenna needs to stay as stable as possible. So two tuned mass damper systems when stored to reduce unwanted vibrations. One is set at an altitude of 625m and weighs 25 tonnes. And the other is at an altitude of 620m.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1150,2022-10-09 11:50:51
12925," 1. 1 is set at an altitude of 625m and weighs 25 tonnes and the other is at an altitude of 620m and weighs 40 tonnes. When the tower shakes, these two dampers act together as reverse pendulums, reducing vibrations caused by wind or an earthquake. When SkyToo was designed in the late 2000s, architects and engineers flew weather balloons to collect data on wind speeds and build models which they tested in a wind tunnel. But for some building designs, this expensive and time-consuming process has been replaced by faster and cheaper software powered by artificial intelligence. After a decade of research, architectural engineering company Takinaka has developed a typhoon simulation software called Kazamidori. For a 3km square urban area, it usually takes three months to build a model conductor wind tunnel test and get the results. But with Takinaka's software, the entire process can happen in just two or three days and its engineers are trying to reduce that down to half a day.

Japanese architects are also experimenting with unconventional building materials for high rises. Sky scrapers are usually built from concrete or steel because they're strong and cost-effective, but building from wood is more environmentally friendly. Compared with the production of steel and concrete, production of timber consumes less energy and releases less carbon dioxide. New trees can also be planted to absorb emissions. But building tall structures with wood offers up its own engineering and financial challenges. That didn't stop Japanese construction company Myida from trying though. Myida is going to construct a 13-story wood and steel hybrid office building in Tokyo, Shibuya district. To make the building earthquake proof, designers came up with a hybrid lattice structure that will support the walls and create a more user-friendly experience. The chemical outerût we used was called expensive and build well-known ways for the themes. In order to use the structure, if you put it outside the glass, the glass will be torn off and torn off. There is a problem that the glass will fall off. So I thought that I could see it from the outside and put it inside the glass. Even if you think about the environment, there is a point where you can see the office building and the first floor. In the building, there is a place where you can walk in the building. And when you think about the space, you can see the space where you can see the space where you can see the space. For example, the back of the glass will be torn off, so the space will be torn off and torn off. The space where the glass will be torn off and torn off will be torn off. So there is only one thing. This is not a glass. It is a place where you can see the data from the other side. The space, the space in the room, the temperature in the room, the equipment from the working concrete, the head is very thick. There is a time when there is a kind of space during the day. It is said that there is a room where you can see the entire space. These designs and technologies have helped high-rise buildings to withstand typhoons in earthquakes. And many low-rise buildings in Japan are starting to adopt them as well. Some vulnerabilities still exist, like older buildings constructed before regulations were tightened in 1981.

She is extremely smart and bright. You need somebody who is able to digest a lot of information that rapidly and can distinguish what is important, what is less important. And she has tremendous skill in that. And she's not afraid to call people out, to call out other members of the executive team if she feels that something isn't being. She does that in a very nice way, actually. She helps me tremendously in steering the company because she is highly regarded by my other colleagues in the senior team. And typically, if they have a problem, they share at first with her before they come to me. When I think about the conversations I have with Frank, the shortest part is actually about the analysis and the facts. It's more the debate about, OK, on that basis, what are the options? What can we do? My role is essentially saying in three sentences, what is working well in this company, where do we have challenges, and what should we do going forward? Deutsche Post DHL Group consists of five divisions. Express. Germany's Post and Parcel Service, Global Forwarding and Freight, Supply Chain, and E-commerce Solutions. Each of these segments has seen revenue growth in the last four years, while the surge of E-commerce volume during the pandemic has had a direct impact on the trajectory. Every C-Ecommerce has a very structural and fundamental growth driver for us as a company. What we now saw under the pandemic was a structural acceleration. It took us forward to a point in terms of e-compensation, which we probably would have reached on the normal circumstances in three years' time. So it was a big step forward. DP DHL was well prepared to take this step. The company's strategic plan recognized E-commerce as a growing trend in the logistics landscape, but no one could have forecast the speed and breadth of the transformation. What we are now seeing that also under the pandemic, not only domestic e-commerce has taken a faster growth trajectories and anticipated, but also cross-border e-commerce. And we see that very clearly in our express network, but also in our e-commerce solutions division. What are the other big structural shifts that you see on the horizon? Is it e-commerce B2B? Is it increased trade as globalization restructures? What are the shifts that you're seeing? The B2B e-commerce is still at a very early stage, so we believe that there will be a huge post-opportunity there. And we also see that when we are talking to our customers now, I guess everybody has been our realize that being dependent on just one supplier in one province in one country is probably not a good idea. So they want to build more resilience into the supply chain. I think our international footprint, our global strengths, is really something we can leverage for the benefit of our customers. Another factor in the company's favor is its balance sheet. Since Melanie Christ became CFO, cash flow has improved significantly. One of my priorities over the last years has been to really focus the whole organization on better cash generation. It's not just a finance job. Making sure that ultimately revenue converts into EBIT and into cash in the bank account is the responsibility of the whole organization. She says, we can't be successful as a company. If we are not collecting the cash for our services, we have provided. And she has not missed one single opportunity talk about that. I think it's a very comfortable situation, particularly in the current environment, to have a strong balance sheet. I think in that respect, I'm very conservative and I'd rather have a bit...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1154,2022-10-09 12:08:39
12929," Comfortable situation, particularly in the current environment, to have a strong balance sheet. I think in that respect, I'm very conservative, and I'd rather have a bit more on the balance sheet and a bit more buffer. Spell out for us what the priorities are, the longer-term priorities, in terms of putting some of that cash to use for you. The first priority here is organic growth. We clearly indicated also this our CAPEX budget, 12 billion for the next three years, that we will keep investing into organic growth. We are very focused on our regular dividend payment. And then, if there is something left, which is fortunately the case at the moment, we will think about inorganic opportunities, and we will also think about other means to allow our shareholders to participate. That is why we are currently running a 2 billion euro share-by-back program. Inorganic opportunities include M&A, like the recent purchase of beverage shipper, Hillerbrand. But deploying cash is always subject to careful consideration. Does Melanie ever turn around and say, no, when you're pushing through or pushing for a particular package of spending? Yes, she does that quite often, because she has... She is a person, and that's great, if you have a CEO who is risk-abuse, because you need somebody. The business is always too optimistic. Melanie might be something too pessimistic, but that's a very healthy discussion. If we then jointly come to the same conclusion after a debate, then we are probably in the right spot. How often do you find yourself saying no to divisional heads? So when I was promoted into the CFO position, my team gave me a stamp with rejected. It sits on my desk. I think the fact that people know it sits there, already has instilled quite a lot of discipline in the organization. So I think when I get a proposal, it has already gone through a number of iterations and is normally of such a high quality that I don't need to reject it a stamp too often. For the time being, Christ should be able to keep that stamp in a drawer. CEO Frank Appell has expressed a commitment to service quality and confidence that customers will accept higher prices that come with it. If you are too expensive, you will be out of business, but if you don't provide the right quality, you will be out of business as well. So we want to be, we will never be the cheapest in town. That's not doable. We are the premium provider. That's our strategy. Of course, it's also more challenging for us when our customers are under pressure. At the same time, I think, over all the last two years have shown that reliable, high quality supply chain comes at a certain price tag. I definitely see that inflation is having a huge impact on the logistics industry. And there's been substantial price increases in the last few years. I do not see that changing. There's a lot of innovation happening. And I don't see the inflation necessarily going away. It might level out a bit, but it's not going to go away. The logistics companies may have pricing power with customers, but their stock prices haven't been so robust. I think the issue there is the increase in interest rates has made everyone rethink and be concerned about the level of inventory that is out, you know, in the system, if you will, and with the level of disruption. I think what's happened more in the last, that means pre-mance, is the more of a view that we're actually heading into, certainly in the coming slowdown, maybe a recession. With more than half its revenue coming from Europe, investors may see DPDHL as more exposed to recession risks than its global peers. The company insists it can meet its revenue targets in the event of a downturn. It's counting on diversification as a cushion. I'm not so pessimistic that there is really a deep recession at our doorstep. But even then, our portfolio is very much balanced. We are everywhere in the world, but not entirely in recession. Would it be a stretch to suggest that DPDHL is to some extent recession-proof? I wouldn't go as far as to say recession-proof, but I think we are very well positioned to deal with this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1155,2022-10-09 12:13:01
12930," DHL is, to some extent, recession proof. I wouldn't go as far as to say recession proof, but I think we are very well positioned to deal with all different types of recessions in our scenarios due to the breadth of support for you. The balance of support for you really gives us a lot of resilience against any type of headwind. Coming up, a look at DP DHL's investments in action. Melanie Christ shows me around the company's state-of-the-art logistics hub. What I love about this building is it actually shows the big mega trends which formed our strategy 2025. This is Bloomberg. Markets are preparing to close, but the day is not over yet. Stock that is now up about 45%. A lot of volatility, right? You need the power of the Bloomberg terminal to get you market-moving data before anyone else. There's numbers much higher than they expect. Operated today to overweight. You need top analysts to bring you exclusive global insight into cross-asset markets. The mini-bond market. The tiny is a really big focus. This one ain't going as long today. It's going to be a short term. Bloomberg markets to close weekdays on Bloomberg. As the chief financial officer of one of the world's largest logistics companies, Melanie Christ has made her mark in global business. That's not what she originally attended to do. I really wanted to go into research. I wanted to become a physicist, and that was where my passion was. But then during my studies, some friends of mine started doing this strange thing. They went into management consulting. I didn't even know how to spell it. And I had no idea what it was about. But what they told me was quite interesting. And so I ended up doing an internship with a consulting firm. And I learned more in the two months there than I had in the last two years in my physics job at university. That is how I ended up in consulting. She started her career with three years at McKinsey, then spent four years in private equity with APAC's partners in London, before joining Deutsche Post DHL Group in 2004. I was brought into the company to do international M&A project. That was at the time around 20 years ago when we were really building the company in the current shape, acquiring lots of logistics companies around the world. The M&A part was the first thing. And I then wandered into a more mainstream finance field here in the group, becoming the CFO of our DHL Express Division. So from then on, it was more leading towards the CFO role eventually. Malenny Christ now heads the finance team with around 11,000 employees. Success in this role is as much an art as a science. If you do the greatest piece of analysis, and you see it all, and you know it all, but you can't convey that message, and you can't convince the rest of the organization that we should move into a certain direction, it's useless. DP DHL is sending a consistent message with its investments. The company spent 123 million euros to upgrade its logistic centre at the Clone Bon Airport, designing it around key strategic goals. What I love about this building is it actually shows the big mega trends which formed our strategy 2025, which was inaugurated in 2019 when this building opened. So globalisation connecting the world. E-commerce, we have a lot of sortation facilities here for smaller e-commerce shipments. Sustainability, it's a very sustainable building, there's solar panels on the roof and everything, and digitalisation, and well, you can obviously see that it is quite automated. How did the team pitch this investment to you initially, and how hard was it as a sell for them? How quickly did you turn around and say, yes, this is worth 123 million euros. Of course, you always have to make sure that you have the right capacity for the growth in the network. And at that time, they came and said, hey, we will really see a strong growth in e-commerce volumes on top of the regular B2B growth. We need more sorting capacity, we need this building. And of course, there are always debates, does it really have to cost 123 million euros and so on? Unfortunately, they convinced us because then with COVID and the volume search, we urgently needed the capacity. At the same time as COVID accelerated.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1156,2022-10-09 12:17:26
12931," and so on. Unfortunately, they convinced us because then with Covid and the volume search, we urgently needed the capacity. At the same time as Covid accelerated demand for logistic services, disruptions in the labour supply hurt productivity. Advances and technology, like this digital sauter, have helped offset some pressures, but automation also raises questions. Does this tell us that this is the business grows? This is going to become a more automated business that is going to be less need for labour for workers. Well, you still see people here and I think what you can nicely witness here is the combination of technology which supports people. So for example, when you look at the customs area, it used to be a very manual and sometimes confusing process. Now the people are supported in picking the right shipments for customs inspections by light and they are automatically sorted in this sauter to go to customs inspections. So it is also helping the people with the jobs they're doing every day. We overset in 2019-20. You know, we might get one-third less jobs in the current setup until 2030 if we digitalise the organisation, but we are very sure that our company will be at least 50, maybe 100% bigger and we will have more jobs to offer. At the beginning of a couple of years ago when we started that journey people said, oh, you know, I might lose my job. I haven't heard that in the last two years as a question any time hold. This airport hub also showcases DP DHL's aviation fleet which both small than 320 dedicated cargo aircraft. We own the biggest tank of our aircraft but we also have short and medium and long term leases and visit growth in our business. We anticipate that the people keep going. You've talked about investing of course in sustainable fuel. Yes. When does that come online? How significant is it? Is it just the critics might say that's just window dressing around a part of the business that is of course very carbon intensive, at least a lot of emissions? Yeah, so you absolutely write the problem with our beautiful aircraft is the CO2 emissions. And when you look at our overall CO2 emissions two-thirds are from aviation. It is about flying these birds with more sustainable fuel and we said that we are really willing to spend billions on it. We now really hope that we will see the uptick and supply over the next years. Spending billions isn't vague hyperbole. The company has pledged to put seven billion euros towards sustainable technologies and fuels by 2030 with a goal of climate neutral logistics by 2050. Sustainability makes good business sense anyway, especially if you are in a business that is energy or fuel hungry as a compliance element that not just operators in the logistics sector need to consider but also their customers. So being transparent becomes part of the service about their impact on the globe. We had a landfill discussion. Should we make a clear financial commitment how much we want to invest for the next decade in our sustainability? We had a long debate is it right to say we want to invest seven billion to 2030. There were pros and cons. But that was a very intense discussion melody in I-Hart where we finally came to the conclusion that this is a right number. This is a right approach. We convinced our colleague and that's the reason why we are where we are. We are seen as somebody who really commit. They are not that many companies who have quantified their future investment. Still ahead how one of the business world's most influential women is working to strengthen gender equality within her company. I think the great thing is that now across the board in finance but also in the group overall we have role models which show young female talent that everything is possible. This is Bloomberg.

12932," It's the first element on the periodic table. It is the most abandoned element in the universe. And when clean energy advocates think about what can we find, which would be as easy to use as fossil fuels, they think about hydrogen. The fuel that will, when burned, only produce water. We like to imagine that if we just built enough of these and these, we could ditch fossil fuels and save the planet. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. There are some things where you just need a good old-fashioned combustible fuel. Now, startups around the world are betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century.

Be ahead of the game. Deutsche Post DHL Group's CFO Melanie Christ is often named to lists of the most powerful women in business. And while men still outnumber women as finance heads of large companies, there are signs that the balance is shifting. The number of female CFOs across major US companies has risen to an all-time high, according to a study by Chris Calder Associates. And executive search firm Cohen Partners reports that 36% of new CFOs hired by notable companies in the first half of 2022 were women. I asked Melanie Christ if she's encountered obstacles as a woman rising through the executive ranks. I have to say, I have not made many negative experiences. Maybe I was also a little bit in the even-not-thinking about these challenges so much. So, I mean, when I studied physics, there weren't many women, so I was somehow always used to it. And it can also be an advantage when you're kind of like the only girl in the room. I mean, the boss at the end remembers your name and not the 19 guys who all kind of like were dark suits and white shirts and look alike. So, I never experienced it as an external stress factor. I have to say for me personally, it was more balancing my own expectations around kind of like getting family and the job combined. But that was probably more of a pressure I put on myself, thinking that I had to be perfect in every dimension and not something where the pressure was put on me from my male colleagues. So, how do you take that experience and put it to play in terms of how you advance the role of women in this organization? I think the great thing is that now across the board, in finance, but also in the group overall, we have role models which show young female talent that everything is possible. In finance, we have a share of women in management of 32%. So, we are ahead of the group. We want to get to 35% by 2025. I think we are now at a position where if you have a vacancy, I want to have at least one woman on the shortlist. Because we have enough female talent. So, every shortlist should contain a woman and then the best person in the race should win. CEO Frank Appell says Christ sets an example for the entire organization. And he believes her success may be...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1158,2022-10-09 12:25:47
12933," person in the race should win. CEO Frank Appell says Christ sets an example for the entire organization. And he believes her success may influence the entire industry. She has proven that she is an outstanding CEO for all. And she's definitely a role model in many dimensions that you know what I like about there. She is still you know a very warm and nice person. And that makes such a big difference. So you can get to that level without compromising on how nice you are as a person. I think she's a great role model. And I hope that this has had positive impact for many others. From the big picture down to the smallest operational details, Melanie Christ is fully engaged in guiding DP DHL into the future. I wanted to know what she sees when she looks ahead. What do you see as the biggest opportunities for DP DHL? Over the next 10 years. I think we have a fantastic portfolio. And we just have to leverage the growth opportunities which are there, both on the ECOM site and also on the traditional B2B site. And the key differentiators for us will be digitalisation, sustainability and our great people. As you look ahead 10 years, what are some of the challenges? What keeps you up at night as you think about the business going forward? I think we have to keep this focus and the ability to adjust in a very agile way. Sometimes when you kind of think about all the risk controlling and stuff, people tend to create the impression that you can preplan everything. That's clearly not the case. So I think we have to stay focused and keep the ability to react in a very agile way. But looking at what happened over the last 24 months, I'm very optimistic that we will also be able to cope with whatever happens next. And how do you see your role changing in the years ahead? I think it is changing at a very rapid pace, which is a great thing because it never gets boring. Those elements I just mentioned for the group, overall digitalisation and sustainability are also hugely relevant for the finance role. It's like a new language you have to learn. And you learn the vocabulary, and then you also have to develop a feeling if I kind of like put so much capital into this decarbonisation measure, I get so much in terms of return out of it. But that's a fascinating opportunity where we can make a huge difference for finance and for the group overall. As you look to the future, Melanie, what do you think is going to be the skill sets, the knowledge bases, they're going to be essential to the success of future CFOs? Yes, probably the two most essential new skills will be to get even better at lifelong learning, because we will have to learn so much new stuff every year. Be it in the digitalisation area, be it on sustainability. So this ability also has a 50-year plus-old person to keep learning and keep the curiosity. I think that is going to be super essential. And the second element will be being a great team player. The world is complex, you can't know it all, so you really have to work even more strongly with your team. What advice would you give to someone who's just recently been appointed CFO? That's a great question. I think I would probably simply say, be curious and ask as many questions as you can, try to learn as much as possible, not only in the finance area, but get close to the business, try to really understand the business, because only when you are close to the business and you understand the fundamental profit drivers, will you be a really great CFO. I'm Tom McKenzie. This is Bloomberg. I'm going to name a couple of your babies. I don't know if I'm asking you to choose amongst your children, but some of the most recognizable buildings by you, of course, the Millennium Bridge, London City Hall, the Reichstag, and the Great Court British Museum. What was your favourite project to do? The Reichstag does stand out, because, first of all, it's an energy manifesto. So it transforms something that was dependent on fossil fuels, it uses all the technology to produce something which is essentially carbon neutral and is a public building.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1159,2022-10-09 12:30:15
12934," Something that was dependent on fossil fuels, it uses all the technology to produce something which is essentially carbon neutral and there's a public building, that's a statement. It's a symbol of a city, it's a symbol of a nation, it incorporates works of art, it's recycling and existing building which as I mentioned earlier is the ultimate in sustainability if you can, if you can get a new life to a building. It also creates public space at the roof level, it's the most visited parliament in the world, so it puts the public above the politicians who are answerable to them and that of course was made possible by the politician. So it's a demonstration of democracy in action. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Buildings across America burn fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all-electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do a 100% clean energy, all-electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all-electric with no fossil fuels, we want to do that with our buildings and if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings and if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.

This week I'm meeting the space experts and physicist Professor Brian Cox and I'm really looking forward to asking him about how he gets his head around the vastness of space and to explain it to all of us or try to anyway. How he also goes about his daily life when he knows how insignificant we really are and what he makes of NASA's new telescope and those amazing images. Welcome to the programme. Thank you so much for coming to talk to me and to all of our viewers. I wanted to start with the new NASA telescope. It's named after the man who ran the agency in the 60s and oversaw the first man mission to the Moon. What do you make of what we're seeing so far? It's incredible. It's a remarkable instrument. You think of the predecessor which is the Hubble Space Telescope. It's almost impossible to imagine a world without that. Even if you don't know the images that we're familiar with at the universe, many of them, the spectacular galaxies in star-forming regions, they're from Hubble. The web is a significant step forward and technically one of the most important things is it can see what we call longer wavelength light or infrared light. That's important because if you think about we want to see the first galaxies forming. So we want to understand how the first stars and galaxies formed in the universe. What you do is you look far out into the universe and because light travels quite slow.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1160,2022-10-09 12:34:16
12935," So we want to understand how the first stars and galaxies formed in the universe. And so what you do is you look far out into the universe. And because light travels quite slowly across cosmic distances. Let's say you have a galaxy that's the most distant one you can see with the naked eye, is about two million light years away. So that means that the light has been traveling for two million years to reach us. And it's a remarkable thing actually to think when you look, it's called the Andromeda Galaxy. And if you know where you're looking, you can just catch you out of the corner of your eye. If you think about it, you're seeing that as it was two million years ago. Yes, although I don't. Because it takes a light two million years to travel. I don't like being late to information, so that makes me feel very out of date. Well, it's remarkable. I mean, it began its journey before we had evolved on Earth. So in the time it took, and that's the nearest neighbouring galaxy. The web looks so far out that it's capturing light that's been traveling for over 13 billion years. But the universe has been expanding. And so the light has been stretching. And so for the most distant galaxies, we're looking back in time, almost to the big bank. Then the Hubble was not sensitive to that light. So that the web can see the formation of the first galaxies. It's essentially looking all the way back to very close to the beginning of time. And that's very important. Because we're not entirely sure exactly how those first galaxies form. The idea of what you just talked about in terms of how much time this has taken and what it's covering. Do you think we will ever be able to see the big bank? Well, we almost can. It's not the web telescope. There's something called the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation, which is light that was emitted in the universe. And it's a very precise number. It's 380,000 years after the big bank. We should not very long at all. But the universe is 13.8 billion years old. So we can see that. It's microwaves because it's been stretched so much by the expansion of the universe. Going back that the problem with light is that in those earliest times, the universe was so hot and so dense that light couldn't travel through it. So it's opaque. So you can't use light to go back earlier than that. But what we can potentially do, not yet. We're not good enough yet. But the technology we use to now to detect colliding black holes, which is another remarkable thing. But I'll leave that one aside for now. But we have the technology to do that. And that technology possibly could allow us to probe right back to this thing, the big bank. And again, whether or not that's the origin of time, we can talk about as well. Brian, you've dedicated your life to explaining the scale of the universe to people. You have a new world tour and show called Horizons. What's the goal? Are you trying to teach people new things and understand the world they're living in better? Or what are you aiming for? Well, actually, all those things. So it works. I hope on different levels. So I talk about cosmology. We've spoken about what we call the large scale stretch of the universe. So the galaxies and how they formed, how the universe has evolved since the big bank. But also, I've got very interested in my academic work in black holes. And black holes, and they're really evocacy things. I think everyone's heard of these strange things, these totally collapsed stars, from which nothing apparently can escape. But in the past few years, past few decades really, beginning work that Stephen Hawking really began back in the 1970s and many others. And we've begun to suspect there's a lot more to them. And they've started forcing us to reassess our understanding of what space and time are. And that's a really weird sentence. You might think, well, space is the arena in which we live in time just ticks. But it really isn't. It looks like, from studying these things, there are building blocks of space and building blocks of time. And what I say in the show is, that's a mind-blowing idea. And I talk about that. But the key point is, is a great quote from Einstein, a beautiful story. The Einstein told about when he was a little boy, he was six or seven years old. And his dad gave him a compass. And so he looked at the compass and he said, well, there's this thing, this needle, and it always points north, points in this direction. So there's some kind of invisible that I can't see that underlies our reality that's making this needle point north.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1161,2022-10-09 12:39:11
12936," points north, points in this direction. So there's something invisible that I can't see that underlives our reality that's making this needle point north. And he said later in life, it was my first encounter with an idea, which is if you look at nature carefully and really pay attention and you're lucky, you can catch your glimps of something deeply hidden. Which is a beautiful phrase, something deeply hidden, which is the deep structure of reality. That's what our reality is. And so black holes, they're kind of a metaphor in a way. I talk about them as resetsis stones in the sky. They're the things that by studying them, and you say, why would we study these things? Well, in studying these things, we're beginning to get a deep, a deep picture of what our reality actually is. That's a remarkable idea. But it's a beautiful idea that runs through all of science. How do you define a black hole? Well, it's in Einstein's theory, which again is a remarkable thing. It's published in 1915 over 100 years old. But it's just a region of space from which even light can't escape. We have to get interest rates higher and bring inflation back to our target. 23 million people have been affected by this flooding and pollution. Disruption is the whole point of a strike. Remember your global business authority. Microsoft, such a nadella, IBM's, Arvin, Krishna, Micron, technology, Sanjay, Mayhotra, and that's just the start. So many Indians risen to the top. No coastal points to an indias incredibly competitive education system. If you can survive the pressure it takes to get into one of the Indian Institutes of Technology, it gives you confidence to handle American universities and later the business world. Meanwhile, the belief in India's ability to produce so many tech wizards is reinforced every year. Indians make up about three-fourths of the immigrants receiving coveted H1B visas for the U.S. And it's a safe bet that some of them will eventually find their way to the sea suite. And by understanding what they are and knowing more about them, what do we then learn? Well, Stephen Hawking, back in the 70s, published a paper. The initial one was called Black Hole Explosions, which is a great title for a paper. And he calculated, he found out that Black holes in his language, he said, Black holes ain't so black. They glow in the sky, like holes in the sky, and they radiate. And so over time, they lose energy and mass and ultimately disappear of a huge time scale holes. And that's so important. I show this picture in the show that if you go into Westminster Abbey and look on the floor of Westminster Abbey on Stephen's memorial stone, then you find his equation for the temperature of a Black hole literally chiseled in stone on the floor of an Abbey. So you might say, why? Why is it so important? This was the key. This was this Rosetta Stone idea. In trying to understand what happens. What happens to the stuff that fell in? When you thought these things existed forever, which is pre-hawking.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1162,2022-10-09 12:43:05
12937," understand what happens, what happens to the stuff that fell in. When you thought these things existed forever, which is pre-hawking, then you think, well, it's okay, it gets locked up inside, it can never get out, we don't care. But the thing evaporates away, one day it will be gone. So then suddenly you have to be faced with this question, what happened to everything then? If I throw a book into a black hole, is it somehow possible in the far future if you collect all this so-called hawking radiation that comes off? Is it possible to reconstruct the information in the book? And that's been a question, simple question that's driven this tremendous amount of research for 50 years, and it was pretty much sold in 2019 actually in 2020, pretty much, I mean, there's still a huge number of questions, but roughly, well, the statement is everything comes out again, all the information comes out. So everything that fell in, in principle, in the far future, you could reconstruct the information of everything that fell in. It's just an astonishing idea, because actually the last thing I'll say is that before that, before the hawking papers and before this modern understanding, inside a black hole, just according to Einstein, sits the end of time, which is an astonishing thing to say, because we can see them. We have a photograph of one of these things in the center of a galaxy, too, actually. And when you look at that photograph, you're looking at the end of time in space. So then you think, well, if things go to the end of time, how does everything get out again? And that's the content of this tremendous work in theoretical physics. This work, studying black holes, which is probably, it's one of those things that a certain kind of person says is useless, right? He said, why? Who cares? It turns out that the techniques that have been developed and the understanding that's being gained from looking at these things, has got a very strong crossover with building quantum computers, right? Which is, the quantum computers are in laboratories now. They have a tremendous potential to revolutionize our civilization, incredibly powerful computer devices. Yes, and also that's sometimes the defense given, isn't it, about what's going into man going back to the moon, or woman going back to the moon? Are there other things I discovered in the pursuit of those missions? Yeah, I mean, it's always a cliche, but it's true. A friend of mine, an astronomer always says, when people criticize these spacecraft and they say, you know, let's say the James Webb Space Telescope, it was what, $6 billion or so. But it's, appropriate points out that nobody put $6 billion in a suitcase and launched it on the rocket. The $6 billion didn't go into space. It was spent on Earth. And what is often the case, it put inside the glory and wonder of the discoveries that are made, basically you were paying people to do high tech jobs and do research and build machines that operate at the edge of the possible. And history tells us that that tends to be extremely useful. You're inventing things and trying to do things that are difficult. And that expertise never stays in one place. It then spreads out across our civilization in ways that you can't really predict or even quantify. Indeed. And you did sound very excited early. I mean, you sound excited the whole time about all of this, which is infectious, even if people are trying to keep up including myself. But when you talk about the golden possibility of there being a life out there, and that question of, are we alone? Where are you with that? What do you say to people right now with the latest information? Well, so again, I think there's a cosmology, I say this in the show as well. It's one of the most challenging subjects because at one level it makes us feel very, very small and insignificant. And it's true, physically. I mean, the Earth is one planet around one star amongst 400 billion stars in one galaxy amongst two trillion galaxies in the part of the universe we can see. So we're definitely small, right? Is he can't argue that? Yes, he clarified. But. But, but. You're right. If you ask the question about life, the answer is we don't know. We found nothing, but nothing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1163,2022-10-09 12:47:49
12938," You can't argue that. Yes, you clarified. But, but, but, you're right, if you ask the question about life, the answer is we don't know, we found nothing, nothing alive beyond the earth. But I've missed it that we haven't been very far or looked tremendously hard, although we are looking hard now on Mars, because we suspect there might have been microbes on Mars, because there was one's water on Mars and it was geologically active, and all the things that we think led to the origin of life on Earth were present on Mars around the same time, about three and a half to four billion years ago. So we wouldn't be surprised if we find that microbes existed, probably subsurface on Mars, or maybe on some of the moons of Jupiter or Saturn, where there's water today. However, nobody expects anything more complicated than a microbe. And it's interesting, so if you look at the history of life on Earth, you have microbes around 3.8 billion years ago, pretty much not long after the Earth formed in geological time. But if you look for evidence of complex life on Earth, then really there isn't any in the fossil record until about 600 million years ago or so. So on this planet, for most of the history of the planet, there was slime, basically, single-celled things, doing interesting stuff, photosynthesis and things, but nothing more complicated than a single cell. And it's only in the last half of billion years or so that you get this explosion of life on Earth. And only, as I said, it's only in the last, less than a million years that we've had home-o sapiens on Earth, and in the last few tens of thousands of years we've had a civilization. So here, it took pretty much 4 billion years to go from cell to civilization. And that's the third of the age of the universe. And so that leads many biologists that I speak to to suggest that whilst microbes might be common, civilizations might be rare. Actually, I asked a friend of mine at Great Physician Carol, how many civilizations do you think there will be in the Milky Way galaxy, a typical galaxy? How many in a typical galaxy? And he said, none. Right, none. And I think he's, I tend to say one. So somewhere between zero and one, probably. But that's a guess. But what do you, do you want me to be? I think it's a good guess. Brian, is that what it is? You sound like perhaps you have an optimism for it, and I wonder what's underpinning that? I would love that to be. And actually, because he worries me, and this is the way that I end my show, actually. It worries me that let's take that position. Let's imagine that in our galaxy, 400 billion suns, there's just us that thinks. Right, the microbes are all over the place. But in terms of things that think and can feel. And in a very real sense, bring meaning to the universe. All these things we've talked about, and beauty of these galaxies, they're not beautiful if there's nothing there to perceive them, right? They're just galaxies. So if that's it in this galaxy, then the decisions that we make now as a civilization, have a galactic implications. Right, we destroy ourselves, for example, deliberately or through inaction. Then it's possible that we eliminate meaning, perhaps forever, in a galaxy of 400 billion stars. And so that's it. I think that leads you to, it's a good work in assumption that we have a tremendous responsibility, in a sense, not to do that. So I would be much more comfortable with our current predicament, if the galaxy was filled with civilizations, then I'd say, well, okay, it would be rather stupid of us to eliminate all this beautiful culture and science and art and music that we build up. But at least there's someone else that's doing that. But I'm not actually sure there is. Bloomberg has enhanced search on the terminal to deliver what you need when you need it.

When you think of cutting edge technology at sea, you might be thinking of stuff like this. But there's an incoming revolution on the high seas that isn't quite as sexy but could be significantly more impactful. Containershiping is the key component of global trade. About 80% and 90% of all the world's goods are transported at some point. But there's a significant unseen cost to the modern era of global commerce. About 3% of all the world's is your true mission from shipping. 3% may not sound like a lot but that's roughly comparable to the entire CO2 output of Germany. Since reducing trade isn't a likely option, what about a technological improvement to help reduce the emissions from these well-stocked maritime behemoths? How comfortable are you with space tourism and the pursuit of that knowledge and meaning being left largely to a very small group of rich men? You're right. The idea that technology is used, if all it was useful, it was to send a few very rich people into space on a joyride, then there will be real criticism there. But that's not all the technology is used for. So I think it's important to understand that the space industry is about operating initially in near-earth orbits. And we've already industrialized that. We all use it every day. We all switch on our sat nav in the car, satellite navigation. It requires infrastructure in orbit. A lot of the stuff we know about climate change, resource use and so on, that's coming from satellites. So I think you have to look at the space industry as a whole, really, and then say, well, it's not just about... The same argument was made for intercontinental travel by aircraft. When the first aircraft was built, it was extremely expensive and the preserve of the rich. But of course, within a few decades, it had democratized travel. And we all take advantage of that every day. So I think that's the right way to look at space. It's not to focus on particular bits of it that we might not like for moral reasons or whatever it is. So it's actually... I really do advocate for the facts of looking at the whole industry, which is tremendously important now. It is. I mean, I am interested though, that you did say, and correct me if I'm wrong, that all political leaders should go to space, perhaps for some perspective. Do you still think that? Most of them should come back. Most of them. That's the last part of that quote. That was based on an idea, which is a very famous idea called the overview effect, which is well known. The astronauts change their view of the... Always, as far as I'm aware, when they come back, they have a more positive view of the value of this planet. And a very much more focused on preserving it as a beautiful place, perhaps a unique place in a galaxy, as I said. So I felt that... And I do feel that having had the good fortune of speaking to many astronauts, that that experience, for the people who make the decisions, the big decisions of our future, could have that experience, I think, would be a good investment. It's extremely hard arguments to make, that we should actually spend money allowing, in our case at the moment, our Prime Minister, right? So in the UK, you'd say, well, we should spend money sending Boris Johnson into space and bringing him back safely to Earth again, because it would change his view. No, I don't think I win that argument. But I think it is...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1165,2022-10-09 12:56:01
12940," Johnson into space and bringing him back safely to Earth again because he would change his view. No, I don't think I win that argument. No. But I think there's a serious point there which is that it does seem to change people for the better when they see our Earth as it really is, which is a fragile thing against the Blackness of Space. So I think it's an argument that I would try to make. I would lose it because it's very expensive. Do you want to go? Are you willing to go? I would love to because as I said, I'd love to share that experience of seeing our world from space. I think it's really unarguably. It appears to be a life-changing experience and it seems to change individuals for the better. You won't be scared. Well, I don't know. I mean, I remember one of my great heroes, John Young, who flew on the Apollo missions, walked on the moon testfully the first space shuttle. And he said that anyone who sits on top of however many thousands of tons of liquid hydrogen, helium, liquid hydrogen oxygen and isn't a bit worried, doesn't understand the problem. But it's probably right. Do you have people come and talk to you about faith? Do they talk to you about how religion and that side of life fits into your level of knowledge because I know you've traveled around the world talking to people? Yeah, a lot. It comes up as a question because cosmology is the science of origins. And actually, with the study of black holes, I mentioned, we're even beginning now to think about what's face and time are. So naturally, I say in the show, actually, I say when we talk about this, it's the moment of creation. So we're asking, was there a moment of creation? And that's the correct language to use, I think. Or it's the evocative language, but it's really what we're talking about. Did everything come into being or has it always been here? We actually don't even know the answer to that question really. So yeah, I can ask you a lot because I think cosmology is a challenging science that challenges us to think about these things. We associate that with theology or philosophy. And I think that's a good thing because something I very strongly believe in is that segmenting or making little canisters and putting different bits of human experience or different music and art and theology and philosophy and science and segmenting them all is just the wrong way to look at it. But what we're doing is a deep level trying to understand what it means to be human in this tremendous, potentially infinite universe. And so I, those questions get asked. And ultimately, I say, I'm quite straightforward. I say, I don't. I'm not a religious person myself. But the correct thing to say, even about the question, did the universe have a beginning in time is we don't know. We don't know. And that's it.

For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s and so it makes it a really exciting field because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harness to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart.

As Fall sets in, a decided turn in the air where the new British government's designs for the economy were Elon Musk's designs on Twitter and most decidedly for Mr. Putin's designs on Ukraine. This is Bloomberg Wall Street Week. I'm David West. This week's Special Contributor Larry Summers on whether the jobs market is starting to show some signs of loosening. I think we are headed for a collision of some kind or other and we've just got to manage that collision carefully. And Brad DeLong of Berkeley on what the broad sweep of economic history may be telling us about where we are headed next. People say that the United States has very little to teach them that we don't have any greater grasp on how to deploy and use these technologies to create a good society. We had our fair share of about faces this week with the Bank of England's quick intervention to save the guilt market as explained by former MPC member Kristen Forbes of MIT. It's a very important thing to do. Because of the big market moves, there could be some margin calls, some pressures for force selling that could cause the guilt market to freeze up. And British Prime Minister Liz Truss giving up at least part of her economic program. It was becoming a distraction. That's why we immediately changed that policy and that's the kind of government we are. But as ugly as the situation was in the UK markets, it was nothing compared with the setbacks for Russian forces in eastern and southern Ukraine, with President Putin's efforts to quote Annex territory that his forces didn't even control. Which Admiral John Kirby at the NSC looks at as an indication that Mr. Putin just may be coming to understand how difficult his situation really is. The Annexation Announcements as well as his announcement of partial mobilization certainly shows the degree to which Mr. Putin knows how much he's struggling inside Ukraine.

And OPEC plus weighed in with its own changes, cutting production caps by two million barrels a day or about seven percent, putting even more pressure on Europe and the rest of the world already worried about energy. While we were disappointed that OPEC made this decision, as the president mentioned, we think it's unnecessary if you look at the global environment where supply continues to be the predominant challenge. Then there's Elon Musk. He offered $44 billion for Twitter back in April, then decided to renegade, got sued, and on the eve of his deposition, returned to his original offer. Even it looks like he's going to be way overpaying. In many ways, this is almost the most expected outcome of all, which is settling on the eve of trial just before the deposition of the main players, Elon Musk himself. He doesn't want to be deposed. He has probably some embarrassing text messages and conflicting statements, and all of that would make for a very unpleasant decision. But after all the back and forth this week, US jobs numbers actually came in surprisingly on course, adding 263,000 new jobs just slightly more than expected with workers paid 5% more than they were last year. And a reduction in the unemployment rate to 3.5%, which made for a rough day in equities on Friday, but actually a pretty good week overall for equities, for the S&P 500 adding 1.5% to end the week at 3639, and the NASDAQ eaked out a gain of 3.4%. Elon's also had a topsy-turvy week, but ended up with the 10-year yield of a relatively modest five basis points to 3.88. Here to walk us through this week, and what got us here are Aaron Brown, portfolio manager at PIMCO, and Chris Ellman, chief investment officer at CalSTRS. So Chris, let me start with you. Boy, given what we're seeing right now, are we looking at a long-cold winner, would you say? Unfortunately, David, I think we are. I think the Fed, you know, with these employment numbers, the Fed knows that they have to continue this pace of aggressive tightening, and they're gonna do so the next meeting and the next meeting after that. And I think, which is the street is pricing in, but I think after that, they're gonna have to keep it up, and that's gonna be into the winter, and it's gonna be a tough time. So what do you say, Aaron? Is it gonna be a rough winter? I think it is gonna be a rough winter. I think that there are bands of uncertainty are quite wide for next year. The Fed is tightening into an economic slowdown, and we haven't even seen the real impact of that slowdown yet. We're just starting to see signs of a gradual slowing, but likely we'll continue to see that into next year, and we think that we're heading into a recession into early 2023. And at that same point, just given the level of inflation, the Federal Reserve is now really challenged to be able to arrest that inflation, get it under control, despite what happens to the economy. So I think that really poses a challenge for the Fed, and we'll likely see something that's fairly unprecedented, which is continued financial conditions tightening, and Fed tightening into an economic slowdown, even if it really leads to a harder landing than what the Fed's anticipating. And Aaron, I push back a little bit. I actually think we're in a recession right now. It's not a very strong one, and it doesn't hurt a lot. I was so with employment growing, but we did have a negative GDP in the second quarter, third quarter is mild. To me, anything below 1% in the USA feels like a recession. But so what you're saying is, you think it's gonna be a really, we'll actually have a good traditional hard, negative recession with rising unemployment, which is exactly what Powell has said. I mean, that's his forecast. Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, my, our view at PIMCO is that we'll likely see unemployment rise to about 5% by the end of 2023. And so right now, we're sort of seeing some of those early signs, but we really haven't seen the full brunt of financial condition tightening yet. That's more to come. So we are going to continue to see a slowdown, and I think that's really gonna hit in the first quarter of next year and into the second quarter of 2023. Chris, given where we're at with inflation right now, the concerns about inflation, if we are heading an intersection or even are already in one, no matter how long it is or how short it is, what are the tools the Fed has to use? Because typically you turn to the Fed and say, okay, start cutting interest rates. That's more so.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1168,2022-10-09 13:09:42
12943," in an intersection or even are already in one, no matter how long it is or how short it is, what are the tools the Fed has to use? Because typically you turn to the Fed and say, okay, start cutting interest rates. Doesn't look like they're gonna do that in a likelihood. No, they're gonna raise interest rates. They only have one tool. They have, well, they have their mouth. They can job on the market, which is what they're doing. They have the dot plot, which is going to indicate or direct the market. But really, the only tool they have is short term interest rates in the Fed funds rate. And that's what they're using aggressively. I mean, good grief. 75 basis points. Those are big bounces. You know through history, you've got to go way back before you have that aggressive tightening of monetary policy. And they have to shrink the balance sheet. So as they move through that, you know, he's already said, he's gonna hurt employment. Yet we have stronger numbers. I think the numbers are something strange in the numbers this week, just like last month. But we'll see how that balances out. We're gonna have a tougher time. And, you know, I think the question's gonna be about corporate earnings. You got CPI next week, and then you got the bank starting to roll out with their earnings. Aaron, has the market priced in the diminishment of earnings at this point, corporate earnings? No, I don't think that they have. What you've seen since the beginning of the year is equities have de-graded, largely driven by the market multiple. So you've seen the market multiple for the S&P 500, de-rate from about 21 and a half times to about 16 times today. Keep in mind that traditionally in recessions, the market multiple is somewhere between 14 and 16 times. So we're just at the upper end of where we typically are in recessions. And we think that you could see a little bit more de-rating from there. That's not really the challenge for the market. The challenge for the market is that when you look at corporate earnings for next year, the market's pricing them to be up 7.5% for consensus. Our forward-looking models are expecting them to be down about 9%. So that's north of a 15% differential versus what the market's pricing for next year and what we think it's likely to be. Also, historically, during recessions, earnings fall about 27% on average. So there's real downside risks to our forecast and certainly to the market's forecast. And I think that's where you're going to see the real pressure point for the market in early next year. What's driving that is margins. We're at record high margins right now. The street is expecting that margins are going to expand further from here. So even higher than and hit new record highs, we've never seen that in a recession before. So I think the market's really mispriced and that's where the pain's going to come from. Aaron, I've got to ask you if we're already down 23% so far this year, how much lower do you think we can go? Do you see a support level on the S&P? I think that in a moderate recession, the market probably bottoms out about 30 to 50. There is downside risk if we see further a more severe or harder landing from there. But 30 to 50 is still down about 14%, 15%. So I do think that there's still room for the market to fall further. Where are you looking present in terms of your estimates? Yeah, no, I agree 32, 50. But I mean, that's a negative 36 on the year, which is you're like me. We have asset allocation portfolios. Where do you hide in that kind of a negative market? You've got bonds with the rates rising. So you're going to have continued negative returns out of bonds and then a negative 30 out of stocks. That's a rough calendar year. Where do you hide? Well, I think that I think there have been actually market opportunities that have arisen since the start of this year. Cash rate right now, two-year bonds are yielding north of 4%. Now that's not a sexy return by any sort of stretch of the imagination. But if you can lock in 4%, add a little bit of spread on top of that, an IG corporates that give you an additional 2% or so. That's about a 6% return over the next couple of years. That's high quality paper that you can invest in. So I wouldn't rule cash out as an option. I think that that's somewhere where you can hide and really not expect that much volatility and really consistent returns and hide out there until we see the markets bottom. And you can start incrementally moving back into risk. But we can't die.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1169,2022-10-09 13:14:00
12944," and really consistent returns and sort of hide out there until we see the markets bottom and you can start incrementally moving back into risk. But we can't I think you need to keep in mind as an investor that if the core of your allocation of your portfolio which is sort of cash and poor fixed income is unstable then you really can invest in the outer ring asset. So you know we really have to stabilize rates in order to move out the risk curve into other asset classes right now cash is a pretty good option. Okay we're gonna pick up exactly that question where do you hide in this environment when Chris Aylman and Aaron Brown will be staying with us we're gonna ask for them for some investment advice we could use it that's for sure that's next on Wall Street Week here on Bloomberg move So what's the best investment advice you've ever been given by anybody? The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day and if you keep at it and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle and it's not just interest. It was always said above compound interest returns, compound business returns, compound human returns. They're all very additive because you'll learn every day and if you keep at it, it's very, very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make? Selling it the wrong time and they sell when the prices go down or not keeping. But people have conviction or the investors, if they invest for the right reasons, just keep at it. The facts on unemployment seem clear enough or at least as clear as that changing social definition ever can be, the situation is getting a little better but not much. The government announced today that the overall unemployment rate last month was 6.9%. The official unemployment rate has been stuck within a tenth of 7% for six months and that scarcely represents the massive reduction of unemployment that at least some folks thought they heard Jimmy Carter promise a year ago. That was Louis Royce-Huyes on Wall Street Week back in October of 1977 when the unemployment rate was twice what it is today and we were trying to get it down rather than focusing on inflation whatever that ends up meaning for employment. And if that seems like a galaxy far, far away, well maybe that's no accident. The top movie this week back in 1977 was Star Wars and the top song on the charts was you got it, the Star Wars theme. Still with us are Aaron Brown and Pymco and Chris ailment of Calcester. So Aaron let me turn to you and pick up on where we were talking just now with Chris but where you hide if you're really an asset allocator you said cash is one alternative. Are there things though that involve at least some risk that you go to and how much it depends on what you think the recovery is going to look like whenever it comes. So I'm going to flip that sort of question and answer the second question first which is unlike prior recessions that we see in very recent history so think of the global financial crisis or even the pandemic of 2020. I don't think this is going to be a V-shaped recovery. I think this is going to be a V-shaped recovery. I don't know if you're going to get a V-shaped recovery.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1170,2022-10-09 13:17:48
12945," of 2020. I don't think this is going to be a V-shaped recovery. I think this is going to be more of a prolonged, sort of, stalling of the economy and more of an L-shaped recovery than what we've seen in the past. And the reason for that is because inflation is high and it's likely to persist at high levels, you're not going to come in and see the fed start cutting, you know, as the unemployment rises, like we've seen in the past, instead because the fed is, you know, moved from a dual-mandate fed to a single-mandate fed, really just focus on getting the inflation rate down, you'll likely see, you won't see this sort of immediate relief that we've seen in recent history. And so that does change a little bit the landscape of how you think about investing, you know, historically, as we start to get closer to what we expect the bottom level of the S&P 500 to be, we start to, you know, scale risk back up, start to move back into equity investments to catch that recovery to the upside. And this time around, I think you have to be a little bit more patient. So instead, what we're really looking at is fixing come investments that we think are going to be able to sort of stand at the test of time, be able to sort of hide out in a safe haven assets. So beyond just looking at cash, we're looking at high quality investment-grade corporates, we're looking at municipalities, municipal bonds, you know, particularly for those who are, can take advantage of the tax advantages, tax-advantaged bonds, we think offer good value there at a sort of after-tax yield of 6.5%. You know, in addition, we also like some mortgage agency bonds and structured credit bonds as well. And then sort of high quality equities that are defensive equities, high free cash flow, dividend growth, strong balance sheets. We also think do do well in this environment, but, you know, it is a sort of challenging time for investors where you have to see more towards fixed income in order to have stability of return as opposed to looking for a quick snapback inequities. But, you know, I posed a question to Chris because I know he also manages a diversified portfolio. Chris, where are you looking at what type of sort of diversification that are you looking at in order to sort of hide out over the next couple of quarters? Well, Aaron, you know, I've got the benefit of being able to go into private security. So, I've got a good size real estate portfolio. We have a large private equity portfolio. Sure, it's going to have write downs, but its value is a bit more stable than we see in the public markets. We have a cash position, but the problem is for us, cash is not outperforming inflation. So, the old adage cash is trash is still true. We do like a private credit. You were kind of hitting on that that, you know, variable rate debt, short term debt with high quality. And I think collateral is going to be key because, as you said, we're going to have a long rough winter. So, you don't want to be loaning money to everybody. You have to do care about governance. But it is tough in this environment. I mean, you know, if the economy is slowing and inflation is still strong, that's stagflation. And you look back in the 70s. I got to say, I love that suit that Lou had. I don't know where you get that back in the 70s, but I'm stunned by it. But, you know, you look back in that time period. Returns in the 77 were terrible. We're hard places to, it was just a very tough time to hide anywhere. Yeah, so I'm curious though, exactly, about when you go into fixed income. Do you think the price is attractive now in some fixed income? Chris? Well, I agree with Aaron. I'm going to go short. I'm not going to go long fixed income and take duration exposure, short term credits. I mean, you've been holding credit for two to three years. And then it's money good. And as she said, you're going to put it in a spread product. So, you pick up a couple of basis points by being in a corporate, you're okay. There's still a lot of money, David, international money that wants to come into this market, non-US rather, that wants to come into the market. You saw it in this week where suddenly comes rushing in. So, I would give the advice to the average investors. You've got a slowly average cost in. You're not going to be able to call the bottom. As much as Aaron, I think there's a support number, it may not hit that at all. And the market's going to just bounce along. And Aaron's example of an L, an L goes on forever. It's just flat. I hope we don't have to live in a...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1171,2022-10-09 13:22:38
12946," I hit that at all and the market's going to just bounce along. And in Aaron's example of an L, an L goes on forever. It's just flat. I hope we don't have to live in a flat recession for years and years. But I think this is going to be a tough market to find any kind of growth opportunities. So you want to protection and a return of your money rather than return on your money. Aaron, one of the big developments this week was OPEC Plus and what they did. It certainly seemed to stun the whiteheads at the time. What does that tell us about geopolitical risk generally and specifically energy? And it looks like oil prices are going to stay up there for a while. I think that's one of the things that the market's really miss pricing. Right now, if you look at the forward curve for oil, the risk is really in this very short term where the market expects that oil is going to be elevated for the short term. But it really hasn't extrapolated or extended that expectation out the next one to two years. And I think that there's a real value in sort of the back end of the curve for oil because I think that these oil challenges are going to persist much longer than what the market's anticipating. One of the reasons for that is, first we saw out of oil, OPEC Plus this week, their intention to keep prices elevated. But I think the other challenges is that we really haven't invested here in the U.S. or on a global basis on energy infrastructure. So that capacity is really constrained over the next couple of years. Even if we wanted to expand capacity or if oil producers wanted to expand capacity, they don't have the ability to do so in the immediate term. And that's going to keep oil prices elevated. So the risk for oil, then the risk for the energy complex broadly, isn't just this winter, but it's next winter as well. And next winter's challenges are going to be even more difficult, particularly on the shores of Europe, than what we're experiencing this winter. And so that's what I think the challenge is and why I think this is something that's going to persist much longer than what the market's currently priced in. And David, it's running into the challenge of climate change. You know, I'm looking at decades, not a short-term trade in carbon. And I'm glad that we're having a constraint on the ability to expand hydrocarbons and burning carbon. But you're right, people want heat and Europe heats itself. Whether we like it or not, it doesn't heat itself a solar and wind. It's got to do it through fossil fuels. And that's matching and running into it as I had to reduce these fossil fuels. And I agree with Aaron, I'm hearing the same thing that Europe has enough oil and natural gas for this year in their supplies. But if it's a really cold winter, they're very worried about next year. So you're going to have climate change crashing into this challenge of of OPEC and inflation and energy prices certainly over the next couple of years. Europe has a lot of challenges, Aaron, right now. Not just energy, it goes beyond that. Does that make the U.S. relative the most attractive place to be for you? I don't know if it's the most attractive place, but it's one of the more attractive places, particularly Vs of E Europe. And the challenge that Europe has is that they're starting from a lower productivity, you know, a lower and weaker growth rate to start out. They also didn't, you know, sort of fully recover in the same way that the U.S. did post-COVID. And they're now have wider fiscal deficits. They're going to have to spend more money in order to insulate their economy from a harder hit because of energy. And that's going to create real challenges at the same time where the economy is rapidly slowing. And so our view is that while the U.S. is going into recession, the recession in Europe is going to hit harder and is likely to be more prolonged. Thank you so much to Aaron Brown and Chris Aelman. When we come back, we're going to take a look at what's happening next week on Global Wall Street. And this is Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1172,2022-10-09 13:26:47

Great question. You will put a woman on Mars. You will bring forth global cooling. You will be the first chief crypto officer. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge, and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer disrupt, before you change the world, Bloomberg. From the world of politics to the world of business, balance of power with David Weston, views and analysis inside, from and about politics power players. Weekdays, this is Bloomberg. This is Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. It's time to take a look ahead. China stocks reopening is the big story in Asia this week. Exchanges on the mainland have been shut for the past five straight sessions that's to mark the golden week holiday. So we could see a pop at the open given the moves that we saw in Chinese assets in offshore markets. And that would be of course welcome news for officials in Beijing. Because President Xi Jinping is just days away from securing a third term as Communist Party leader. That's at the 20th party Congress starting October 16th. Otherwise, travel restrictions or the easing of those is the major theme as well. Japan will further loosen controls from Tuesday and Taiwan from Thursday. For Europe next week, there's a big risk lingering in the markets. And that's the end of the B.O.E. short term program to backstop bond markets. They of course announce that they would be purchasing long-dated bonds after concerns that a huge spike up in yields in the long end of the curve meant that there would be danger for pension funds. So the B.O.E. has been doing this buying program. It's set to end on Friday, on October 14th. There could be jitters in this market. What it means to no longer have a B.O.E. backstopping a political story really of the UK government, which has been doing various U-turns. So all of that will be in focus this week. All eyes next week will be on the latest batches of US inflation data. Produced surprises will be released on Wednesday with the headline figure projected to have fallen year over year for a third straight month. Meanwhile, the Consumer Price Index released on Thursday is once again expected to show conflicting signals with the deceleration in the headline number from a year ago. But the core measure of CPI, which strips out food and energy, is forecast to re-accelerate its pace of growth rather than fall. Investors also will parse the release of the minutes from the Fed September meeting and whether there was any serious discussion about slowing or even halting the tightening of monetary policy. And earning season is finally here. The latest round of quarterly reports kicks off with Pepsi, JP Morgan, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Delta Airlines, and United Health among the Notables. David?

I'm David Weston. Every week we turn to Larry Somersaharbert, our very special contributor here on Wall Street Week, to help us sum up the major events of the weekend. Once again, we welcome back Larry Somersahar. So Larry, I think we should start with the jobs numbers out on Friday in the United States. I mean, some say not too hot, not too cold. Some people say, isn't this good? At least it's not getting worse. I guess my real question to you is, I mean, I can be getting worse. But is there a danger just in the inflation where many where it is? We have 5% year-over-year increase in wages. I think these numbers were about what we expected. And the sensible judgment was that we've got an inflation problem. Core inflation figures look artificially good. They're better than median inflation. And yet core inflation ran at a 7% rate last month. And that was more than for the quarter. And the quarter was more than for the half year. And the half year was more than for the whole year. So we're not in a controlled place with respect to inflation. And there wasn't really anything in this report to suggest that we were coming into a controlled place. The monthly wage number was relatively favorable. But it was pretty clearly distorted by the fact that you had a lot more workers coming in and leisure and hospitality. And those are low-wage workers. The workers where wages are most flexible are going up more rapidly. So I don't think this is a number that changed the picture that we've got an economy that is too strong to be an economy where inflation is going down. But that is maintaining its robustness. But I think we are headed for a collision of some kind or other. And we've just got to manage that collision carefully. And I think the sooner we start managing for a slope, managing for some slowdown, the better we're going to do. I think German Powell was way late to come to that recognition. But he now has that recognition. And he should be supported in that. So what do you think, Chair Powell, and the Federal Reserve will make of these numbers? How will it affect what they do in early November? I don't think these numbers are going to change.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1174,2022-10-09 13:35:34
12949," So what do you think, Chair Powell, and the Federal Reserve will make of these numbers? How will it affect what they do in early November? I don't think these numbers are going to change what the Fed does. You know, you never know what's going to happen, and certainly there's risk of some kind of financially traumatic event, but I think the chances of something that is large enough to divert the Fed are really quite low. So I'd be expecting that the market, which is anticipating 75 basis points in November and is anticipating 50 more in December, that would correspond to my best guess at this moment as well. And I think that kind of thing is going to be appropriate if we achieve disinflation. Larry, there's another strain of discussion. I've seen certainly this week, in fact, there was even some Fed staff work at the New York Fed suggesting that we better be careful because in fact, the rate that we may need, you already get down to 2%, maybe so high, it will cause financial instability. There is a really safety and soundness issue. What do you make of that? Is it possible the Fed will have to choose between financial stability in the one hand and getting inflation down on the other? First, I think that should be the occasion for some sole searching. If we have an economy where we think there's going to be substantial financial breakage, because the Fed lifts the Fed funds rate to 4.5%, then we have an inadequately supervised financial system and an insufficiently active financial regulator. And so if anyone believes that, along with whatever monetary policy implication they draw, they'd better tell us how we think, how they think we ought to be repairing the regulation of the financial system. David, my sense is that you can never rule out these kinds of risks. But the Fed has more than one instrument. It has instruments for specific guarantee lending. We've seen that used a number of times. And each time we're surprised by how much the economy retains its robustness. In retrospect, we cut interest rates too much and kept them too low when we were supporting the financial system after COVID. In retrospect, we kept interest rates too low and blew up a bubble when we were supporting the economy with low interest rates after Asia and LTCM. In retrospect, we were surprised, amazed by how rapidly the economy grew when the Fed was what was necessary after the 1987 stock market crash. So we need to regulate right to preserve financial stability. We need to have a very strong firefighting force in order to respond if and when financial accidents happen. But I think it's a real mistake to suggest that somehow we shouldn't do the monetary policies that are necessary to avoid inflation becoming entrenched because of concerns about financial stability. You know, David, the people who are still on team transitory, they're always saying that expectations aren't entrenched. The more it's true that expectations are not yet entrenched, despite high inflation, seems to me the more important it is to move vigorously now with respect to inflation so they don't become entrenched. If they were already entrenched, we could discuss the right timing of a disinflation. And if we have the big advantage in disinflation of expectations that are not yet entrenched, we should be acting.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1175,2022-10-09 13:39:15
12950," If we have the big advantage in disinflation of expectations that are not yet entrenched, surely we should be acting on inflation while we have that advantage. Larry, another big development this week was the OPEC plus decision to reduce production limits by 2 million barrels a day. Something that I think it's fair to say was set the Biden administration back a bit. He'd gone over there and asked the Crown Prince not to do that. It wasn't very pretty. So apart from perhaps any embarrassment in my cause, does it have larger macroeconomic effects for a globe that we are warned by WTO? No, maybe headed toward a global recession. There's nothing good in this. Certainly, it's not what we wanted to see. Actually, it's a lot less than 2 million barrels because many of the countries that reduced their quota weren't hitting their quota before, so the reduction in the ceiling didn't really matter. You didn't see a hugely dramatic move in oil markets in a way that was proportionate to the headlines that you saw. But certainly the risks are up and it just points up the importance. We always do a scramble about the immediate when these things happen and we don't forget about the medium term. Look, we made a mistake by canceling the Keystone pipeline. We made a mistake by slowing down all kinds of permitting activity. We made a mistake by being hostile as a country to natural gas. We made a mistake in the Congress a few weeks ago when we didn't pass the mansion program of expanding permitting. We crucially need regulatory relief where we're not going to get renewables online fast and we're not going to get the transmission lines that are necessary for renewables to become a large part of our energy fast. The real lesson on this is we need a different kind of energy strategy than the one that we've had. We need a strategy that is balanced rather than an unbalanced strategy of total hostility to fossil fuels or God knows the kind of total strategy of favoring fossil fuels that we had and even egregious favoritism towards Saudi Arabia that we saw during the Trump administration. We need to find a balance and I think we're making our way in that direction. Larry is always so helpful to have you on each week and I would like to say, Larry is always staying with us as we bring in Professor Brad DeLong, Professor of economics from UC Berkeley on his new book, Slouching Toward Utopia. That's an economic history of the 20th century. That's coming up next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. Imagine simply climbing a cable into space. The concept is known as the space elevator. But only could it significantly change how we leave planet Earth, but it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space.

If a private entity wants to build it or a government, they can build it. It'll change society. We have no clue how colonizing in the space, how really spreading on the space, really changed our society over the next 50 to 200 years. It'll be completely different. This is Walter E. I'm David Weston. Our very special contributor, Larry Summers of Harvard, has stayed with us because we're going to bring in now Professor of Economics from UC Berkeley. He's Brad DeLong, the author of a new book, Slouching Toward Utopia, an economic history of the 20th century. So Professor, welcome for joining us. It's really good to have you here. I've read this fascinating and really sort of protein book. It's really quite a book. Let's set it up first because it's a history of the 20th century. But you don't necessarily define the 20th century as from 1900 to 2000. You started in 1870 and you ended up in 2010. Why? Well, the big thing that happens happens in 1870. Right? Before 1870, the world's poor, and there's no prospect for the world being anything other than poor. After 1870, every single generation, humanity's technical competence doubles, and then doubles again in the following generation. And such an enormous pace of technological advance raises the possibility for the first time of a world in which we can bake a sufficiently large economic pie for everyone to have enough. And that was nothing that humanity had ever seen before. One of the remarkable things, Brad, that you highlight is that it really wasn't very different to live in the United Kingdom in the 19th century, than it had been to live in the ancient world 2000 years before. Say something about the acceleration of growth that you see is happening in the 20th century. Well, you know, I mean, it was British economist John Stuart Mill, right? He was writing in 1871 about how all the industrial revolution had done was it had created a somewhat larger middle class, and it had allowed manufacturers and the rich to earn greater fortunes, but that the overwhelming mass of humanity was still confined to the same life of drudgery and imprisonment than they had been before, and before all the way back into deep time. It was very clear by 1900 that things had changed. You know, John Maynard Keynes writing in 1919 looks back and says starting in 1870, we entered economic Eldorado, and that now our chief task after World War I was figuring out why we tried to blow it up and try to get desperately back to what was good was going on after 1870. Fortunately, we eventually did, and so things rolled through up until our day. First of all, it gives us a sense of what happened in 1870 that brought all this about. There were some three driving forces in your book. Well, you know, everyone has an idea about just what it is that's made us as a civilization so wealthy that makes our economy so productive. And the different people have different things and they all go back some of them back even to say the year 1070 when it turns out that the law applies to a German emperor standing in the snow outside of the castle that allows and his tool, but instead it could be that the law relies to everybody. But you get three things that fall into place in 1870 that set technological progress into a much higher gear than ever before. And they are the industrial.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1177,2022-10-09 13:48:03
12952," things that fall into place in 1870 that set technological progress into a much higher gear than ever before. And they are the industrial research lab so that you can rationalize and rootonize the discovery and development of technology. And then the corporation, as we know it, which rationalizes the development and deployment of technology. You know, to combine that with the globalized economy with the telegraph and the I railroad and the iron hold ocean going steamship. And all of a sudden the incentives to deploy technology worldwide for production are so overwhelming and people turn their minds to how to do this that everything explodes in a way it never had before. Brad, much of the academic discussion of your book has centered on this idea of a pivot point in 1870. But I want to ask about a different judgment you make, which is that there was this major era and that the major era ended in 2010. I would have thought that the world was growing. It was becoming more integrated with technology. There were important political struggles. That was the stuff of history through the 20th century, much better in the second half of the century than in the first half of the century. The Cold War was a very different war than World War One or World War Two. It was cold. But I would have thought that was a continuing process with substantial challenges. And yet you see us as now being in a quite different era. What's different about the era we're in than the era you wrote the history of other than more of the kind of progress and change that you saw as happening every generation. Well, I'm pleased you disagree here and I'm very pleased you disagree on our historic optimist here about our future. Because look, I've been losing arguments in person with you for 42 years, even when I think I'm right afterwards. And here I'm genuinely uncertain. And I actually very much hope you are really right this time. My thinking was I've been listening to our friend John Furnald about how the underlying pace of technological progress has more or less halved since 2005 compared to what we were used to beforehand. Save in those years from 1975 to 1990 when technology was crawling toward a more energy efficient and environmentally friendly. Configuration rather than focusing on labor saving. But after 2000 and after 2000, we seem to have we substantial loss of social and economic knowledge about how to run things. Things about financial regulation that I thought were in trend that were known in the bones turned out to have been completely forgotten in 2008. Things about the proper tools for macroeconomic policy that I thought were ingrained in the bone were also forgotten after 2010. And I remember UNI whimpering in 2012 that no for more expansionary fiscal policy was not then a thing that ran any risks whatsoever. Combined that with the fact that from 1870 on to 2010, you know, first you had Britain in the United States and then the United States as the countries that people were looking to for examples as you always Leon Trotsky liked to say as the furnace where the future is being forged. You know, but now you go to China, you go to India, you even go to Indonesia and what you find is that people say that the United States has very little to teach them. That we don't have any greater grasp on how to deploy and use these technologies to create a good society and are in fact the society, our society that is more trouble. We're more trouble than theirs are. Brad, if that is right, how much of it could go?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1178,2022-10-09 13:52:20
12953," And are in fact the society, our society that is more trouble. We're more trouble than theirs are. Brad, if that is right, how much of it is because of a running out of ideas? And how much of it is running out of cohesion? One of the themes in your book is the sort of polls if I can put it that way between high-ick on the one hand, the market is king, and Pallani and the others, the market has to serve people. How much of the problems we're in right now are because we're lacking cohesion because of the dispersion in wealth and income? I think we're definitely lacking cohesion. I think dispersion and wealth and income creates work of cohesion. I am struck by comparing the United States around 1900 with the United States today, that around in 1900 politics was as fierce and mean as it is today. That is, theodore Roosevelt denounced in William Jennings Bryan as the puppet of an alien European socialist, John Peter Altgill, the governor of Illinois, who had not only been born in Europe, but also had dared to pardon anarchists. But there seems to be a very different flavor. That is, I think it's Ezra Klein talks about it, that somehow that our media and our communications today focuses first on establishing who are your enemies. Do you share any enemies with me, and if you share enemies with me, I will listen to. As I say, it's a remarkable book. It's slouching toward an economic history of the 20th century. Thank you so much for bringing it. I only really touch upon it today. I urge everybody to read it. It is really worth the effort. Thank you so much. That's Professor Brad DeLon of UC Berkeley. And of course, to our very special contributor, Larry Summers of Harvard. Coming up, staying the course or turning tail, we'll reflect on some big about faces this week. This is Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. We will never break. We will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never. Finally, one more thought. The fine line between being steady and being stubborn. We've all admired those leaders through the years who have stuck to their guns when times got tough. British leaders like Winston Churchill and the darkest days of World War II. We shall fight in the hills. We shall never surrender. And Churchill's successor, Margaret Thatcher, who was known for sticking to her guns, no matter what. He wanted the Council of Ministers to be the Senate. No. No. No. And American leaders like President Reagan at the Brennan Bird Gate.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1179,2022-10-09 13:57:04

Gorbachev's mind mr. Gorbachev Open this gate Mr. Gorbachev's tear down this wall But those were the times when the steadfast were ultimately proven right by history What happens when bold proclamations don't hold up quite as well such as George Herbert Walker Bush's insistence He would never ever raise taxes and they'll push again and I'll say to them Read my lips And then there are those bold pronouncements that have yet to be proven out one way or the other like President Jesus insistence that his zero COVID policy is the right one for his country If you just look at the COVID zero protocols it requires all people returning from abroad to have Ten days of quarantine or President Putin insisting that he will ultimately still prevail in Ukraine He thinks he's losing and may lose his his you know office and even life Then he could become completely unpredictable, but this week this week we saw something a bit different Big bold pronouncements being completely reversed not long after they were made a big one was of course Elon Musk's change of mind Again on whether he pony up 44 billion dollars for Twitter We're now hearing that Elon Musk and Twitter of course that resolution really said to be sticking on the contingency of getting that debt Financing and that is going to be the key clause that were focused on going forward But at least Mr. Musk took a few months for his change of heart over in Great Britain We saw a new government lay out a new budget that included big tax cuts starting with the top tax bracket We love the tax cutting but not at this time. This is just the absolutely the wrong time to do this bringing immediate and violent reaction in the markets Just trying to get the markets behind those two blaster factors probably significantly more difficult And the Bank of England stepping in for the rescue So suddenly the Bank of England find itself in the ECB situation So Prime Minister Truss's newly minted chancellor of the chequer had to admit publicly that they had been wrong Clearly and dramatically wrong at least on those top tax rates and it came only days after he and Prime Minister Truss had gone so big and so bold I think it was a distraction And I think and I think I think It was it was the wrong thing to do one can hardly fault a government for listening to its people even if the listening might have come better before the deciding But whatever the right answer the one thing for certain is that at least in this respect Miss Truss is no Margaret Thatcher To those waiting with baited breaths for that favorite media catch phrase the you turn I have only one thing to say You turn if you want to the ladies not for turning That does it for this episode of Wall Street Week.

12955," One day we left rights and we got inside. Even turned back on. We make it very transparent to the shopper before they accept an order. What the order is going to look like, how much work are going to pay them and how much like the consumer is paying them. And so they can decide whether they take an order or whether they refuse it. And that's a kind of flexibility. That's our shoppers really value and the kind of transparency that they want. Are you seeing a labor shortage right now? And what are you doing to combat that? It's different in different places. Our demographic of shoppers is completely different from food delivery and our right sharing, where 70% women and half of them are moms. And that's because a lot of the job at Instacart is very different than just being in a car with strangers. It's about like going to the store, doing a good job of customer service, of really picking the right products for the consumer. And we are seeing that being very appealing to women. This is my kitchen table and also my filing system. Over much of the past three decades, I've been an investor. The highest calling of me in time I've often thought was private equity. And then I started interviewing. Well I watch your interviews because I know how to do something. I've learned in doing my interviews how leaders make it to the top. I asked him how much he wanted. He said 250, I said fine, I didn't negotiate with him and I did no due diligence. I have something I'd like to sell and how they stay there. You don't feel inadequate now because being only the second wealthiest man in the world is that right? One of the most successful entrepreneurs in the world of cryptocurrency is Sam Bankman Freed. He's created the FTX platform and after platform has been so successful in the cryptocurrency world that Sam has become one of the wealthiest men in the world. As a result of this, he's now focusing a lot of his energy on philanthropy. I sat down with him at the Bloomberg headquarters in New York recently to talk about the future of crypto that is desire to change the world and make it a better place. So is crypto down for the count or is it coming back? I think it's coming back and obviously a lot of this is just going to have to do with the macro environment. If we see markets crash again, we're going to see crypto crash along with it. If we see a market recovery, we're going to see a crypto recovery along with it. But I think this is, it's flushed out a lot of the things that needed to be flushed out from the crypto space anyway. When May of 2022 began, I think I'm meltdown in tech values and also crypto. Did you get nervous that all of a sudden the world was going to fall apart? Not super nervous. It was definitely going to be a rocky road for the industry and you saw some businesses blow up when Bitcoin hit 20K. I think if we saw things melt down much further than they did, right? If we saw NAS Act drop 30, 40% from here and Bitcoin go down to 10K per token, I think you would see another round of pain for the industry that would potentially be more of a medium to long term problem. So it didn't give you any gray hair I can see. Oh, a little bit. But I plucked those out to keep up appearances. So let me ask you this, when the Bitcoin world was kind of going down a bit, I think it Bitcoin peaked at 61,000 or something and now it's at 23,000 but it went as low as 1718. 1718. 1718. Well, I did. A lot of other cryptocurrencies went down as well. You bailed out some companies. What money did you use to do that? So there were a few different versions of it and one piece of this was basically FTX balance sheet like we keep our corporate cash.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1181,2022-10-09 14:06:33
12956," You know, one piece of this was basically FTX balance sheet. Like we keep our corporate cash just in dollars. And so, you know, we'd raised a few billion dollars over the course of the last, last couple of years and we're a profitable business. Now, we'd also done some acquisitions, which partially balances that out. But, you know, we had some cash left and with the BlockFi, you know, deal, for instance, that was on FTX, I think FTX US's balance sheet. Well, in Wall Street, it had its problems early in the 20th century. Mr. JP Morgan himself used to go out and say, I'm going to bail out certain companies and you were called the JP Morgan of crypto. Is that bother you or not? It doesn't bother me too much. I mean, I think it's something I thought was the right thing for the industry and, you know, our very explicit mandate that we sort of gave to the team of people working on this was your goal is not to make a fortune. For us doing this, like your goal is to do OK deals. Your goal is for us to not get our faces ripped off. But contingent on that, you know, do as much as we can to bail out the industry and that was the higher goal was trying to backstop places rather than maximizing on these deals. You know, I would have loved other people to do it. Like, I think it would have been great. So you went in, you bought some companies where those investments profitable? I mixed is basically the answer. I think some are going to turn out to be profitable. Some won't be. Like, one of them certainly, I mean, with Voyager, I think, you know, there's $70 million there that we put in that I'm not sure whether seeing that $70 million again. And so, you know, we had to make snap judgment calls and we made them such that if things turned out well, they'd be good investments. And if they turned out badly, they'd be bad investments. But we sort of limited the amount that we could lose from it. Why do so many young people seem so attracted to crypto? I mean, I know there are people from all over the world of all ages, but it seems like young people, particularly are very interested. Why is that? Yeah, I mean, partially it's a new thing that's going to appeal to younger people. But I think another aspect of this is if you're, you know, 21 years old and you're trying to get access to markets, you want to be able to trade to invest. You can sign up for an account on the crypto exchange and get full market access. If you try and get that same love of access in equities and commodities, you can't get it. You're going to end up with heavily intermediated access that has, like, pretty limited amounts of real interactiveness, limited amounts of liquidity, limited amounts of size, limited amounts of market data. And so, I think, for a, you know, natively digital generation that's looking to take more control of their finances, actually being able to do it with crypto is a big, big difference. So, in your own case, you got involved with crypto at what age? I was, boy, I guess it was 25 or so. And did you ever imagine that at 25, when you got involved, you would now be one of the most important people in the crypto world and have become a multi-billionaire? No, well, no, although the crypto world sells are grown quite a bit since I got involved, but I was surprised at how big things grew in general, how big, you know, I was able to grow things. I thought there was a chance of it. Like, I did see pretty high upside when I got involved. I was surprised that we actually got there. So, today, you're running FTX. You started FTX in what year? 2019. And what does it actually do? So, it's a, I mean, cryptocurrency exchange is what we call it, but really, it's a combination of a few different businesses. If you compare to traditional finance, right? You have the New York Stock Exchange, Genese Act, Icent CME, as the exchanges. And that's where Bids and Offers cross. But you don't go to New YorkSockExchange.com to send an order. They are primarily the sort of backend trading infrastructure. Separately, you have brokerages, FCMs, and other businesses that sit in the front that consumers access. And then you have different settlement and sort of custody parties sitting in the middle there. In crypto, all of that gets squashed traditionally into one entity. And so, what FTX is, it's sort of all of those things. It's a backend, you know, match engine, risk engine, custody system, say, front end, mobile app, website, API, and everything in between. So that, you know, if you want to buy or sell a Bitcoin, you can go to FTX.com. And, you know, we offer all the services necessary to do that, except for buying and selling. So, you got involved because you thought it would be a creative new area to get involved with. But was making a lot of money at one of your goals? Yeah, it was. And in particular, when I was in college, I sort of went to a lot of charities that I really respected and said, hey, what can I do to help you guys out? Like, do you want me to work for you? And they basically said, not really. I mean, you could, but they'd be kind of mediocre.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1182,2022-10-09 14:10:49
12957," a charity said I really respected and said, hey, what can I do to help you guys out? Like do you want me to work for you? And they basically said not really. I mean, you could, but they'd be kind of mediocre. You know, what they say is they'd rather my money than my time. And so I ended up going on to Wall Street and then getting involved with crypto with the goal of donating what I made. Back in 1997, I was interested in the following question, which is there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called Saurapod dinosaurs, which had really long skinny necks. So Apatosaurus is an example. I also had really long skinny tails. So I made a computer model that showed that in fact the tail of these Saurapod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip, a bullfip. Now, the way a bullfip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. And that crack is a sonic boom. I think the way they got to date was to impress the females by making loud booms. So let's go back to your youth. You're 30 years old. So let's go back to when you were growing up. You grew up in California? Yep, on Stanford campus. And your parents were both professors at Stanford Law School. And one's name was Professor Fried and one is Professor Bankman. So whose idea was it to combine the two into one name? I think they both have the idea. I think there's a little bit hashing out of exactly what that would look like when it would be Bankman Fried, would it be Fried Bankman. But I think they kind of mutually came to that decision. So if you got married someday and you have to have two hyphens? Well, especially if I married someone with a hyphenated last name, right, then you've got four names. I think at that point we just have to roll a die and choose one. Oh, wow. Okay, so you've thought about that? Yeah, I mean you could also just use a totally new name. But would it be particularly attractive to find somebody had a hyphenated name or not really? I think it would be worth one good story. That's what I get out of it. On the scale of life partners, not the most important criteria. Okay, so you're growing up. Your parents are distinguished professors at Stanford Law School. Were you interested in the law at any point or not? Not at all growing up. I think I've become more interested in it recently. But you know, I mean when I was growing up my parents told me look you can do whatever you want with your life. We don't particularly recommend that you become a lawyer, but you know you're welcome to do whatever you want. So you were a bit of a math prodigy when you were younger? I was certainly better at math than I was at reading or literature. So you went to MIT? Yep. And when you got there did you find that people were smarter than you thought or not as smart as you thought? I think smarter than I thought. I think maybe some part of me had hoped that I would be able to live a life where I was always clearly sort of like an outlier on that. And I think MIT taught me that wasn't true. There were a lot of other really smart people in the world and you know was really interesting and cool getting to know them. So when you get to MIT did you say look I'm going to go out and become a multi billion air before I'm 30? No, I had no idea what I was going to do. I mean I wiggly thought I was going to become a professor not for any particular reason. I realized I didn't really like academia when I was there and that left me kind of a little bit lost about what I would actually do with my life. So what did you major in? Physics technically. I took about the bare minimum that you could imagine. It took maybe seven or eight physics classes my whole time there. So what did you really take courses in math or? I took some I minored in math but I took a kind of popery of classes. You know some polyps high classes some econ some psychology but really I also.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1183,2022-10-09 14:14:35
12958," math or? I took some I had minor in math but I took a kind of popery of classes, you know some polycyclasses, some econ, some psychology, but really I also didn't take that many classes and sort of got a little burnt out of academia. Right. So when you graduated, what did your parents say to you about what you should do upon graduation? I mean, mostly they said I should do what I wanted and what like I thought was whatever I thought would be exciting. And you know, they're going to support me with whatever, but I you know, going to like junior year of college, I had no idea what that was going to be. I always sort of had just ruled out or soft rolled out academia and didn't know what was going to replace it. I ended up interning at Jane Street, a finance firm after my junior year and and really liked it there and was starting to to chart a path forward of donating money. Okay, so what did you do upon graduation? You took a job in finance? Yep. Went back to Jane Street, worked there full time. And what did they do? They're quant trading firms. So I was on the internationally TFTASK. Basically, that means you have a US listed fund that owns a lot of foreign stocks. So, you know, you could look at EEM, US listed ETF that owns a bunch of emerging market companies, you know, across Asia, across LADM and you know, few places in Europe. And it's basically a combination of like modeling computer trading and real time intuition kind of jumbled together. And how many years were you doing that? About three, three and a half years. All right. And after that, you're said, I'm going to go start something in the crypto world. Not quite. So I left in late in the say fall 2017 roughly, not sure what it was actually going to do. Next, what I'd really done was sort of written down like 12 things I could do with my life and felt like a lot of them were compelling. And I didn't know what was going to be best. But that, you know, the only way to try would be to so leave and just dive into some of them. Right. So you started your own company. What was it called? So I'll meet a research. It's the first company I started up. And it was a crypto-quant trading firm. And you know, the sort of founding if it was basically, well, you know, Bitcoin was trading on a lot of different crypto exchanges. And it was not trading at the same price on all of them. So you might see it trading for $10,000 on Coinbase and $10,100. On Bet Stamp. And you know, in theory, there's a 1% arbitrage to do their trading those against each other. All right. So you just started to mirror less trade, Bitcoin or other cryptos who take some arbitrage advantage. And it was a profit of Y presumed. Yep. It was. It was a huge amount of logistical work. Like finding the trades was the easy part. The hard part was getting the account sending wire transfers, opening up entities and all of the other sort of operational work that went into actually being able to execute. And normally, then people start companies to get venture capital money and those venture capitalists own a piece of it. Did you get venture capital money? I did not for Alameda. And part of this was, you know, we talked with some VC firms and our petri is basically, hey, guys, good news. A bunch of 25-year-olds. We don't really know what a Bitcoin is, but we're trading it. Also, this is all crypto. And we got to start up together. None of us has run a company before and we'd like $100 million by next Tuesday, ideally. It was not a very compelling pitch. Okay. So you got to turn down. Oh, yeah. I mean, no one, you know, people were like, oh, that's so cool. Like, I hope you find success. And, you know, no one was, and so what we ended up doing was basically cobbling together lines of credit and other things from various sources trying to sort of snowball and be able to build on ourselves. Okay. So after that, you started another company, FTX. Yeah. Now, what does FTX do that your first company didn't do? So Alameda is buying and selling. Like, it's trading for its own book and, you know, trying to do profitable trades. FTX, you can think of it as infrastructure. It's markets infrastructure. So everything that sits between a buyer and a seller. So FTX doesn't buy and sell itself. But it's a venue where people can go to trade crypto and, and, you know, that, that aims to solve sort of every piece in between those two parties from, you know, the clearing and settlement and custody, the, you know, anti-money laundering, you know, your customer policies, the compliance, you know, the match engine, the risk engine, the front end, and everything else. All right. So why does somebody come to FTX and use you as opposed to one of the other similar exchanges? Yeah. I mean, you know, Twitch is own. But the things that I think we've particularly specialized in and been good at, you know, one we've been pretty, you know, fast-moving and innovative. You know, we're a relatively new venue. But we've put a lot of thought into exactly how our products are designed.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1184,2022-10-09 14:19:23
12959," specialized and been good at. You know, one, we've been pretty, you know, fast-moving and innovative. You know, we're a relatively new venue, but we've put a lot of thought into exactly how our products are designed. Where's the company based? So we have, we have a lot of offices for regulatory reasons. So as an example, we have a new Tokyo office with a bunch of people in it because we now have a, JFSA type one financial services license there. So we have like little bases in a number of the jurisdictions that we are licensed and regulated in. But our biggest office is in the United States in Chicago and out to the United States is NASA on the Bahamas. All right, so you live in NASA? That's right. And is that a tough place to live? It's really tough. It's a hard life. And so how do you put up with the pleasure of going to the beach or not versus working? I'm, you know, for better or for worse, not the person most tempted in the world to go to the beach. I enjoy being there. I like going there once every couple months, but I don't spend a lot of time outside. I'm pretty much just in the office. So you don't look like you have a tan or anything? No, not so much. In the case of crypto currencies today, I think it's now is a time to get in. It's good or now is a time to wait to see where the market's going. The biggest thing I would say is don't put in more than you're fine losing. Big expensive cities have a lot going for them. But if you live in one, you've probably noticed that these big expensive cities keep getting more well expensive. You could always move away. You might have just started working remotely, so there's really nothing keeping you there. But then again, moving is a hassle. Well, what if someone paid you 10 grand to do it? What if they threw in free office space, a bicycle or a gym membership? Programs and cities and states around the US are doing exactly that. And they're getting a lot of interest. We've had over 50,000 applications. About 90,000 applications. We've had over 1,800 applicants from all over North America. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them? Or are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns from places looking for an injection of fresh talent? You will shed light on dark matter. You will make aging optional.

Bloombergouch tablets connected to urban kingdoms and elastic Airlines, So very often when people get wealthy, they buy fancy suits and so forth. You haven't gone to that phase yet, right? Not so much. Your output is pretty much standard. It's some kind of t-shirt, shorts, tennis shoes. Is that what you wear all the time? When I go to Washington, DC, I have a suit there because I have to wear it on the help. But outside of that, yeah. So are you thinking of buying a house to live in or where do you live? I live in nine colleagues and I bought a large apartment together near office that we live in. And I don't, I mean, I'm sort of really fortunate to be able to have a really comfortable life and not have to worry ever about money for myself. But I'm not particularly excited to dive into luxury. I'm not excited about yachts. And I both think it's not what I should do with my money. I think I should be thinking about how I can help the world with it. And I also just isn't who I am. So do you go to Washington, much to lobby with members of Congress and or regulators? And is that an uplifting experience for you? It's, so I go a lot. I'm there probably every.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1185,2022-10-09 14:23:21
12960," So, do you go to Washington much to lobby with members of Congress and or regulators? And is that an uplifting experience for you? It's, so I go a lot. I'm there probably every few weeks. And it's been a surprisingly uplifting experience. I was not expecting that. I was expecting it to be a real slog. And I think it could have been in a slightly different universe where you saw continued boards going on between regulators and the industry. What we've tried really hard to do over the last year was get the industry to a place where it is happy to accept sensible regulation. And I think that's helped turn down the volume a little bit on the arguments and get to a place where most people are honestly trying to engage on what's the important federal oversight that we need to give to the industry. How can we do that in a way that makes sense given how the industry operates? The crypto industry seems to want to be regulated by the CFTC and some people want the SEC to be the principal regulator. Do you have a view on this? So in the end both are going to be regulators. And the CFTC is going to regulate commodity futures. So it's going to regulate very likely futures on tokens that are not securities. The SEC is very likely going to end up regulating spot security token markets. And there's some territory in between there when you look at spot commodity markets, when you look at what a security token futures regime might look like. Those may end up as joint regimes. They may end up in one place or the other. And in principle I'm fine with either regulator or any combination of them. I think that the non-security token aspect of this is a nice fit for the CFTC regime. Now in our country when you want to have some influence with government very often people make campaign contributions as they're called. And you've become a large donor to political candidates. Is it because you want some influence on the policy of crypto or is it just you think these candidates are good public servants? It's mostly just looking for good public servants like that is by far the most important thing to me and look there are a lot of issues that matter. But there's also just this correlate aspect of like are they going to be fighting to what they think is right for the country in general. And you know the single issue that I have sort of spent the most time you know thinking about the most money you know don't need to on the political side is pandemic prevention which is nothing to do with crypto. But it's you know ultimately what I think is you know one of the most important issues for the world over the next. So how do you find political fundraisers they come to you directly? Is it easy to get to you and say we need this money for this candidate and what type of candidates do you tend to support? Oh yeah well if you if I you know pulled out my phone here and just looked at my last ten text messages you know about half of them are going to be people asking for you know politicians asking for for contributions but those you have a political expert advisor. Yeah so I obviously ignore the text messages. I've got a few people on the ground in DC who are sort of actually running the operations days. So when you give money to a candidate and he or she gets elected do they respond to you when you call them later or not really? Some do some don't and it's you know always super happy to talk but it's not generally the primary goal like the primary goal is generally that I thought they would be a good legislator. Do you get involved with presidential campaigns are you going to be involved in this campaign that's coming up in a couple years? It's a good question dancers maybe it totally depends on who's running on what the race looks like. I'll give a couple thoughts the first is you know I might be very involved I might not be involved at all. I might be involved on either side or both and in general my sense is that primaries are really important and I think this is true for the presidency as well. I think this is something a lot of people miss is that if your goal is partisan then you basically have to operate in general elections that's when you know partisan splits are determined but if your goal is getting like good public servants and people who are really fighting for it's right for the country there are people who do and don't fit that description on both sides of the aisle and you know you have these contests which are way lower stakes from a partisan perspective it gets rid of a lot of the noise and competition and you know they're great opportunities to support people who just be good public servants. So you support people both parties yeah okay and today you would not consider running for office yourself right? I would be an insane thing for me to do is a fourth job to tack on to you know the other things I'm doing. And can you see doing this for another 10 years 20 years 30 years like this? I think so I don't I mean when I get burnt out I get burnt out because I'm out of useful things to do on a topic I don't tend to get burnt out from worker stress.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1186,2022-10-09 14:27:53
12961," years, 20 years, 30 years like this? I think so. I don't tend, I mean, when I get burnt out, I get burnt out because I'm out of useful things to do on a topic. I don't tend to get burnt out from worker stress. Well, crypto came along relatively recently. I guess Bitcoin was invented in 2009, but yeah, but relatively recently it's become a big phenomenon. Do you see any other phenomenon like that that you might get involved with as well? Potentially. I mean, look, eventually AI. I think, you know, right now we're at the stage of AI being mediocre chat bots instead of really bad chat bots, but that's going to change over time and you know, mark to 10, 20 years from now, we may be having a very different conversation. So I have not bought any cryptocurrencies. I have invested in companies that service the industry, but I haven't bought crypto myself. Let's suppose I said I wanted to buy some crypto currencies. What would you recommend to me or anybody else? Well, first thing is I try not to give an investment advice and you know, what I would say is the most effective and, you know, useful thing you can do is just try everything out. $810, feed it through every protocol, feed it through every exchange, see what it's like, get a first hand experience of using a blockchain, using a blockchain explorer, doing trade, and that will teach you a lot about how the industry functions. You know, I think I've been really interested in a few different areas of the space. I think it's been interested in scalable blockchains. I've been interested in obviously in the exchange and platform space, especially on the regulated side. And then I'm super excited about the potential for blockchain-based social media to be extent that there are projects coming out, you know, in that area around where mittences and payments and around market structure. Those are the places that I'm looking at the most right now. So in the case of crypto currencies today, you think it's now as a time to get in. It's good or now as a time to wait to see where the market's going. So I think what I would say is there's potentially a lot of profit you could make. You could also lose though. Like things can go up, things can go down. There is, you know, a lot of upside potential. The biggest thing I would say is don't put in more than your fine losing. Like, you know, don't put in money that you would be really, really sad to lose into, you know, crypto right now. You know, think of it more as an upside play. When you leave this interview and you go outside, can you walk down the streets of New York without anybody bothering you? It's borderline. So I think probably a half a percent or a third of a percent or something of a people recognize me here. And so, you know, the real answer is like every 10 minutes that I'm walking on the streets, someone will recognize me roughly, it's a little bit in between. What you can do is get a comb, comb your hair, get a suit and then people will, they'll be your disguise. It's true. I could just look normal and that would, yeah. But you haven't thought of that. No, that's beyond me. So as you look back on your career, what would you say is the best investment advice you've ever received? Probably the best investment advice that I never received, but that I've lived my whole life around is surround yourself with really good people. I thought about it just today, like I do many times, you know, what makes a great investor? A great investment firm is comprised of people who are optimists and pessimists and realists because in the intersection of the debates that go across that wide range of personalities is where you find truth. It's part of the reason I'm so focused on freedom of expression. I see it my own four walls, the robust and fulsome debates around how we commit our capital, what defines a good idea, what businesses to build or pursue, that's what drives the success at Citadel. And I've been very fortunate in life to have always had a group of friends who really push me, who make me better. And here I get to work with three and a half thousand colleagues who in their ways make me better each and every day and collectively as a team, we've had the opportunity to have an incredible impact on the financial landscape around the world.

12962," Aides of stagnation, Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation. Corporate giants, policymakers and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that. Every week on Japan ahead, right here on Bloomberg Television. Welcome to the world of decentralized finance, Bloomberg's covering all things crypto, the people, the transactions and the technology. Bloomberg crypto Tuesdays. Well, it's a really a reminder isn't it just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see pressure on the U.N. We did see pressure on the futures. That is now being reversed. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. We have to get interest rates higher and bring inflation back to our targets. We are experts, we are running on thin ice. No one deliberately wants to go into battle but we sneak walk into conflict. With unmatched reach and resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks, 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. Welcome everybody to the inaugural NIL Summit and NIL Awards. In July 2022, Atlanta hosted what might sound like a boring legal seminar. A conference on the new rules around name, image and likeness in sports. But far from dry and academic, the first annual NIL Summit was in fact a flashy star-studded event put on at the college football hall of fame. In mingling amid the biggest current and former names in sports and media, there was a crucial cohort. The player is poised to redefine what it means to be a modern college athlete. And the winner of male athlete of the year goes to Chase Griffin. Among those up-and-comers, UCLA's Chase Griffin. The UCLA quarterback is among the students becoming as well known for making deals as making plays. And even in that group, Chase stands out. My name is Chase Griffin. What's up everyone? It's Chase Griffin. It's your favorite quarterback, it's favorite quarterback, Chase Griffin. When you look at it as an empowerment, equity opportunity has really been unmatched in the sports world for any point in time since Title IX. Better a scope. After hardly a full year of name, image and likeness deals being the reality, he already has more than 20 deals with major brands, venture and charitable groups. All the while bouncing, graduating undergrad in just two years and fighting for playing time on the field. Chase Griffin out of the gun. We are joined by UCLA quarterback Chase Griffin. Not just UCLA quarterback, but name image likeness superstar. I am sited for this one. This kid could actually be the president of the United States someday. Chase isn't the starting quarterback for UCLA. He's not even the backup quarterback. At the time of the day, he's not the first to be the president of the United States. But back on campus in LA, his nickname is president Chase. And after spending a couple days talking about his approach to business, sports and equality, it's not shocking to think he might someday hold that off. His level of focus and maturity at the stage. I only wish I had. If you want to buy stock and human being, buy stock and Chase Griffin. When it comes to building generational wealth, it's not about the money that you make in college. I made last year. I am even ten times more excited that I know how to make that money. Summer on any college campuses, mostly for the athlete, who are unlighter, but still regimented schedules. Attending classes, working out, a little bit of hanging out, and then more working out, on their own time. Chase is no exception. The 21-year-old is a backup, albeit an impatient one. In the topsy-turvy past couple of seasons, dotted with families, games, and COVID protocol.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1188,2022-10-09 14:35:55
12963," The 21 year old is a backup, albeit an impatient one. In the Topsy-Turvy past couple of seasons dotted with fan-less games and COVID protocols, he's been able to start three games for the Bruins. Griffin, gonna throw to the end zone! Wide open again! Touchdown UCLA! Feeding Arizona and narrowly losing to both Stanford and Oregon. That was inches away from Chase Griffin and UCLA being in full-fledged comeback mode. For Chase, UCLA felt like destiny. He was born just a few miles away before his family moved to Texas when he was a toddler. But beyond being a sort of homecoming, the school's history of athlete activism was a massive draw. I always expected from myself to have some sort of impact that was beneficial for more people than I interact with on a daily basis. And choosing UCLA, a lot of that went into me seeing myself as someone who reflected the same want to make things better. That so many of the people that UCLA prides itself upon be in the home for have done in the past. The legacies of former UCLA greats like Arthur Asch, Jackie Robinson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Jackie Joyner Kursi have had a wide-ranging impact on society well beyond the Westwood campus. Chase reveres these people, but he's perhaps most keenly aware of the activism of a more recent Bruin alum, the basketball player at O'Bannon. At O'Bannon, who was an ace-meth player of the year National Champ, UCLA Sports Legend is also a legal hero. I think NIO could be the next installment where we look back in 30, 40, 50 years and God willing, if we give him the roses he deserves, we add at O'Bannon to that list of UCLA greats. O'Bannon, who played at UCLA from 91 to 95 initiated a lawsuit that's widely credited for finally opening up the possibility of college athletes being paid for use of their name, Imogen Lightness. He sued the NCAA in video game publisher EA for anti-trust violations, arguing that athletes should be entitled to financial compensation when schools used their lightness for game. In 2014, a judge ruled in his favor. I don't think he was congratulating. What was your call? And then, on an episode of the shop, surrounded by O'Bannon, Diana Tarrassi, and LeBron James, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed the first ultimately successful legislation to allow athletes to receive endorsement deals. The fair pay to play act led other states to follow suit and ultimately led the NCAA in 2021 to relent, seemingly reluctantly. NIO payments were officially allowed as of July 1st, 2021. Today is the last day where name Imogen Lightness laws will not be on the books and kids will not be, if you will, not allowed to make money off of their name Imogen Lightless. Making money from Jersey sales and endorsement deals is a way for players to share in the massively lucrative world of college athletics. This NIO thing is the wild, wild west. The NIO change felt like many things that happened very slowly and then it happened very fast. And I wonder for you, having contemplated that maybe this was coming at some point, how prepared were you, what was your mindset when the switch flipped? I mean I still think everyone is trying to get prepared for that industry. It's still sort of like a wild, wild west. I wasn't really expecting anything. I was more just thinking about honestly getting ready for that season and capitalizing on everything that was happening. When NIO hit and it turned out I had action, I was like, oh, okay, well after this degree deal, which was fantastic. I was like, okay, I see how I can be a staple in this game and I see how I can get better over time. That's why I teamed up with my friends at Shell. I'm now in Southdale hit and then boost my whole deal hit. Then you keep on building clear cover. You keep on building.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1189,2022-10-09 14:40:21
12964," better over time. That's why I teamed up with my friends as shell. Now in Shell they'll hit and then boost my old deal hit. Then you keep on building clear cover like you keep on building and you get better in the meetings and most of all you start seeing where your value can be best placed in these new opportunities. The headlines and storylines in the aftermath of the NIL change introduced visions of instant millionaire strolling campuses across the nation. You might think the NIL athlete of the year lives in splendor or at least in one of those athletic palaces that put most of our coach dorms to shame. Well it's all relative to chase. All right Jason. So here we are world headquarters. Yep this is where it all happens. So there's the kitchen right here. I actually really enjoy cooking. Oh yeah. Yeah this gas oven gets really hot really fast. I make pieces in there. This is the best appliance since diaphragm. I've already put anything in there. I need to do these dishes right here. So no trappings of success yet. More a pretty average college dorm room. The fridge filled with leftovers, a well-used PS4 and of course the requisite Godfather poster. It's a far cry from the lifestyle seen in some local news reports for NIL athletes during this first year. These are Robinson made headlines with an NIL deal with Lamborghini Austin. Lamborghini's tend to make more headlines that Muhammad Ali are Bruce Lee pictures. Some athletes are living in mansions driving Lamborghinis. As far as I know you're doing either of those things I see where you're living right here. It is it is with all to respect not a mansion. Okay. How much of that is a conscious choice and what does it say about sort of your approach to that? Right. I mean first off I look at this is like is my own room a guy everything I need. I'm cool with that. I'm cool with living below my means. I think it's important to remember that the volume of financial gain is completely overstated. And that's what it y'all is following the media. Yeah. And someone hears about a five million or ten million dollar deal. You got to report it like oh my goodness people are going to read this. Hey I'd count two things like how many kids are even getting these deals. And then for the kids that do get it how much of that is in liquor cash and how much of it is in assets. If you pay for a two million dollar house out here in LA for a kid to stay in the college that's great but as soon as they're graduated they're not going to have that two million dollars. I say the same thing you know for the kids who are driving around in Lamborghini's and stuff like that. That's awesome. Like that's super dope and I know some of those kids. But you know someone paying for your lease is different than someone actually giving you the value of that lease every single month. You're investing in saving it for a one K etc. I say all that just to mention that product deals and stuff like that are overhyped by the media and they also can land kids in some trouble if they're not paying taxes on it. That's one of the distinctly unsexy and easy to overlook elements of the new rules. Even if an athlete's not getting cold hard cash from a deal the value of any products given are subject to state and federal taxes. So suddenly what a player sees as free year in return for some social media posts actually equals taxable income. And that requires the same forms you'd fill out as an independent contractor getting a check. I made a fair amount in NIO deals and I invested all of it. In my opinion NIO is great doing all this is great making money now is great but the most valuable thing I've gotten from all of this is the fact I'll always know how to make money off of myself. All told Chase has done more than 20 deals with major brands like degree, shell and boost mobile. Along with venture stage companies including Discord, Duffel and Creative Juice. He's also made a point to work with charities like the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank where he's already raised funds for almost 60,000 meals. It is crucially important and I think we've moved from this attitude from its indulgence a waste of time almost an illness that needs a cure.

12965," For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s, and so it makes that a really exciting field, because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harnessed to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts. But if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what you bring to use out while you're sleeping. Everything you need to get set for the start of U.S. trading, Bloomberg, the open with Jonathan Ferrell. Drilling down in the numbers and preparing you as only Bloomberg can, weekdays on Bloomberg. Markets are preparing to close, but the day is not over yet. A lot of volatility right now. You need the power of the Bloomberg terminal to get you market moving data before anyone else. There's numbers much higher than expected. Upgraded today to overweight. You need top analysts to bring you exclusive global insight into cross-asset markets. The meaning of market data is a really big focus. Bitcoin ain't playing along today. It's going to be a short term. Markets the close, weekdays on Bloomberg. This is a song by Javion. I heard the opening. I just took that opening and I pitched it slow, or I think I sped it. At his desk when he's not making music, another side project, he's either networking with CEOs or investors he seeks out or who seek him out, or negotiating new deals. This is an average NIL deal. A brand approaches an athlete who can help spread their message to a demographic they believe the athlete can help reach. In this case, direct TV is looking to market their NFL Sunday ticket to college students. It would be two posts, one post late August and one post on the first week of September. The compensation would be 1200 per post, so it would be 400 total. Are they video posts or are they picking captions? They can be either. It's up to you guys. That was pretty good. 400 above, but they had originally asked. That's a win. So yeah, I mean, at this point, after I do a Zoom or something like that, I get to chill out and go back to land down if I was watching a movie or something, or go to YouTube to start looking for more samples. It's a pretty simple interaction for Chase and for direct TV. Negotiated over a couple of emails and Zoom calls, and papered with a contract chase will have his dad look over before he signs.

12966," and papered with a contract Chase will have his dad look over before he signs. And Chase, who's made himself as much of a student of the new NIL marketplace as he has a public policy at UCLA, says he understands why it's working. A brand ambassador with ship with an athlete is more attractive to these brands announced as far as a terminal investment than even a post by a famous actor. If there's any place to learn that sports are deep in the hearts of Americans, it's on a high school football field in Texas. Friday night lights in the Lone Star State might be the great iron equivalent of Frank Sinatra's New York City. Making it there means you're something special. Chase Griffin quarterback class 19, Hotto, Texas. And Chase didn't just make it, he excelled. Let's talk about some of the top quarterbacks in the state. And when you look at that list at the top of it, you got to talk about Chase Griffin. I was lucky to play three years as a quarterback for Hotto High School, which is a one horse town. We have great success. And so the town really shut down and came out and supported us every Friday night. Chase, face back. He's there. I'd open a peeking catch tonight. He does touch the hot dip. Chase, one word to describe that finish that game. God, that's it. Coming from a town like that where football is so prioritized, it has its pros and cons, but I think on the pros side, I learned how to win, how to get better, and most importantly, what it's like to build a team where everyone gets better. Emulating his UCLA alumni like Robinson, Joyner Cursey and Abdelger Barr, Chase is looking at the impact NIL will have not just for him, but the athletes that will follow. When the predecessors who have come before you have changed the world and made life better for everyone today, you can't help but ask yourself how the actions that you're taking now and the companies and brands and the NIL space that you work with are all cumulatively building something greater than any of us could foresee. I've actually, I've never moderated. So this will be my first time. It should be fun. I know my handwriting's terrible. The last day the conference Chase was asked to co-moderate a panel with Monique Nelson. The CEO for UNI World Group. All right, I'm excited to be here. UNI World Group is one of the longest standing multicultural advertising and marketing agencies in the United States. The firm works with brands like Ford, Home Depot, and Johnson and Johnson to help reach the black and brown communities. And they have big ambitions in NIL. For UNI World Group, the idea of this was pretty epic in that because we serve the undervalued overlooked and the underserved. We knew that this particular group of people would fall into that category. And we plan on being the premier practice for NIL athletes that are looking to do purpose driven media advertising, community level engagement work. UWG launched a program called the NIL to help black student athletes partner with major brands. But to help them understand how to do that, they brought on Chase to serve as a student athlete executive in residence. For me, I do nothing without tremendous amounts of data for all of our clients. I really wanted to be thoughtful about this practice being very athlete-centric. If I were to build it or anyone on my team were to build it, it would not have the athlete at the core. When you're 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, the best way to have credibility is confidence and the only way for confidence to be authentic. I'm actually learning on the job. I'm learning about the brand side of NIL, but I'm also trying to make sure that empowerment equity is built in, especially for black student athletes in the NIL world.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1192,2022-10-09 14:53:20
12967," of NIO, but I'm also trying to make sure that empowerment equity is built in, especially for Black student athletes in the NIO world. R-O-I, return on investment. Both Chase and UWG see NIO deals as something much more than making money for students. It's also a potential investment in a community long overlooked. I think we're getting ready to stop boxes, trying to feed the people with L.A. A piece of each of Chase's NIO deals go to his belief brand campaign, which has raised more than $13,000 for meals for the L.A. Food Bank backpack program. But athletes giving back is only one side. I'm here with legal zoom to give you five tips on the NIO game plan. UWG and Chase believe having brands investing in the athletes, especially athletes of color, could be a force multiplier for these historically marginalized communities. When you look at the revenue jet and rating sports for Obama, 88% of those athletes are Black. So, when you're doing stuff to empower student athletes in the NIO space, you're also helping to deliver on your promise. Now, student athletes are not the only ones who should receive this help by any means. But statistically, by doing that, you're going to be delivering on your mission. Fortunately, student athletes on average come from lower levels of income. So, you're also delivering on that promise. And a lot of these student athletes are first generation, their first gen college students. Some of them first gen high school diploma. Some of them first time receiving the amount of money that they receive in their families. This has been a wild first year in NIO. We all knew that there would be bags of cash around, right? There's always been bags of cash. There's cash everywhere. What we know is that that's not sustainable. We know that athletics has an expiration date on it. So, for us, inclusion ultimately means this is just a part of you. It is a tremendous part of you and we're going to celebrate that part of you. But we also know that you're bigger than that. So we want to empower you to live past your expiration date for this part of your life. And quite honestly, have equity in everything that you have poured yourself into as an NIO athlete. It may still be the Wild West days for the NIO industry. But in the first year, about a billion dollars in business was done with NCAA athletes. For the early leaders in the NIO space like Chase, they're striking a precedent for athletes that follow them. And that's important because collegiate athletes don't have that much time to profit. Only an estimated 2% of NCAA athletes go on to the pros. Even the hardest working are often limited by things they can't control. For Chase, it's been his height. I'm 5'10 now in high school after my sophomore year went up through for 3,000 yards. I was probably like 5'6"", 5'5"". I could already say I'm one of the best in the history of Texas high school football. But I've gone through the height test where they'll call you out of class, shake your hand, look at you up and down. And be like, nice to meet you, you go back to class. It's a sad but timeless story for student athletes. And for Chase, his story is something he's not shyed away from, but embraced when it comes to his NIO deals. I'm frequently the smallest person on the football field, but I always strive to be the most impactful. My middle school coach taught me that I would never play in high school. Chase's deals with degrees breaking limits team and clear covers inspired underdogs allowed him to capitalize financially from football. Even the last season, he never saw the field for UCLA. I play football because I love the game. I play the football because I'm a good competitor. I love to compete and I play football because I'm good at it. At the end of the day, I don't play football for my livelihood, which is important to remember when it comes down to identity. I myself chase Griffin as long as I'm that. I got something in this world. As he moves into the news.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1193,2022-10-09 14:57:45
12968," I'm that I got something in this world. As he moves into the new season and focuses more on football than business, Chase doesn't seem much of a differentiation between the two in terms of his mindset. I wouldn't be surprised if I wasn't playing football in five years and was running a Fortune 500 company, but I also wouldn't be surprised if I was winning a Super Bowl five, ten years from now. And either way, I'm going to keep on working at the tools that would align myself and my future with both. At the end of the day, you're always going to have yourself. If you can make profit off of yourself and know where you add value in any world you're in, you'll be able to adapt and find ways to generate wealth through yourself. Part of what I love about business is you get to build things from nothing. I don't have any investors. All this is all money and this is me just building. It's pretty much full service shadow banking with nobody in charge. And you're one of the most fascinating entrepreneurs because you all started with young. What did you learn? Did you always think that you'd be an entrepreneur? Probably, yes. That thing, which is a bit sad, isn't it? From age what? Five? It is. I'm not sure. I come from a family of entrepreneurs, so even I probably can spell the word and still can't say it's sort of in my blood. It's really fun starting a business. I feel it's a real privilege. I started my business officially at 18, but I knew I wanted to do it very differently from about 15. I'm sure it's if you're surrounded by it, it feels very natural. You started by making you want to Florence. It was an Italy and you started handbags. I knew I was given a handbag by my mother when I was about 61 of her old handbags. I remember how it made me feel and I think fashion is fascinating for the mood changing, the confidence boosting aspects and the tribal aspects of what fashion does. I went at 18 to Florence knowing that was the home of a levergas which is what interested me. I just wanted to learn, actually, I'm surrounded by craftsmen who are making things as important. That's going to be very interesting over the next ten years. I'm going to be on-shoring of craft and manufacturing is going to be fascinating. I watched the off-shoring and literally saw it and I think we're going to be seeing that coming back to local. When we're all looking at objectives in terms of carbon proximity is going to be key.

12969," We will never break. We will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never break. We will never break. We will never break. We will never break. Welcome to the earth shot prize innovation summit. This event powered by Bloomberg featured finalists selected by the earth shot council. Larns by Prince William is a global initiative that drives innovation on solutions to climate change and environmental issues in the following categories. Protect and restore nature. Clean our air, revive our oceans, build our waste free world, fix our climate. So over the next half an hour we will bring you all the highlights from this most important gathering. This is Bloomberg. Protecting the environment was a cause close to my grandmother's heart. And I know you should have been delighted to hear about this event and the support you're all giving our earth shot finalists. The next generation of environmental pioneers. Together in this room are the people and organisations who will help us to achieve the earth shot mission. To repair, restore and rejuvenate our planet within this current decade. That mission is not simple. Just as President John F. Kennedy said, as he challenged the United States for America to unite behind the goal of putting man on the moon, we choose to do these things not because they are easy but because they are hard. I know that the world is an uncertain place right now that many families and communities across the globe are facing unimaginable challenges. From conflicts to energy crisis and food shortages. While addressing these in the short term, we must also remain resolutely focused on tackling the greatest challenges that threaten our tomorrow. Because if we don't, the changing climate will only serve to entrench these immediate challenges into fundamental global issues, severely impacting the lives of each and every one of us. That is why our collective mission is so urgent. But there is huge reason to be optimistic. The 221 cohort of earth shot winners and finalists is evidence that we can succeed. That we can protect our world for our children, our grandchildren and the generations that will follow them. These pioneers exemplify the leadership needed in this decade of change. They include inspiring activists, brilliant innovators, a forward thinking city and even an entire country making a real difference. But they cannot do it alone. This must be a team effort. We must come together behind their innovative solutions to ensure they reach their full potential with peace and scale. While my message today is one of gratitude and encouragement, I also acknowledge that you cannot succeed in isolation. As governments, we have a responsibility to create the incentives and the space for you to flourish. A receptive environment for change and the accountability that comes with guardianship. Many nations, the foundation for this approach has been flayed for us long ago if we choose to listen. Where I come from, I'll tell you in our New Zealand a beautiful place. You must visit. Our indigenous people hold a world view that every single living and non-living thing is connected. Our people, our plants, our animals, descendants of Ranganoi the sky father of Papatu Anuku, the earth mother, and the earth mother.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1195,2022-10-09 15:05:59
12970," It's connected. Our people, our plants, our animals, descendants of Ranganui the Sky Father and Papa Tuanuku, the Earth's Mother and their Children. And so it follows that people and nature are kin, are family. And we must care for one another in the spirit of Kaitiaki Tanga, which translates into guardianship by the people of the land for the next generation. In short, kō ahō te tāau kō te tāau kō ahō. I am the environment and the environment is me. Our life source, our economy, our future. Now I've seen this in action first hand many times, not least in my own backyard, the Pacific, where the ocean is a source of protein, income, culture and connection. Now that it is a source of challenge, as it rises up and begins to inundate small island nations. It can be confronting to hear and see the stories of just how real these challenges are, but none of us are here because we have given up, but because we believe there is a way to change the future. We are not only part of the nature, but we are nature. Nature is living element. For indigenous people, nature is whole. Our planet is alive. The rivers are her blood. The trees are her hair. The soil, her skin, the wind, her breeze. And indigenous peoples, our planet they know, they are the doctor. We are protecting 80% of the world's biodiversity. Because our way of life do not harm nature. At the opposite, we are strengthening ecosystems. We improve biodiversity by cooperating with the birds and trees, listening to the winds, observing the cloud, learning from even the little insect. We protect nature by setting up our own limits. We don't take more that mother earth can give and we give back. We protect the sacred trees. We don't destroy the field of the medicinal plants. We choose, please usely. As all of us know in this fight, no one can afford to sit on the sidelines. No one can claim that climate change is somebody else's problem or forget off for future generations to address. We're all affected by a warming planet. We see that every day. And decisions being made right now will determine our shared tomorrow. So we must choose and we must act as united nations ourselves. Our progress depends on collective action, on collective ingenuity. If we stick together, we can make fixing the climate the greatest project and greatest achievement of our lifetimes. We have the science, we have the solutions. Now all the world needs is political will. Together we can create a future where rampant carbon is removed from the atmosphere, where green buildings and green business transform the livability of communities, where easy access to renewable energy enables greater equity, where sustainable agriculture feeds a growing global population. The needs are urgent and the costs of inaction are worse than any nightmare. But let us not be driven by, let us be driven by hope not fear, by optimism not despair. Because hope is not passive. Hope is the ultimate source of renewable energy pushing us forward every day to try and try again. Today, the earth shop prize innovation summit in partnership with Mike Bloomberg and Bloomberg Philanthropies will ask each and every one of us what we can do to accelerate progress to repair our planet this decade. And offer solutions on how to collaborate to drive this ambition.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1196,2022-10-09 15:10:44
12971," Every one of us, what we can do to accelerate progress to repair our planet this decade. And offer solutions on how to collaborate to drive this ambitious but essential climate agenda. We will continue to drive impact around system changing climate solutions and amplify the earth shop prizes call to accelerate progress to repair our planet through collaboration and innovation. But most importantly, we will remind ourselves what can be achieved when we turn pessimism to optimism and optimism into action. Coming up, put more from the panelists and finalists here at the earth shop prize innovation summit. This is Bloomberg. Hydrogen has a very special place in the universe. It's the first element on the periodic table. It is the most abandoned element in the universe. And when clean energy advocates think about what can we find which would be as easy to use as fossil fuels they think about hydrogen. The fuel that will when burn only produce water. We like to imagine that if we just built enough of these and these we could ditch fossil fuels and save the planet. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. There are some things where you just need a good old-fashioned combustible fuel. Now startups around the world are betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century. Can it sustain its normal at a time when everybody else is facing a very different reality? Welcome back to the best of the earth shop prize innovation summit. The guests featured ranged from heads of state to leaders of grassroots environmental organizations. Well, amongst them was philanthropist and Microsoft founder Bill Gates. Yeah, it's too bad you can't do things overnight in either medication or adaptation. When I last went through Europe people were the leaders were all saying hey give me technologies so I can tell Putin to get lost. And I said hey in five years you're going to be able to call him up. They were like no we'd like it. Now. It's the year now. Okay, that how's your planning permission regime and all the planning for that future grid? Seeds typically between the time you start and they get out in the farmers fields is about eight years. Now we have a pipeline of innovations. You know we've been funding the CG system for 20 years now. It's funded about a billion a year. It's if people care at all about adaptation. That thing will be funded at two billion a year. I mean there won't be anything close to the impact of climate related seeds. Climate related maze rice wheat sort of a millet and thank goodness because of human genetics. We know how to do the editing. Thank goodness because of AI we know how to find the alleles because of drones. We can measure stuff in the field. So there's huge advance in terms of how the whole. Seed ecosystem moves at at full speed. The timing is very tricky here. The warming doesn't stop the day you get to.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1197,2022-10-09 15:14:31
12972," system moves at full speed. The timing is very tricky here. The warming doesn't stop the day you get to zero emissions. There's a lag in this system. It's about a 20-year lag. So you haven't seen that Earth Tempter's not equilibrated to the atmospheric CO2 content. So when you get to zero, it's not like 2051. Take my air conditioner away. No, it starts quite a bit later. And so you have to look at what the peak is. And you can't just plan for OK, 2030, 2030 is where your main production in central Africa is down 25%. By 2050, it's down 70%. And you will have a key sensitive crop to SOARGOM. Now SOARGOM productivity is super low. So we'll get people to do better maize for these next 15 years. And then they are going to have to switch to SOARGOM. It is tough when you see the floods in Pakistan. I mean, nobody expected that. If the goal of climate was to make us pay attention, wow, that is way beyond expectation. So some adaptation money literally will just be disaffirming the recovery money. The boundary of what's also pretty confusing. I mean, what is food aid? If climate's causing some food production losses, all world food program money is that all climate adaptation money. It's certainly the need for it's going out. That's a system that's about 6 1.5 billion a year. So relative to the systemic solution, which is the research piece, it's relatively larger. But the demand for that piece, which is the acute half of Pakistani rice got flushed away. And so you're going to have malnutrition problems if you don't go in for that. That's also a type of adaptation. And so I do think we're going to bring some rigor to this because the pressure now, the goal of doubling the adaptation money from they say 20 billion here to 40 billion here. The pressure on that is still peanuts. No, it's very small. I mean, literally, yeah, if you start sticking food aid in there, you can use it up very quickly, rebuilding after hurricanes. I mean, we had hurricanes before, but the costs there are absolutely gigantic. There are ways of stopping wildfires that are ways of dealing with sea level rise. So the innovation agenda, not just on seeds, the innovation agenda is going full speed on mitigation. That's where there's 100 companies break through energy funded. And so by mitigation, you mean mostly energy? You mean everything to do with energy. You mean generation of energy, you mean batteries, you mean transport, you mean all of the new. And there's some renewables that are already traditional, but more that need to come on. So that's the package that you're talking about mitigation. Or are you also talking about agriculture as mitigation? Yeah, so every area of emissions, the world tends to focus on passenger cars and electricity. That's not a third of emissions. And so the focus on the easiest third, now 4% of new cars are electric. So that's the field that we're further still long. About 4% of energy generation is wind and solar. And as you triple the size of your grid, you want that to be say, some people would say 100%. Other people might say 70% to 80%. The amount you have to build, we're not within a factor of five of the build rate of those. But those are the easy sectors. Sement, clean cement costs over twice as much as the way we make cement today. And it's not, it's partly the heating energy. It's partly the basic thing, you know, remember in chemistry, when you take calcium carbonate and heat it, you get calcium. That's what makes cement. But the thing that goes away, that's CO2. And so we have to have a way of making cement.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1198,2022-10-09 15:20:12
12973," go to. And so we have to have a way of making cement, which a number of these innovative. And steel and iron. Yep. There's a whole family of hard to obeyed sectors. That's true. If you get a dead industrial sector, if you get green hydrogen that's cheap enough, it actually solves quite a large number of those. Some of the industrial processes should go straight to electricity. And some you go through, you do your reduction using the hydrogen, where you would have used some hydrocarbon constant before. For steel, we actually have companies doing both. We have electricity steel and others doing electricity is the way of replacing the blast furnace. And then we have others that take hydrogen. And if you get the hydrogen cheap enough, you get the super magic thing, which is that the green product doesn't cost more. That's called green premium equals zero. And then your adoption scale is utterly different. If we tried to subsidize steel and cement, say rich countries say, OK, we want to get rid of that, which goes to our 15% of emissions, that's greater than all foreign aid budgets put together. So over 200 billion foreign aid never will pass that number. It's just not politically possible. It's a number that's at about 170 and going down today. Coming up, but more from the panelists and finalists here at the earth's shop prize innovation side. This is Bloomberg. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total US greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Buildings across America burn fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy, the electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels, we want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of US greenhouse gas emissions. Access to financial world on demand.

Welcome back to the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit. Finalists of the annual award appeared alongside special guests, including worldwide business leaders, philanthropists, and non-governmental activists. Now while the 2022 finalists have been announced, our panelists have their eyes on the future and here's what they have to say. This is the Earth Shop Decade. We are in a race to repair and regenerate the planet. Some will focus on policy. Some will focus on activism. We are focused on supporting the game changes, the innovators, the entrepreneurs and the problem solvers. We believe in the power of human ingenuity, grit, and determination to create solutions that if scaled could repair the planet. We have only 8% of the ocean protected today. And our Earth Shop is, as Pari said, 30 by 30. 30% of the ocean at least, 30% of the ocean protected by 2030. And we...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1199,2022-10-09 15:23:37
12974," percent of the ocean protected today. And our first shot is, as Pati said, 30 by 30, 30% of the ocean at least, 30% of the ocean protected by 2030. And we know that if we protect the right 30%, not only will we prevent the extinction of many marine species, but also we will produce more fish. There's going to be these protected areas are going to produce a spillover that will exceed the forgon catch. So we're going to have more fish to eat, food security, livelihoods for people. And we know that for every dollar that we invest in a protected area in a marine reserve, that produces $10 in economic output and creates more jobs. So it's a triple win for marine life, for food security, and for climate, and of course for the economy. So that's the goal, the mission, to in the next eight years. And that's where the air shot is pretty crazy. In the next eight years, we need to quadruple all the ocean protection that has ever happened in human history. Are you optimistic that can be done? I am optimistic there's no choice. I've seen firsthand the potential that a breakthrough idea can hold. And if we start seeing more of these transformative solutions across all the challenges facing our planet, and suddenly our earth shot won't seem so improbable, the work will be difficult. It'll take extraordinary resources, determination, partnership. But we've got all the essentials right here in this room. So what is the challenge? It's the speed, scale, and cost of making these green hydrogen generators. Well, that's exactly what we are working on. Because to make green hydrogen the fuel source of the future, it needs to be cheaper than fossil fuels. And that means, electrolyzers are going to need to be really, really cheap. If you want to take a solution around the globe as quickly as possible, you need to make it standardized, mass-produced commodity. A product that is easy to make and quick to build and cheap as well. And so, while some believe electrolyzers need to be large machines, we believe the electrolyzer should be a standardized, mass-producible product that can make green hydrogen anywhere for anyone. In 2030, we imagine millions and millions of projects on restore. And not just places on earth where we see nature being brought back, but all of the other nodes that are key to ensuring success. So the technology providers, the nurseries, the seed banks, the funders, the government incentive programs, so that we have an ecosystem that really allows us to leverage the many, many connections within the nature-based solution space. And in 2030, we have been focused on another key area, which is cities. And cities require data and insights to take action on climate and to preserve nature, to create more nature and tree canopy. So we've set a goal that we want to increase cities, exactly. Exactly, right. And so we've been partnering with cities like Los Angeles to give them insights utilizing AI and geo-mapping on where all the places that you can create more tree canopy, which reduces urban heat islands, improves air quality sequesters carbon. So we want to bring data and solutions to bringing nature into cities, as well as, of course, preserving and restoring nature. And so one of the goals that we've set is we want to enable over 500 cities around the world. I know we're going to hear from the mayor of Paris after this to reduce a gigaton of carbon emissions by 2030. And so that's through data, tools, and sites, whether that's evolving transportation systems or planting new tree canopy. So that's a big bold target that we want to see achieved by 2030. Anyway, I guess I'm in the wrong place. I came here to invite all of you to the Grouch Convention. But it turns out you're all about my least favorite thing, helping. Oh. You've got me, Oscar. I do like helping people learn how to reuse repurpose and recycle. Together, everyone in this room can build a world where nothing goes to waste. And that includes even you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1200,2022-10-09 15:28:07

You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer, disrupt. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. The world of politics to the world of business. Balance of power with David Weston, views and analysis inside, from and about politics power players. Weekdays, this is Bloomberg. Hello! Good! How are you? It's so great to see you. Thank you so much for doing this. What do you think about all this love getting into crypto? I think that was more last year. I think it's kind of a way of that past. No, I don't think so, but I think it's like any time that frankly, it's when a lot of other people get into crypto, right? Other audiences too. It's when it's in the news a lot. When does that happen? A lot of times when prices are going up. She was a federal prosecutor going after gangs and the mob before being handed her next assignment, taking down Bitcoin. Katie Han soon realized this new technology was much more than a tool used by criminals. She dove deep and became a crypto convert, swapping her prosecutor hat for a board seat at Coinbase, and became the first female general partner at venture firm and recent Horowitz. Han, now a prolific crypto investor, recently launched her own fund with one and a half billion dollars to deploy. It's the largest fund ever raised by a single investor. Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, CEO and founder of Han Ventures, Katie Han. Katie, it's so great to have you. Great to be back here in the studio with you, Emily. I want to start with a vibe check. Okay. What state of the crypto cycle are we in right now? It was hot. Yep. And then it got pretty cold. Well, look, Emily, zooming back because I've been in crypto for a decade, if you can believe it. We've seen crypto be really hot and then all of a sudden not. And so we've seen this before, however, I think one of the things that's a little bit different now is with each new crypto cycle, more and more people come into it. And so it's more and more pronounced each cycle. And I would push back on it's not. I think it depends on what area of the ecosystem you're looking at. We think developers think crypto and Web3 is still really hot. I am seeing a lot less of those. We're all going to make it hashtags. I am seeing a lot less of them too, although I am spending less time on Twitter, so maybe that's why as well. But with each cycle, there are new acronyms. What hasn't happened is a crypto winter in the midst of really serious global macro conditions. So we have inflation, kind of at record highs for our generation, in our lifetime. And then we have also a war that's broken out in the Ukraine. And we have a number of other factors going on here. So that's very different. There was some serious carnage out there. So I think that's very serious. Luna, three hours. What's been your takeaways from what? I don't want to sit here and tell you that algorithmic stablecoins are bad because I actually think they're really interesting. However, I think what happened is you had, in this case you mentioned, Luna and Tara, you know, that was an algorithmic stablecoin. That was getting pretty widespread adoption relative to what the tech could do. It was a huge change to years, living in Egypt and learning.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1201,2022-10-09 15:36:05
12976," an adoption relative to what the tech could do. I didn't realize you spent your teenage years living in Egypt and learning Arabic. Tell me about your upbringing. I was always uprooted. My dad worked for a large company and we were always moving just when I would get comfortable in one space. And I think actually that's pretty important if you fast-forward and look at my career. I'm comfortable being in uncomfortable situations. I didn't know a lot about venture when I got into it initially. I didn't know a lot about crypto when I got into it initially. And I was okay asking questions. I was okay not knowing the local acronyms or the Namanclature of a particular field. And I'm taken right back to my teenage years in Cairo moving from Houston, Texas one day to downtown Maddie in Cairo the next day. You studied law? I did. You clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. That's right. You became a federal prosecutor. You were taking on prison gangs and the mafia. That must have taken a really thick skin. I was doing it at 8 to 25. And now if I kind of take a step back and you know I think that happens at different points in your career. Like, whoa, if I would have analyzed that a little more at the time. And I'm kind of in some ways glad I didn't. I just dove right in. Because I found it fascinating. There was a human aspect to it. And I found out that there were other stories. And I felt like those stories mattered. So I was drawn to criminal law and became a federal prosecutor. And I did cases involving violent crime. But then really mistriing cases. Being back in the courtroom. Being before the grand jury. Like the prosecutor you would see on TV going to try those murder cases. Doing those two hour closing arguments. That's right. And so moved out here to California. I died at the largest prison gang in the world at the time. And I was a hostage taking bank robberies, armed bank robberies. There was really not a kind of criminal case by that point in my career. I hadn't done it. It was right around that time. 2012. One of my bosses came in and said, let's have that same energy. That you brought to those gang cases, to those murder cases. And let's go ahead and have you investigate this new criminal technology. That we really need to look into and possibly shut this down. So you created the first cryptocurrency task force. How would you describe it? Fortunately, several of us in the government realized at the time. It's not possible. Also not desirable. Because Bitcoin is not an entity. It's not a person. Right. It's a protocol. And it would be like saying, let's go shut down cash. Let's go shut down the internet. It's not possible. Probably wouldn't be a good idea either. I was using crypto and technologies like the Bitcoin blockchain. Because that's all it existed then. This is 2012, 2013 to actually uncover criminal activity. So I didn't think that that technology was bad. Frankly, it was a tool that helped me uncover the various activity. And by the way, it was a step level function improvement better than compliance by banks. I'll just go ahead and say it. That's a little bit controversial. But I had spent a decade subpoenaing large financial institutions. And five times out of ten didn't get back what I needed. One case I worked on and people always say, oh, you shut down the Silk Road. What actually happened? I was looking into something completely, not having to do with anything at all of the Silk Road, and came across some, what looked to be some kind of odd activity. And it turns out that a couple of federal agents on the Silk Road Task Force out of Washington, D.C. were cropped. And that is the case that I ended up in Diting and I ended up prosecuting those agents. And they both went to prison. So that's the aspect of what the Silk Road case that I worked on. I would never, never have been able to uncover that criminal activity by those agents. Because they were federal agents, they knew how to cover their tracks. Had they not used Bitcoin blockchain. So that technology right there, if they had just used wires or cash or bank wires, we would never have uncovered that. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund in front of scratch? You will shed light on dark matter. You will make aging optional. You will turn 5G up to 11. Because we're...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1202,2022-10-09 15:40:11
12977," No. You will turn 5G up to 11. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge, and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer, disrupt. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. So what's the best investment advice you've ever put in? You haven't found anybody. Compound interest. The compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance, and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day. And if you keep at it and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's not just interest. It was always said about compound interest returns. Compound business returns. Compound human returns. They're all very additive because you'll learn every day. And if you keep at it, it's very, very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make? Selling it the wrong time. And they sell when the prices go down? Yes. Or, yes. Not keeping. But people have conviction for the investors, if they invest for the right reasons, just keep at it. So you became kind of a crypto convert after this. You joined the board of Coinbase. That's right. Very early on. How did you and Coinbase and Brian Armstrong come together? I hosted an event here in San Francisco at the Federal Reserve Bank. And I believe it was there that it wasn't just Brian. It was a lot of what I'll call legitimate actors and crypto who wanted to usher in this new wave, this new ecosystem. And then we brought together the heads of all kinds of agencies. Really in an effort to kind of talk about building bridges. The government and the crypto industry, we're never going to see eye to eye on a lot of things, but we did think there were some commonalities. Coinbase is a company that has suffered. They've been losing share. The valuation of the public markets has plummeted. Why do you think that is? And how do you think it can be fixed? Yeah. Well, I think again, a few things it's tied to. And a large aspect of Coinbase's business now, of course, is trading revenue. And that's down when prices are down. And the company's been very transparent about that long before going public. I mean, also, if you look at its S1, it specifically identifies that. And just how volatile crypto cycles are. So I think that's part of it. It's judged by public markets as a technology stock or as a financial services company. By the way, I think it's both. I think it's not just a financial services company. I think it's so much more. I think it's really a portal to this whole new ecosystem. You were also on the board of OpenC, until recently, there's an insider trading situation or accusation going on there. Coinbase has also had employees accused of insider trading. How much is this happening within crypto companies and within the industry and how big a problem is? Yeah. I think crypto is under the microscope. So where you have a case, two cases, three cases in crypto ecosystem, which now is a trillion dollar industry. I think multi-billion approaching trillion dollar industry, you're always going to be able to find examples like that. So I don't want to make too much out of a handful of cases. That said, the company, Coinbase, OpenC, take these things incredibly seriously. Along with your position at Coinbase, you became a partner at one of the most story venture capital for insular convales in the United States. That is Andrewson Horowitz. What was your experience at A16Z? Here I met Chris Dixon and I met Ben Horowitz and I met Mark Andreessen and I had worked with them for just about a year, maybe a little bit over when they asked me to come and co-run their crypto funds at Andreessen Horowitz. Again, I jumped at that chance and I think really that speaks to the fact that, as I've said before, things are a hell yes or there are no and it was a hell yes for me. So Andreessen Horowitz is the kind of place where if you make a partner, you don't leave. Yeah. How did Mark and Ben respond when you said? Yeah. I want to leave to start a crypto fund of my own. As you might know, Emily, they're an anchor. They're an anchor check into my fund and I'm very grateful for that. Mark and Chris and folks like them are also personal LPs. I felt very supported when I shared that decision and I will say that it was not...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1203,2022-10-09 15:44:18
12978," Chris and folks like them are also personal LPs. So I felt very supported when I shared that decision. And I will say that it was not running away from Andrewson Hearts, it was running to another opportunity. And you know, crypto is not, what do they say? It's not a spectator sport. It's like you're in it, it's very young, it's 24-7, it's global, and it's hustle. And at this, and that's a trade-off, it's a life trade-off. And at this point in my career and in my life, if I was going to continue to make that trade-off, I just wanted to do it and do it in a way that was really true to me. So you struck out on your own? Yes. To launch on ventures. What gave you the courage to do that? What was the spark that lit the fire? Yeah. That got you to say, I need to do this and do this now. Sure. What I set out to do was to continue to invest in this ecosystem that I think is so broad that decision was very purposeful and the timing was very purposeful. We have an early stage fund that does seed stage, series A, even series B, and then we have what we call an acceleration fund, which is, it's not a growth fund, it's a crypto-growth fund. And I think those are different things. But it's later stage. It might be crypto-publics. Certain kinds of public tokens were set up to hold tokens to participate in the token ecosystem. Or later stage companies. I mean, there are now several crypto, many crypto unicorns. Space has become really competitive. Even though you say, you know, crypto's had its kind of ups and downs, the thing is, a lot of people in some of those last cycles have seen the kind of venture style returns that can be had in crypto. And so you've had a lot of new funds enter the space. And that's driven up competition. So what differentiates on ventures then? From all of these other crypto funds, or even more traditional venture capitalists, like entries in Harowitz or Sequoia, they also have crypto funds now. Well, I think a lot of traditional venture capital funds now have crypto funds. It used to just be like a regulatory designation. It was like, are you an RIA, which is registered investment advisor? I would say for crypto founders today, it's not enough to just be an RIA, right? They, frankly, I don't even know if a lot of them care. That's a regulatory designation. What crypto founders today want to know is, do you live and breathe crypto? Do you inhale the discourse? Are you part of the community? Do you participate in governance? Are you going to be staking these kind of crypto verbs out there? And if you're not really in this space full time, I think it's very hard to run a successful crypto fund. We don't have a hedge fund component. So we're not sitting here buying and trading and selling. That's a hedge fund structure. And there are crypto hedge funds. We're not one. We're making seven to 10 year bets. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund from scratch? You know, it's hard, but it's not impossible. We don't have a crystal ball. I don't know. I can't predict cycles, but I knew that we were in a cycle where you saw so much for an excitement around the space. And I already talked about what makes this different. But I think one thing also is we are a nimble strike force. We don't fish in the same pond. We have the crypto natives. We have a fish and execution. We have operators, seasoned operators, who really know how to stick the landing. And I think that's reflected in our culture. I would say the only thing that's changed in our strategy as a result of the market correction is really more of a focus on early stage. But we still have our late stage fund. And when we see valuations, which I think will still see correct, spoiler. I think we'll continue to see some corrections. And so we might deploy our later stage fund a little bit more slowly. It might not be on an even 50-50 cadence. And that's OK. Long-term, our strategy hasn't changed. Long-term, we're committed to this space. How much do you think valuations are going to correct? It's just, I can't give you a one-size-fits-all answer, because crypto is not a monolith. You have some crypto companies that really follow more of an enterprise-sass business model. You have others that are layer one protocols. You have still others that are consumer-facing applications. And I think one of the things we're seeing right now is the infrastructure layer. And that's where we're spending a lot of our time, by the way. And we think more and more use cases will come about when the infrastructure layers in place. So my own view is we are not rushing to deploy. We're certainly not getting caught up. We're going to get VC FOMO and have you not avoid that. You know, look, I think it's very easy to get into that mindset. It's because it's a competitive sport. It's a competitive sport.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1204,2022-10-09 15:48:56
12979," I try not to avoid that. You know, look, I think it's very easy to get into that mindset, right? It's because it's a competitive sport. It's a competitive space. And I think I'd be lying if I said that that doesn't influence anyone. I try to, what I do, and I think I do differently, is I try to take stock of that. Oh, that's the faux-momentality kicking in. That's bad. Again, you don't want to over-crackth, though. What we look for is we look for amazing founders. It doesn't matter if I think valuations will correct if they're amazing founders. There's a huge tam. We also look for what's your regulatory plan. If you're launching a token, what's your plan to comply with the law? What's your plan for security, by the way? We've seen a lot of hacks in the space. We want to really dive in there and make sure that the founders have been thoughtful about, especially if they're custodian customer funds, keeping those funds secure. If it's a cross-chain bridge, what are the exploits? Have you changed your strategy at all, given the downturn? What? We don't have any deals or decided not to do certain deals. Because the conditions have changed, don't you raise the phone? We have decided not to do certain deals. We've never backed out of a deal. We have decided not to do a few deals. Because? Because we think that pricing was ahead of progress, candidly. We might have been wrong about that, Emily. We might have been wrong about that. But I think if we were wrong not to do a couple of deals, better that we might have been right. Because if we were wrong about that, I think we can find a way to still invest in those projects later. Well, one thing I'm hearing is that a lot of dry powder has just sifted up. Because all these funds raised a lot of money raised. What was the biggest fund ever for a single person, not just a woman? Anyone? Are you confident you're going to have a place to put all that money on? I am, but if I don't have a place to put it, I'm not just going to go willingly deploy it. One of the things that we told our LPs even during that period when we raised our fund, which was when crypto was undeniably still on a bull run, we said that we are going to be pretty steadfast sticking to a two-year deployment cycle. And I think one thing that's changed is that might have lengthened. It certainly hasn't shortened. But we will, again, we feel very good that we have the capital to back great teams when we see them. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind. I mean, we're falling behind.

We are going to increasingly live in a digital world. And I happen to think that if you live in a digital world, you're going to want to own digital goods in that world. You're not just going to be satisfied to rent them, which is what we do now. We buy our content from walled gardens without digital scarcity, which is what NFTs unlock. You don't really own anything. You're subject to the whims of a platform. And I think NFTs and digitally scarce goods fundamentally change that. I think you'll see NFTs back again. But we are spending a lot of time in the infrastructure layer. Like I tell you, zero knowledge, technology, scalability. We think of that as like the plumbing. If you think of the fiber-hubtic cables. Remember, you couldn't have had YouTube and-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1205,2022-10-09 15:52:56
12980," or like I tell you zero knowledge, technology, scalability, we think of that as like the plumbing, if you think of the fiber optic cables. Remember you couldn't have had YouTube and Netflix with dial up. You couldn't have streamed content. The same is true of crypto use cases. We think that there will be a lot of new use cases unlocked when the infrastructure is there, when it's more efficient, when it's more user friendly. And so we're spending a lot of our time there. We show executive order, there are a number of ports that are coming do. What do you want to see from the administration when it comes to regulation? Are you optimistic that we will get there? Yeah. We were so delighted to see that executive order. It's not something you should normally be delighted about. But why we were is because it was to us a real recognition that this is a US government saying this field isn't going anywhere. This field is growing. It's growing so much that we are going to direct every single agency in the federal government to come up with a plan here. I think we take a step forward, but then you see we're a big government. We're a big system. We have states. We have local entities. So we take a step forward with the EO. And then we take some steps back sometimes too. And I think what I see as crypto founders are confused by that. They're starting to think, well, I could go to this jurisdiction where there's a single regulator. And you don't have 50 states with different rules. It's the US government that needs to start taking stock of the fact that right now, Emily in China, there's a quarter of a billion, ECNY wallets, a quarter of a billion. We're still talking about whether there should be a government central bank digital currency. We're still studying that. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind China. And we're falling behind. What are the dangers of falling behind China and the rest of the world? This is years ahead. So I don't want people to take a headline and say, oh, I think the US dollar will be no longer the global currency, reserve global currency. I'm not saying that now. But fast forward decades. And if you no longer need to use the dollar because you have an alternative, I think that's a real problem. What would we use instead? Well, I think that there are going to be stable coins out there that people who have access to a smartphone will use. There is a demand for it. We see 285% year of your growth with stable coins. So people are clearly liking the idea of this. Now, again, there have been some spectacular failures too, but not all stable coins are created the same. But I think the important thing is that we really do need to not just quash innovation. What do you think of how Gary Gensler, the chair of the SEC, and how he's approaching it? One of the things that I hear from founders is that they're very confused because they get told, come in, register. Just come in and talk to us. But you have the one company who's done the ultimate act of going in and registering Coinbase, File the S1. And still, there's a lot of saber rattling still going on, I think. And again, I don't want to single out the SEC. And I don't want to suggest that anything they're doing is bad. I do think that right now there's a lot of confusion. And one of the pieces of confusion stems from the fact that, and it started with the ICO, Mania back in 2016, 2017, I can't even remember which year now, where the SEC was very loud about securities. A lot of them were securities, but the space has changed. And so to still view it through the ICO lens when so much has happened over the last five years in the space, I think is a mistake. What do you have to say to the skeptics out there who just don't believe in the future of Web3? And don't see where this is going. Yeah, I would say don't judge the current state of innovation by the end state of innovation. I hear from a lot of these skeptics. And by the way, I'm friends with a lot of these skeptics too. I don't only want to live in a crypto bubble. They want to see the use cases, especially if they're not technical. Well, when am I going to use it? What will I use it for? And I think one of the things that's not appreciated is how quickly the infrastructure here is catching up. And once you have kind of a, once you have really scalable blockchains that can handle a lot of thorough put and are very efficient, I think that unlocks a whole lot of use cases. People are spending more time on screens. That curve is up and to the right. Whether we like it or not, that is the future. I mean, those who have kids know that kids spend more time online. They want digital things too. And I think to dismiss it, it is a bit generation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1206,2022-10-09 15:57:31
12981," Like it or not, that is the future. I mean, those who have kids know that kids spend more time online. They want digital things too. And I think to dismiss it, it is a bit generational. I do find not always, but it is a bit generational. If you talk to kids about being able to have money online, they instantly get that concept. They're comfortable not having to hold something in their hand to think it has value. Take us to the end state. Do Google and Amazon and Facebook and Apple still exist? I believe they will still exist. I mean, it depends what you talk about when you talk about the end state. I mean, I think that, you know, I think for decades, those companies will still be around. But the important thing is I think this new ecosystem is going to represent a challenge to them. I do think that those entities, decentralized forces are coming and will cut into those entities, profits and revenues. So we have a little rapid fire section.

12982," The markets come down in Europe from the financial centers of the world. Bloomberg markets European flows with Guy Johnson in London and Alex Diel in New York. Real-time numbers, real-time analysis. Weekdays. The markets are preparing to close but the day is not over yet. It's talked it is now up about 45% A lot of volatility right now. You need the power of the Bloomberg terminal to get you market moving data before anyone else. There's numbers much higher than expected. Upgraded today to overweight. You need top analysts to bring you exclusive global insight into cross-asset markets. The mini-bond market. Kind of is a really big focus. Bitcoin ain't fighting along today. It's going to be a short term. Bloomberg markets the close weekdays on Bloomberg. As fall sets in, a decided turn in the air for the new British government's designs for the economy, for Elon Musk designs on Twitter, and most decidedly for Mr. Putin's designs on Ukraine. This is Bloomberg Wall Street week. I'm David Weston. This week's Special Contributor Larry Summers on whether the jobs market is starting to show some signs of loosening. I think we are headed for a collision of some kind or other and we just got to manage that collision carefully. And Brad DeLong of Berkeley on what the broad sweep of economic history may be telling us about where we are headed next. People say that the United States has very little to teach them that we don't have any greater grasp on how to deploy and use these technologies to create a good society. We had our fair share of about faces this week, with the Bank of England's quick intervention to save the guilt market, as explained by former MPC member Kristen Forbes of MIT. Seems that they are worried that because of the big market moves, there could be some margin calls, some pressures for foreselling that could cause the guilt market to freeze up. And British Prime Minister Liz Truss giving up at least part of her economic program. It was becoming a distraction, so that's why we immediately changed that policy and that's the kind of government we are. But as ugly as the situation was in UK markets, it was nothing compared with the setbacks for Russian forces in eastern and southern Ukraine, with President Putin's efforts to quote Annex territory that his forces didn't even control, which Admiral John Kirby at the NSC looks at as an indication that Mr. Putin just may be coming to understand how difficult his situation really is. The Annexation Announcements, as well as his announcement of partial mobilization, certainly shows the degree to which Mr. Putin knows how much he's struggling inside Ukraine. And OPEC plus weighed in with its own changes. Cutting production caps by 2 million barrels a day or about 7 percent, putting even more pressure on Europe and the rest of the world already worried about energy. Well, we were disappointed that OPEC made this decision. As the President mentioned, we think it's unnecessary if you look at the global environment where supply continues to be the predominant challenge. Then there's Elon Musk. He offered $44 billion for Twitter back in April, then decided to renegade, got sued, and on the eve of his deposition, returned to his original offer. Even it looks like he's going to be way overpaying. In many ways, this is almost the most expected outcome of all, which is settling on the eve of trial just before deposition of the main players, Elon Musk himself. He doesn't want to be deposed. He has, you know, probably some embarrassing text messages and conflicting statements, and all of that would make for a very unpleasant deposition. But after all the back and forth this week, US jobs numbers actually came in surprisingly on course, adding 263,000 new jobs just slightly more than expected with workers paid 5 percent more than they were last year. And a reduction in the unemployment rate to 3.5 percent, which made for a rough day in equities on Friday, but actually a pretty good week overall for equities, and the P500 adding 1.5 percent to end the week at 3639, and the NASDAQ, eaked out a gain of 3.4 percent. Bonds also had a topsy-turvy week, but ended up with the 10-year yield of a relatively modest five basis points to 3.88. Here to walk us through this week, and what got us here, our Aaron Brown, portfolio manager at PIMCO, and the PIMCO, and the PIMCO, and the PIMCO,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1208,2022-10-09 16:06:00
12983," 10-year yield of a relatively modest five basis points to 3.88. Here to walk us through this week and what got us here are Aaron Brown, portfolio manager at PIMCO and Chris Ellman, chief investment officer at CalSTRS. So Chris let me start with you. Boy, given what we're seeing right now, are we looking at a long cold winter would you say? Unfortunately David, I think we are. I think the Fed, you know, with these employment numbers, the Fed knows that they have to continue this pace of aggressive tightening and they're going to do so the next meeting and the next meeting after that and I think which is the street is pricing in but I think after that they're going to have to keep it up and that's going to be into the winter and it's going to be a tough time. So what do you say Aaron, is it going to be a rough winter? I think it is going to be a rough winter. I think that there are bands of uncertainty are quite wide for next year. The Fed is tightening into an economic slowdown and we haven't even seen the real impact of that slowdown yet. We're just starting to see signs of a gradual slowing but likely we'll continue to see that into next year and we think that we're heading into a recession into early 2023 and at that same point, just given the level of inflation, the Federal Reserve is now really challenged to be able to arrest that inflation, get it under control despite what happens to the economy. So I think that really poses a challenge for the Fed and we'll likely see something that's fairly unprecedented which is continued financial conditions tightening and Fed tightening into an economic slowdown even if it really leads to a harder landing than what the Fed's anticipating. And Aaron, I push back a little bit. I actually think we're in a recession right now. It's not a very strong one and it doesn't hurt a lot. Obviously with employment growing, you know, but we did have a negative GDP in the second quarter, third quarter is mild. To me, anything below 1% in the USA feels like a recession. But so what you're saying is, you think it's going to be a really, we'll actually have a good traditional hard negative recession with rising unemployment, which is exactly what Powell has said. I mean, that's his forecast. Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, my our view at PIMCO is that we'll likely see unemployment rise to about 5% by the end of 2023. And so right now, we're sort of seeing some of those early signs, but we really haven't seen the full brunt of financial condition tightening yet. That's more to come. So we are going to continue to see a slowdown. And I think that's really going to hit in the first quarter of next year and into the second quarter of 2023. Chris, given where we're at with inflation right now, the concerns about inflation, if we are heading an intersection or even are already in one, no matter how long it is or how short it is, what are the tools the Fed has to use? Because typically you turn to the Fed and say, okay, start cutting interest rates. Doesn't one thing they're going to do that in a likelihood? No, they're going to raise interest rates. They only have one tool. They have, well, they have their mouth. They can jawbone the market, which is what they're doing. They have the dot plot, which is going to indicate or direct the market. But the really, the only tool they have is short term interest rates and the Fed funds rate. And that's what they're using aggressively. I mean, good grief. 75 basis points. Those are big bounces. You know through history, you've got to go way back before you have that aggressive tightening of monetary policy. And they have to shrink the balance sheet. So as they move through that, you know, he's already said he's going to hurt employment. Yet we have stronger numbers. I think the numbers, there's something strange in the numbers this week, just like last month, but we'll see how that balances out. We're going to have a tougher time. And, you know, I think the question is going to be about corporate earnings. You got CPI next week, and then you got the bank starting to roll out with their earnings. Aaron, has the market priced in the diminishment of earnings at this point, corporate earnings? No, I don't think that they have. What you've seen since the beginning of the year is equities have de-graded, largely driven by the market multiple. So you've seen the market multiple for the S&P 500, de-rade from about 21 and a half times to about 16 times today. Keep in mind that traditionally in recessions, the market multiple is somewhere between 14 and 16 times. So we're just at the upper end of where we typically are in recessions. And we think that you could see a little bit more de-raiding from there. That's not really the challenge for the market. The challenge for the market is that when you look at corporate earnings for next year, the market's pricing...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1209,2022-10-09 16:10:21
12984," think that you could see a little bit more derating from there, that's not really the challenge for the market. The challenge for the market is that when you look at corporate earnings for next year, the markets pricing them to be up 7.5% for consensus. Our forward-looking models are expecting them to be down about 9%. So that's north of a 15% differential versus what the market's pricing for next year and what we think it's likely to be. Also, historically, during recessions earnings fall about 27% on average. So there's real downside risks to our forecast and certainly to the markets forecast. And I think that's where you're going to see the real pressure point for the market in early next year. What's driving that is margins. We're at record high margins right now. The street is expecting that margins are going to expand further from here. So we even hire them and hit new record highs. We've never seen that in a recession before. So I think the markets really mispriced and that's where the pain's going to come from. Aaron, I've got to ask you if we're already down 23% so far this year. How much lower do you think we can go? Do you see a support level on the S&P? I think that in a moderate recession, the market probably bottoms out about 30 to 50. There is downside risk if we see further a more severe or harder landing from there. But 30 to 50 is still down about 14 to 15%. So I do think that there's still room for the market to fall further. Where are you looking at in terms of your estimates? Yeah, no, I agree 30 to 50. But I mean, that's a negative 36 on the year, which is you're like me. We have asset allocation portfolios. Where do you hide in that kind of a negative market? You've got bonds with the rates rising. So you're going to have continued negative returns out of bonds and then a negative 30 out of stocks. That's a rough calendar year. Where do you hide? Well, I think there have been actually market opportunities that have arisen since the start of this year. Cash rate right now, two-year bonds are yielding north of 4%. Now, that's not a sexy return by any sort of stretch of the imagination. But if you can lock in 4%, add a little bit of spread on top of that. And IG corporates that give you an additional 2% or so. That's about a 6% return over the next couple of years. That's high quality paper that you can invest in. So I wouldn't rule cash out as an option. I think that that's somewhere where you can hide and really not expect that much volatility and really consistent returns. And hide out there until we see the markets bottom and you can start incrementally moving back into risk. But I think you need to keep in mind as an investor that if the core of your allocation of your portfolio, which is cash and core fixed income, is unstable, then you really can invest in the outer ring assets. So we really have to stabilize rates in order to move out the risk curve into other asset classes. Right now, cash is a pretty good option. Okay, we're going to pick up exactly that question. Where do you hide in this environment? Chris Aylman and Aaron Brown will be staying with us. We're going to ask for them for some investment advice we could use it, that's for sure. That's next on Wall Street Week here on Bloomberg. Imagine simply climbing a cable into space. The concept is known as the space elevator. But only could it significantly change how we leave planet earth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1210,2022-10-09 16:14:23
12985," The concept is known as the space elevator. Not only could it significantly change how we leave planet Earth, but it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space. And there are scientists who think and could have already built it. We have the material, we have the technology, we have the lasers, we have the climbers, we have all of it. If a private entity wants to build it or a government, they could build it. It will change society. We have no clue how colonizing in the space, how really spreading on the space, really change our society over the next 50 to 200 years. It will be completely different. The facts on unemployment seem clear enough, or at least as clear as that changing social definition ever can be, the situation is getting a little better, but not much. The government announced today that the overall unemployment rate last month was 6.9%. The official unemployment rate has been stuck within a tenth of 7% for 6 months, and that scarcely represents the massive reduction of unemployment, that at least some folks thought they heard Jimmy Carter promise a year ago. That was Louis Archie's round Wall Street week back in October of 1977, when the unemployment rate was twice what it is today, and we were trying to get it down rather than focusing on inflation, whatever that ends up meaning for employment. If that seems like a galaxy far, far away, well maybe that's no accident. The top movie this week back in 1977 was Star Wars, and the top song on the charts was, you got it, the Star Wars theme. Still with us, our Aaron Brown at Pymco, in Chris ailment of Calcester. Aaron, let me turn to you and pick up on where we were talking just now with Chris, but where you hide, if you're really an asset allocator, you said cash is one alternative. Are there things that involve at least some risks that you go to, and how much it depends on what you think the recovery is going to look like whenever it comes? I'm going to flip that sort of question and answer the second question first, which is unlike prior recessions that we've seen in very recent history, so think of the global financial crisis or even the pandemic of 2020, I don't think this is going to be a V-shaped recovery. I think this is going to be more of a prolonged sort of stalling of the economy and more of an L-shaped recovery than what we've seen in the past. The reason for that is because inflation is high and it's likely to persist at high levels, you're not going to come in and see the Fed start cutting as the unemployment rises, like we've seen in the past. Instead, because the Fed has moved from a dual mandate Fed to a single mandate Fed, really just focus on getting the inflation rate down, you'll likely see, you won't see this sort of immediate relief that we've seen in recent history. So, we've changed a little bit the landscape of how you think about investing. Historically, as we start to get closer to what we expect the bottom level of the S&P 500 to be, we start to scale risk back up, start to move back into equity investments to catch that recovery to the upside. And this time around, I think you have to be a little bit more patient. So, instead, what we're really looking at is fixing come investments that we think are going to be able to sort of stand at the test of time, to be able to sort of hide out in a safe haven assets. So, beyond just looking at cash, we're looking at high quality investment-grade corporates, we're looking at municipalities, municipal bonds, particularly for those who are, can take advantage of the tax advantages, tax-advantaged bonds. We think offer good value there at a sort of after-tax yield of 6.5%. In addition, we also like some mortgage agency bonds, and structured credit bonds as well, and then sort of high quality equities that are defensive equities, high free cash flow.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1211,2022-10-09 16:18:51
12986," Sort of high quality equities that are defensive equities, high free cash flow, dividend growth, strong balance sheets. We also think do do well in this environment, but you know it is a sort of challenging time for investors where you have to skew more towards fixed income in order to have stability of return as opposed to looking for a quick snapback in equities. But you know I pose a question to Chris because I know he also manages a diversified portfolio. Chris where are you looking at what type of sort of diversification that are you looking at in in order to sort of hide out over the next couple of quarters. Well Aaron you know the I've got the benefit of being able to go into private security so I've got a good size real estate portfolio. We have a large private equity portfolio sure it's going to have write downs but its value is a bit more stable than we see in the public markets. We have a cash position but the problem is for us cash is not outperforming inflation so the old adage cash is trash is still true. We do like a private credit you were kind of hitting on that that you know variable rate that short term debt with high quality and I think collateral is going to be key because as you said we're going to have a long rough winter so you don't want to be loaning money to everybody you have to do care about governance but it is tough in this environment. I mean you know if the economy is slowing and inflation is still strong that's stagflation and you look back in the 70s I got to say I love that suit that that Lou had I don't know where you get that back in the 70s but I'm stunned by it but you know you look back in that time period returns in 77 were terrible there were hard places to it was just a very tough time to hide anywhere. Yeah so I'm curious though exactly about when you go into fixed income and you think the price is attractive now in some fixed income Chris. Well I agree with Aaron I'm going to go short I'm not going to go long fixed income and take duration exposure short term credits I mean you've been hold a credit for two to three years and then it's money good and as she said you're going to put it in a spread product so you pick up a couple of basis points by being in a corporate you're okay. There's still a lot of money David international money that wants to come into this market non-US rather that wants to come into the market you saw it in the this week where suddenly comes rushing in so I would give the advice to the average investors you've got a slowly average cost in you're not going to be able to call the bottom as much as Aaron I think there's a support number it may not hit that at all and the market's going to just bounce along and and Aaron's example of an L an L goes on forever it's just flat I hope we don't have to live in a flat recession for years and years but I think this is going to be a tough market to find any kind of growth opportunities so you want to protection and a return of your money rather than a return on your money. Aaron one of their big develop this week was OPEC Plus and what they did it certainly seemed to stun the white hats at the time what does that tell us about geopolitical risk generally and specifically energy and it looks like oil prices are going to stay up there for a while. I think that's one of the things that the market's really mispricing right now if you look at the forward curve for oil the risk is really in this sort of very short term where the market expects that oil is going to be elevated for the short term but it really hasn't extrapolated or extended that expectation out the next one to two years and I think that there's real value in sort of the back end of the curve for oil because I think that these oil challenges are going to persist much longer than what the market's anticipating. One of the reasons for that is first we saw out of oil OPEC Plus this week their intention to keep prices elevated but I think the other challenges is that we really haven't invested here in the U.S. or on a global basis on energy infrastructure so that capacity is really constrained over the next couple of years even if we wanted to expand capacity or oil producers wanted to expand capacity they don't have the ability to do so in the immediate term and that's going to keep oil prices elevated so the risk for oil then the risk for the energy complex broadly isn't just this winter but it's next winter as well and next winter's challenges are going to be even more difficult particularly on the shores of Europe then what we're experiencing this winter and so that's what I think the challenge is and you know why",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1212,2022-10-09 16:23:18
12987," challenges are going to be even more difficult, particularly on the shores of Europe, than what we're experiencing this winter. And so that's what I think the challenge is, and why I think this is something that's going to persist much longer than what the markets currently priced in. And David, it's running into the challenge of climate change. You know, I'm looking at decades, not a short-term trade in carbon. And I'm glad that we're having a constraint on the ability to expand hydrocarbons and burning carbon. But you're right, people want heat, and Europe heats itself, whether we like it or not, it doesn't need itself a solar and wind. It's got to do it through fossil fuels. And that's matching and running into a desire to reduce these fossil fuels. And I agree with Aaron, I'm hearing the same thing that Europe has enough oil and natural gas for this year in their supplies. But if it's a really cold winter, they're very worried about next year. So you're going to have climate change crashing into this challenge of OPEC and inflation and energy prices, certainly over the next couple of years. Europe has a lot of challenges, Aaron, right now. Not just energy, it goes beyond that. Does that make the U.S. relative the most attractive place to be for you? I don't know if it's the most attractive place, but it's one of the more attractive places, particularly these of Europe. And the challenge that Europe has is that they're starting from a lower productivity, a lower and weaker growth rate to start out. They also didn't fully recover in the same way that the U.S. did post-COVID. And they now have wider fiscal deficits. They're going to have to spend more money in order to insulate their economy from a harder hit because of energy. And that's going to create real challenges at the same time where the economy's rapidly slowing. And so our view is that while the U.S. is going into recession, the recession in Europe is going to hit harder and is likely to be more prolonged. Thank you so much to Aaron Brown and Chris Haleman.

China stocks reopening is the big story in Asia this week. Exchanges on the mainland, they've been shut for the past five straight sessions to mark the golden week holiday. So we could see a pop at the open given the moves that we saw in Chinese assets in offshore markets.

12988," We open, given the moves that we saw in Chinese assets in offshore markets. And that would be of course welcome news for officials in Beijing because President Xi Jinping is just days away from securing a third-termist communist party leader. That's at the 20th party Congress starting October 16th. Otherwise, travel restrictions or the easing of those is the major theme as well. Japan will further loosen controls from Tuesday and Taiwan from Thursday. For Europe next week there's a big risk lingering in the markets and that's the end of the B.O.E. short-term program to backstop bond markets. They of course announce that they would be purchasing long-dated bonds after concerns that a huge spike up in yields in the long end of the curve meant that there would be danger for pension funds. So the B.O.E. has been doing this buying program. It's set to end on Friday on October 14th. There could be jitters in this market. What it means to no longer have a B.O.E. backstopping a political story really of the UK government which has been doing various U-turns so all of that will be in focus this week. All eyes next week will be on the latest batches of U.S. inflation data. Produced surprises will be released on Wednesday with the headline figure projected to have fallen year over year for a third straight month. Meanwhile the consumer price index release on Thursday is once again expected to show conflicting signals with a deceleration in the headline number from a year ago but the core measure of CPI which strips out food and energy is forecast to reaccelerate its pace of growth rather than fall. Investors also will parse the release of the minutes from the Fed September meeting and whether there was any serious discussion about slowing or even halting the tightening of monetary policy. And earning season is finally here. The latest round of quarterly reports kicks off with Pepsi, JP Morgan, City Group, Morgan Stanley, Delta Airlines and United Health among the Notables. David? Coming up we'll wrap up the week with our special contributor Larry Somersal Harvard that's going up next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. We'll see you in the market that over the past few weeks has made it clear it wants to go higher. It got a little spooked by the idea that geopolitical potential rises. We make it very transparent to the shopper before they accept an order. What's the order is going to look like? How much work on the pace and how much the consumer is paying them. And so they can decide whether they take an order or whether they refuse it. And that's the kind of flexibility that our shoppers really value and the kind of transparency that they want. Are you seeing a labor shortage right now? And what are you doing to combat that? It's different in different places or demographic of shoppers is completely different from food delivery and right sharing where 70% women and half of them are moms. And that's because a lot of the job at Instacart is very different than just being in a car with strangers. It's about like going to the store, doing a good job of customer service of really picking the right products for the consumer. And we are seeing that being very appealing to women.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1214,2022-10-09 16:31:47
12989," MUSIC Innovation, money and power collide in Silicon Valley and beyond. Bloomberg Technology with Emily Chan. Weekdays at 5 p.m. in New York and 2 p.m. in San Francisco. MUSIC MUSIC This is Wall Street Week. I'm David West. And every week we turn to Larry Summers of Harvard, our very special contributor here on Wall Street Week, to help us sum up the major events of the week. And once again, we welcome back Larry Summers. So Larry, I think we should start with the jobs numbers out on Friday in the United States. I mean, some say not too hot, not too cold. Some people say, isn't this good? At least it's not getting worse. I guess my real question to you is, I mean, I can be getting worse, but is there a danger just in the inflation where many word is? We have 5% year-over-year increase in wages. I think these numbers were about what we expected. And the sensible judgment was that we've got an inflation problem. Core inflation figures look artificially good. They're better than median inflation. And yet core inflation ran at a 7% rate last month. And that was more than for the quarter. And the quarter was more than for the half year. And the half year was more than for the whole year. So we're not in a controlled place with respect to inflation. And there wasn't really anything in this report to suggest that we were coming into a controlled place. The monthly wage number was relatively favorable. But it was pretty clearly distorted by the fact that you had a lot more workers coming in in leisure and hospitality. And those are low wage workers. The workers where wages are most flexible are going up more rapidly. So I don't think this is a number that changed the picture that we've got an economy that is too strong to be an economy where inflation is going up more rapidly. And so the lower inflation is going down. But that is maintaining its robustness. But I think we are headed for a collision of some kind or other. And we've just got to manage that collision carefully. And I think the sooner we start managing for some slow down, the better we're going to do. I think German Powell was way late to come to that recognition. Now has that recognition and he should be supported in that. So what do you think, Chair Powell, and the Federal Reserve will make of these numbers? How will it affect what they do in early November? I don't think these numbers are going to change what the Fed does. You know, you never know what's going to happen. And certainly there's risk of some kind of financially traumatic event. But I think the chances of something that is large enough to divert the Fed are really quite low. So I'd be expecting that the market, which is anticipating 75 basis points in November and is anticipating 50 more in December, that would correspond to my best guess at this moment as well. I think that kind of thing is going to be appropriate if we achieve disinflation. Larry, there's another strain of discussion. I've seen certainly this week, in fact, there was even some Fed staff work at the New York Fed suggesting that we better be careful because in fact, the rate that we may need and already get down to 2%, maybe so high, it will cause financial instability. There is a really safety and soundness issue. What do you make of that? Is it possible the Fed will have to choose between financial stability in the one hand and getting inflation down on the other? First, I think that should be the occasion for some sole searching. If we have an economy where we think there's going to be substantial financial breakage, because the Fed lifts the Fed funds rate to 4.5%. Then we have an inadequately supervised financial system and an insufficiently active financial regulator. If anyone believes that...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1215,2022-10-09 16:36:12
12990," active financial regulator. And so if anyone believes that, along with whatever monetary policy implication they draw, they better tell us how they think, how they think we ought to be repairing the regulation of the financial system. David, my sense is that you can never rule out these kinds of risks. But the Fed has more than one instrument. It has instruments for specific, guaranteed lending. We've seen that used a number of times. And each time we're surprised by how much the economy retains its robustness. In retrospect, we cut interest rates too much and kept them too low when we were supporting the financial system after COVID. In retrospect, we kept interest rates too low and blew up a bubble when we were supporting the economy with low interest rates after Asia and LTCM. In retrospect, we were surprised and amazed by how rapidly the economy grew when the Fed did what was necessary after the 1987 stock market crash. So we need to regulate right to preserve financial stability. We need to have a very strong firefighting force in order to respond if and when financial accidents happen. But I think it's a real mistake to suggest that somehow we shouldn't do the monetary policies that are necessary to avoid inflation becoming entrenched. Because of concerns about financial stability. You know, David, the people who are still on team transitory, they're always saying that expectations aren't entrenched. The more it's true that expectations are not yet entrenched, despite high inflation, seems to me the more important it is to move vigorously now with respect to inflation so they don't become entrenched. If they were already entrenched, we could discuss the right timing of a disinflation. But if we have the big advantage in disinflation of expectations that are not yet entrenched, surely we should be acting on inflation while we have that advantage. Larry, another big development this week was the OPEC plus decision to reduce production limits by 2 million barrels a day. Something that I think it's fair to say was set the Biden administration back a bit. He'd gone over there and asked the Crown Prince not to do that. It wasn't very pretty. So apart from perhaps any embarrassment of my cause, does it have larger macroeconomic effects for a globe that we are warned by WTO? No, maybe headed toward a global recession. There's nothing good in this. Certainly it's not what we wanted to see. Actually, it's a lot less than 2 million barrels because many of the countries that reduced their quota weren't hitting their quota before. So the reduction in the ceiling didn't really matter. And you didn't see a hugely dramatic move in oil markets in a way that was proportionate to the headlines that you saw. But certainly the risks are up. And it just points up the importance. And we always do a scramble about the immediate when these things happen. And we don't forget about the medium term. Look, we made a mistake by canceling the Keystone pipeline. We made a mistake by slowing down all kinds of permitting activity. We made a mistake by being hostile as a country to natural gas. We made a mistake in the Congress a few weeks ago when we didn't pass the mansion program of expanding permitting. We crucially...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1216,2022-10-09 16:40:30
12991," A few weeks ago, when we didn't pass the mansion program of expanding permitting, we crucially need regulatory relief where we're not going to get renewables online fast and we're not going to get the transmission lines that are necessary for renewables to become a large part of our energy fast. So the real lesson on this is we need a different kind of energy strategy than the one that we've had. We need a strategy that is balanced rather than an unbalanced strategy of total hostility to fossil fuels. Or God knows the kind of total strategy of favoring fossil fuels that we had, even egregious favoritism towards Saudi Arabia that we saw during the Trump administration. We need to find a balance and I think we're making our way in that direction. Larry is always so helpful to have you on each week and I would like to say Larry summons me staying with us as we bring in Professor Brad DeLong, Professor economics from UC Berkeley and his new book Slouching Toward Utopia. That's an economic history of the 20th century. That's coming up next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. Back in 1997, I was interested in the following question which is there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called sauropod dinosaurs which had really long skinny necks. So a podosaurus is an example. Now it's had really long skinny tails. So I made a computer model that showed that in fact the tail of these sauropod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip, a bullfip. Now the way a bullfip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. Okay. And that crack is a sonic boom. Yeah. I think the way they got a date was to impress the females by making loud booms. Welcome to the world of decentralized finance. Bloomberg's covering all things crypto. But people, the transactions and the technology Bloomberg crypto Tuesdays. This is Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. Our very special contributor Larry Summers of Harvard has stayed with us because we're going to bring in now Professor economics from UC Berkeley. He's Brad DeLong, the author of a new book, Slouching Toward Utopia, an economic history of the 20th century. So Professor, welcome for joining us. It's really good to have you here. I've read this fascinating and really sort of protein book. It's really quite a book. Let's set it up first because it's a history of the 20th century. But you don't necessarily define the 20th century as from 1900 to 2000. You started in 1870 and you end up in 2010. Why? Well, the big thing that happens happens in 1870. Before 1870, the world's poor and there's no prospect for the world being anything other than poor. After 1870, every single generation humanity.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1217,2022-10-09 16:44:42
12992," Evidence, the world's poor, and there's no prospect for the world being anything other than poor. After 1870, every single generation, humanity's technical competence doubles, and then doubles again in the following generation. And such an enormous pace of technological advance raises the possibility for the first time of a world in which we can bake a sufficiently large economic pie for everyone to have enough. And that was nothing that humanity had ever seen before. One of the remarkable things, Brad, that you highlight is that it really wasn't very different to live in the United Kingdom in the 19th century, than it had been to live in the ancient world 2000 years before. Say something about the acceleration of growth that you see is happening in the 20th century. Well, you know, I mean, it was British economist John Stuart Mill, right? He was writing in 1871 about how all the industrial revolution had done was it had created a somewhat larger middle class, and it had allowed manufacturers and the rich to earn greater fortunes, but that the overwhelming mass of humanity was still confined to the same life of drudgery and imprisonment than they had been before, that they had been in before. And before all the way back into deep time, it was very clear by 1900 that things had changed. You know, John Maynard Keynes writing in 1919 looks back and says starting in 1870, we entered economic Eldorado and that now our chief task after World War I was figuring out why we tried to blow it up and try to get desperately back to what was good was going on after 1870. Fortunately, we eventually did and so things rolled through up until our day. First of all, it gives us a sense of what happened in 1870 to brought all this about. There were some three driving forces in your book. Well, you know, everyone has an idea about just what it is that's made us as a civilization so wealthy that makes our economy so productive. And the different people have different things and they all go back some of them back even to say the year 1070 when it turns out that the law applies to a German emperor standing in the snow outside of the castle that allows and his tool, but instead it could be that the law relies to everybody. But you get three things that fall into place in 1870 that set technological progress into a much higher gear than ever before and they are the industrial research lab so that you can rationalize and routinize the discovery and development of technology. And then the corporation as we know it, which rationalizes the development and deployment of technology, you know, to combine that with the globalized economy with the telegraph and the I railroad and the iron hold ocean going steamship. And all of a sudden the incentives to deploy technology worldwide for production are so overwhelming and people turn their minds to how to do this that everything explodes in a way it never had before. Brad, much of the academic discussion of your book has centered on this idea of a pivot point in 1870. But I want to ask about a different judgment you make, which is that there was this major era and that the major era ended in 2010. I would have thought that the world was growing, it was becoming more integrated with technology. There were important political struggles. That was the stuff of history through the 20th century, much better in the second half of the century than in the first half of the century. The end of the Cold War was a very different war than World War One or World War Two. It was cold, but I would have thought that was a continuing process with substantial challenges. And yet you see us as now being in a quite different era. What's different about the era we're in than the era we're in?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1218,2022-10-09 16:49:10
12993," And yet you see us as now being in a quite different era. What's different about the era we're in than the era you wrote the history of other than more of the kind of progress and change that you saw is happening every generation. Well, I'm pleased you disagree here and I'm very pleased you disagree on our story. I had optimist here about our future. Because look, I've been losing arguments in person with you for 42 years, even when I think I'm right afterwards. And here I'm genuinely uncertain and I actually very much hope you are really right this time. My thinking was I've been listening to our friend John Furnald about how the underlying pace of technological progress has more or less halved since 2005 compared to what we were used to beforehand. And saving those years from 1975 to 1990 when technology was crawling toward a more energy efficient and environmentally friendly configuration rather than focusing on labor saving. But after 2000 and after 2000, we seem to have a substantial loss of social and economic knowledge about how to run things things about financial regulation that I thought were entrenched that were known in the bones turned out to have been completely forgotten in 2008. And things about the proper tools for macroeconomic policy that I thought were ingrained in the bone were also forgotten after 2010. And I remember you and I whimpering in 2012 that no for the more expansionary fiscal policy was not then a thing that ran any risks whatsoever. And by that with the fact that from 1870 on to 2010, you know, first you had Britain in the United States and then the United States as the countries that people were looking to for examples as you always Leon Trotsky like to say as the furnace where the future is being forged. But now you go to China, you go to India, we even go to Indonesia and what you find is that people say that the United States has very little to teach them that we don't have any greater grasp on how to deploy and use these technologies to create a good society and are in fact a society that is more trouble. We're more trouble than theirs are Brad, if that is right, how much of it because of a running out of ideas and how much of it is running out of cohesion one of the themes in your book is the sort of polls if I can put it that way between Hayek on the one hand, the market is king and Polonia and the others, the market has to serve people. How much of the problems we're in right now are because we're lacking cohesion because of the dispersion in wealth and income. I think we're definitely lacking cohesion, I think dispersion and wealth and income creates work of cohesion. I am struck by comparing the United States around 1900 with the United States today that around in 1900 politics was as fierce and mean as it is today. That is theodore Roosevelt denouncing William Jennings Bryan as the puppet of a alien European socialist, John Peter Altgill, the governor of Illinois who had not only been born in Europe but also had dared to pardon anarchists. But there seems to be a very different flavor that is, I think it's Ezra Klein talks about it that somehow that our media and our communications today focuses first on establishing who are your enemies. Do you share any enemies with me and if you share enemies with me, I will listen to. As I say, it's a remarkable book. It's slouching toward Utopia and economic history of the 20th century. Thank you so much for bringing it. I only really touch upon it today. I urge everybody to read it. It's really worth the effort. Thank you so much. Let's Professor Brad DeLon of UC Berkeley.

12994," to our very special contributor, Larry Summers of Harvard. MUSIC Coming up, staying the course or turning tail, we'll reflect on some big about faces this week. This is Wall Street week on Bloomberg. Whether you get your news on TV, on the radio, on the web, on the Bloomberg Journal, or the Bloomberg apps, the news that affect your business. Here's what I'm watching. You do not want to miss this story. How are we thinking about those dynamics? Is our business? Bloomberg TV and radio. The world is listening. Why do the biggest names in business choose Bloomberg? That's a great question. That's a great question. Great question. Pesh question I get all night. Bloomberg, top experts, great questions. Watch Bloomberg's surveillance early edition for the news you need when you need it. Not in a little of Kayleigh Lines in New York and any Edwards in London. The straightiest central bank raises interest rates twice as much as bull cars. The first one is in surveillance for in-depth analysis. Besides Tom Kane and Lisa Brownbott, so I'm Jonathan Ferro, the RPA, Fronts and Sensor. How does Japan get away with not raising rates? Can it sustain its normal at a time when everybody else is facing a very different reality? Bloomberg's surveillance. Be informed. Be prepared. Be ahead of the game. Everything you need to get set for this start of US trading. Bloomberg, the open with Jonathan Ferro. Drilling down on the numbers and preparing you as only Bloomberg can. Weekdays on Bloomberg. Finally, one more thought. The fine line between being steady and being stubborn. We've all admired those leaders through the years who have stuck to their guns when times got tough. British leaders like Winston Churchill and the darkest days of World War II. British will fight in the hills. We shall never surrender. And Churchill's successor, Margaret Thatcher, who was known for sticking to her guns, no matter what. He wanted the Council of Ministers to be the Senate. No. No. No. And American leaders, like President Reagan, at the Brennan-Bird Gate, demanding that the Soviet Union tear down the Berlin Wall when it seemed that that was the farthest thing for Mr. Gorbachev's mind. Mr. Gorbachev opened this gate. No. No. No. No. No. No. Mr. Gorbachev teared down this wall. No. But those were the times when the steadfast were ultimately proven right by history. What happens when bold proclamations don't hold up quite as well, such as George Herbert Walker Bush's insistence he would never, ever raise taxes. And they'll push again and I'll say to them, read my lips. No. No. No. And then there are those bold pronouncements that have yet to be proven out one way or the other. Like President Xi's insistence that his zero COVID policy is the right one for his country. If you just look at the COVID-0 protocols, it requires all people returning from abroad to have 10 days of quarantine. Or President Putin insisting that he will ultimately still prevail in Ukraine. If he thinks he's losing and may lose his office and even life, then he could become completely unpredictable. But this week, this week we saw something a bit different. Big bold pronouncements being completely reversed, not long after they were made. A big one was, of course, Elon Musk's change of mind again on whether he'd pony up $44 billion for Twitter. We're now hearing that Elon Musk and Twitter, of course, that resolution really said to be sticking on the contingency of getting that debt financing. And that is going to be the key clause that we're focused on going forward. But at least, Mr. Musk took a few months for his change of heart over in gray.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1220,2022-10-09 16:58:02
12995," You can see I'm getting that debt financing and that is going to be the key clause that we're focused on going forward. But at least Mr. Moss took a few months for his change of heart. Over in Great Britain we saw a new government lay out a new budget that included big tax cuts starting with the top tax bracket. We love the tax cutting but not at this time. This is just absolutely the wrong time to do this. Bringing immediate and violent reaction in the markets. Just trying to get the markets behind those two latter factors, probably significantly more difficult. And the Bank of England stepping in for the rescue. Suddenly the Bank of England signed itself in the ECB situation. So Prime Minister Trust's newly minted Chancellor of the Checker had to admit publicly that they had been wrong. Clearly and dramatically wrong. At least on those top tax rates. And it came only days after he and Prime Minister Trust had gone so big and so bold. I think it was a distraction and I think it was the wrong thing to do. One can hardly fault a government for listening to its people. Even if the listening might have come better before the deciding. But whatever the right answer, the one thing for certain is that at least in this respect, Mr. Trust is no Margaret Thatcher. To those waiting with baited breaths for that favourite media catch phrase that you turn, I have only one thing to say. You turn if you want to. LAUGHTER The ladies not for turning. That does it for this episode of Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston, this is Bloomberg. See you next week. LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER Every Friday with 30 minutes dedicated to fixed income, I'm Jonathan Farrow this is Bloomberg Real Yield.

You might have just started working remotely, so there's really nothing keeping you there. But then again, moving is a hassle. A lot of people are getting a lot of interest. We've had over 50,000 applications. About 90,000 applications. We've had over 1800 applicants from all over North America. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them?

12996," What separates a great investor from an average investor? Is it an early affinity for markets? I put a satellite dish on top of the dorm room, so I would have access to real-time stock quotes. An unconventional path? What I really wanted to do was ski. So I left Wharton and I went up to Maine and became ski boat. A never-ending thirst for knowledge? It is a constant education each and every day. And acute attention to detail? I was down there for three weeks. I met every tenant. I was counting the car traffic. I was learning the business. A willingness to take a risk? If you want to produce return, you have to be willing to take risk. Where the ability to recognize a mistake and move on. I don't mind a 90% chance probability of failure if there's a 10% chance of changing the world. In how to invest, I hope to provide a glimpse into the thoughts and practices of the world's great investors and hopefully inspire a new generation of professional investors. In my pursuit of identifying the traits and skills of a great investor, I first looked into their backgrounds. I found many were raised in blue collar or middle-class families, rarely where they from fabulously wealthy families or families where there was a history of investing professionally. But their path to a career in investing varied. Some like Ron Baron, the mutual fund manager and investor with more than $50 billion on her management started investing as a teenager. Yeah, from my partner, Metsua, I was interested in stock market because I had friends of mine who had been given stock from the grandparents who were prosperous. In Eastman, Kodak and Polaroid. I said, I want to do that. And my father said, we can't invest in stocks. We've never done that, you know, family. And in fact, one of the ideas behind my business is the idea was I wanted to be able to have people like my parents be able to invest in the stock market. So I saw that and then he said, well, I had $1,000 at the time. And he said, well, if you show me why you want to invest in a company and you put all your money into one company, then and show me why. Then I'll let you do that and open account for you. And so I did research, I would go to this brokerage firm. And it was called McDonald Company or from Cleveland. And they were right by Asbury Park High School. So I would go there after school, sports and girls and stocks. I would go there after school and all these guys, old guys, 40, 50 years old. They're sitting there on these green chairs and looking at the tape that hardly moved. I think the New York Stock Exchange was 25 million shares a day and maybe American was a million or two million shares a day. So look, I got a report on this mom with County National Bank. And I start reading it and it was around the corner in where I lived in Allenhurst outside of Asbury Park. And I told my father why I wanted to invest in it. And he let me invest. And the stock was $10 a share, 100 shares. And then the stock every day for the next six months, seven months, every day, did they stay the same or went up and eighth? And it was printed to 15 stocks and then Asbury Park Press. And everybody said the same. And then it got acquired at $17 a share. So my $1,000 became $1,700. I said, man, there's nothing today. I want to do that. So I was interested. Hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin also turned an early affinity for math and computers into an early career in stock trading. Let's talk about your background before you started Sadeil. You're born in Florida? I was born in Daytona Beach. My father worked on the space program back in the 1960s. But I spent my formative years in middle school and high school in Buckertown, Florida. And you were a pretty good math student and I'm told a computer nerd as well. Is that fair or unfair? Well, I appreciate the compliment because to be a computer nerd has obviously turned out to be a pretty good place to be in life. And yes, I was very interested in both mathematics and programming in high school. And it's defined my career and has had a very important role in my life. So you went to Harvard College. Most students there are taking courses or their athletics. But you were doing that, but you were also trading securities. Is that true? That is true. I started up a small partnership my second year at Harvard to engage in convertible bond arbitrage, which was a bit of an off the beaten path occupation for a kid in college. But I had a great fascination with markets. And I had an opportunity to invest capital markets in my college days.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1222,2022-10-09 17:06:55
12997," of the beaten path occupation for a kid in college. But I had a great fast nation with markets, and I had an opportunity to invest capital markets in my college days. And it was an incredible opportunity. It was a really great learning experience. But in those days, it wasn't common to be able to get stock prices instantly. You had to get a special terminal or special intended to let you get the stock quotes, is that right? So it's amazing is, you know, I love the line people go, well, that's how we've always done it. And I could think back into the early days of Citadel, where always did it meant we used a fax machine, which you and I of course have memories of. And the fax machine was revolutionary. In the 1980s, real-time stock prices were actually difficult to receive. And I put a satellite dish on top of the dorm room, so I would have access to real-time stock quotes and manage the portfolio that I managed. And what did the Harvard people say? Interestingly enough, back in the 80s, Harvard had a general prohibition on commercial activity in your dorm rooms. So I had to go to the building superintendent to get an exception to put the satellite dish on the roof of the building. And fortunately, he was willing to grant me that exception. But not every investor saw their future in finance early. Real estate, Titan, Sam Zell, and myself studied the law, became lawyers, and hated it. I was always a good enough academic to get from here to there. So when I wanted to go to law school, I got seven A's. But I didn't get very many A's before that. And I basically used the four years of being an undergraduate to build a real estate business and build other businesses. And I just had a great time. So you were doing some real estate on the side while you were in college. And then you went to University of Michigan Law School. And to please your mother or father, you said, I'm going to go to law school. But you weren't that interested in being a lawyer? No. Never. As a matter of fact, I ended up graduating and becoming a lawyer. And I practiced for four days. Four days? That's, I didn't realize you practiced that long. Four days. Four days. And I'm warning you the fifth day I went to see the senior partner. And as only a 24-year-old could do, I looked in and I said, I just don't think this is a good use of my time. He said, OK, there's the door? No, actually, what he said is, what are you going to do? And I said, I'm just going to go back to doing deals like I did when I was in law school and in the real estate business in New York. And so he said, one of you stay here and we'll do the legal work and we'll invest in your deals. And so that's what we did for a year. And then there's activist investor Nelson Peltz, who didn't see the point in studying at all. What I really wanted to do was ski. So I left Wharton and I went up to Maine and became a ski boat. What did your family say? Nelson, we really wanted you to go to Wharton and be a good student. You're one of ski. I mean, that's not what you're supposed to do. That's correct. They did say that. What did you do? You said I went skiing. My father was an amazing guy. He wasn't happy that I left Wharton. He wasn't happy that I was a ski bum. And he wasn't happy that I grew a beard. But I did all of those things. And the snow melted in late spring and came back and I had a summer job offered to me at Mount Hood Argon to help them teach racing to young kids in Mount Hood Argon. And I needed some money to get out there. I asked him if he'd give me a job on a truck 100 bucks a week, two weeks, that was all I needed. He said, fine, shave your beard off and do it. I said, I would. It was only temporary. So I shaved my beard off. And after about a week on the job, I started telling him things that I thought that were missed opportunities. And he set me up beautifully. He said, why don't you stay here and do what you want to do instead of going out to Mount Hood Argon? Well, I did. And that's what happened. There are also great investors like Paula Volent, one of the country's most successful endowment heads who came to investing after a completely different career. I studied paper conservation restoring prints and drawings. I worked at the New York Historical Society for a while there. I then went to work at the Palace of Fine Arts in their Conservation Lab.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1223,2022-10-09 17:11:12
12998," Paper conservation restoring prints and drawings. I worked at the New York Historical Society for a while there. I then went to work at the Palace of Fine Arts in their Conservation Lab, and then I went to Los Angeles, where I worked at the LA County Museum. I did scientific work at the Getty, and then I set up my own conservation studio where I worked with contemporary artists, like Edward Shay, St. Francis. And I was running my own business, and I realized I needed to know a little bit about finance, because I was working with very expensive works of art. I was running a studio. And so I started taking a couple business classes at UCLA, and through that I got introduced to Yale School of Management. And I got into Yale School of Management at the same time I got offered a fellowship at the National Gallery of Art, where you and I both serve. The Lyscher Fellow, and I worked in the Paper Conservation Lab there, combining paper and paintings techniques for conservation on contemporary works of art. So you did that for a while? Then you went to Yale School of Management? My husband and I had been trying to have a child, and it wasn't kind of works. It wasn't happening, so he said, OK, let's move to New Haven. And of course, that was instant. And my daughter was born after my first semester. So I took a break, and when my daughter was probably two months old, I went to David Swenson and knocked on the door and said, hi, I want to learn about endowment because I'm going to work at a museum. And this is about David. David looked at my resume. There was no finance at all. And he took me in. And I started filing and helping organize things and little by little I got projects to do. I remember he had me do a big research on soft dollars. That was one project I worked on. And little by little I became incorporated into the investment office. Coming up, we hear about the extreme intelligence and intention to detail that it takes for success on Wall Street. One of Sam's favorite samisms is we suffer from knowing the numbers. Leap is crucially important. And I think we've moved from this attitude, from its intelligence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s. And so it makes that a really exciting field because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harnessed to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart. If you can spit back a lot of facts. But if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what you bring figures out while you're sleeping. We will never break. We will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never break. Have the water rises and the mountains shake. Our love will remain. We will never. We will never. No. Another trait of great investors that shouldn't surprise you is they all tell you that you're not going to be able to",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1224,2022-10-09 17:15:13
12999," Another trait of great investors that shouldn't surprise you is they all tend to have a high degree of intelligence, many excelled academically. But true success as Mary Eardos, the CEO of JP Morgan Asset and Wealth Management, points out, comes from training and continuing to educate oneself. So training on Wall Street, but specifically in Wealth Management, is a very, very long process. We have 2200 analysts starting today and they're going to be working through the summer. We have 3600 analysts across JP Morgan Chase that will start at the very, in the September time period for their full time role. And we work very hard to go through in depth training and then to work through which ones actually are good at stock investing, which ones are good at M&A transactions, which ones are good at helping people understand things in a more simplistic manner. That's a two to three year training program. But that's pretty fast. If you think 10,000 hours is about what you need to master any subject. If someone comes in and has a regular eight hour a day job, five days a week, it's going to take you about five years to have a base level mastery. On Wall Street, it's more like 12 hours a day, six days a week, that cuts you down to about two and a half years before you become mastered in something. Once they've got that under their belt, they can then join a team. And if they've been successful going through the analyst program, joining a team, then the team will work through how that works. But it is a constant education each and every day. Every morning we start with an eight o'clock meeting and I call it like a mini university. And it's not just about what you've read in the newspapers as to what happened overnight. It's about understanding how all of those components fit together in a client's portfolio and then what might be right for you would be different than somebody else. And you're synthesizing all that information every morning and then you're going out and you're figuring out how to apply it to each situation. Dawn Fitzpatrick, the investment chief for George Soros, is of a similar mindset to Erdos. For her, the constant pursuit of new ideas and new voices keep her ahead of the game. So I read a lot, you know, in the morning, I'll skim through two or three different papers. During my days, I'm meeting with a lot of smart investors and smart people running companies. You learn a lot from there. I talk to peers. But I think part of the trick of this big business is being able to really aggregate and assimilate information. And one of the other tricks of this industry is trying to find sources of information that are different than the other people in the business because you don't want to get crowd thinking. I think that happens a lot in this business. Everyone's talking to the same people. And a view becomes consensus that might not be really grounded as well as it should be in facts. Attention to detail also sets great investors apart as described by two real estate legends, Sam Zell and John Gray. You know, one of Sam's favorite samisms is we suffer from knowing the numbers. I think we've managed to tip through the two loops for the last 50 years by never allowing ourselves to get swept up in the enthusiasm of whatever the current event might be. And I think by maintaining that level of discipline, yeah, we made mistakes. And that's to be expected. But we've all been, quote, controllable. No one mistake was ever catastrophic. The first deal I worked on was a shopping center in Chesapeake, Virginia, the great bridge shopping center. It was a $6 million transaction. We borrowed four. So it was a $2 million equity check. And you would have thought I was buying the island of Manhattan. I mean, I was down there for three weeks. I met every tenant. I was counting the car traffic. I was learning the business. And it was an amazing experience because I was the chief bottle washer. I was the waiter. I was the matredee. Because we were this tiny little business and I was learning it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1225,2022-10-09 17:19:44
13000," business and it was an amazing experience because I was the chief bottle washer, I was the waiter, I was the matredee because we were this tiny little business and I was learning at first hand. Now one of the most famous things in the real estate world is location, location, location meaning that the location is everything and also you might say it's local, local, local because most people make in real estate investments kind of in the area they know. You've made investments all over the world. How do you sitting in New York know about the value of real estate in Europe or in Asia and how hard is that being to build a global business? So I think the key to that is to have a global footprint, to have hundreds of people all over the world and it took us a long time to do it. I mean we've been at this for 30 years and you really need talented people on the ground. You need local people who know the markets. The one thing I'd say though that is advantageous about real estate is so many of the trends we're seeing, particularly driven by technology, are the same around the world. So when we started buying warehouses back in 2010 and we noticed that there were these e-commerce tenants showing up and we started buying more in the US, it wasn't a big leap of faith to say the same thing is going to happen in Canada, it's going to happen in the UK and continental Europe and across Asia. So my view is that if you have the skill set you can evaluate plus you travel a lot like you, I'm on planes a lot. I no longer run the real estate business day today. My colleagues Ken Kaplan and Kathleen McCarthy have done an amazing job but they have teams around the world on the ground and we're local in those markets and I think that's really important. You cannot buy real estate in Mumbai the way we have flying in and flying out of New York. Next we look at how skilled investors evaluate risk. We are 100% confident every time we make the investment that it's going to be a big company. We are wrong a lot of the time. We are not going to be able to do that.

But what great investors have found is that path doesn't lead to easy returns. The biggest wins come from going against the grain and taking a risk especially if you are leading venture capital investor like Mark Andreessen or Vinod Kostler. Each top and venture firm has its own bar so it has its own set of criteria for things that you should be done or not. The top tier venture firms have a collective bar which is a top tier venture firm going to fund this company or not. It's actually easier to answer that second question than it is the first question. If you have been in the business for a while you tend to have a sense of like okay this is going to get funded by a top and venture capital firm or not. If it is going to get funded by a top and venture capital firm and if my firm doesn't think it's a good idea you do wonder who's right because the other firms are quite smart. This is one of the regular discussions that we have which is like okay if another one of these top and firms is interested in it that might be a very positive substantive signal. If the other top firms have looked at it and all passed that might be a substantive negative signal that said some of the best deals in history have been passed on by a very large number of people. One of the class examples Uber was passed on by a very large number of venture capital firms so Uber was actually available to be invested in on this site called Angel List where literally anybody with a checkbook can",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1226,2022-10-09 17:23:54
13001," In one of the class examples, Uber was passed on by a very large number of venture capital firms. Uber was actually available to be invested in on this site called Angelist, where literally anybody with a checkbook can invest. And so every once in a while you get these outliers. And it's fundamentally a game of outliers, like the money is made on the aberrations. And so I say you want to be generally open-minded and humble about your conclusions about what all these different signals mean. Now a famous economist, Herb Stein, once said, if something can't keep going on forever, it won't. In other words, at some point things settle down. Do you worry that because the economy might soften at some point if interest rates are raised or just because of the business cycle, the wonderful world of venture capital will slow down a bit. And is that a worry for you? So it's a cyclical business for sure. It has a history of boom bus cycles, you know, basically just like any other sector of the economy. That said, I guess I would say we do not have a great track record in our industry of predicting these cycles. And I think most of how we either perform or fail to perform is micro not macro, which is to say it's based on the successor failure of individual companies. And if you just look at the history of venture capital startups, many of the best companies have been formed during the hot periods. But also many of the companies have been formed during the cold periods, right? And they're pros and cons of those periods. And so look, it's possible there's another cyclical boom and bus cycle, you know, our plan for that cycle would basically be to just keep going, keep working with our existing companies, help them through it, keep investing in new companies all the way through. And basically bet on these sort of micro level fundamental technological and economic changes that continue to happen. Most of what we do is on chartered territory. I would say the one piece that works really well in our business is go for higher risk higher consequences. So most people in business reduce risk, increase the probability of success, which is reduce risk. But at the expense of making the consequences of success relatively inconsequential, you might make two times your money or something. I for our business what works is I don't mind the 90% chance probability of failure if there's a 10% chance of changing the world. And that's very much the philosophy. It also goes with it's it's the right way to make huge impact. It's not just venture capitalists taking risks. Columbia's in down and head Kim Liu also says gains are not without calculated risks. I think the best investment advice I've ever received is the fact that we are in the business of taking risk. And so if you want to produce return, you have to be willing to take risk and you have to be willing to analyze and mitigate that risk the best you can. And to make sure that the return potential of an investment is equal to the risk, but you can't avoid risk. Now what do you think the most common mistake investors make generally? I think the most common mistakes is following the herd and just doing what everybody else is doing and not making sure that an investment is appropriate for your institution and making sure that the analysis that someone else has done is not appropriate for you or is not congruent with the way you think about the world. I think there are a million ways to make money. I think there are a million strategies that can work. Not every investment is consistent with your strategy. And so I think there's a lot of herd mentality and that's a huge mistake that happens. Now sometimes risk don't pan out and mistakes are made. Now I might sit and stew over the loss for a decade or two, but a truly great investor like Kleiner Perkins chairman John Doer has the ability to admit a mistake, cut his losses and move on. When I first came to Silicon Valley, I hung out at Stanford on the second floor of Margaret Jack's Hall. And down that hall was Andy Bechtel-Sheim who founded Sun Microsystems, John Hennessey, who became president of Stanford, founded MIPS Jim Clark of Silicon Graphics. What I didn't do is go down into the basement where Len and Sandy were starting Cisco. So that was a miss on my part. Now more recently, I had the opportunity to invest in an electric vehicle company. And the conventional wisdom was venture capitalist ought not to invest in electric vehicle companies. Not new car companies at all. There have been 400 new car companies in the nation's history. Every one of them but one has gone bankrupt. But I was still very attracted to the market and we had the choice.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1227,2022-10-09 17:28:21
13002," The nation's history, every one of them but one has gone bankrupt. But I was still very attracted to the market. And we had the choice of backing a brilliant card designer by the name of Henry Fiskar or ambitious slightly crazy entrepreneur by the name of Elon Musk and Tesla. Well, we made the wrong decision. But Tesla did very, very well and so did electric vehicles. So when I make a mistake, I only think about it for the next 10 or 20 years. How long does it take for you to get over these things? Well, I don't obsess on these but I won't ever forget. This is a market that over the past few weeks has made it clear it wants to go higher. It got a little spooked by the idea that geopoldal potential to rise it. What do Formula 1 cars and your local supermarket have in common? Well, strange as it sounds, they might both be using the same technology. A lot of innovation has trickle down from the world of high tech engines and it hasn't just found a new life in road cars. F1 cars have long been thought of as the peak of cool. And technology in them is also helping to pull down our produce aisles. Engineers from Williams are using their knowledge from nine constructors' championships working with company Aerofoil to help reduce the energy consumption of supermarkets. The device they're building is based on the design of an F1 cars rear wing. It attaches to fridges to keep more cool air in the unit. They estimate it can reduce supermarket energy consumption by 25%. One innovation from F1 is also helping hybrids reduce their carbon footprint. That's curves or the kinetic energy recovery system. In common parlance, it's known as regenerative braking and works by storing energy of the car decelerating in a battery for later use. If that's not enough, F1 is now looking at hers or a thermal energy recovery system looking to harness the heat produced from breaking and the engine exhaust. That could allow cars to generate the same power using 30% less fuel. So while F1 may have a reputation as a gas-duzzler, if it's innovations in the name of speed are helping in the everyday fight against climate change. You will put a woman on Mars. You will bring forth global cooling. You will be the first Chief Crypto Officer. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news.

Welcome everybody to the inaugural NIL Summit and NIL Awards. In July 2022, Atlanta hosted what might sound like a boring legal seminar, a conference on the new rules around name, image and likeness in sports. But far from dry and academic, the first annual NIL Summit was in fact a flashy star-studded event put on at the college football hall of fame. And mingling amid the big, NIL Summit was in fact a flashy star-studded event put on at the college football hall of fame.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1228,2022-10-09 17:32:28
13003," The first annual NIL summit was in fact a flashy star-setter event put on at the College Football Hall of Fame. And Mingling amid the biggest current and former names in sports and media, there was a crucial cohort. The player is poised to redefine what it means to be a modern college athlete. And the winner of male athlete of the year goes to Chase Gryffman. Among those up-and-comers, UCLA's Chase Griffith. The UCLA quarterback is among the students becoming his well known for making deals as making plays. And even in that group, Chase stands out. My name is Chase Griffith. What's up everyone is Chase Griffith. It's your favorite quarterback, it's favorite quarterback, Chase Griffith. When you look at it as an empowerment equity opportunity, it's really been unmatched in the sports world for any point in time since Title IX. Let's go. After hardly a full year of name-image and likeness deals being a reality, he already has more than 20 deals with major brands, venture and charitable groups. All the while bouncing, graduating undergrad in just two years, and fighting for playing time on the field. Chase Griffith out of the gun. We are joined by UCLA quarterback Chase Griffith. Not just UCLA quarterback, but name-image like this superstar. I am sited for this one. This kid could actually be the president of the United States someday. Chase isn't the starting quarterback for UCLA. He's not even the backup quarterback. But back on campus in LA, his nickname is President Chase. And after spending a couple days talking about his approach to business, sports and equality, it's not shocking to think he might someday hold that office. His level of focus and maturity at this stage, I can't wait to see what he's doing. I'm just a stage. I only wish I had. If you wanted by stocking him in the name, by stocking Chase Griffith. When it comes to building generational wealth, it's not about the money that you make in college. I'm very excited that I made the amount of money that I made last year. I'm even 10 times more excited that I know how to make that money. Summer on any college campuses, mostly for the athlete, tour on lighter, but still regimented schedules. Attending classes, working out, a little bit of hanging out, and then more working out on their own time. Chase is no exception. The 21-year-old is a backup, albeit an impatient one. In the topsy-turvy past couple of seasons dotted with family games and COVID protocols, he's been able to start three games for the Bruins. Griffin, going to throw to the end zone. Why open again? Touchdown UCLA. Feeding Arizona and narrowly losing to both Stanford and Oregon. That was inches away from Chase Griffin and UCLA. Being in cold, fledged, come back mode. For Chase, UCLA felt like destiny. He was bored just a few miles away before his family moved to Texas when he was a toddler. But beyond being a sort of homecoming, the school's history of athlete activism was a massive draw. I always expected from myself to have some sort of impact that was beneficial for more people than I interact with on a daily basis. And choosing UCLA, a lot of that went into me seeing myself as someone who reflected the same want to make things better. That so many of the people that UCLA prides itself upon be in the home for it have done in the past. The legacies of former UCLA greats like Arthur Ash, Jackie Robinson, Kareem Abdul Jabbar and Jackie Joyner Cursey have had a wide ranging impact on society well beyond the Westwood campus. Chase reveres these people, but he's perhaps most keenly aware of the activism of a more recent Bruin alum, the basketball player at Obanit. At Obanit, who was an ace-smith player of the year National Champ, UCLA Sports Legend is...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1229,2022-10-09 17:36:59
13004," the basketball player at O'Bannon. At O'Bannon, who was an ace-smith player of the Year National Champ, UCLA Sports Legend is also a legal hero. I think NIO could be the next installment where we look back in 30, 40, 50 years and God willing, if we give him the roses he deserves, we add at O'Bannon to that list of UCLA grades. O'Bannon, who played at UCLA from 91 to 95, initiated a lawsuit that's widely credited for finally opening up the possibility of college athletes being paid for use of their name, Image and Lightness. He sued the NCAA in video game publisher EA for anti-trust violations, arguing that athletes should be entitled to financial compensation when schools used their lightness for game. In 2014, a judge ruled in his favor. I don't think he was congratulating you. What was your call? And then, on an episode of the show, surrounded by O'Bannon, Diana Tarrassi, and LeBron James, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed the first ultimately successful legislation to allow athletes to receive endorsement deals. The fair pay to play act led other states to follow suit and ultimately led the NCAA in 2021 to relent, seemingly reluctantly. The NIL payments were officially allowed as of July 1st, 2021. Today is the last day where name, image, and likeness laws will not be on the books, and kids will not be, if you will, not allowed to make money off of their name, image, and likeness. Making money from Jersey sales and endorsement deals is a way for players to share in the massively lucrative world of college athletics. This NIL thing is the wild, wild west. The NIL change felt like many things that happened very slowly and then it happened very fast. And I wonder for you, having contemplated that maybe this was coming at some point, how prepared were you? What was your mindset when the switch flipped? Right. I mean, I still think everyone's trying to get prepared for the industry. It's still sort of like a wild, wild west. I wasn't really expecting anything. I was more just thinking about honestly getting ready for that season and capitalizing on everything that was happening. When NIL hit and it turned out I had action, I was like, oh, okay, well after this degree deal, which was fantastic. I was like, okay, I see how I can be a staple in this game and I see how I can get better over time. That's why I teamed up with my friends as Shell. Shell deal hit and then boost my old deal hit. Then you keep on building clear coverage. You keep on building and you get better in the meetings. And most of all, you start seeing where your value can be best placed in these new opportunities. The headlines and storylines in the aftermath of the NIL change introduced visions of instant millionaire strolling campuses across the nation. You might think the NIL athlete of the year lives in splendor or at least in one of those athletic halices that put most of our coach dorms to shame. Well, it's all relative to chase. All right, Jason. So here we are, World Headquarters. This is where it all happens. There's the kitchen right here. I actually really enjoy cooking. Oh, yeah. Yeah, this gas oven gets really hot really fast. I make pizzas in there. This is the best appliance since dog foam. If I already put anything in there, I need to do these dishes right here. So no trappings of success yet. More a pretty average college dorm room. The fridge filled with leftovers, a well-used PS4. And of course, the requisite Godfather poster. It's a far cry from the lifestyle seen in some local news reports for NIL athletes during this first year. Beigeon Robinson made headlines with an NIL deal with Lamborghini Austin. Lamborghini's tend to make more headlines than Muhammad Ali are Bruce Lee pictures. Some athletes who are living in mansions, driving Lamborghini's, as far as I know, you're doing either of those things. I see where you're living right here. It is with all due respect, not a mansion. Okay. How much of that is a conscious choice? And what is...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1230,2022-10-09 17:41:21
13005," As far as I know, you're doing either of those things. I see where you're living right here. It is, it is with all the respect not to mention. Okay. How much of that is a conscious choice? And what does it say about sort of your approach to this? Right. I mean, first off, I look at this is like, is my own room a guy? Everything I need. I'm cool with that. I'm cool with living, but what I mean is, I think it's important to remember that the volume of financial gain is completely overstated. And that's what it y'all is for in the media. Yeah. And someone hears about a $5 million or $10 million deal. You gotta report it. Like, oh my goodness, people are gonna read this. Hey, I'd count two things. Like, how many kids are even getting these deals? And then for the kids that do get it, how much of that is in liquor cash? And how much of it is in assets? If you pay for a $2 million house out here in LA for a kid to stay in the college, that's great. But as soon as they're graduated, they're not gonna have that $2 million house. I say the same thing, you know, for the kids who are driving around in Lamborghini's and stuff like that. That's awesome. Like, that's super dope. And I know some of those kids. But, you know, someone paying for your lease is different than someone actually giving you the value of that lease every single month. You're investing it, saving it for a $1K, et cetera. I say all that just to mention that product deals and stuff like that are overhyped by the media. And they also can land kids in some trouble if they're not paying taxes on it. That's one of the distinctly unsexy and easy to overlook elements of the new rules. Even if an athlete's not getting cold hard cash from a deal, the value of any products given are subject to state and federal taxes. So suddenly, what a player sees as free gear in return for some social media posts actually equals taxable income. And that requires the same forms you'd fill out as an independent contractor getting a check. I made a fair amount in NIO deals and I invested all of it. In my opinion, NIO is great. Doing all this is great. Making money now is great. But the most valuable thing I've gotten from all of this is, in the fact, I'll always know how to make money off of myself. All told, Chase has done more than 20 deals with major brands like Degree, Shell, and Boost Mobile. Along with venture-stage companies, including Discord, Duffel, and Creative Juice. He's also made a point to work with charities like the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, where he's already raised funds for almost 60,000 meals. Hydrogen has a very special place in the universe. It's the first element on the periodic table. It is the most abandoned element in the universe. And when clean energy advocates think about, what can we find which would be as easy to use, as fossil fuels, they think about hydrogen. The fuel that will, when burn, only produce water. We like to imagine that if we just built enough of these and these, we could ditch fossil fuels and save the planet. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. There are some things where you just need a good old-fashioned combustible fuel. Now startups around the world are betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century.

13006," The economy is changing as the world recalibrates. After decades of stagnation, Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation. Corporate giants, policymakers and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that. Every week on Japan ahead, right here on Bloomberg Television. Markets come down in Europe from the financial centers of the world. Bloomberg markets European polls with Guy Johnson and London and Alex Steele in New York. Real-time numbers, real-time analysis weekdays. However you get your news, this is Bloomberg Daybreak, but let's Bloomberg. Welcome to Daybreak Australia. This is Bloomberg Technology. This is Bloomberg. On TV, radio and the web, this is Bloomberg. This is a song by Julian. I heard the opening. I do. I just took that opening and I pitched it slow, or I think I sped it. At his desk when he's not making music, another side project, he's either networking with CEOs or investors he seeks out or who seek him out, or negotiating new deals. Hey, Mallory. I'm sure you tell you doing. I'm doing well. I'm turning on my camera right now. You have no worries. This is an average NIL deal, a brand approaches an athlete who can help spread their message to a demographic they believe the athlete can help reach. In this case, direct TV is looking to market their NFL Sunday ticket to college students. If the two posts, one post, late August, and one post on the first week of September, and the compensation would be 1200 per post, so it would be 400 total. Right. Are they video posts or are they picking captions? They can be either. It's up to you guys. That was pretty good, 400 above, but they had originally asked, so that's a win. So yeah, I mean, at this point, after I do a Zoom or something like that, I get to chill out, go back to land down if I was watching a movie or something, or go to YouTube to start looking for more samples. This is pretty simple interaction for Chase and for direct TV, negotiated over a couple of emails in Zoom calls, and papered with a contract Chase will have his dad look over before he signs. And Chase, who's made himself as much of a student of the new NIL marketplace as he has a public policy at UCLA, says he understands why it's working. The brand ambassador with ship with an athlete is more attractive to these brands now as large of terminal investment than even a post by a famous actor. If there's any place to learn that sports are deep in the hearts of Americans, it's on a high school football field in Texas. Friday night lights in the Lone Star State might be the great iron equivalent of Frank Sinatra's New York City, making it there means you're something special. Chase Griffin quarterback class 19, Hado, Texas. And Chase didn't just make it, he excelled. Let's talk about some of the top quarterbacks in the state, and when you look at that list at the top of it, you got to talk about Chase Griffin. I was lucky to play three years as a quarterback for Hado High School, which is a one horse town. We have great success, and so the town really shut down and came out and supported us every Friday night. Chase, one word to describe that finish that game. God, that's it. Coming from a town like that where football is so prioritized, it has its pros and cons, but I think on the pros side, I learned how to win, how to get better, and most importantly, what it's like to build a team where everyone gets better.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1232,2022-10-09 17:49:53
13007," Team where everyone gets better. Emulating his UCLA alumni like Robinson, Joyner Kursy and Abdel Jabbar, Chase is looking at the impact NIL will have not just for him, but the athletes that will follow. When the predecessors who have come before you have changed the world and made life better for everyone today, you can't help but ask yourself how the actions that you're taking now and the companies and brands and the NIL space that you work with are all cumulatively building something greater than any of us could foresee. I've actually, I've never moderated, so this will be my first time. It should be fun. I know my handwriting's terrible. The last day the conference chase was asked to co-moderate a panel with Monique Nelson, the CEO for Univ world group. All right, I'm excited to be here. Univ world group is one of the longest standing multicultural advertising and marketing agencies in the United States. The firm works with brands like Ford, Home Depot, and Johnson and Johnson to help reach the black and brown communities, and they have big ambitions in NIL. For Univ world group, the idea of this was pretty epic in that because we serve the undervalued, overlooked, and the underserved, we knew that this particular group of people would fall into that category. And we plan on being the premier practice for NIL athletes that are looking to do purpose-driven media advertising, community level engagement work. UWG launched a program called the NIL to help black student athletes partner with major brands, but to help them understand how to do that, they brought on chase to serve as a student athlete executive in residence. For me, I do nothing without tremendous amounts of data for all of our clients. I really wanted to be thoughtful about this practice being very athlete-centric. If I were to build it or anyone on my team were to build it, it would not have the athlete at the core. When you're 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, the best way to have credibility is confidence, and the only way for confidence to be authentic. I'm actually learning on the job. I'm learning about the brand side of NIL, but I'm also trying to make sure that empowerment equity is built in, especially for black student athletes in the NIL world. ROI. Return on investment. Both Chase and UWG see NIL deals as something much more than making money for students. It's also a potential investment in a community long overlooked. I think we're getting ready to stop boxes, trying to feed the people of L.A. A piece of each of Chase's NIL deals go to his belief brand campaign, which has raised more than $13,000 for meals for the L.A. Food Bank backpack program. But athletes giving back is only one side. I'm here with legal zoom to give you five tips on the NIL game plan. UWG and Chase believe having brands investing in the athletes, especially athletes of color, can be a force multiplier for these historically marginalized communities. When you look at the revenue, JTN rating, sports for a bomb ass, what 88% of those athletes are black. So when you're doing stuff to empower student athletes in the NIL space, you're also helping to deliver on your promise. Now, student athletes are not the only ones who should receive this help by any means. But statistically, by doing that, you're going to be delivering on your mission. Additionally, student athletes on average come from lower levels of income. So you're also delivering on that promise. And a lot of these student athletes are first generation, their first gen college students. Some of them first gen high school diploma. Some of them first time receiving the amount of money that they receive in their families. This has been a wild first year in NIL.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1233,2022-10-09 17:54:16
13008," receive in their families. This has been a wild first year in NIL. We all knew that there would be bags of cash around, right? There's always been bags of cash. There's cash everywhere. What we know is that that's not sustainable. We know that athletics has an expiration date on it. So for us, inclusion ultimately means this is just a part of you. It is a tremendous part of you and we're going to celebrate that part of you. But we also know that you're bigger than that. So we want to empower you to live past your expiration date for this part of your life. And quite honestly, have equity in everything that you have poured yourself into as an NIL athlete. It may still be the Wild West days for the NIL industry. But in the first year, about a billion dollars in business was done with NCAA athletes. For the early leaders in the NIL space like Chase, they're striking a precedent for athletes that follow them. And that's important because collegiate athletes don't have that much time to profit. Only an estimated 2% of NCAA athletes go on to the pros. Even the hardest working are often limited by things they can't control. For Chase, it's been his height. I'm 5'10 now in high school after my sophomore year went up through for 3000 yards. I was probably like 5'6"", 5'5"". I mean, I get arguably say I'm one of the best in the history of Texas high school football. But, you know, I've gone through the height test where they'll call you out of class, shake your hand, look at you up and down. And be like, nice to meet you, you go back to class. It's a sad but timeless story for student athletes. And for Chase, his story is something he's not shyed away from, but embraced when it comes to his NIL deals. I'm frequently the smallest person on the football field, but I always strive to be the most impactful. My middle school coach told me that I would never play in high school. Chase's deals with degrees breaking limits team and clear covers inspired underdogs, allowed him to capitalize financially from football. But in the last season, he never saw the field for UCLA. I play football because I love the game. I play the football because I'm a good competitor. I love to compete and I play football because I'm good at it. At the end of the day, I don't play football for my livelihood, which is important to remember when it comes down to identity. I myself, Chase Griffin, as long as I'm that, I got something in this world. As he moves into the new season and focuses more on football than business, Chase doesn't see much of a differentiation between the two in terms of his mindset. I wouldn't be surprised if I wasn't playing football in five years and it was running in Fortune 500 company. But I also wouldn't be surprised if I was winning a Super Bowl five-ten years from now. Then either way, I'm going to keep on working at the tools that would align myself and my future with both. At the end of the day, you're always going to have yourself. If you can make profit off of yourself and know where you add value, in any world you're in, you'll be able to adapt and find ways to generate wealth for yourself. One of what I love about business is you get to build things from nothing. I don't have any investors. All this is all money and this is making this building. It's pretty much full service shadow banking with nobody in charge.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1234,2022-10-09 17:58:31
13009," MUSIC At some point you had to fight for the trademark, right, for the red salt. Is that stressful? Very stressful. Especially, you know, we are a small company in a way and to have to fight people who have those huge companies, who put you 27 lawyers on your back for something which is yours is very stressful. I mean, I wish it didn't happen. Everything which happened to me is a lesson in a way, bad or good. And once it's done, it's done and you're sort of happy. I'm happy about it. That thing I could have definitely avoided, but it's done. Did you realize at the time when you started the company that you would become so successful and actually so big? No, no. You know, when I started the company, I wanted to have a shop in Paris, which is my hometown. And I wanted to do pretty shoes for pretty girls. That was my goal. And now you look back and you say, actually, I still make pretty shoes, but for many more women. Absolutely. Do you think you would have been so successful without the Red Soul? I think the Red Soul definitely, of course, participates to my work, but also to the fame of my shoes because it's instantly recognizable. But then, you know, the design is very important. But definitely, when you have such a strong sign of recognition, it participates to, yeah. We have to get interest rates higher and bring inflation back to our targets. It's better to pass this becoming scarce. We are running on thin ice. No one deliberately wants to go into battle, but we sneak walk into conflict.

Just how sensitive the market's odds. Any commentary about trade. We did see some pressure on the UI and we did see some pressure on the futures. That is now being reversed. While Tesla's in the like, make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the road today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building to crowds America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do a whole lot of work. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do a 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels. We want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. This is my kitchen table and also my filing system. Over much of the past three decades, I've been an investor. The highest falling of mankind I've often thought was private equity.

13010," One of the most successful entrepreneurs in the world of cryptocurrency is Sam Bankman Freed. He's created the FTX platform and that platform has been so successful in the cryptocurrency world that Sam has become one of the wealthiest men in the world. As a result of this, he's now focusing a lot of his energy on philanthropy. I sat down with him at the Bloomberg headquarters in New York recently to talk about the future of crypto and his desire to change the world and make it a better place. So is crypto down for the count or is it coming back? I think it's coming back and obviously a lot of this is just going to have to do with the macro environment. If we see markets crash again, we're going to see crypto crash along with it. If we see a market recovery, we're going to see crypto recovery along with it. But I think this is, it's flushed out a lot of the things that needed to be flushed out from the crypto space anyway. When May of 2022 began, I think I'm meltdown in tech values and also crypto. Did you get nervous at all of a sudden the world was going to fall apart? Not super nervous. It's like it was definitely going to be a rocky road for the industry and you saw some businesses blow up when Bitcoin hit 20K. I think if we saw things meltdown much further than they did. If we saw NAS Act dropped 30%, 40% from here in Bitcoin go down to 10K, Protokin, I think you would see another round of pain for the industry that would potentially be more of a medium to long-term problem. So it didn't give you any gray hair I can see. I'll a little bit, but I pluck those out to keep up appearances. So let me ask you this, when the Bitcoin world was kind of going down a bit, I think at Bitcoin peaked at 61,000 or something and now it's at 23,000 but it went as low as 1718. 1718. When I did, a lot of other cryptocurrencies went down as well. You bailed out some companies. What money did you use to do that? So there were a few different versions of it and one piece of this was basically FTX balance sheet. We keep our corporate cash just in dollars and so we'd raised a few billion dollars over the course of the last couple of years and we're profitable business. Now we'd also done some acquisitions which partially balances that out but we had some cash left and with the BlockFi deal for instance, that was on FTX, I think FTX US's balance. Well, Wall Street's had its problems early in the 20th century. Mr. JP Morgan himself used to go out and say I'm going to bail out certain companies and you were called the JP Morgan crypto. Does that bother you or not? It doesn't bother me too much. I mean, I think it's something I thought was the right thing for the industry and our very explicit mandate that we sort of gave to the team of people working on this was your goal is not to make a fortune for us doing this. Like your goal is to do OK deals, your goal is for us to not get our faces ripped off but contingent on that. You know, do as much as we can to bail out the industry and that was the higher goal was trying to backstop places rather than maximizing on these deals. No, I would have loved other people to do it. Like I think it would have been great. So you went in, you bought some companies where those investments profitable? I mixed is basically the answer. I think some are going to turn out to be profitable, some won't be. Like, one of them certainly, I mean with Voyager, I think, you know, there's somebody $30 million there that we put in that I'm not sure ever seeing that 70 million again. And so, you know, we had to make snap judgment calls and we made them such that if things turned out well, they'd be good investments. And if they turned out badly, they'd be bad investments. But we sort of limited the amount that we could lose from it. Why do so many young people seem so attracted to crypto? I mean, I know there are people from all over the world of all ages, but it seems like young people, particularly are very interested. Why is that? Yeah, I mean, partially it's a new thing that's going to appeal to younger people. But I think another aspect of this is if you're, you know, 21 years old and you're trying to get access to markets, you want to be able to trade to invest. You can sign up for an account on a crypto exchange and get full market access. If you try and get that same level of access in equity using commodities, you can't get it. You're going to end up with heavily intermediate access that has like pretty limited amounts of real interactiveness, limited amounts of liquidity, limited amounts of size, limited amounts of market data. And so I think for a natively digital generation that's looking to take more control of their finances, actually being able to do it with crypto is a big, big difference. So in your own case, you guys.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1236,2022-10-09 18:07:31
13011," or a natively digital generation that's looking to take more control of their finances actually being able to do it with crypto is a big difference. So in your own case, you got involved with crypto at what age? I was boy, I guess it was 25 or so. And did you ever imagine that at 25 when you got involved, you would now be one of the most important people in the crypto world and have become a multi-billionaire? No, well, no, although the crypto world's results are grown quite a bit, since I got involved, but I was surprised at how big things grew in general, how big I was able to grow things. I thought there was a chance of it. Like I did see pretty high upside when I got involved. I was surprised that we actually got there. So today you're running FTX. You started FTX in what year? 2019. And what does it actually do? So it's a cryptocurrency exchange is what we call it, but really it's a combination of a few different businesses. If you compare to traditional finance, right? You have the New York Stock Exchange, Gnasc Act, IE since CME as the exchanges. And that's where Bids and Offers cross. But you don't go to New YorkSockExchange.com to send an order. They are primarily the sort of backend trading infrastructure. Separately you have brokerages, FCMs, and other businesses that sit in the front that consumers access. And then you have different settlement and sort of custody parties sitting in the middle there. Intriptal, all of that gets squashed traditionally into one entity. And so what FTX is, it's sort of all of those things. It's a backend, you know, match Gngin, risk Gngin, custody system, say, front end, mobile app, website, API, and everything in between. So that, you know, if you want to buy or sell a Bitcoin, you can go to FTX.com. And, you know, we offer all the services necessary to do that, except for buying and selling. So you got involved because you thought it would be a creative new area to get involved with. But was making a lot of money at one of your goals? Yeah, it was. And in particular, when I was in college, I started wanting to allow charities that I really respected and said, hey, what can I do to help you guys out? Like, do you want me to work for you? And they basically, not really. I mean, you could, but they'd be kind of mediocre. You know, what they say is they'd rather my money than my time. And so I ended up going on to Wall Street and then getting involved, and with the goal of donating what I made. So what's the best investment advice you've ever put in? You haven't found anybody. The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance, and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day. And if you keep at it and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's not just interest. It was always said above compound interest returns, compound business returns, compound human returns. They're all very additive because you learn every day. And if you keep at it, it's very, very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make selling at the wrong time? And they sell when the prices go down? Yes. Or yes. Not keeping, like, people have conviction or they invest for the, if they invest for the right reasons, just keep at it. So let's go back to your youth, not that you're old now, your how old? 30 years old. 30 years old. So let's go back to, let's say, when you were growing up, you grew up in California? Yep. On Stanford campus. And your parents were both professors at Stanford Law School. Yeah. And one's name was Professor Fried. Yep. And one is Professor Bankman. So whose idea was it to combine the two into one name? I think they kind of both had the idea. I think there's a little bit hashing out of exactly what that would look like, would I be Bankman Fried? Would I be Fried Bankman? But I think they kind of mutually came to that decision. So if you got married someday and you have a show, yeah. I'm inconsolable.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1237,2022-10-09 18:11:58
13012," that would look like would it be Bankman Freed, would it be Free Bankman? But I think they kind of mutually came to that decision. So if you got married someday, and you have a **** show, yeah. So you'd have two hyphens? Right, well, especially if I married someone with a hyphenated last name, right, then you've got four names. I think at that point, would you stop to roll a die and choose one? Oh, wow, okay. So you've thought about that? Yeah, I mean, you could also just use a totally new name. But would it be particularly attractive to find somebody to have a hyphenated name or not, really? Oh, I think it would be worth one good story. That's why I get out of it. On the scale of life partners, not the most important criteria. Okay, so you're growing up. Your parents are distinguished professors at Stanford Law School. Were you interested in the law at any point or not? Not at all growing up. I think I've become more interested in it recently. But, you know, I mean, when I was growing up, my parents told me, look, you can do whatever you want with your life. We don't particularly recommend that you become a lawyer, but, you know, you're welcome to do whatever you want. So you were a bit of a math prodigy when you were younger? I was certainly better at math than I was at reading or literature. So you went to MIT? Yep. And when you got there, did you find that people were smarter than you thought or not as smart as you thought? I think smarter than I thought, I think maybe some part of me had hoped that I would, you know, be able to live a life where I, you know, was always clearly sort of like, you know, an outlier on that. And I think MIT taught me that wasn't true, that there were a lot of other really smart people in the world. And, you know, was really interesting and cool getting to know them. So when you get to MIT, did you say, look, I'm going to go out and become a multi-billionaire before I'm 30? No, I had no idea what I was going to do. I mean, I, I, I weekly thought I was going to become a professor not for any particular reason. I realized I didn't really like academia when I was there, and that left me kind of a little bit lost about what I would actually do with my life. So what did you major in? Physics, technically, I took about the bare minimum that you could imagine. It took maybe seven or eight physics classes my whole time there. So what did you really take courses in math or? I took some, I minored in math, but I took a kind of popery of classes, you know, some polycyclics, some econ, some psychology, but really I also didn't take that many classes and sort of got a little burnt out of academia. Right. So when you graduated, what did your parents say to you about what you should do upon graduation? I mean, mostly they said I should do what I wanted and what like I thought was whatever I thought would be exciting. And you know, they're going to support me with whatever, but I, you know, going to like junior year of college, I had no idea what that was going to be. I always sort of had just ruled out or soft rolled out academia and didn't know what was going to replace it. I ended up interning at Jane Street, a finance firm after my junior year and really liked it there. And was starting to chart a path forward of donating money. Okay. So what did you do upon graduation? Did you took a job and finance? Yep. Went back to Jane Street work there full time. And what did they do? They're a quant trading firm. So I was on the internationally TFTASK. Basically that means you have a US listed fund that owns a lot of foreign stocks. So you know, you could look at EEM, US listed ETF that owns a bunch of emerging market companies, you know, across Asia, across Lodam and you know, a few places in Europe. And it's basically a combination of like modeling, computer trading and real time intuition kind of jumbled together. And how many years were you doing that? About three, three and a half years. All right. And then after that, you said I'm going to go start something in the crypto world? Not quite. So I left in late, in let's say fall 2017, roughly, not sure what it was actually going to do. Next, what I'd really done was sort of written down like 12 things I could do with my life and felt like a lot of them were compelling. And I didn't know what was going to be best, but that, you know, the only way to try would be to so leave and just dive into some of them. All right. So you started your own company. What was it called? So Alameda Research, the first company, started up and it was a crypto-quant trading firm. And you know, the sort of founding, if it was basically, well, you know, Bitcoin was trading on a lot of different crypto exchanges and it was not trading at the same price on all of them. So you might see it trading for $10,000 on Coinbase and $10,100 on Bet Stamp. And, you know, in theory, there's a 1% arbitrage to do their trading those against each other. All right. So you just started to, nevertheless, trade Bitcoin or other cryptos and take some arbitrage advantage. And it was a profit of YPROZOOM. Yep. It was. It was a huge amount of money.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1238,2022-10-09 18:16:28
13013," just started to mirror less trade, Bitcoin or other cryptos who take some arbitrage advantage. And it was a profit of white presumed. Yep, it was. It was a huge amount of logistical work. Like finding the trade was the easy part. The hard part was getting the account sending wire transfers, opening up entities, and all of the other sort of operational work that went into actually being able to execute. And normally, when people start companies, they get venture capital money. Yeah, those venture capitalists own a piece of it. Did you get venture capital money? I did not for Alameda. And part of this was, we talked with some VC firms. And our petri is basically, hey, guys, good news. Bunch of 25-year-olds. We don't really know what a Bitcoin is, but we're trading it. Also, this is all crypto. And we got to start up together. None of us has run a company before. And we'd like $100 million by next Tuesday, ideally. It was not a very compelling pitch. OK, so you got to turn down. Oh, yeah. People were like, oh, that's so cool. I hope you find success. And no one was, and we ended up doing this basically cobbling together lines of credit and other things from various sources, trying to sort of snowball and be able to build on ourselves. OK, so after that, you started another company, FTX. Yeah. Now, what does FTX do that your first company didn't do? So Alameda is buying and selling. Like it's trading for its own book and trying to do profitable trades. FTX, you can think of it as infrastructure. It's markets infrastructure. So everything that sits between a buyer and a seller. So FTX doesn't buy and sell itself. But it's a venue where people can go to trade crypto. And that aims to solve every piece in between those two parties from the clearing and settlement and custody, the anti-money laundering, your customer policies, the compliance, the match engine, the risk engine, the front end, and everything else. All right, so why does somebody come to FTX and use you, as opposed to one of the other similar exchanges? Yeah, I mean, you know, Twitch is owned. But the things that I think we've particularly specialized in and been good at, you know, one, we've been pretty fast-moving and innovative. We're a relatively new venue, but we've put a lot of thought into exactly how our products are designed. Where's the company based? So we have a lot of offices for regulatory reasons. So as an example, we have a new Tokyo office with a bunch of people in it because we now have a JFSA type one financial services license there. So we have like little bases in a number of the jurisdictions that we are licensed and regulated in. But our biggest offices in the United States is Chicago. And outside the United States is NASA on the Bahamas. All right, so you live in NASA? That's right. And is that a tough place to live? It's really tough. It's a hard life. And so how do you put up with the pleasure of going to the beach or not versus working? I'm, you know, for better or for worse, not the person most tempted in the world to go to the beach. I enjoy it being there. I like going there once every couple months. But I don't spend a lot of time outside. I'm pretty much just in the office. So you don't look like you have a tan or anything? No. No, not so much. In the case of cryptocurrencies today, I think it's now is a time to get in. It's good, or now is a time to wait to see where the market's going. The biggest thing I would say is don't put in more than you're fine losing. OK, so you're moving in on me quick. Just stradzing me with your fancy hands. I'm going to deal with your night because it's really bothering me. Ah, my night. Yeah. He's a troublemaker. Yeah. What did you get up to this weekend? You know, just robot stuff. A lot of chess. I was practicing for you. I know you're pretty good. Ooh, I don't like that. I will take this. Oh, put it over here. Not cool. Not cool. All right, I will. I will concede. I can see. Ah. Got me, Bid. Very good game. Well played. Thank you, sir. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1239,2022-10-09 18:20:30
13014," We will never break. We will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never. So very often when people get wealthy, they buy fancy shoots and so forth. You haven't gone to that phase yet, right? Not so much. Your outfit is pretty much standard. It's some kind of t-shirt, shorts, tennis shoes. Is that what you wear all the time? When I go to Washington, DC, I have a suit there because I have to wear it on the help. But outside of that, yeah. So are you thinking of buying a house to live in or where do you live? I live in nine colleagues and I bought a large apartment together on your office that we live in. I mean, I'm really fortunate to be able to have a really comfortable life and not have to worry ever about money for myself. But I'm not particularly excited to dive into luxury. I'm not excited about yachts. And I both think it's not what I should do with my money. I think I should be thinking about how I can help the world with it. And I also just isn't who I am. So do you go to Washington much to lobby with members of Congress and or regulators and is that an uplifting experience for you? So I go a lot. I'm there probably every few weeks. And it's been a surprisingly uplifting experience. I was not expecting that. I was expecting it to be a real slog. And I think it could have been in a slightly different universe where you saw continued boards going on between regulators and the industry. What we've tried really hard to do over the last year was get the industry to a place where it is happy to accept sensible regulation. And I think that's helped turn down the volume a little bit on the arguments. And did to a place where most people are honestly trying to engage on what's the important federal oversight that we need to give to the industry. How can we do that in a way that makes sense given how the industry operates? The crypto industry seems to want to be regulated by the CFTC. And some people want the SEC to be the principal regulator. Do you have a view on this? So in the end, both are going to be regulators. And you know, the CFTC is going to regulate commodity futures. So it's going to regulate very likely futures on tokens that are not securities. The SEC is very likely going to end up regulating spot security token markets. And there's some territory in between there when you look at spot commodity markets, when you look at what a security token futures regime might look like. Those may end up as joint regimes, they may end up in one place or the other. In principle, I'm fine with either a regulator or any combination of them. You know, I think that the non-security token aspect of this is a nice fit for the CFTC's regime. In our country, when you want to have some influence with government, very often people make campaign contributions as they're called. And you've become a large donor to political candidates. Is it because you want some influence on the policy of crypto or is it just you think these candidates are good public servants? It's mostly just looking for good public servants. Like that is by far the most important thing to me. And look, there are a lot of issues that matter. But there's also just this correlate aspect of like, are they going to be fighting to what they think is right for the country in general? And the single issue that I have sort of spent the most time thinking about the most money doing to on the political side is pandemic prevention, which is nothing to do with crypto. But it's ultimately what I think is one of the most important issues for the world over the next. So how do you find political fundraisers? They come to you directly. Is it easy to get to you and say, we need this money for this candidate? And what type of candidates do you tend to say?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1240,2022-10-09 18:25:09
13015," issues for the world over the next. So how do you find political fundraisers? They come to you directly? Is it easy to get to you and say, we need this money for this candidate? And what type of candidates do you tend to support? Oh, yeah. Well, if I pulled out my phone here and just looked at my last 10 text messages, about half of them are going to be people asking for, politics is asking for contributions. But those. Do you have a political expert advisor? Yeah. So I obviously ignore the text messages. I've got a few people on the ground in DC who are sort of actually running the operations days. So when you give money to a candidate and he or she gets elected, do they respond to you when you call them later or not really? Some do, some don't. And it's always super happy to talk, but it's not generally the primary goal. Like the primary goal is generally that I thought they would be a good legislator. You get involved with presidential campaigns or you're going to be involved in this campaign that's coming up in a couple of years? It's a good question. The answer is maybe it totally depends on who's running on what the race looks like. I'll give a couple thoughts. The first is, you know, I might be very involved. I might not be involved at all. I might be involved on either side or both. And in general, my sense is that primaries are really important. And I think this is true for the presidency as well. I think this is something a lot of people miss is that if your goal is partisan, then you basically have to operate in general elections. That's when you know, partisan splits are determined. But if your goal is getting like good public servants and people who are really fighting for what's right for the country, there are people who do and don't fit that description on both sides of the aisle. And you know, you have these contests which are way lower stakes from a partisan perspective. It gets rid of a lot of the noise and competition. And you know, there are great opportunities to support people who would just be good public servants. So you support people in both parties? Yeah. Okay. And today, you would not consider running for office yourself, right? I would be an insane thing for me to do is a fourth job to tack on to the other things I'm doing. And can you see doing this for another 10 years, 20 years, 30 years like this? I think so. I don't, I mean, when I get burnt out, I get burnt out because I'm out of useful things to do on a topic. I don't tend to get burnt out from worker stress. Well, crypto came along relatively recently. I guess Bitcoin was invented in 2009, but yeah. But relatively recently, it's become a big phenomenon. Do you see any other phenomenon like that that you might get involved with as well? Potentially. Look, eventually AI. I think, you know, right now we're at the stage of AI being mediocre chatbots instead of really bad chatbots. But that's going to change over time. And you'll mark to 10, 20 years from now, we may be having a very different conversation. So I have not bought any cryptocurrencies. I have invested in companies that service the industry, but I haven't bought crypto myself. Let's suppose I said I wanted to buy some crypto currencies. What would you recommend to me or anybody else? Well, first thing is I try not to give an investment and vice-ent what I would say is the most effective and useful thing you can do is just try everything out. Take $10, feed it through every protocol, feed it through every exchange, see what it's like. Get a first-hand experience of using a blockchain, using a blockchain explorer, doing trade, and that will teach you a lot about how the industry functions. I think I've been really interested in a few different areas of the space. I think it's been interested in scalable blockchains. I've been interested obviously in the exchange and platform space, especially on the regulated side. And then I'm super excited about the potential for blockchain-based social media to be sent that there are projects coming out in that area around where maintenance is in payments and around market structure. Those are the places that I'm looking at the most right now. So in the case of crypto currencies today, would you say it's now as a time to get in? It's good or now is a time to wait to see where the market's going? So I think what I would say is there's potentially a lot of profit you could make. You could also lose though. Like things can go up, things can go down. There is a lot of upside potential. The biggest thing I would say is don't put in more than you're fine losing. Like don't put in money that you would be really, really sad to lose into crypto right now. Think of it more as an upside play. When you leave this interview and you go outside, can you walk down the streets of New York without anybody bothering you? It's borderline. So I think probably a half a percent or a third of a percent or something of a people recognize me here. And so the real answer is like every 10 minutes that I'm walking on the streets, someone will recognize me roughly, it's a little bit in between. What you can do is get a comb, comb your hair, get a suit and then people will be your disguise.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1241,2022-10-09 18:29:19
13016," Every 10 minutes that I'm walking on the streets, someone will recognize me roughly, it's a little bit in between. What you can do is get a comb, comb your hair, get a suit, and then people will be able to be your disguise. It's true, I could just look normal, and that would, yeah. But do you have any thought of that? No, that's beyond me. We don't have enough women founder CEOs who are getting funding. So basically less than 2% of VC funds go to women, less than 1% go to women of color. And so in this innovation space, I said to myself, what's the best way to use capital to move things for women? And that's when I started to say, okay, I actually need to move some money into the venture capital space, and I want to do it smartly. I mean, the first goal is to make money. I'm not putting my money out as a social impact. I'm putting it out to make money. But I wanted to go behind funds like aspect ventures that's run by Theresa Gaugh and Jennifer Fondstadt, who are looking at these opportunities, and they have a thesis around my gosh. There are so many opportunities there if we go towards funding some of these women businesses. Some LPs have said to me, all we care about is returns. Some of the best investors may not be the best people, but they have the best returns. What do you have to say to those people? I have to say you're investing in what you know. And so you need to look at what trends are coming in the nation and how you're going to address them. Women are 85% of consumer dollars spent. Women control 70% of financial decisions in the house. So if you're not investing in products that go towards females or a women led company, you're missing an opportunity because you just don't see it. The markets are preparing to close, but the day is not over yet. A lot of volatility right now. You need the power of the Bloomberg terminal to get you market moving data before anyone else.

When the COVID pandemic brought global travel to a standstill in 2020, the impact on the hotel industry was devastating. It was like nothing you could have imagined. It was a shock. Was a kick in the butt. There's very little that didn't change during the pandemic for the global change. It's comparable to maybe five consecutive 9-11s what it did to demand. Marriott, the world's largest hotel chain, saw revenues plummet by 50% in 2020. Another blow came in early 2021 when CEO Arnie Sorenson lost his battle with pancreatic cancer. Long time, Marriott executive Tony Capuano succeeded Sorenson. And despite the setbacks, he's optimistic about the future. Part of my confidence in the ability to lead the company through this crisis is I have the benefit of what I've called a long 10-year battle tested team. A key member of this team is CFO Lini Oberg. She really is flappable in terms of the way in which she handles business challenges. I think she goes...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1242,2022-10-09 18:33:19
13017," in terms of the way in which she handles business challenges. I think she goes well beyond maybe the quote traditional CFO role. She's involved in every aspect of the business. The openings in Q4, we're still right on target. We've even had a couple in Europe at NET. Not only is she obviously a wonderful steward of the company's balance sheet, but I rely on her heavily as any leader would as we try to look around the corner. Part of our job is to make sure what the customers want, what are they thinking that they want next year and the next year, and that takes investment, and that takes thinking ahead of time of where you want to get. You could call Leni Oberg, Merriott's chief future officer. I always love finance. I did figure out that once I'd worked at a financial services firm, that it was a great experience for a few years, but that I ultimately wanted to join a team for a more long-term way to try to build a business. Oberg joined Merriott as part of its investor relations group in 1999. As is often the case for many people, things evolve. The company grows, opportunities show up, and I really was able to build a set of skills and experiences that help prepare me for the CFO role. Not only in corporate-level roles, but also operational and international. She's been chief financial officer since 2016, the year Merriott acquired Starb with Hotels and Resorts and became the largest hotel chain in the world. Although that scale remains an advantage, all the industry's major players are finding it crucial to innovate in the wake of an unprecedented disruption. That was the wake of code for rethinking some of the operations and to try to figure out smarter ways to operate. The large hotel chains are very much still in the mode of figuring out what the consumer is going to look like, what guest demands are, what preferences have changed. How does Merriott need to reinvent itself in these very uncertain times? I think a lot of the initiatives that were in place, a lot of the strategy that was in place, even before the pandemic began to unfold, will continue to serve us well, continued global growth. More than 60 percent of our pipeline is outside the United States today. I think that will continue to increase as a percentage. When you think about market share for the company, inside the US, we have about a 16-percent share of the hotel rooms. While outside the US, we have 3 percent. But no doubt I would expect that we will see greater growth rates of our rooms outside the US than inside the US. Does that mean that you'll be putting more investments over sea as well? Well, investments is an interesting word. But the capital structure of deals varies a lot by market. So for example, in some markets in Asia Pacific, there's far less use of debt. While in the US, there is much more use of debt to construct a hotel. So the investment needs are often different for an owner outside the US than inside the US. Notice as she refers to owners. That's because Merriott owns a very small percentage of properties that carry its name. The majority are owned and operated by franchisees, while the company operates others under long-term management agreements. This asset-lied business model presents a CFO with a unique set of opportunities and challenges. Because we don't own all of our hotels, we have far less debt. We would never have been able to grow as fast as we've grown and become more attractive to our customers without having the capital from all these hundreds of owners providing capital. The challenges of the model are you're managing a lot of different constituencies. You have to really consider the owner's needs and what's going on in the financing markets. I'd say the biggest challenges around prior-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1243,2022-10-09 18:37:43
13018," And what's going on in the financing markets, I'd say the biggest challenge is around prioritization. About really picking your spots, going after them, going after them quickly with your investment dollars, and then adapting as times change. And in a time of rapid change, Maryann has made it a priority to invest in technology. We've worked really hard to improve productivity and to be able to come up with innovation that both is attractive to the customer but also helpful to the owners. The fact that you can now go and have your mobile key and not have to stop by the front desk and that you can communicate about how you want your pillows, etc. all on your smartphone. That's both great for the customer. That's also great for the hotel. It allows them to plan better, allows them to run it more efficiently. There have been wonderful innovations. We're not done. We've got plenty more to go. I think the key is to really enhance technology but to realize that technology doesn't replace the face-to-face interaction. I have to make sure we do things right. After all, it's my name over the door. We are a people first business, but how do we utilize technology to enhance the services we can deliver and make those services more efficient? With the cost of wages going up and the cost of doing business, increasing every year, we have to figure out how to do more with what we have and how to utilize technology to become better at our craft. Coming up, Linny Oberg shows me how classic hospitality needs cutting-edge technology at one of Mary-Uts' iconic hotels. On the digital platform, you can do so much in terms of communicating with your customers. And guess what? It's also economically really efficient to be doing it that way. It's all about engagement. This is Bloomberg. Watch Bloomberg surveillance early edition for the news you need when you need it. I'm Daniel O'Kaley-Line's in New York and Ann Edwards in London. I'm a straight-ass central bank. This is interesting, twice as much as Paul Carson. Then surveillance for in-depth analysis. Outside Tom Kane and Lisa Brownbitt, some Jonathan Ferro, the RPA, Frontsen Sense. How does Japan get away with not raising rates? Can it sustain its normal at a time when everybody else is facing a very different reality? Bloomberg surveillance. Be informed. Be prepared. Be ahead of the game. Founded in 1927 as a root beer stand in Washington, DC, Merriott has grown from a tiny family business into the world's largest provider of hotel rooms. As it's added, millions of new customers, it's also expanded its customer loyalty programs. We were the first in the industry to have a loyalty program, so we understand the value and the importance of it. But in 2020, the public health crisis that ravaged global travel also threatened the consumer engagement these programs had built. Some of our most loyal customers didn't stay in a hotel for a year, but through our branded credit card programs, through the partnership with Uber that we rolled out, we found other mechanisms to keep connected with our customers, even in a period where they were grounded, not traveling at all. The partnership with Uber allowed Merriott-Volmvoy members to earn points through vines and food orders. The credit card partnerships not only kept Merriott connected with customers, they connected the company with funds at a critical moment. What Merriott as well as Hilton did, they were in a position to generate cash by pre-selling points to their credit card partners. That shows just how much the credit cards value the relationship. And if you're willing to make a $1 billion cash advance to a hotel company, that stock price had dropped by 80-85%, means you really value the relationship and you trust the partner. You truly trust the partner. They'll make millions and millions of dollars from the branding of their credit cards. And then additionally with that, the consumers get the points on that. What we're seeing quite a bit this year is a lot of redemption of those points now that the world is opening up again. We've enabled our customers to have more...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1244,2022-10-09 18:42:01
13019," What we're seeing quite a bit this year is a lot of redemption of those points now that the world is opening up again. We've enabled our customers to have more choices in how to redeem those points. They can redeem them within our hotels. They can redeem them outside of our hotels with the partnerships that we have through experiences, etc. But I think it really helps our customers stay within the ecosystem of Marion. I got a view of that ecosystem from Lini Oberg when she showed me around the Merriott Marquine Times Square. Originally opened in 1985, the hotel was recently given a $135 million renovation. We started in the newly remodeled M-Club Lounge, a premier amenity for Bomboy members. Making our loyalty members now $157 million strong, making them feel welcome, special and appreciated for their frequent travel with us really matters. It feels like you're trying to own the full experience of travel, whether it's through your co-branded cards or your travel insurance. Why is it important to bring your guests into this ecosystem? It's all about engagement. One of the most important things is looking around the corner. What are the trends that you're seeing in customers, particularly in the digital commerce space? It before, obviously, so many of our reservations were made by the telephone. We now see that well over a third of our reservations are made on our app. And on the digital platform, you can do so much in terms of communicating with your customers. And guess what? It's also economically really efficient to be doing it that way. The digital future is already in place for married guests, transforming everything from the checking process to the traditional boom key. But even as technology creates efficiencies, there are areas of rising cost on the horizon. After making deep staff cuts in 2020, married needs to rebuild its workforce. For sure, the most painful part of this entire pandemic was about the furloughs and the layoffs that we had to do. It was necessary to survive, to make sure we got through to the other side. Now the company not only faces competition for workers in an economy reshaped by the pandemic. It's trying to do this while wages in the industry are rising, and when customers and employee expectations are in a state of flux. One of the real things that sets a hotel apart from a home sharing platform like Airbnb is the services that they offer to guests. So there's an incredible tension as they work through what those guest expectations are, what their strategic placement in the market is, and what their labor cost needs actually are. So I do think they need to leverage technology to reduce the number of unskilled jobs in hotel operation. But they really need to provide jobs that require high level of skills so that they can reallocate part of their payroll to fewer workers and pay them them. We have been able to hire 40,000 people since the beginning of the year in 2021, and where you see it is in certain really hot markets. It's where you can see the shortages, but generally overall it is improving. Technology may help Mariett meet this challenge as well. The company is rolling out a new labor management system that will more precisely match staffing to customer demand. This labor management system allows a hotel to much more assigned labor just in time. So you're able to say, I see what's coming over the next couple days. I can work the shifts in a way that frankly gives the associates more flexibility, but also makes the staffing levels more appropriate. It used to be prior that it would be more, okay, I'm going to plan for all of next month done your work shift, you know what it is. Now there's more flexibility and more adaptability to what's happening in the business of a hotel. Flexibility and agility will be critical assets for Mary and in the foreseeable future.

13020," Community will be critical assets for Mary and in the foreseeable future. With leisure travel driving the demand recovery and the forecast for business travel still uncertain, hotel companies are hoping to attract a hybrid customer, adapting their spaces and services to a category known as Pleasure. You're going to be reminding people to say, hey, you know, take your family for the weekend, but maybe stay an extra night and we have the business center and we have the guaranteed Wi-Fi and reception that can ensure that you can get business done from perhaps the pool or the beach on a come Monday morning. Where I'm a business traveler, where I likely will choose mobile check-in, mobile key, come up the elevator straight to my room. Then I may go on a family vacation. I want to talk to the front desk clerk and find out about a restaurant that no tourists are aware of. So now when you look around this hotel and you look before it would be really easy to tell exactly who was on a business trip and who was here, you know, seeing the city for leisure, now much more of a blend. People staying longer over a weekend. That means we need to have space that works for everyone, no matter what the purpose. For hotels, conventions, big events, drawing big revenue, right? What do you do after the pandemic when perhaps we won't have as many conventions and events as in the past? Well, I think first of all, we ultimately will. That business is coming back. I think one of the interesting things we're seeing in the group business is that people are not canceling farther out. They're canceling really close in where there's still some discomfort in traveling, but where there is bookings that they feel comfortable doing in the next few months, those bookings are ramping up. So we've seen group get better and better and better with each quarter of this year and we're actually really excited about what we see in 2022. Lini Oberg's job always keeps her on her toes and when she's not on the job, her favorite pursuits are active as well. I love to run, been part of a women's running group for 23 years and we still run together three times a week. How does that help you in the day-to-day job and the grind that it is to be a CFO of such a big corporation? You know, it's always been for me a way to clean my head. You know, a lot of people say they run with music. I generally don't run with anything. I really like the time to think, reflect. You've always heard the saying that people get their best ideas when they're out for run. There's no doubt there's something to that. Up next, Lini Oberg believes that chief future officer must be a good listener to be a good leader. I actually find that the listening is where some of the best decisions get made. And she says some of the best ideas come from a business culture of diversity. Over 60% of my global finance team are women. Over a third are people of color. It makes us a better company, not only from ideas but from performance. This is Bloomberg. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. Like just be honest, we've had sort of a shift in our way in some sort of circulation fears moment. People were talking about that all day yesterday. Imagine simply climbing a cable into space. The concept is known as the space elevator. Not only could it significantly change how we leave planet earth, but it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space. And they're a scientist who think we could have already built it. We have the material, we have the technology, we have the lasers, we have the climbers, we have all of them. If a private entity wants to build it or a government, they can build it. It'll change society. We have no clue how colonizing in the space, how really spreading out in the space, really change our society over the next 50 to 200 years. It'll be completely different.

In February 2021, the Merriot Foundation announced a $20 million endowment to launch the Merriot Sorenson Center for Hospitality Leadership and Howard University. The partnership with a historically black institution aims not just to bring more diversity to the industry, but to give students the tools to rise to the top. So when we first spoke about this, it was about building a true partnership, really trying to solve for this year. And that is the lack of underrepresented minorities, especially at the upper echelon of these industries. And that is problematic. And what this is is to provide a solution. I think the positioning of that center is really unique in being one of the first to say that, tragically, we will not develop entry-level workers. We're going to develop people that you will need to take seriously. When you look at the travelers around the globe, it's a very diverse group of travelers. And promoting diversity promotes new thought, new ideas. It makes organizations stronger, it makes organizations better. It requires deliberate focus to drive the sort of diverse workforce that we want. If you look at our C-suite, more than 50% of my direct reports are diverse. If you look at our board, more than 50% of our board composition is diverse. On the diversity inclusion side, I'm particularly proud in finance. We have over 60% of my global finance team are women. Over a third are people of color. It makes us a better company, not only from ideas, but from performance. The number of women chief financial officers has been steadily rising over the last decade and a half. A study of nearly 700 companies shows their representation doubling since 2004. Lineo Bergen tends to keep the trend towards diversity going as a mentor in all areas of business. One of my overall beliefs is really important for leaders to be approachable. And so the more that I can talk to anyone in my shop or frankly even out of my discipline about what they're doing and how they're thinking about it, hopefully it's helpful for both them and for the company. Unflappable, responsible and approachable. Lineo work has the expertise and the people skills to steer merit into the future. I asked her what she sees when she looks ahead. What's the opportunity for Merriott in the next 10 years that most excites you? We are all about being the world's favorite travel company and there are so many more places for us to grow and so many more ways for us to connect with our consumers. I do think our size and scale gives us a unique opportunity and when I think about those opportunities we got to get at them, we got to make sure that we go and take advantage of them. And so a lot of this is about the translation of business strategy and financial resources and putting them together in a way that provides value to all of our constituencies. What's the challenge for Merriott in the next 10 years that keeps you up at night? Pace of change. Pace of change. So all of us have seen that technology has meant that the pace of change has only accelerated.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1247,2022-10-09 18:55:07
13022," You know, all of us have seen that technology has meant that the pace of change has only accelerated. When I think about when we would start a brand initiative 20 years ago, versus when you start it now and how quickly it takes to get it done and rolled out, and what customers expect. They expect things really quickly. All of us, you know, you go on your smartphone, you're like, well, why didn't I get that answer right away? And I think that is one of our biggest challenges is trying to keep up with the pace of change. How do you see your role as CFO changing in the next 10 years? Of course, you've got the standard parts of the CFO role in reporting accurately and with great transparency of our results and our state of health, critically important. But just as important is really helping the company find ways to accelerate growth. For me, it is very much about how to enable the growth that we want to achieve. What's a skill set or area of expertise that the CFO will need to develop in the next 10 years? Deep understanding of technology and where technology is going. I think it's number one. I think communication skills, the need for good communication skills, is only going to continue to increase. You know, the old days, you had the classic view of the CFO with the green eye shades kind of sitting and making sure the numbers all got tallied appropriately. I think it's much broader now. And it really is about making sure that all the constituencies understand the strategy and the value that you're trying to deliver. What's the best advice that you'd give to somebody who got promoted to the CFO level today? Love what you do. It's really important that you love what you do. And then the other one is about listening. You know, as a leader, there's this expectation that perhaps you're going to come out with what everybody should go do and the edict of this is the way we go. I actually find that the listening is where some of the best decisions get made. By listening to team members so that you can say, I want to take part of that point of view and that point of view to get to the best decision and strategy for the company. And that takes really listening. Leaders who listen are essential to a company that's determined to innovate, especially when its industry is in transition.

When the price of anything goes up, the consequences reach far beyond what you'd expect. But perhaps most of all, when it comes to food. In 2010, surging food prices helped spark the Arab Spring. Lives were lost, regimes fell and the consequences are still with us. Once again, food prices are rising and fast. Energy costs, broken supply chains, and surging demand were just some of the factors that have driven food prices to their first record high since the Arab Spring. And that's all before a war between two of the world's biggest food producers. Ukraine is called the Bread Basket of Europe, and taken with Russia the two account for about a quarter of global wheat trade. They produce more than half of the world's sunflower seeds in oil, nearly 20% of the barley. Now throw in rising energy prices and processing, transporting, even refrigerating food gets more expensive. Plus, fertilizer production is extremely energy intensive. Less fertilizer means lower crop yield and prices rise even more. The pandemic revealed how complicated and fragile global trade systems are. Global agriculture, perhaps even more so. Unlike metals, for example, food goes bad. And crops take months to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1248,2022-10-09 18:59:30
13023," Revealed how complicated and fragile global trade systems are, global agriculture perhaps even more so. Unlike metals for example, food goes bad. And crops take months to grow and are vulnerable to unpredictabilities like the weather. Rising food prices will be felt everywhere, but the poorest countries in the world will be hit the hardest. And as all these factors compound, the real fear is that record high will lead to record high and ultimately to a global food crisis with vast consequence. This knowledge and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer, disrupt. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. This is a market that over the past few weeks has made it clear it wants to go higher. It got a little spooked by the idea that geopelittle potential rises. We make it very transparent to the shopper before they accept an order. What the order is going to look like, how much work on a pays them and how much consumer is paying them. And so they can decide whether they take an order or whether they refuse it. And that's the kind of flexibility that our shoppers really value and the kind of transparency that they want. Are you seeing a labor shortage right now? And what are you doing to combat that? It's different in different places or demographic of shoppers is completely different from food delivery and right sharing, where 70% women and half of them are moms. And that's because a lot of the job at Instacart is very different than just being in a car with strangers. It's about like going to the store, doing a good job of customer service, of really picking the right products for the consumer. And we are seeing that being very appealing to women. I talked to you about my own sort of fear of kids playing too much. A friend was like, try to think of it like a painting. Like show it, ask him to show it to you. Like the same way you would treat a painting. I want to see what you made. Yeah, that's right. So make it a family. Do you have kids? I have two daughters. Do they play? Yeah, they're older now. But they, not a lot. Because like growing up, I think it was always the thing that dad did. He's in charge of one of the top gaming consoles in the world. Microsoft Xbox, a $16 billion business, home to Minecraft, Halo, and perhaps soon, Call of Duty. If a $70 billion deal to buy Activision goes through, the executive behind that deal is Phil Spencer. And if he has his way, he hopes the gaming industry will level up in the next 20 years. And be less a battle between rival consoles and more home to platforms that reach every potential gamer on the planet. Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer. So we're going to start by going in the way back machine. A little bit. Did some research. You worked at a computer mart in Vancouver, Washington, where you were selling and playing a lot of computer games in the 80s. Yeah. I'm thinking like stranger things. Stranger things resonates with my, yeah, definitely growing up my inner geekdom is there. I'm going to need some photographic evidence of this. What were your most played?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1249,2022-10-09 19:03:45
13024," Things. Stranger Things resonates with my, yeah, definitely, growing up my inner geekdom is there. I'm going to need some photographic evidence of this. What were your most played games in the 80s? So it was funny when I started growing up playing video games, most of it was going to the arcades. Now most people won't remember these days of like going to a store where you'd put quarters in play. Robatron was one of my favorites in the arcades. I would go play that. And then probably more in the 70s and the 80s, I remember my dad bringing a video game, the Atari 2600, with the cartridges home. And I was kind of the beginning of it and it just kept playing. And it's still with me. You started out at Microsoft as an intern. I did. In 1988. How would you compare Microsoft's history on games under Bill Gates versus Steve Balmer versus Sacha Medella? Yeah, I think like many things at Microsoft back in the 80s, we started in video games as much out of kind of a defensive. We were worried that other companies might be putting the home PC in place. And the avenue to get there was through video games and game consoles. So we said, OK, we're going to go start our own game console. Because if anybody's going to build a computer for the home, we wanted it to be Microsoft. I think through Steve's years, it was more about growing the business and how do we bring business leadership into this group of Ragtag people who are out there just having fun building video games as part of Xbox. I think when I first took this job, and I got this job as head of Xbox about two months after Sacha Medella became the CEO of Microsoft. Well, and when Sacha started, there were activist investors targeting the company. Yeah. The stock hadn't been doing well. They were targeting Xbox. Absolutely. Yeah. At the time, absolutely right, that there was a question of why are we in video games? In fact, one of his first questions to me was because he had come from the cloud part of the business being in the cloud, he didn't actually understand why we're in video games. Not as a negative, just as literally, why is Microsoft at the time, what $1 trillion market cap company? Why are we in the video game business? And he challenged us. Like, let's go figure out why we're in the video game space and see if it makes sense. And if it does, let's be all in. And if it doesn't, we'd make other decisions. Early in that journey is when this game, which I know you know about, is Minecraft. And the opportunity to acquire Minecraft came about months after this moment. So. I might have a kid or two that plays Minecraft, yes. And it really caused us as a team to think about, OK, if you're going to go spend $2.5 billion on this blocky Java-based game, how does this fit into the mission of this company? Let's talk about that strategy. Was the idea to tie gaming to the cloud? Was that the clincher? If you think about a game like Minecraft or Fortnite or Roblox, these are games that play on iPads, they play on Xboxes, PlayStation, PCs, that games were going from per device to per user. And cloud would be an enabler for that. But we didn't start with how do we fit cloud into video games. We were just kind of watching the trends of creators and where they were building and saw this transformation of games being ubiquitous. How does this all, as you see it, connect to Microsoft's future? The cool thing I see going on now, and it does fit with the investments Microsoft's making in Azure and other places, is today, the world, anybody's a creator. And video games are going through that same transformation where if I rewind to my childhood in playing video games, I walked into an egghead software, and there was a line of boxes. We might go create the best game in the world, but there was no way for us to get it in front of an actual person who might want to go play, because we couldn't get shelf space, all these things. Today, we see gamers on our creators on our platform from all over the globe, who can create a game that can literally reach billions of people through our distribution capability to a player a game is a game. And you can deliver that game through the cloud to anybody who has a device that's capable of reaching the internet. I hear you're still an avid gamer. How often do you play games? Like, how many hours? I go to bed early, so I got to bed at 10. It's Seattle at 10 o'clock. People who play with me online, they tease me about how militant I am at 10 o'clock. I'm out. I probably play 15 hours a week. As I understand it, you do your own deals. You don't necessarily need permission from Satcha to do a deal. Is that true? No, there's no.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1250,2022-10-09 19:08:35
13025," 15 hours a week. As I understand it, you do your own deals. You don't necessarily need permission from SOTJA to do a deal. Is that true? No, there's definitely... It depends on the amount of the money in the deal. But when we think about some of our bigger deals, we go to the board. And so, Sotty and Adela, Amy Hood, the CFO, have been incredibly supportive. As Xbox, we're one of the biggest consumer businesses in the company. We're a brand that makes Microsoft relevant to a whole generation that probably doesn't think about a lot of other Microsoft products in their day-to-day life. Activision specifically is facing a lot of challenges here. There have been lawsuits, there have been employee walkouts. How much did that concern you when you were thinking about this deal? You will shed light on dark matter. You will make aging optional. You will turn 5G up to 11. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge, and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer, disrupt. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. Back in 1997, I was interested in the following question, which is, there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called Saurapod dinosaurs, which had really long skinny necks. So Apodosaurus is an example. Now, it's had really long skinny tails. So I made a computer model that showed that in fact, the tail of these Saurapod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip, a bullfip. Now, the way a bullfip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. And that crack is a sonic boom. I think the way they got a date was to impress the females by making loud booms. Well, you're in the process of a potentially monster deal, $70 billion acquisition of Activision. Talk to us about how this deal came together. When we were thinking about on that idea of what are we capable of doing today and where do we need to go? The biggest gaming platform on the planet is mobile phones. One and a half billion people play on mobile phones. And I guess, regretfully as Microsoft, it's not a place where we have a native platform. As gaming coming from console and PC, we don't have a lot of creative capability that has built hit mobile games. One thing about the video game space is if you've been around maybe too long, you know most of the creators out there. So you kind of know teams that could be a good fit in terms of what we were trying to do. But we really started the discussions internally, at least, on Activision Blizzard around the capability they had on mobile and then PC with Blizzard. Those are the two things that we're really driving our interest. Big tech is under a lot of regulatory scrutiny. Big tech deals are under scrutiny. What's the status of the deal? What are your conversations with regulators been like? I kind of come at this that big deals should be scrutinized. I think that's the role of regulators why they're in place. I feel good about the progress that we've been making. Asking good hard questions about what is our intent? What does this mean? If you play it out over five years, is this constricting a market? I feel good about it. Microsoft had its time in the antitrust spotlight. Now the spotlight's on Google and Muddah and Apple and Amazon. How is it that Microsoft has skirted the spotlight? Your competitors might say it's unfair. Well, I think your point about us having grown through that time. I might call that the adolescent years for us as we were kind of learning. I think it's an important consideration that we did learn a lot as a company through that time and what it meant. And I think that sticks with us.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1251,2022-10-09 19:12:36
13026," Says we were kind of learning. I think is an important consideration that we did learn a lot as a company through that time and what it meant. And I think that sticks with us today. You've been a really big advocate of cross platform play and this idea that gamer should be allowed to play whatever games they want on whatever platform they want. Why is that so important to you? Maybe you happen in your household to buy an Xbox and I buy a PlayStation and our kids want to play together and they can't because we bought the wrong piece of plastic to plug into our television. It just seems that these artificial constraints that the industry might put up for near term kind of business dynamics in the long run. If you take a business that is at 3 billion people growing to 4 billion people over the next decade and saying how do we continue to grow this business reducing friction for our customers as an industry has to be at the top. So how far does this go? Does this mean that Activision gave that call of duty? You'll be able to play on any platform and perpetuity? I don't know what that means and forever. When you think about how long and it's not for any kind of nefarious business reason, it's just like what do we even platforms mean 10 years ago? I think the definition of some of these things might change over time. But our expectation is we want more people to play. So I know you're working with Sony on some things for the benefit of gamers. Can you talk to us about that a little bit? We have a pretty big publishing footprint on PlayStation as well as Nintendo, which means we have good relationships with those platforms because we're there big part of our business and we're a big part of their business. I think our long-term ambition of where we see this industry growing is also shared. I think the area where things get stuck a little bit, it's in the kind of near midterm competition. If somebody walks into a store and they have $500 bill, they're either going to walk out with a switch, which is what most people buy. Or they're going to walk out with a PlayStation 5 or they're going to walk out with an Xbox or maybe somebody will go buy a Windows PC. But in that world of somebody's got to make a decision for one platform over another in the beginning, that is where I think we get stuck in some of the kind of near-term competition. I don't think that's bad. It's just the dynamic of each of us pushing each other to build the best product for our customers. Now, while you've been working to make the gaming industry more collaborative, the gaming industry has historically been tough for women, for diverse voices. When you look back on Game or Gate, do you think you did enough? I can always look back at any incident for me and think about things that in hindsight, I should have done more. I should have done better. I'm proud of how our team evolves, how our leadership team evolves. There's societal issues around us. The gaming industry is not immune to those. People in my position sitting here as kind of old white guys ahead of gaming platforms, not in more than norm than I should be. And I talk about 3 billion people who play video games. And if you say your audience is 3 billion people, then the demographic is the planet's demographic. I want our team to reflect the customer that we aspire to earn. I know that our teams ship their culture with every product that they ship. Well, Activision specifically is facing a lot of challenges here. There have been lawsuits. There have been employee walkouts. There have been accusations of sexual harassment, sexual assault. How much did that concern you when you were thinking about this deal? We had access to data from the company before we announced the acquisition to see what the actual numbers were in terms of reports. We definitely, as a team, signed up to say, just like we're on our own journey with Xbox, that we're going to expand that journey if this deal closes. It's a lot of people and a lot of people that will feel very dedicated to and committed to building a great workplace environment for them. That's true of any of our studios, right? But it's obviously a conversation that you're going to have. You think about the board of Microsoft. And when they're thinking about the deal and they're typing into their search engine, Activision, what are the headlines that they're coming back? And there were questions that we had. We've learned from this. We will continue to learn. And we're committed to that journey. Not only for the betterment of our teams, but our customers, the creators on our platform. We think it's critical to our business success that we make progress here. Is Bobby Codic going to stay on? Yeah, I'm not in a position to make comments about their leadership team. We're in the regulatory phase and how that will close. When the deal closes, then we have say in how they're managed and how it goes. But until that point, I'm not really in position to say.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1252,2022-10-09 19:17:16
13027," Phase and how that will close. When the deal closes, then we have say in how they're managed and how it goes, but until that point, I'm not really in position to say. There have been very specific allegations of Bobby being aware of things. That happened and not reporting it to the board. What has he communicated to you about what he knew, what he didn't know? The discussions we've had were about the teams where they're at. Can they make the progress they need to make? The closing is a long process. Are they putting in the work that they need to put in to move along their journey? I believe they're committed to that. When I look at the work that they're doing now, there's always more that can be done. Activision has divisions that are unionizing. I know Microsoft has said they'll recognize those unions. What does that look like? I've never run an organization that has unions in it. What I can say in working through this is we recognize workers' needs to feel safe and heard and compensated fairly in order to do great work. We thought it was important to make a public statement on that front for workers that are there that are making decisions about their employment and what that relationship looks like to understand what it would mean if Microsoft was able to close the deal. When I think about the environment on any of our teams, I build from a perspective of people building a workplace where people feel like they can do their best work in a sustainable way and they could see this as a long-term career for themselves. So if Xbox employees decided to unionize with Microsoft support that? We knew we made the public statement that it wasn't that it would have a broader impact than just the impact of what would potentially happen on the close of Activision Blizzard. My view on metaverse is gamers have been in the metaverse for 30 years. Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world recalibrates. Often decades of stagnation, Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation. Corporate giants, policymakers and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that. Every week on Japan ahead, right here on Bloomberg Television. Innovation, money and power collide in Silicon Valley and beyond. Bloomberg Technology with Emily Chang. Weekdays at 5pm in New York and 2pm in San Francisco. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. We have to get interest rates higher and bring inflation back to our targets. It's better to pass this become a scarce. We are running on thin ice. No one deliberately wants to go into battle but we sneak walk into conflict. With unmatched reach and resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. So let's talk about some of the broader trends. You and I talked a lot during the pandemic, gameplay surge. Yeah. During the pandemic, we were all stuck at home. Has that changed? It has changed. We've seen gameplay hours come down a bit, which I will say I think is a good thing. People should get outside, people should moderate. Long-term growth trajectory for the business is incredibly durable and strong. You have adults now that have grown up playing like myself and it's become a more normal part of how people entertain and how families spend time. As the economy has tightened for consumers, as gas prices are higher, people are worried about what their home economics are. What their home economics situation looks like. We're seeing gameplay hours kind of stay strong. I think from a value perspective, gaming is a good value for people in a time of kind of economic constriction. People bought Minecraft, they can continue to go play Minecraft. What about supply chain? What challenges are you still seeing? Are all the consoles that you want to have made and time for the holidays going to be here? I still think demand will outstrip supply.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1253,2022-10-09 19:21:12
13028," What about supply chain? What challenges are you still seeing? Are all the consoles that you want to have made in time for the holiday is going to be here? I still think demand will outstrips supply for us this holiday. We will see when we get into 2023. You'll start to see more that supply is catching up with demand and maybe actually see one in the store when you walk in. And what's the future of the console? I mean, our console is going to be around in 10 years. If even Microsoft is your sort of deemphasizing. I equate in my head gaming on console to gaming on a television, but absolutely people are playing on more screens. And I think for us as a platform, if we don't adopt that as part of our strategy, we're kind of pushing against what our customers are asking for. We talked a bit about kids earlier and as a mom, I'm always slightly terrified that my kids are playing too much. Video games are ruining their brains. They're going to be exposed to all this bad stuff. That's all the positive things. You're a very pro game for kids. And I wonder how do you support that? As a parent, you know what's best for your kid first. Like I'm not going to say what's best for any individual's kids. What we can say in the research backs this up, that gaming can be a great on ramp for kids into STEM education as they think about, well, how are these games built? I also think the community power of gaming is something that doesn't get talked about enough. Last night, I was playing Escape Room on Xbox with one of my friends. And while the conversation might start about how are we going to escape from this room, then we're talking about his daughter who's looking at colleges. And we just talk about life, like people will when they're in the same place. And I think that ability for gaming, whether it's with kids or adults, to bring people from different backgrounds, different geographies, different socio-economic, different religion, different genders together, and shared experiences, is pretty unique out there. And I think building those connections that video games can enable, maybe this is too altruistic, but there aren't enough of those things in the world today. Which brings me to the metaverse. You know, obviously, Sasha came on my show. I hope that this is the next big thing that happens off to the mobile internet. Facebook changed its name, to meta. Some gamers don't even want this whole metaverse thing. My view on metaverse is gamers have been in the metaverse for 30 years. When you're playing games, if you're playing a world of warcraft game, you're playing in roadblocks. When you're playing in a racing game, where everybody's in a shared world, these 3D shared worlds that gamers have been playing in for years and years, I think what we've found is there's more connection as I was talking about before, because we have shared purpose. It's not at all surprising to me that gamers might look at metaverse and think, well, I don't really get it, because we've already, I already have an avatar of myself. And I can already go into a shared world, and I can already sit there and have voice conversations with people anywhere. But I do think the skills that we have as game designers and game creators make a ton of sense in a lot of enterprise experiences. And this is why Satti gets excited about it. What about crypto? Play to earn is all the rage right now. Play to earn specifically is something I'm cautious about. It creates a worker force out of players for certain players to kind of monetize. Now, to be fair for us in the game industry, this has existed for years and years. There have been gold farmers of people who literally just spend their time doing some menial task in a game to accrue some currency that they could sell to some other rich player in for real money so that that person doesn't have to spend their time. Now you find games that are starting to build that into the economy of the game itself. We made some comments in Minecraft about how we view NFTs in this space because we saw people doing things that we thought were exploitive in our product and we said we don't want that. I think sometimes it's hammer looking for a nail when these technologies come up. But the actual human use or player use in our case of these technologies. I think there could be some interesting things. So let's talk about your priorities looking forward. You're in the middle of trying to do this really big deal. Are we going to see you keep doing deals? Are you still on the look out for new studios or new geographic locations where you want to build out Microsoft's gaming presence? Definitely on the second part geographic expansion is critically important. We've hired our first people in Nigeria now as part of our team.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1254,2022-10-09 19:25:42
13029," Definitely on the second part, geographic expansion is critically important. We've hired our first people in Nigeria now as part of our team. We have teams in India, teams in South America. You know, again, when I talk about 3 billion gamers, I'll just use Africa for a second. Like 1.2 billion people in the continent. Average age is what, 20 or 21. I think it's very, very likely that the next big hit games that we're going to see are not from the traditional locations, not from the traditional people. I think that's fantastic. So geographic expansion is critical. Cloud is important to that as we put our data centers in places. And we can not only distribute the games, but allow creators to use our cloud development platforms to build games without having to have the local hardware right there in their house or in their office to go build. I think that is important. So we're going to do a little rapid fire. What video games are you playing now? Cult of the Lamb. Most important meeting you've ever played a game in. You trying to give me trouble plus games? Have you ever just played a game in a meeting with Sasha? It's easier on teams calls because they can't see your screen. You're not in the cereal with people. I have played games. Sauti has caught me playing games before. And yeah, I'd say a Sauti meeting. I plead the fifth. What's your favorite thing to do when you're not gaming? Of all things, snowboard with my family. You have a lot of gaming fans. Who do you fan over? One of the things I love to go do is find a game I've never heard of and go spend time with it and then talk to the creators about it. I think creating something, putting it out there is such a brave thing to do. If you could see any band in their prime, who would it be? Wow. So I'm a punk rock fan. So I'd probably go back and say like the Ramones. Best piece of advice for your 20s. When I think about at least my career, not the only lens I have, there have been a number of times when others have made bets on me that I probably didn't think I was ready for, including the job I'm in now. And to listen to the others around you when they are making a bet on you, when they're pulling you to go do things, at least for me who has probably read a cent, maybe a little imposter syndrome kicking in on was I really ready for something. But understand that others around you when they're encouraging you, that they're probably doing it for good reason. How do you balance work life and play? My little 15 minute commute back and forth is my transition zone of I'm now at work, I'm now at home. I don't even have a home office because when I'm home, I'm not at work. Like it's just always been my thing is that segmentation with my family and what I do. It doesn't mean I've never responded to a male when I'm at home. But I'm very regimented that way. When COVID happened, it didn't work and it didn't work emotionally, it didn't work output-wise, like motivation. And I was pretty transparent about that with the people around me and how I had to change things. Does that mean you want everyone else to come back to the office? No, people have to work in the way that works for them. What is the gaming industry look like in five years and what does it look like in 20 years? We're going to see video games really gain their space in telling stories that really change people's perspective on others lived experience. And I think that's a pretty cool thing. All right, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Perfectly done.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1255,2022-10-09 19:30:14

Bloomberg markets the close weekdays on Bloomberg. Today is the most significant day in the history of the NCAA. The last day on planet earth in the United States of America in college athletics where name, image, and likeness laws will not be on the books. And kids will be not allowed to make money off of their name, image, and likeness. Today's the last day that amateurism has at least a shadow meaning in our culture. Major ruling from the Supreme Court involved in getting it. The most seismic change in college sports happened in 2021 and its aftershocks are still ricocheting across the landscape. Non-Pro athletes getting paid for use of their name, image, and likeness. Until last year banned by the NCAA is now allowed and it's changing the face of sports and business radically. According to open and doors, brands spent almost a billion dollars in the first year of the new rules. And that number is only going to grow. But some of the biggest winners, they may surprise you. Top female athletes are caching in and women's basketball players are standing center stage. You're heels, you want your heels to go down. You took a pre-ride poop. And I always really is pretty surreal. I don't think I really wrap my head around the concept that I am making money. Just doing the thing that I love. Starting her sophomore year, Aisy Fudds already signed deals with Chipotle, American Eagle, and others. Running tens of thousands of dollars, leveraging her on court prowess and off court social media following. She's also getting massive investment from the pro game as well, becoming one of the first athletes to sign with Steph Curry's SC30 Inc. The two even designed a shoe together. One Steph Curry would wear during his 2021 NBA Finals MVP performance. It's an investment directly into a future player, but also the future of women's basketball. And especially for the women's game, NIL deals may not only benefit.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1256,2022-10-09 19:34:02
13031," It's an investment directly into a future player, but also the future of women's basketball. And especially for the women's game, NIL deals may not only benefit the students, but the pro-game as well. I'm gonna call Carly knows everything. Hey! Hi, Carly. I held my TV mounted on the wall in my room, and I'm wondering if I'm moving back into the same room? Can I just take the TV off and leave the mouse? Kind of all the little things that I said I have too much of. AZFUD can almost trick you into thinking she's just a regular college student. You can't judge me by what you see here today. We just finished our summer session, so I'm about to move out, I gotta completely move out to remove in the exact same apartment. I'm starting to stress me out, I gotta carry this back. Who's gonna help you move all the bait stuff out? Oh, well you see, I leave tomorrow, so I will be probably playing at all nighter, but not if my mom is watching this, I will be going to sleep early and getting my rest. Don't let a messy dorm room and procrastination fool you, though. It's very clear, very quick, that there is nothing ordinary about her. FUD was the class of 2021's number one consensus for crew while she was playing for St. John's College High School out of DC. Now she's playing for one of the most storied and winning programs in any sport in history, the University of Connecticut Huskies. The National Championship goes to Connecticut for the fourth year in a row, as the dynasty fulfills its destiny. Winners of 11 national championships, producers of Olympians, and multiple WNBA MVP's. But AZ has something that the trailblazing women of UConn's past never had, the opportunity to not only play basketball, but get paid for it. I remember just learning that you could profit off of your name and brand and like, I could profit off of AZ, the Bachelot player, not just AZ, the person, which I didn't really understand why you couldn't, because at least for me, like, AZ, the basketball player is also AZ, the person like basketball is such a huge role in my life that I didn't understand why I wouldn't be able to profit from it. It's a board and I understand exactly what made this all possible. In 2021, after decades of debate, lawsuits, and legislation, the NCAA prompted by a unanimous ruling by the Supreme Court finally relented on one of its longest standing strictures that athletes could not in any way be compensated beyond scholarships and small stipends from their schools. It would only take a few months before AZ, a freshman at the time, would sign her first major deal with Chipotle. Before the freshman even got to play a game for the Huskies, she aches her first NIL deal as a college athlete ambassador for the magnificent Mexican restaurant chain. You are on the leading edge of something that feels, for those of us who've been looking at sports for a long time, like a very meaningful moment in sports. Like, the economics are changing, the role of sports in society is changing. We see that from the outside. You're inside it. Does it feel momentous to you? You can tell, like, how important it is, but at the same time, like, this is all I know in college battles, NIL. So, like, I'm still trying to find my way in it, find my groove and stuff. But, like, I know how important it is, and kind of like the people before me paved the way and set that path for me to be able to do this, and how important it is for me to be able to take and manage this, and be able to continue this on for the athletes to come. While colleges and universities still can't directly come and say through athletes, those athletes can legally be paid by third parties who want to use their name, Image and likeness, or NIL. AZ, advised closely by a team led by her parents and her agents, has created a portfolio anchor by relationships with Chipotle, American Eagle, Sports Strength Bio Steel, and SC30. Brands, she already admired as a successful athlete and American teenager. I've been lucky that the deals that I've been approached with have been things that have been, like, really good and things I have, like American...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1257,2022-10-09 19:38:47

American Ego is one of my favorite brands. I always wear their jeans. So it's one of the easiest transitions type things. Bio-seal was something that I hadn't tried before and once I did, I really liked it. On the basketball side, it's impossible to be on Yukon's campus and not feel the weight of history, especially when you see where the team works out. Officially called the Worth Family Yukon Basketball Champion Center, it's a 78,200 square foot complex that costs $40 million. Its most striking feature? It's split right down the middle between men's and women's basketball. Seemingly identical when you walk in except while the men's team boasts four national champion chips, the women's side has more than double that. And that actually understates their dominance. The team has gone undefeated in six seasons and its players have been staples on the US Olympic team. Suburred and Diana Tarrassee are only the latest in the line of superstars that began in the early 1990s with Rebecca Lobo. The Huskies have featured 12 AP national players of the year including Lobo, Maya Moore, Twice, Re-honest Stewart, Three Times, and most recently Paige Becker's will get to her in men. It is crucially important and I think we've moved from this attitude, from its indulgence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s and so it makes it a really exciting field because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harness to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts but if you want to be wise, you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information and that's what you bring to use out while you're sleeping.

I'm not super. We need to forge our own path and our own story in the UConn books. The whole book goes to work in the land and a beautiful book.

13033," Arise, Yukon has become one of the biggest platforms for women's basketball. Yukon Women's team is so well known that at the moment it's arguably a better platform than most, if not all, of the professional women's teams or even the WNBA overall. Well, I don't think there's any creator, female sports collegiate brand than Yukon Women's basketball. It's on TV, you can follow those athletes. In a way that if you compare it to the WNBA, you don't always get consistency of coverage local or international markets. You're not always able to follow those athletes. This is Angela Regiro. She's a former hockey player and four-time Olympian. She now runs Sports Innovation Lab. That's a Boston-based company that uses data science to help teams and leagues understand their fans and figure out how to better engage them. The future of sports really is how do you optimize and drive revenue in these digital spaces, these digital communities? So collegiate athletes are going to really benefit from the change in the NIL ecosystem because they are authentically themselves. They're using these platforms already and they're being entertainers. I'm not sure how to work this. I think it's recording. Fans of women's sports and female athletes want more authenticity. These fans are dying. For not just the game and the stats and the scores, they want to know what you're doing 24-7. You know what these female athletes think. What are they wearing? What are they dating? What do they care about? What are their causes? And that's going to build a wave of support when those athletes graduate that they'll hopefully bring to those WMBA teams. I think that this is really an incredible opportunity for me and all of women's basketball to be able to benefit. And it's sad knowing that this is kind of our most profitable age. So I think that that's also an important part of being able to use NIL now before going pro. But dance videos and homemade tostinos ads can only take that mission so far. AZ knows that success on the court comes first and will allow everything else to follow. And while Yukon has had a storied history, their last championship was way back in 2016. Lucky for her, she's playing with not only just a good friend and dance partner, but the best college player in the country, Paige Becker's. Paige Bucket's Becker's is also one of the biggest college students when it comes to NIL deals, striking the first NCAA athlete deal with Gatorade, as well as partnerships with StockX and Cash App, and she has been estimated to potentially bring in a million dollars in NIL deals. We do a lot of team activities, but this is for some horse riding. Yes, this is my first one involving a live animal. During the last week of official summer workouts, AZ Paige and their teammates finished their last session and went over to Yukon's horse barn for some team bonding. I have an extra large. Right, so when you're working with the horses, you want to try to stay calm and relax. You're going to make him anxious. I'm sorry. The typical day in stores can pick it. So we deal and we don't play basketball. Peasants. They're well. It was a light moment before everyone went off to hang with their families and get rested up for the season. A few weeks later, beckers would announce that her 22-23 season was over before it even started. Yukon Women's Basketball Junior Guard Paige Beckers suffered a torn ACL in her left knee and will miss the 2022-23 season. It's an injury AZ knows all too well, having gone through her own ACL tear in 2019. While Paige's absence will test the team's depth and metal, what was on display in stores and apparent in conversations with AZ was that she and Beckers were intent on using their increasingly higher profiles, not just to benefit themselves, but their entire team. Bra, paint. No, you didn't. How did this so sweet? I'm so excited. Genius case!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1259,2022-10-09 19:47:22

Both ASEAN Page are conscious of the inequality that still exists in NIL. While the players in this room share the benefit of playing at Yukon, not all can or will get the deals ASEAN Page have already signed. Soft, more as you first, insi-cater. People outside of your world are actually doing it speculate about the consequences and maybe some of the unintended consequences of NIL. You think, well, you know, the really prominent players like you, we're going to benefit and then other players are not. And so maybe there's some jealousy or envy or whatever. How do you make sure that it doesn't? We were very tight. We're a super close group. I mean, you've been to stores or not. But it was not much else to do besides play basketball and hang out with each other. And I think it also is because that whatever deals we get, like, you share with each other. So I have a deal with Chipotle and my whole team. Whenever they watch Chipotle, they let me know. Or American Eagle, they can get whatever they want. I think it goes both ways with whatever deals. Other people have that we're super open. Always willing to share. I think I'm posting an answer around about this. This would be the last team meal for ASEAN before going on summer break. And when we next caught up with her, it would be about as far from a dorm room in stores that you could possibly get. ASEAN's out in LA this week to do a commercial shoot for a new underarmer shoot alongside both Steph and Seth Curry. Along with her is her family, including her former coaches and current business screens, her mom and dad. We make sure that one of us is at everything that she does just to give her that support. So I've been at a lot of them. Still blows my mind like, you look really cute in that outfit. But it just doesn't really, I don't know, sink in that she's this public figure for lack of a better word. The partnership with Curry is both historic and important well beyond the deal itself. ASEAN was the first woman and the first college athlete to join the SC30 brand and has developed a friendship with Curry. She fully concedes to initially being a bit star-struck.

13035," Not just the first like NIL, the own college athlete, but also the first female scientist who has brand. I don't even really know what word to use to describe that feeling when I first signed it and being here now like it means so much. Aze's connection to and reliance on her own family was on full display in LA. She'd come to the West Coast with her mom, dad, and two younger brothers and her success as a burgeoning business provides some fun perks. On trips like this I love just watching my parents reaction because they've been in the game. They've always played in college and they play professionally so seeing their reaction to kind of where I am it's just really funny. I mean like my dad loves being around all these NBA players. My mom loves seeing all these high-level workouts and so seeing like them happy. It's really fun. Aze's parents both played Division 1 basketball in college and coached her throughout her youth which she credits made her the way she is. Even if sometimes it's not so easy to grow up with two coaches for parents. Part of the reason that I am the way I am is because they didn't really complement much so I always had something to work on. I was always working hard. I think they did a very good job obviously. I played really bad. I would hear about that but they did a really good job of separating mom and dad from coach. Like I remember when I was younger my dad would take me off to get ice cream and stuff after games. That was something when we started coaching and we were very cognizant of not having that coach role carry over. I harbor things a little more so sometimes they'd go get ice cream and I'd be like, you know she sucked. Why are you getting ice cream? It wasn't the ice cream but then he really likes ice cream too so. When I started the coach I definitely did not want to have that contentious relationship at all and so the ice cream thing became a reminder to me. It's a treat to like now I get to go back and be dad. Katie Fudd played at NC State and then Georgetown in the late 1990s as women's basketball was starting to gain a bit of traction and the WNBA was in its form of years. She had to deal with inequalities that she never wanted her daughter to face. When it came time for AZ to pick a school her mom had a big influence. When AZ was getting recruited I felt very strongly in what is the culture. When I was a Georgetown it was kind of a men's basketball program and not really much else. It's evolved since then but in our practice time was limited on the court based on when the men practiced or you know it's just it was just all based around the men. There's a lot of schools that she was looking at where they they had some storied men's programs but how do the players interact? How does you know what's the culture on the campus like? Let's make sure that we're doing the right thing by by both the men's and women's program. AZ's parents were able to go from being her coaches to fans in the stands but now have evolved into her advisory board on her branding deals. I think we spent the better part of the pandemic on seminars and YouTube and listening talk I probably have a four-year degree and I have a cell phone and I L just because they're just making sure we understood it as well as we could to help her but also connecting with the right people. I think the fact that we have such a great relationship with her she trusts us implicitly like we're not gonna put her in a situation that one she doesn't support the company or doesn't you know it too much authentic stuff and then we're not gonna put her in a situation that just isn't isn't good for her. As the new season starts AZ's NIL deals existing and new will be in the background. Expectations are always high at Yukon and even more attention will be on her given Becker's injury. While new NIL opportunities grab headlines and attention AZ has a clear focus on what to head. How do you raise your NIL game? How do you grow it in a way that's authentically easy? I think now that I've my first year kind of under my belt I have established my brand with all these other people but I think I need to be able to kind of like establish my own brand more like the easy brand and like post about myself more as well but I think just knowing that what your priorities are that my priorities right now are basketball in school because without good grades won't be able to play and without basketball I wouldn't have these opportunities in these deals.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1261,2022-10-09 19:59:25

Before you change the world, Bloomberg. What are the moon shots at Amazon that are capturing most of your time and attention? Well, you know, we have a unique way that we go get big new investments. I'm not sure it's right or wrong. It just happens to be our way. And we ask ourselves when we're considering something for questions. We ask if it's successful, can it be big and move the needle in Amazon? Is it being well served today? Do we have a differentiated approach? And do we have competence there? And if not, can we acquire quickly? If we like the answer to those questions, we'll go pursue it with a single threaded team that isn't distracted by the rest of the business. When it comes to the stock, it has fallen significantly. Do you think investors are missing something or has tech just been overvalued? I have never tried to predict what the stocks might do. In any time, I've tried to a little bit. I've been wrong. I do really believe that in the short term, the stock market tends to be a voting machine and the long term it tends to be a weighing machine. We have a concept we talk about a lot of Amazon inputs and outputs. You know, in the ultimate output for a company, a share price, you know, in that other big outputs are free cash flow or profit or revenue. You can't really manage the outputs. You have to manage at the input level and that's where we spend all our time. And so if you do the right things for the business long term, things tend to work out. I think we've had very good returns for investors and I expect that to be true again. We will never break. We will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never break. Have a wide of rosers and the mountains shake. All of us will remain. We will never. No, no. We will never. No. As fall sets in, a decided turn in the air for the new British government's designs for the economy for Elon Musk designs on Twitter and most decidedly for Mr. Putin's designs on Ukraine. This is Bloomberg Wall Street week. I'm David Weston. This week's Special Contributor Larry Summers on whether the jobs market is starting to show some signs of loosening. I think we are headed for a collision of some kind or other and we've just got to manage that collision carefully. And Brad DeLong of Berkeley on what the broad sweep of economic history may be telling us about where we are headed next. People say that the United States has very little to teach them that we don't have any greater grasp on how to deploy and use these technologies to create a good society. We had our fair share of about faces this week with the Bank of England's quick intervention to save the guilt market as explained by former MPC member Kristen Forbes of MIT. Seems that they are worried that because of the big market moves, there could be some margin calls, some pressures for force selling that could cause the guilt market to freeze up.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1262,2022-10-09 20:03:25
13037," All some pressures for force selling that could cause the guilt market to freeze up. And British Prime Minister Liz Truss giving up at least part of her economic program. It was becoming a distraction, so that's why we immediately changed that policy, and that's the kind of government we are. But as ugly as the situation was in UK markets, it was nothing compared with the setbacks for Russian forces in eastern and southern Ukraine, with President Putin's efforts to quote Annex territory that his forces didn't even control. Which Admiral John Kirby at the NSC looks at as an indication that Mr. Putin just may be coming to understand how difficult his situation really is. The Annexation Announcements as well as his announcement of partial mobilization certainly shows the degree to which Mr. Putin knows how much he's struggling inside Ukraine. And Ulpec Plus weighed in with its own changes. The campaign production caps by 2 million barrels a day or about 7 percent, putting even more pressure on Europe and the rest of the world already worried about energy. Well we were disappointed that Ulpec made this decision. As the President mentioned, we think it's unnecessary if you look at the global environment where supply continues to be the predominant challenge. Then there's Elon Musk. He offered $44 billion for Twitter back in April, then decided to renegade, got sued, and on the eve of his deposition returned to his original offer. Even it looks like he's going to be way overpaying. In many ways, this is almost the most expected outcome of all, which is settling on the eve of trial just before deposition of the main players Elon Musk himself. He doesn't want to be deposed. He has probably some embarrassing text messages and conflicting statements and all of that would make for a very unpleasant deposition. But after all the back and forth this week, US jobs numbers actually came in surprisingly on course, adding 263,000 new jobs just slightly more than expected, with workers paid 5 percent more than they were last year. In a reduction in the unemployment rate, to 3.5 percent, which made for a rough day in equities on Friday, but actually a pretty good week overall for equities, for the S&P 500 adding 1.5 percent to end the week at 3639 in the NASDAQ, eaked out a gain of 3.4 percent. This also had a topsy-turvy week, but ended up with the 10-year yield of a relatively modest 5 basis points to 3.88. Here to walk us through this week and what got us here are Aaron Brown, portfolio manager at PIMCO and Chris Ellman, chief investment officer at CalSTRS. So Chris, let me start with you. Boy, given what we're seeing right now, are we looking at a long cold winter, would you say? Unfortunately, David, I think we are. I think the Fed, you know, with these employment numbers, the Fed knows that they have to continue this pace of aggressive tightening, and they're going to do so the next week and the next week after that. And I think, which is the street is pricing in, but I think after that, they're going to have to keep it up. And that's going to be into the winter and it's going to be a tough time. So what do you say, Aaron? Is it going to be a rough winter? I think it is going to be a rough winter. I think that their bands of uncertainty are quite wide for next year. The Fed is tightening into an economic slowdown. We haven't even seen the real impact of that slowdown yet. We're just starting to see signs of a gradual slowing, but likely we'll continue to see that into next year. And we think that we're heading into a recession in to early 2023. And at that same point, just given the level of inflation, the Federal Reserve is now really challenged to be able to arrest that inflation, get it under control, despite what happens to the economy. And I think that really poses a challenge for the Fed and we'll likely see something that's fairly unprecedented, which is continued financial conditions tightening and Fed tightening into an economic slowdown, even if it really leads to a harder landing than what the Fed's anticipating. And Aaron, I'd push back a little bit. I actually think we're in a recession right now. It's not a very strong one and it doesn't hurt a lot. Obviously with employment growing, but we did have a negative GDP in the second quarter, third quarter is mild. To me, anything below 1% in the USA feels like a recession. But so what you're saying is you think it's going to be a really, we'll actually have a good traditional hard negative recession with rising unemployment, which is exactly what Powell has said. I mean, that's his forecast. Yeah, I think that's.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1263,2022-10-09 20:08:14
13038," the traditional hard negative recession with rising unemployment, which is exactly what Powell has said. I mean, that's his forecast. Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, my, our view at PIMCO is that we'll likely see unemployment rise to about 5% by the end of 2023. And so right now, we're sort of seeing some of those early signs, but we really haven't seen the full brunt of financial condition tightening yet. That's more to come. So we are going to continue to see us slow down. And I think that's really going to hit in the first quarter of next year and into the second quarter of 2023. Chris, given where we're at with inflation right now, the concerns about inflation, if we are heading an intersection or even are already in one, no matter how long it is or how short it is, what are the tools the Fed has to use? Because typically you turn to the Fed and say, okay, start cutting interest rates. Doesn't look like they're going to do that in a likelihood. No, they're going to raise interest rates. They only have one tool. They have, well, they have their mouth. They can jawbone the market, which is what they're doing. They have the dot plot, which is going to indicate or direct the market. But they're really the only tool they have is short term interest rates in the Fed funds rate. And that's what they're using aggressively. I mean, good grief. 75 basis points. Those are big bounces. You know through history, you've got to go way back before you have that aggressive tightening of monetary policy. And they have to shrink the balance sheet. So as they move through that, you know, he's already said he's going to hurt employment. Yet, we have stronger numbers. I think the numbers, there's something strange in the numbers this week, just like last month, but we'll see how that balances out. We're going to have a tougher time. And, you know, I think the question is going to be about corporate earnings. You got CPI next week. And then you got the bank starting to roll out with their earnings. Aaron, as the market price in the diminishment of earnings to this point, corporate earnings, no, I don't think that they have what you've seen since the beginning of the year is equities have de-rated, largely driven by the market multiple. So you've seen the market multiple for the S and B 500, de-rate from about 21 and a half times to about 16 times today. Keep in mind that traditionally in recessions, the market multiple is somewhere between 14 and 16 times. So we're just at the upper end of where we typically are in recessions. And we think that you could see a little bit more de-rating from there. That's not really the challenge for the market. The challenge for the market is that when you look at corporate earnings for next year, the market's pricing them to be up 7.5 percent for consensus. Our forward-looking models are expecting them to be down about 9 percent. So that's north of a 15 percent differential versus what the market's pricing for next year and what we think it's likely to be. Also, historically during recessions, earnings fall about 27 percent on average. So there's real downside risks to our forecast and certainly to the market's forecast. And I think that's where you're going to see the real pressure point for the market in early next year. What's driving that is margins. We're at record high margins right now. The street is expecting that margins are going to expand further from here. So we've been higher than and hit new record highs. We've never seen that in a recession before. So I think the market's really mispriced and that's where the pain's going to come from. Aaron, I've got to ask you if we're already down 23 percent so far this year. How much lower do you think we can go? Do you see a support level on the S&P? I think that in a moderate recession, the market probably bottoms out about 32.50. There is downside risk if we see further a more severe or harder landing from there. But 32.50 is still down about 14 percent. So I do think that there's still room for the market to fall further. Where are you looking for us in terms of your estimates? Yeah, no, I agree 32.50. But I mean, that's a negative 36 on the year, which is you're like me. We have asset allocation portfolios. Where do you hide in that kind of a negative market? You've got bonds with the rates rising. So you're going to have continued negative returns out of bonds and then a negative 30 out of stocks. That's a rough calendar year. Where do you hide? Well, I think that I think there have been actually market opportunities that have arisen up since the start of this year. Cash right now, two-year bonds are revealing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1264,2022-10-09 20:12:36
13039," I think that I think there have been actually market opportunities that have arisen since the start of this year cash cash rate right now at two-year bonds are yielding north of 4% now that's not a sexy return by any You know sort of stretch of the imagine but imagination, but if you can lock in 4% You know add a little bit of spread on top of that you know an iG corporates that give you an additional you know 2% or so That's about a 6% return over the next couple of years. That's high quality paper That you can invest in so I wouldn't you know sort of rule cash out as an option I think that that's somewhere where you can hide and really not expect that much volatility and really consistent returns and sort of hide out there until we see The markets bottom and you can start incrementally moving back into risk But we can't I think you need to keep in mind as an investor that if the core of your allocation of your portfolio Which is sort of cash and poor fixed income is unstable then you really can invest in the outer ring assets So you know we really have to stabilize rates in order to move out the risk curve into other asset classes Right now cash is a pretty good option. Okay. We're gonna pick up exactly that question Where do you hide in this environment? Chris ailment and Aaron Brown will be staying with us We're gonna ask for them then for some investment advice. We could use it. That's for sure. That's next on Wall Street Week here on Bloomberg Hydrogen has a very special place in the universe It's the first element on the periodic table It is the most abandoned element in the universe and When clean energy advocates think about what can we find which would be as easy to use as fossil fuels They think about hydrogen the fuel that will when burn only produce water We like to imagine that if we just built enough of these and these we could ditch fossil fuels and save the planet Unfortunately, it's not that simple There are some things where you just need a good old-fashioned combustible fuel Now startups around the world are betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century The Facts on unemployment seem clear enough or at least as clear as that changing social definition ever can be The situation is getting a little better But not much The government announced today that the overall unemployment rate last month was 6.9 percent The official unemployment rate has been stuck within a tenth of 7 percent for six months And that scarcely represents the massive reduction of unemployment But at least some folks thought they heard Jimmy Carter promise a year ago That was Louis Royce-Royce on Wall Street week back in October of 1977 when the unemployment rate was twice What it is today and we were trying to get it down rather than focusing on inflation Whatever that ends up meaning for employment And if that seems like a galaxy far far away Well, maybe that's no accident the top movie this week back in",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1265,2022-10-09 20:16:27
13040," It down rather than focusing on inflation, whatever that ends up meaning for employment. And if that seems like a galaxy far, far away, well, maybe that's no accident. The top movie this week back in 1977 was Star Wars. And the top song on the charts was, you got it, the Star Wars theme. Still with us, our Aaron Brown of Pimco and Chris Aileman of Calstere. So Aaron, let me turn to you and pick up on where we were talking just now with Chris, but where you hide, if you're really an asset allocator, you said cash is one alternative. Are there things though that involve at least some risk that you go to, and how much it depends on what you think the recovery is going to look like whenever it comes? So I'm going to flip that sort of question and answer the second question first, which is unlike prior recessions that we've seen in very recent history. So think of the global financial crisis or even the pandemic of 2020. I don't think this is going to be a V-shaped recovery. I think this is going to be more of a prolonged, sort of stalling of the economy and more of an L-shaped recovery than what we've seen in the past. And the reason for that is because inflation is high and it's likely to persist at high levels, you're not going to come in and see the fed start cutting as the unemployment rises like we've seen in the past. Instead, because the fed is moved from a dual mandate fed to a single mandate fed, really just focus on getting the inflation rate down, you'll likely see, you won't see the sort of immediate relief that we've seen in recent history. And so that does change a little bit the landscape of how you think about investing. Historically, as we start to get closer, it's what we expect the bottom level of the S&P 500 to be. We start to scale risk back up, start to move back into equity investments to catch that recovery to the upside. And this time around, I think you have to be a little bit more patient. So instead, what we're really looking at is fixing come investments that we think are going to be able to sort of stand at the test of time, be able to sort of hide out in a safe haven assets. So beyond just looking at cash, we're looking at high quality investment-grade corporates, we're looking at municipalities, municipal bonds, particularly for those who can take advantage of the tax advantages, tax-advantaged bonds, we think offer good value there at a sort of after-tax yield of 6.5%. In addition, we also like some mortgage agency bonds and structured credit bonds as well. And then sort of high quality equities that are defensive equities, high free cash flow, dividend growth, strong balance sheets. We also think do well in this environment. But it is a sort of challenging time for investors where you have to see more towards fixed income in order to have stability of return as opposed to looking for a quick snapback in equities. But I posed a question to Chris, because I know he also manages a diversified portfolio. Chris, where are you looking at what type of sort of diversification that are you looking at in order to sort of hide out over the next couple of quarters? Well, Aaron, I've got the benefit of being able to go into private security. So I've got a good size real estate portfolio. We have a large private equity portfolio. Sure, it's going to have write downs. But its value is a bit more stable than we see in the public markets. We have a cash position, but the problem is for us cash is not outperforming inflation. So the old adage cash is trash is still true. We do like a private credit. You were kind of hitting on that, that variable rate, debt, short term debt with high quality. And I think collateral is going to be key. Because as you said, we're going to have a long rough winter. So you don't want to be loaning money to everybody. You have to do care about governance. But it is tough in this environment. I mean, if the economy is slowing and inflation is still strong, that's stagflation. And you look back in the 70s, I got to say, I love that suit that Lou had. I don't know where you get that back in the 70s. But I'm stunned by it. But you look back in that time period, returns in the 77 were terrible. There were hard places to, it was just a very tough time to hide anywhere. Yeah, so I'm curious though, exactly about when you go into fixed income. Do you think the price is attractive now in some fixed income, Chris? Well, I agree with Aaron. I'm going to go short. I'm not going to go long fixed income and take duration exposure.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1266,2022-10-09 20:21:19
13041," Attracted now in some fixed income, Chris? Well, I agree with Aaron. I'm gonna go short. I'm not gonna go long fixed income and take duration exposure. Short-term credits. I mean, you've been holding credit for two to three years and then it's money good. And as she said, you're gonna put it in a spread product. So you pick up a couple of basis points by being in a corporate, you're okay. There's still a lot of money, David, an international money that wants to come into this market and non-US rather that wants to come into the market. You saw it in this week where suddenly comes rushing in. So I would give the advice to the average investors. You've got a slowly average cost in. You're not gonna be able to call the bottom. As much as Aaron, I think there's a support number, it may not hit that at all. And the market's gonna just bounce along. And Aaron's example of an L, an L goes on forever. It's just flat. I hope we don't have to live in a flat recession for years and years. But I think this is gonna be a tough market to find any kind of growth opportunities. So you want to protection and a return of your money rather than a return on your money. Aaron, one of the big developments this week was OPEC Plus and what they did. It certainly seemed to stun the white hats at the time. What does that tell us about geopolitical risk generally and specifically energy? And it looks like oil prices are gonna stay up there for a while. I think that's one of the things that the market's really miss pricing. Right now if you look at the forward curve for oil, the risk is really in the sort of very short term where the market expects that oil is gonna be elevated for the short term, but it really has an extrapolated or extended that expectation out the next one to two years. And I think that there's a real value in sort of the back end of the curve for oil because I think that these oil challenges are gonna persist much longer than what the market's anticipating. One of the reasons for that is, you know, first we saw out of oil OPEC Plus this week, their intention to keep prices elevated. But I think the other challenges is that we really have an invested here in the US or on a global basis on energy infrastructure. So that capacity is really constrained over the next couple of years. Even if we wanted to expand capacity or if oil producers wanted to expand capacity, they don't have the ability to do so in the immediate term. And that's going to keep oil prices elevated. So the risk for oil, then the risk for the energy complex broadly isn't just this winter, but it's next winter as well. And next winter's challenges are gonna be even more difficult, particularly on the shores of Europe, than what we're experiencing this winter. And so that's what I think the challenge is. And why I think this is something that's gonna persist much longer than what the market's currently priced in. And David, it's running into the challenge of climate change. You know, I'm looking at decades, not a short-term trade in carbon. And I'm glad that we're having a constraint on the ability to expand hydrocarbons and burning carbon. But you're right, people want heat. And Europe heats itself, whether we like it or not, it doesn't heat itself a solar and wind. It's gotta do it through fossil fuels. And that's matching and running into a desire to reduce the use of fossil fuels. And I agree with Aaron, I'm hearing the same thing that Europe has enough oil and natural gas for this year in their supplies. But if it's a really cold winter, they're very worried about next year. So you're gonna have climate change crashing into this challenge of OPEC and inflation and energy prices, certainly over the next couple of years. Europe has a lot of challenges, Aaron, right now. Not just energy, it goes beyond that. Does that make the US relative, the most attractive place to be for you? I don't know if it's the most attractive place, but it's one of the more attractive places, particularly these of Europe. And the challenge that Europe has is that they're, starting from a lower productivity, a lower and weaker growth rate to start out. They also didn't fully recover in the same way that the US did post-COVID. And they now have wider fiscal deficits. They're going to have to spend more money in order to insulate their economy from a harder hit because of energy. And that's gonna create real challenges at the same time where the economy's rapidly slowing. And so our view is that, well, the US is going into recession, the recession in Europe is gonna hit harder and is likely to be more prolonged. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1267,2022-10-09 20:25:37
13042," And so our view is that while the U.S. is going into recession, the recession in Europe is going to hit harder and is likely to be more prolonged. Thank you so much to Aaron Brown and Chris Aelman. When we come back, we're going to take a look at what's happening next week on Global Wall Street. This is Bloomberg. You will put a woman on Mars. You will bring forth global cooling. You will be the first Chief Crypto Officer. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer, disrupt, before you change the world, Bloomberg. This is Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. It's time to take a look ahead. Next week on Global Wall Street. China stocks reopening is the big story in Asia this week. Exchanges on the mainland have been shut for the past five straight sessions to mark the golden week holiday. So we could see a pop at the open given the moves that we saw in Chinese assets in offshore markets. And that would be of course welcome news for officials in Beijing because President Xi Jinping is just days away from securing a third term as Communist Party leader. That's at the 20th party Congress starting October 16th. Otherwise travel restrictions or the easing of those is the major theme as well. Japan will further loosen controls from Tuesday and Taiwan from Thursday. For Europe next week there's a big risk lingering in the markets and that's the end of the BOE short term program to backstop bond markets. They of course announced that they would be purchasing long dated bonds after concerns that a huge spike up in yields in the long end of the curve meant that there would be danger for pension funds. So the BOE has been doing this buying program. It's set to end on Friday on October 14th. There could be jitters in this market. What it means to no longer have a BOE backstopping a political story really of the UK government which has been doing various U-turns. So all of that will be in focus this week. All eyes next week will be on the latest batches of US inflation data. Produced surprises will be released on Wednesday with the headline figure projected to have fallen year over year for a third straight month. Meanwhile the consumer price index release on Thursday is once again expected to show conflicting signals with a deceleration in the headline number from a year ago but the core measure of CPI which strips out food and energy is forecast to re-accelerate its pace of growth rather than fall. Investors also will parse the release of the minutes from the Fed September meeting and whether there was any serious discussion about slowing or even halting the tightening of monetary policy. And earning season is finally here. The latest round of quarterly reports kicks off with Pepsi, JP Morgan, City Group, Morgan Stanley, Delta Airlines and United Health among the Notables. David?

Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building across America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels. We want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.

Every week we turn to Larry Summers of Harvard, our very special contributor here on Wall Street Week, to help us sum up the major events of the week. And once again we welcome back Larry Summers. So Larry, I think we should start with the jobs numbers out on Friday in the United States. I mean, some say not too hot, not too cold. Some people say, isn't this good? At least it's not getting worse. I guess my real question is, I mean, I can be getting worse, but is there a danger just in the inflation where many word is? We have 5% year over year, increasing wages. I think these numbers were about what we expected. And the sensible judgment was that we've got an inflation problem. Core inflation figures look artificially good. They're better than median inflation. And yet core inflation ran at a 7% rate last month. And that was more than for the quarter. And the quarter was more than for the half year. And the half year was more than for the whole year. So we're not in a controlled place with respect to inflation. And there wasn't really anything in this report to suggest that we were coming into a controlled place. The monthly wage number was relatively favorable, but it was pretty clearly distorted by the fact that you had a lot more workers coming in and leisure and hospitality. And those are low wage workers. The workers where wages are most flexible are going up more rapidly. So I don't think this is a number that changed the picture that we've got an economy that is too strong to be an economy where",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1269,2022-10-09 20:33:45
13044," that changed the picture that we've got an economy that is too strong to be an economy where inflation is going down, but that is maintaining its robustness. But I think we are headed for a collision of some kind or other, and we've just got to manage that collision carefully, and I think the sooner we start managing for some slowdown, the better we're going to do. I think Chairman Powell was way late to come to that recognition, but he now has that recognition, and he should be supported in that. So what do you think, Chair Powell, and the Federal Reserve will make of these numbers? How will it affect what they do in early November? I don't think these numbers are going to change what the Fed does. You know, you never know what's going to happen, and certainly there's risk of some kind of financially traumatic event, but I think the chances of something that is large enough to divert the Fed are really quite low. So I'd be expecting that the market, which is anticipating 75 basis points in November, and is anticipating 50 more in December, that would correspond to my best guess at this moment as well. And I think that kind of thing is going to be appropriate if we achieve disinflation. Larry, there's another strain of discussion. I've seen certainly this week, in fact, there was even some Fed staff work at the New York Fed suggesting that we better be careful, because in fact, the rate that we may need, in order to get down to 2%, maybe so high, it will cause financial instability. There is a really safety and soundness issue. What do you make of that? Is it possible the Fed will have to choose between financial stability in the one hand and getting inflation down on the other? First, I think that should be the occasion for some slow searching. If we have an economy where we think there's going to be substantial financial breakage, because the Fed lifts the Fed funds rate to 4.5%. Then we have an inadequately supervised financial system and an insufficiently active financial regulator. And so if anyone believes that, along with whatever monetary policy implication they draw, they better tell us how we think, how they think we ought to be repairing the regulation of the financial system. David, my sense is that you can never rule out these kinds of risks. But the Fed has more than one instrument. It has instruments for specific, guaranteed lending. We've seen that used a number of times. And each time we're surprised by how much the economy retains its robustness. In retrospect, we cut interest rates too much and kept them too low when we were supporting the financial system after COVID. In retrospect, we kept interest rates too low and blew up a bubble when we were supporting the economy with low interest rates after Asia and LTCM. In retrospect, we were surprised, amazed by how rapidly the economy grew when the Fed did what was necessary after the 1987 stock market crash. So we need to regulate right to preserve financial stability. We need to have a very strong firefighting force in order to respond if and when financial accidents happen. But I think it's a real mistake to suggest that somehow we shouldn't do the monetary policies that are necessary to avoid inflation becoming entrenched because of concerns about financial stability. David, the people who are still on team transit.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1270,2022-10-09 20:38:09
13045," People who are still on team transitory, they're always saying that expectations aren't entrenched. The more it's true that expectations are not yet entrenched, despite high inflation, seems to me the more important it is to move vigorously now with respect to inflation so they don't become entrenched. If they were already entrenched, we could discuss the right timing of a disinflation. But if we have the big advantage in disinflation of expectations that are not yet entrenched, surely we should be acting on inflation while we have that advantage. Larry, another big development this week was the OPEC plus decision to reduce production limits by 2 million barrels a day. Something that I think it's fair to say was set the Biden administration back a bit. He'd gone over there and asked the Crown Prince not to do that. It wasn't very pretty. So apart from perhaps any embarrassment on my cause, does it have larger macroeconomic effects for a globe that we are warned by WTO? No, maybe headed toward a global recession. There's nothing good in this. Certainly it's not what we wanted to see. Actually it's a lot less than 2 million barrels because many of the countries that reduced their quota weren't hitting their quota before so the reduction in the ceiling didn't really matter. And you didn't see a hugely dramatic move in oil markets in a way that was proportionate to the headlines that you saw. But certainly the risks are up and it just points up the importance. And we always do a scramble about the immediate when these things happen. And we don't forget about the medium term. Look, we made a mistake by canceling the keystone pipeline. We made a mistake by slowing down all kinds of permitting activity. We made a mistake by being hostile as a country to natural gas. We made a mistake in the Congress a few weeks ago when we didn't pass the mansion program of expanding permitting. We crucially need regulatory relief where we're not going to get renewables online fast and we're not going to get the transmission lines that are necessary for renewables to become a large part of our energy fast. So the real lesson on this is we need a different kind of energy strategy than the one that we've had. We need a strategy that is balanced rather than an unbalanced strategy of total hostility to fossil fuels or God knows the kind of total strategy of favoring fossil fuels that we had. Even even egregious favoritism towards Saudi Arabia that we saw during the Trump administration. We need to find a balance. And I think we're making our way in that direction. Larry is always so helpful to have you on each week and I'm going to say, Larry is always staying with us as we bring in Professor Brad DeLong, Professor of Economics from UC Berkeley, on his new book, Slouching Toward Utopia. That's an economic history of the 20th century. That's coming up next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1271,2022-10-09 20:42:28
13046," So what's the best investment advice you've ever been given by anybody? The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance, and human existence. What you learn is additive every day, and if you keep added and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's not just interest. It was always said above compound interest returns, compound business returns, compound human returns. They're all very additive because you learn every day. And if you keep added, it's very, very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make selling at the wrong time? And they sell when the prices go down? Yes, or not keeping. People have conviction if they invest for the right reasons, just keep added. This is Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. Our very special contributor, Larry Summers, of Harvard has stayed with us because we're going to bring in now Professor of Economics from UC Berkeley. He's Brad DeLong, the author of a new book, Slouching Toward Utopia, an economic history of the 20th century. So Professor, welcome for joining us. It's really good to have you here. I've read this fascinating and really sort of protein book. It's really quite a book. I'll set it up first because it's a history of the 20th century. But you don't necessarily define the 20th century as from 1900 to 2000. You started in 1870 and you ended up in 2010. Why? Well, the big thing that happens happens in 1870, right? Before 1870, the world's poor and there's no prospect for the world being anything other than poor. After 1870, every single generation, humanity's technical competence doubles and then doubles again in the following generation. And such an enormous pace of technological advance raises the possibility for the first time of a world in which we can bake a sufficiently large economic pie for everyone to have enough. And that was nothing that humanity had ever seen before. One of the remarkable things, Brad, that you highlight is that it really wasn't very different to live in the United Kingdom in the 19th century than it had been to live in the ancient world 2000 years before. Say something about the acceleration of growth that you see is happening in the 20th century. Well, you know, I mean, it's British economist John Stuart Mill, right? He was writing in 1871 about how all the industrial revolution had done was it had created a somewhat larger middle class and it had allowed manufacturers and the rich to earn greater fortunes, but that the overwhelming mass of humanity was still confined to the same life of drudgery and imprisonment than they had been before, that they had been in before and before all the way back into deep time. It was very clear by 1900 that things had changed. You know, John Maynard Keynes writing in 1919 looks back and says starting in 1870, we entered economic Eldorado and that now our chief task after World War I was figuring out why we tried to blow it up and try to get desperately back to what was good was going on after 1870. Fortunately, we eventually did and so things rolled through up until our day. Mr. Dahl, give us a sense of what happened in 1870 that brought all this about. There were some three driving forces in your book. Well, you know, everyone has an idea about just what it is that's made us as a civilization.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1272,2022-10-09 20:46:52
13047," happened in 1870 that brought all this about. There were some three driving forces in your book. Yeah. Well, everyone has an idea about just what it is that's made us as a civilization so wealthy that makes our economy so productive. And the different people have different things. And they all go back. Some of them back even to say the year 1070, when it turns out that the law applies to a German emperor standing in the snow outside of the castle that lies on his tool, but instead it could be that the law relies to everybody. But you get three things that fall into place in 1870 that set technological progress into a much higher gear than ever before. And they are the industrial research lab so that you can rationalize and routinize the discovery and development of technology. And then the corporation, as we know it, which rationalizes the development and deployment of technology, combined that with the globalized economy, with the telegraph and the I railroad and the iron hold ocean going steamship. And all of a sudden, the incentives to deploy technology worldwide for production are so overwhelming and people turn their minds to how to do this that everything explodes in a way it never had before. Brad, much of the academic discussion of your book has centered on this idea of a pivot point in 1870. But I want to ask about a different judgment you make, which is that there was this major era and that the major era ended in 2010. I would have thought that the world was growing. It was becoming more integrated with technology. There were important political struggles. That was the stuff of history through the 20th century, much better in the second half of the century than in the first half of the century. And the Cold War was a very different war than World War War 1 or World War 2. It was cold. But I would have thought that was a continuing process with substantial challenges. And yet you see us as now being in a quite different era. What's different about the era we're in than the era you wrote the history of other than more of the kind of progress and change that you saw is happening every generation? Well, I'm pleased you disagree here. And I'm very pleased you disagree on our historic Iodoptomist here about our future. Because look, I've been losing arguments in person with you for 42 years, even when I think I'm right afterwards. And here I'm genuinely uncertain. And I actually very much hope you are really right this time. My thinking was I've been listening to our friend, John Furnald, about how the underlying pace of technological progress has more or less halved since 2005, compared to what we were used to beforehand, saving those years from 1975 to 1990, when technology was crawling toward a more energy efficient and environmentally friendly configuration rather than focusing on labor saving. But after 2000, we seem to have a substantial loss of social and economic knowledge about how to run things. Things about financial regulation that I thought were entrenched that were known in the bones turned out to have been completely forgotten in 2008. Things about the proper tools for macroeconomic policy that I thought were ingrained in the bone were also forgotten after 2010. And I remember you and I whimpering in 2012 that no, for the more expansionary fiscal policy, was not then a thing that ran any risks whatsoever. Combined that with the fact that from 1870 on to 2010, first you had Britain in the United States, and then the United States as the countries that people were looking to.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1273,2022-10-09 20:51:16
13048," on to 2010, you know, first you had Britain in the United States, and then the United States as the countries that people were looking to, for example, as, you know, as Leon Trotsky liked to say, as the furnace where the future is being forged. You know, but now you go to China, you go to India, you even go to Indonesia, and what you find is that people say that the United States has very little to teach them, that we don't have any greater grasp on how to deploy and use these technologies to create a good society, and are in fact the society, our society that is more trouble, more trouble than theirs are. Brad, if that is right, how much of it goes over running out of ideas, and how much of it is running out of cohesion? One of the themes in your book is the sort of polls if I can put it that way between Hayek on the one hand, the market is king, and Pallani on the others, the market has to serve people. How much of the problems we're in right now are because we're lacking cohesion because of the dispersion in wealth and income? Um, I think we're definitely lacking cohesion. I think dispersion and wealth and income creates work of cohesion. I am struck by comparing the United States around 1900 with the United States today, right, that around 1900 politics was as fierce and mean as it is today. You know, that is theodore Roosevelt denouncing William Jennings Bryan as the puppet of a alien European socialist, John Peter Altgill, the governor of Illinois, who had not only been born in Europe, but also had dared to pardon anarchists. But there seems to be a very different flavor, right, that is, I think it's Ezra Klein talks about it, that somehow that our media and our communications today focuses first on establishing, you know, who are your enemies? Do you share any enemies with me? And if you share enemies with me, I will listen to. So as I say, it's a remarkable book. It's slouching toward Utopia and economic history of the 20th century. Thank you so much for bringing it. We only really touch upon it today. I urge everybody to read it. It's really worth the effort. Thank you so much. I'm going to ask Professor Brad DeLon of UC Berkeley and of course to our very special contributor Larry Summers of Harvard. Coming up, staying the course or turning tail will reflect on some big about faces this week. This is Wall Street week on Bloomberg. Whether you get your news on TV, on the radio, on Bloomberg Radio, on the web, on the Bloomberg Terminal or the Bloomberg apps, the news that affect your business. Here's what I'm watching. You do not want to miss this story. How are we thinking about those dynamics? That's our business. Bloomberg TV on Radio. The world is listening. Welcome to Debraka Australia. This is Bloomberg Technology. On TV, on the web, this is Bloomberg. We will never break. We will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1274,2022-10-09 20:55:29
13049," We will never...... Finally, one more thought. The fine line between being steady and being stubborn. We have all admired those leaders through the years who have stuck to their guns when times got tough. British leaders like Winston Churchill and the darkest days of World War II. We shall fight in the hills. We shall never surrender. And Churchill's successor, Margaret Thatcher, who was known for sticking to her guns, no matter what. He wanted the Council of Ministers to be the Senate. No! No! No! And American leaders, like President Reagan at the Brennan-Bird Gate, demanding that the Soviet Union tear down the Berlin Wall when it seemed that that was the farthest thing for Mr. Gorbachev's mind. Mr. Gorbachev opened this gate. Mr. Gorbachev teared down this wall. But goals were the times when the steadfast were ultimately proven right by history. What happens when bold proclamations don't hold up quite as well, such as George Herbert Walker Bush's insistence he would never, ever raise taxes. And I'll push again and I'll say to them, read my lips. And then there are those bold pronouncements that have yet to be proven out one way or the other. Like President Xi's insistence that his zero COVID policy is the right one for his country. If you just look at the COVID-0 protocols, it requires all people returning from abroad to have 10 days of quarantine. For President Putin, insisting that he will ultimately still prevail in Ukraine. But this week, this week we saw something a bit different. Big bold pronouncements being completely reversed, not long after they were made. A big one was, of course, Elon Musk's change of mind again on whether he'd pony up $44 billion for Twitter. We're now hearing that Elon Musk and Twitter, of course, that resolution really said to be sticking on the contingency of getting that debt financing. And that is going to be the key clause that we're focused on going forward. But at least Mr. Moss took a few months for his change of heart. Over in Great Britain, we saw a new government lay out a new budget that included big tax cuts starting with the top tax bracket. We love the tax cutting, but not at this time. This is just absolutely the wrong time to do this. Bringing immediate and violent reaction in the markets. Just trying to get the markets behind those two latter factors, probably significantly more difficult. And the Bank of England stepping in for the rescue. So suddenly, the Bank of England finds itself in the ECB situation. So Prime Minister Truss' newly minted Chancellor of the Czech Republic had to admit publicly that they had been wrong, clearly and dramatically wrong, at least on those top tax rates. And it came only days after he and Prime Minister Truss had gone so big and so bold. I think it was a distraction. And I think it was the wrong thing to do. One can hardly fault a government for listening to its people, even if the listening might have come better before the deciding. But whatever the right answer, the one thing for certain is that, at least in this respect, Mr. Truss is no Margaret Thatcher. So those waiting with baited breaths for that favourite media catchphrase that you turn, I have only one thing to say. You turn if you want to. The ladies not for turning. That does it for this episode of Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. This is Bloomberg. See you next week.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1275,2022-10-09 21:00:28
13050," Well done! So really a reminder isn't it just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see some pressure on the U.A. and we did see some pressure on the futures. It is now being with us. Okay so you're moving in on me quick just stradding me with your fancy hands. I'm going to deal with your night because it's really bothering me. Ah my night. Yeah he's a troublemaker. Yeah. What did you get up to this weekend? You know just robot stuff, a lot of chess. I was practicing for you. I know you're pretty good. Ooh I don't like that. I will take this. Oh put it over here. Not cool. Not cool. All right I will, I will concede. I can see. You've got me, Bid. Very good game. Well played. Thank you sir. Thank you. Hello! How are you? It's so great to see you. Thank you so much for doing this. What do you think about all this celebs getting into? Crypto. I think that I think was more last year. I think it's kind of a way of that past. No I don't think so but I think it's like any time that frankly it went a lot of other people get into crypto right? Other audiences too. It's one of the news a lot. And does that happen a lot of times when the prices are going up? She was a federal prosecutor going after gangs and the mob before being handed for next assignment, taking down Bitcoin. Katie Han soon realized this new technology was much more than a tool used by criminals. She dove deep and became a crypto convert, swapping her prosecutor hat for a board seat at Coinbase. And became the first female general partner at Venture Firm and Recent Horowitz. Han, now a prolific crypto investor, recently launched her own fund with one and a half billion dollars to deploy. It's the largest fund ever raised by a single investor. Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0 CEO and founder of Han Ventures, Katie Han. Katie, it's so great to have you. Great to be back here in the studio with you Emily. I want to start with a vibe check. Okay. What state of the crypto cycle are we in right now? It was hot. Yep. And then it got pretty cold. Hmm. Well look Emily, zooming back because I've been in crypto for a decade if you can believe it. We've seen crypto be really hot and then all of a sudden not. And so we've seen this before, however, I think one of the things that's a little bit different now is with each new crypto cycle, more and more people come into it. And so it's more and more pronounced each cycle. And I would push back on it's not. I think it depends on what area of the ecosystem you're looking at. We think developers think crypto and Web3 is still really hot. I am seeing a lot less of the.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1276,2022-10-09 21:04:14
13051," I would push back on it's not. I think it depends on what area of the ecosystem you're looking at. We think developers think crypto and Web3 is still really hot. I am seeing a lot less of those. We're all going to make it hashtags. I am seeing a lot less of them too, although I am spending less time on Twitter. So maybe that's why as well. But with each cycle, there are new acronyms. What hasn't happened is a crypto winter in the midst of kind of really serious global macro conditions. So we have inflation, kind of at record highs for our generation, not our lifetime. And then we have also a war that's broken out in the Ukraine. And we have a number of other factors going on here. So that's very different. There was some serious carnage out there. Socius, Luna, three-hour-os. What's been your takeaways from all of that? I don't want to sit here and tell you that algorithmic stablecoins are bad because I actually think they're really interesting. However, I think what happened is you had, in this case, you mentioned Luna and Tara. That was an algorithmic stablecoin that was getting pretty widespread adoption relative to what the tech could do. I didn't realize you spent your teenage years living in Egypt and learning Arabic. Tell me about your upbringing. I was always uprooted. My dad worked for a large company and we were always moving just when I would get comfortable in one space. And I think actually that's pretty important if you fast-forward and look at my career, I'm comfortable being in uncomfortable situations. I didn't know a lot about venture when I got into it initially. I didn't know a lot about crypto when I got into it initially. And I was okay asking questions. I was okay not knowing the local acronyms or the Namanclature of a particular field. And I'm taken right back to my teenage years in Cairo, moving from Houston, Texas one day to downtown Maddie in Cairo the next day. You studied law? I did. You clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. That's right. You became a federal prosecutor. You were taking on prison gangs and the mafia. That must have taken a really thick skin. I was doing it at each 25. And now if I kind of take a step back and you know, I think that happens at different points in your career. Like, whoa, if I would have analyzed that a little more at the time. And I'm kind of in some ways glad I didn't. I just dove right in because I found it fascinating. There was a human aspect to it and people's stories. And I felt like those stories mattered. So I was drawn to criminal law and became a federal prosecutor. And I did cases involving violent crime, but then really mistriing cases, being back in the courtroom, being before the grand jury. Like the prosecutor you would see on TV going to try those murder cases. Doing those two hour closing arguments. That's right. And so moved out here to California. I indicted the largest prison gang in the world at the time. Outlaw motorcycle gangs, hostage taking, bank robberies, armed bank robberies. There was really not a kind of criminal case by that point in my career. I hadn't done it. It was right around that time. 2012. One of my bosses came in and said, let's have that same energy that you brought to those gang cases, to those murder cases. And let's go ahead and have you investigate this new criminal technology that we really need to look into and possibly shut this down. So you created the first cryptocurrency task force? How would you describe it? Fortunately, several of us in the government realized at the time. It's not possible, also not desirable, because Bitcoin is not an entity. It's not a person, right? It's a protocol. And it would be like saying, let's go shut down cash. Let's go shut down the internet. It's not possible. Probably wouldn't be a good idea, either. I was using crypto and technologies like the Bitcoin blockchain, because that's all it existed then. This is 2012, 2013, to actually uncover criminal activity. So I didn't think that that technology was bad. Frankly, it was a tool that helped me uncover the various activity. And by the way, it was a step-level function improvement better than compliance by banks. I'll just go ahead and say it. That's a little bit controversial. But I had spent a decade subpoenaing large financial institutions. And five times out of ten didn't get back what I needed. One case I worked on, and people always say, oh, you shut down the Silk Road. What actually happened? I was looking into something completely, not having to do with anything at all.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1277,2022-10-09 21:08:57
13052," One case I worked on and people always say, oh, you shut down the Silk Road. What actually happened? I was looking into something completely, not having to do with anything at all of the Silk Road and came across some, what looked to be some kind of odd activity. And it turns out that a couple of federal agents on the Silk Road Task Force out of Washington, DC were croaked. And that is the case that I ended up in dining and I ended up prosecuting those agents and they both went to prison. So that's the aspect of what the Silk Road case that I worked on. I would never, never have been able to uncover that criminal activity by those agents because they were federal agents they knew how to cover their tracks had they not use Bitcoin blockchain. Right? So that technology right there, if they had just used wires or cash or bank wires, we would never have uncovered that. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund to front scratch? Inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer, disrupt. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. Imagine simply climbing a cable into space. The concept is known as the space elevator. Not only could it significantly change how we leave planet Earth, but it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space. And they're a scientist who think we could have already built it. We have the material, we have the technology, we have the lasers, we have the climbers, we have all of it. If a private entity wants to build it or a government, they can build it. It'll change society. We have no clue how colonizing in the space, how really spreading on the space, really changed our society over the next 50 to 200 years. It'll be completely different. So you became kind of a crypto convert after this. You joined the board of coinbase. That's right. Very early on. How did you and coinbase and Brian Armstrong come together? I hosted an event here in San Francisco at the Federal Reserve Bank. And I believe it was there that it wasn't just Brian. It was a lot of what I'll call legitimate actors in crypto who wanted to usher in this new wave, this new ecosystem. And then we brought together the heads of all kinds of agencies. Really in an effort to kind of talk about building bridges. The government and the crypto industry, we're never going to see eye to eye on a lot of things, but we did think there were some commonalities. Coinbase is a company that has suffered. They've been losing share. The valuation of the public markets has plummeted. Why do you think that is? And how do you think it can be fixed? Yeah. Well, I think again, a few things it's tied to. One, a large aspect of Coinbase's business now, of course, is trading revenue. And that's down when prices are down. And the company's been very transparent about that long before going public. I mean, also, if you look at its S1, it specifically identifies that. And just how volatile crypto cycles are. So I think that's part of it. It's judged by public markets as a technology stock, or as a financial services company. By the way, I think it's both. I think it's not just a financial services company. I think it's so much more. I think it's really a portal to this whole new ecosystem. You were also on the board of OpenC, until recently, there's an insider trading situation or accusation going on there. Coinbase has also had employees accused of insider trading. How much is this happening within crypto companies and within the industry and how big a problem is it? Yeah, I think crypto is under the microscope. So where you have two cases, three cases in crypto ecosystem, which now is a trillion dollar industry. I think multi-billion approaching trillion dollar industry, your voice gets...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1278,2022-10-09 21:13:11
13053," is in crypto ecosystem, which now is a trillion dollar industry. I think multi-billion approaching trillion dollar industry, you're always going to be able to find examples like that. So I don't want to make too much out of a handful of cases. That said, the company Coinbase OpenC take these things incredibly seriously. Along with your position at Coinbase, you became a partner at one of the most storied venture capital for American Valley and the United of the Andrews and Harawitz. What was your experience at A16Z-like? There I met Chris Dixon and I met Ben Horwitz and I met Mark Andrews and I had worked with them for just about a year, maybe a little bit over when they asked me to come and co-run their crypto funds at Andrews and Harawitz. Again, I jumped at that chance and I think really that speaks to the fact that as I said before, things are a hell yes or there are no and it was a hell yes for me. So Andrews and Horwitz is the kind of place where if you make a partner, you don't leave. Yeah, how did Mark and Ben respond when you said, yeah, why don't we have to start a crypto fund of my own? As you might know, Emily, they're an anchor. They're an anchor check into my fund and I'm very grateful for that. Mark and Chris and folks like them are also personal LPs. So I felt very supported when I shared that decision and I will say that it was not running away from Andrews and Harawitz. It was running to another opportunity. And you know, crypto is not, what do they say it's not a spectator sport? It's like you're in it, it's excuse very young, it's 24, seven, it's global and it's hustle. And at this, and that's a trade off, it's a life trade off. And at this point in my career and in my life, if I was going to continue to make that trade off, I just wanted to do it and do it in a way that was really true to me. So you struck out on your own? Yes. To launch on Ventures, what gave you the courage to do that? What was the spark that lit the fire? Yeah. I want you to say, I need to do this and do this now. Sure. What I set out to do was to continue to invest in this ecosystem that I think is so broad that decision was very purposeful and the timing was very purposeful. We have an early stage fund that does seed stage, series A, even series B, and then we have what we call an acceleration fund, which is, it's not a growth fund, it's a crypto growth fund. And I think those are different things, but it's later stage, it might be crypto publics. Certain kinds of public tokens were set up to hold tokens to participate in the token ecosystem, or later stage companies. I mean, there are now several crypto, many crypto unicorns. The space has become really competitive, even though you say, you know, crypto has had its kind of ups and downs. The thing is, a lot of people in some of those last cycles have seen the kind of venture style returns that can be having crypto. And so you've had a lot of new funds enter the space. And that's driven up competition. So what differentiates on ventures then? From all of these other crypto funds, or even the more traditional venture capitalists, like entries in Harowitz or Sequoia, they also have crypto funds now. Well, I think a lot of traditional venture capital funds now have crypto funds. It used to just be like a regulatory designation. It was like, are you an RIA, which is registered investment advisor? I would say for crypto founders today, it's not enough to just be an RIA, right? They, frankly, I don't even know if a lot of them care. That's a regulatory designation. What crypto founders today want to know is do you live and breathe crypto? Do you inhale the discourse? Are you part of the community? Do you participate in governance? Are you gonna be staking these kind of crypto verbs out there? And if you're not really in this space full time, I think it's very hard to run a successful crypto fund. We don't have a hedge fund component. So we're not sitting here buying and trading and selling that's a hedge fund structure. And there are crypto hedge funds. We're not one. We're making seven to 10 year best. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund from scratch? You know, it's hard, but it's not impossible. We don't have a crystal ball. I don't know. I can't predict cycles, but I knew that we were in a cycle where you saw so much further an excitement around the space. And I already talked about what makes this different, but I think one thing also is we are a nimble strike force. We don't fish in the same pond. We have the crypto natives. We have efficient execution. We have operators, seasoned operators who really know how to stick the landing. And I think that's reflected on our culture. I would say the only thing that's changed in our strategy as a result of the market correction is really *** *** *** ***. Does that seriously make you grunts?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1279,2022-10-09 21:17:53
13054," who really know how to stick the landing. And I think that's reflected in our culture. I would say the only thing that's changed in our strategy as a result of the market correction is really more of a focus on early stage, but we still have our late stage fund. And when we see valuations, which I think will still see correct, spoiler. And so we might deploy our later stage fund a little bit more slowly. It might not be on an even 50-50 cadence. And that's okay. Long-term, our strategy hasn't changed. Long-term, we're committed to this space. How much do you think valuations are going to correct? You know, it's just, I can't give you a one-size-fits-all answer because crypto is not a monolith. You have some crypto companies that really follow more of an enterprise-sass business model. You have others that are layer one protocols. You have still others that are consumer-facing applications. And I think one of the things we're seeing right now is the infrastructure layer. And that's where we're spending a lot of our time, by the way. And we think more and more use cases will come about when the infrastructure layers in place. So my own view is we are not rushing to deploy. We're certainly not getting caught up. You do get VC FOMO. I try not to. I try not to. You know, look, I think it's very easy to get into that mindset. Right? It's because it's a competitive sport. It's a competitive space. And I think I'd be lying if I said that that doesn't influence anyone. I try to, what I do, and I think I do differently, is I try to take stock of that. Oh, that's the FOMO mentality kicking in. That's bad. Again, you don't want to over-correct, though. What we look for is we look for amazing founders. It doesn't matter if I think valuations will correct if they're amazing founders. There's a huge tam. We also look for what's your regulatory plan? If you're launching a token, what's your plan to comply with the law? What's your plan for security, by the way? We've seen a lot of hacks in the space. We want to really dive in there and make sure that the founders have been thoughtful about, especially if they're custodian customer funds, keeping those funds secure. If it's a cross-chain bridge, what are the exploits? Have you changed your strategy at all, given the downturn? What? Have you backed out of any deals or decided not to do certain deals? Because the conditions have changed. Don't you raise the phone? We have decided not to do certain deals. We've never backed out of a deal. We have decided not to do a few deals. Because we think that pricing was ahead of progress, candidly. And we might have been wrong about that, Emily. We might have been wrong about that. But I think if we were wrong not to do a couple of deals, better that we might have been right. Because if we were wrong about that, I think we can find a way to still invest in those projects later. Well, one thing I'm hearing is that a lot of dry powder has just sifted. Because all these funds raised a lot of money raised, what was the biggest fund ever for a single person? Not just a woman. Anyone? Are you confident you're going to have a place to put all that money? I am, but if I don't have a place to put it, I'm not just going to go willing, nearly deploy it. One of the things that we told our LPs even during the period when we raised our fund, which was when crypto was undeniably still on a bull run, we said that we are going to be pretty steadfast, sticking to a two-year deployment cycle. And I think one thing that's changed is that might have lengthened. It certainly hasn't shortened. But we will, again, we feel very good that we have the capital to back great teams when we see them. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. And we're falling behind. Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world re-calibrates. After decades of stagnation, Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation. Corporate giants, policymakers and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that. Every week on Japan ahead, right here on Bloomberg Television. Innovation, money and power collide in Silicon Valley and beyond. Bloomberg Technology with Emily Chang. Weekdays at 5pm in New York and 2pm in San Francisco. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. We have to get interest rates higher and bring inflation back to our targets. We are the fastest to become a scarce.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1280,2022-10-09 21:21:55
13055," No one covers the world like Bloomberg. We have to get interest rates higher and bring inflation back to our targets. It's better to have the past as we come and scare us. We are running on thin ice. No one will deliberately want to go into battle, but we sneak walk into conflict with unmatched reach and resources. From more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, you are global business authority. We are going to increasingly live in a digital world. And I happen to think that if you live in a digital world, you're going to want to own digital goods in that world. You're not just going to be satisfied to rent them, which is what we do now. We buy our content from walled gardens without digital scarcity, which is what NFTs unlock. You don't really own anything. You're subject to the whims of a platform. And I think NFTs and digitally scarce goods fundamentally change that. I think you'll see NFTs back again. But we are spending a lot of time in the infrastructure layer. Like I tell you, zero knowledge, technology, scalability. We think of that as like the plumbing. If you think of the fiber-hubbic cables. Remember, you couldn't have had YouTube and Netflix with dial-up. You couldn't have streamed content. The same is true of crypto use cases. We think that there will be a lot of new use cases unlocked when the infrastructure is there, when it's more efficient, when it's more user-friendly. And so we're spending a lot of our time there. President Biden issues this crypto executive order. There are a number of ports that are coming due. What do you want to see from the administration when it comes to regulation? Are you optimistic that we will get there? Yeah, we were so delighted to see that executive order. This is not something you should normally be delighted about. But why we were is because it was to us a real recognition that this is a US government saying this field isn't going anywhere. This field is growing. It's growing so much that we are going to direct every single agency in the federal government to come up with a plan here. I think we take a step forward, but then you see we're a big government. We're a big system. We have states. We have local entities. So we take a step forward with the EO. And then we take some steps back sometimes too. And I think what I see as crypto founders are confused by that. They're starting to think, well, I could go to this jurisdiction where there's a single regulator. And you don't have 50 states with different rules. It's the US government that needs to start taking stock of the fact that right now, Emily in China, there's a quarter of a billion, ECNY wallets, a quarter of a billion. We're still talking about whether there should be a government central bank digital currency. We're still studying that. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind China. And we're falling behind. What are the dangers of falling behind China and the rest of the world? This is years ahead. So I don't want people to take a headline and say, oh, I think the US dollar will be no longer the global currency, reserve global currency. I'm not saying that now. But fast forward decades. And if you no longer need to use the dollar because you have an alternative, I think that's a real problem. What would we use instead? Well, I think that there are going to be stable coins out there that people who have access to a smartphone will use. There is a demand for it. We see a 285 percent year of your growth with stable coins. So people are clearly liking the idea of this. Now, again, there have been some spectacular failures too, but not all stable coins are created the same. But I think the important thing is that we really do need to not just quash innovation. And we think of how Gary Gensler, the chair of the SEC, and how he's approaching it. One of the things that I hear from founders is that they're very confused because they get told, come in, register. Just come in and talk to us. But you have the one company who's done the ultimate act of going in and registering coin base, filed an S1. And still, there's a lot of saber rattling still going on, I think. And again, I don't want to single out the SEC. And I don't want to suggest that anything they're doing is bad. I do think, though, that right now there's a lot of confusion. And one of the pieces of confusion stems from the fact that, you know, and it started with the ICO, Mania back in what, 2016, 2017. I can't remember which year now where the SEC was very low.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1281,2022-10-09 21:26:17
13056," You know, and it started with the ICO, Mania back in what, 2016, 2017, I can't even remember which year now, where the SEC was very loud about securities. A lot of them were securities, but the space has changed. And so to still view it through the ICO lens, when so much has happened over the last five years in the space, I think is a mistake. What do you have to say to the skeptics out there who just don't believe in the future of Web3? And don't see where this is going. I would say don't judge the current state of innovation by the end state of innovation. I hear from a lot of these skeptics. And by the way, I'm friends with a lot of these skeptics too. I don't only want to live in a crypto bubble. They want to see the use cases, especially if they're not technical. Well, when am I going to use it? What will I use it for? And I think one of the things that's not appreciated is how quickly the infrastructure here is catching up. And once you have really scalable blockchains that can handle a lot of thorough put and are very efficient, I think that unlocks a whole lot of use cases. People are spending more time on screens. That curve is up and to the right. Whether we like it or not, that is the future. I mean, those who have kids know that kids spend more time online. They want digital things too. And I think to dismiss it, it is a bit generational. I do find not always, but it is a bit generational. If you talk to kids about being able to have money online, they instantly get that concept. They're comfortable not having to hold something in their hand to think it has value. Take us to the end state. Do Google and Amazon and Facebook and Apple still exist? I believe they will still exist. I mean, it depends what you talk about when you talk about the end state. I mean, I think that, you know, I think for decades, those companies will still be around. But the important thing is I think this new ecosystem is going to represent a challenge to them. I do think that those entities, decentralized forces, are coming. And we'll cut into those entities, profits, and revenues. So we have a little rapid fire section. If you could belong to any altcoin tribe, that's what it would be. Gosh. There is no way I'm answering that, because I will get trolled on Twitter by every other altcoin tribe. I'm a crypto-maximalist. I'm a crypto-maximalist. All right. I'm not picking one. Booker, podcast, you're binging now. OK, I'm, yes. I am. Gosh, I'm binging on wheat crashed. Something that brings you simple joy. You know, one of the things that I love, and I've missed being away from this summer, is swimming. I just love, I find like some of my best thoughts come to me while I'm moving. Career philosophy. Yeah. Do a job where you know 50% of the job. And where you're going to learn 50% of the job. Again, that goes back to no growth in the comfort zone, no comfort in the growth zone. I can't tell if I'm Instagramym. Any, any other work gets up over 10% to maybe experience after 30-50 more jobs in the summer. Going to airlines. Anywhere you've gone, in TRACK. Tschek. Jooff idió.

13057," We make it very transparent to the shopper before they accept an order. What the order is going to look like, how much we're going to pay them and how much like the consumer is paying them. And so they can decide whether they take an order or whether they refuse it. And that's a kind of flexibility that our shoppers really value and the kind of transparency that they want. Are you seeing a labor shortage right now? And what are you doing to combat that? It's different in different places or demographic of shoppers is completely different from food delivery and our right sharing where 70% women and half of them are moms. And that's because a lot of the job at Instacart is very different and just being in a car with strangers. It's about like going to the store doing a good job of customer service of really picking the right products for the consumer. And we are seeing that being very appealing to women.

Bloomberg markets to close weekdays on Bloomberg. Welcome to the earth shot prize innovation summit. I'm Francing Lacqua here at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. This event powered by Bloomberg featured finalists selected by the earth shot council. Larns by Prince William. A shot is a global initiative that drives innovation on solutions to climate change and environmental issues. Protect and restore nature. Clean our air, revive our oceans, build our waste free world, fix our climate. Over the next half an hour we'll bring you all the highlights from this most important gathering. This is Bloomberg. Protecting the environment was of course close to my grandmother's heart. I know she would have been delighted to hear about this event and the support you're all giving our earth shot finalists. The next generation of environmental pioneers. Together in this room are the people and organizations who will help us to achieve the earth shot mission. To repair, restore and rejuvenate our planet within this current decade. That mission is not simple. Just as President John F. Kennedy said, as he challenged the United States for America to unite behind the goal of putting man on the moon, we choose to do these things not because they are easy but because they are hard. I know that the world is an uncertain place right now. That many families and communities across the globe are facing unimaginable challenges. From conflicts to energy crisis and food shortages. While addressing these in the short term, we must also remain resolutely focused on tackling the greatest challenges that threaten our tomorrow. Because if we don't, the changing climate will only serve to entrench these immediate challenges into fundamental global issues, severely impacting the lives of each and every one of us. That is why our collective mission is so urgent. But there is huge reason to be optimistic. The 2021 cohort of earth shot winners and finalists is evidence that we can succeed. That we can protect our world for our children, our grandchildren and the generations that will follow them. These pioneers exemplify the leadership needed in this decade of change. They include inspiring activists, brilliant innovators, a forward thinking city and even an entire country making a real difference. But they cannot do it alone. This must be...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1283,2022-10-09 21:34:34
13058," brilliant innovators, a forward-thinking city and even an entire country making a real difference. But they cannot do it alone. This must be a team effort. We must come together behind their innovative solutions to ensure they reach their full potential with peace and scale. While my message today is one of gratitude and encouragement, I also acknowledge that you cannot succeed in isolation. As governments, we have a responsibility to create the incentives and the space for you to flourish, a receptive environment for change and the accountability that comes with guardianship. In many nations, the foundation for this approach has been flayed for us long ago if we choose to listen. Where I come from, I'll tear down New Zealand, a beautiful place you must visit. Our indigenous people hold a world view that every single living and non-living thing is connected. Our people, our plants, our animals, descendants of Ranganoi, the sky father, and Papa Tuanuku, the earth's mother and their children. And so it follows that people and nature are kin, are family. And we must care for one another in the spirit of Kaitiaki Tanga, which translates into guardianship by the people of the land for the next generation. In short, Kau Ahau Te Taiau, Kau Te Taiau, Kau Ahau, I am the environment and the environment is me. Our life source, our economy, our future. Now I've seen this in action first hand many times, not least in my own backyard, the Pacific, where the ocean is a source of protein, income, culture and connection. Now that it is a source of challenge as it rises up and begins to inundate small island nations, it can be confronting to hear and see the stories of just how real these challenges are, but none of us are here because we have given up, but because we believe there is a way to change the future. We are not only part of the nature, but we are nature. Nature is living element. For indigenous people, nature is whole. Our planet is alive. The rivers are her blood. The trees are her hair. The soil, her skin, the wind, her breeze. And indigenous peoples, our planet they know, they are the doctor. We are protecting 80% of the world's biodiversity because our way of life do not harm nature. At the opposite, we are strengthening ecosystems. We improve biodiversity by cooperating with the birds and trees, listening to the winds, observing the cloud, learning from even the little insect. We protect nature by setting up our own limits. We don't take more that mother earth can give and we give back. We protect the sacred trees. We don't destroy the field of the medicinal plants. We choose, pre-susely, the animal that we can kill to just keep the balance of the ecosystem. As all of us know in this fight, no one can afford to sit on the sidelines. No one can claim that climate change is somebody else's problem, or shrug it off for future generations to address. We're all affected by a warming planet. We see that every day. And decisions being made right now will determine our shared tomorrow. So, we must choose and we must act as united nations ourselves. Our progress depends on collective action, on collective ingenuity. If we stick together, we can make fixing the climate the greatest project and greatest achievement of our lifetimes. We have the science, we have the solutions. Now all the world needs is political will. Together, we can create a future where rampant carbon is removed from the atmosphere. For green buildings and green businesses.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1284,2022-10-09 21:38:53
13059," is political will. Together, we can create a future where rampant carbon is removed from the atmosphere, where green buildings and green business transform the livability of communities, where easy access to renewable energy enables greater equity, where sustainable agriculture feeds a growing global population. The needs are urgent and the costs of inaction are worse than any nightmare. But let us not be driven by, let us be driven by hope not fear, by optimism not despair. Because hope is not passive. Hope is the ultimate source of renewable energy, pushing us forward every day to try and try again. Today, the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit, in partnership with Mike Bloomberg and Bloomberg Philanthropies, will ask each and every one of us what we can do to accelerate progress to repair our planet this decade. And offer solutions on how to collaborate to drive this ambitious but essential climate agenda. We will continue to drive impact around system changing climate solutions and amplify the Earth Shop Prize's call to accelerate progress to repair our planet through collaboration and innovation. But most importantly, we will remind ourselves what can be achieved when we turn pessimism to optimism and optimism into action. Coming up, more from the panelists and finalists here at the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit. This is Bloomberg. Back in 1997, I was interested in the following question, which is there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called Sorapod dinosaurs, which had really long skinny necks. So Apatosaurus is an example. Now, I said really long skinny tails. So I made a computer model that showed that in fact the tail of these Sorapod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip, a bull whip. Now the way a bull whip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. Okay. And that crack is a sonic boom. I think the way they got a date was to impress the females by making loud booms. Bloomberg has enhanced search on the terminal to deliver what you need when you need it.

Welcome back to the best of the earth's sharp prize innovation summit. The guests featured ranged from heads of state to leaders of grassroots environmental organizations. Well amongst them was philanthropist and Microsoft founder Bill Gates. Yeah, it's too bad you can't do things overnight in either mitigation adaptation. When I last went through Europe, people were the leaders were all saying, hey, give me technologies so I can tell Putin to get lost. And I said, hey, in five years, you're going to be able to call him up. And they were like, no, we'd like it. No. It's the here and now. Okay, that, how's your planning permission regime and all that planning for that future?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1285,2022-10-09 21:43:08
13060," It's the year alone. OK, that, how's your planning permission regime and all the planning for that future grid? Seeds, typically, between the timing start and they get out in the farmer's fields, is about eight years. Now, we have a pipeline of innovations. We've been funding this CG system for 20 years now. It's funded about a billion a year. People care at all about adaptation. That thing will be funded at 2 billion a year. I mean, there won't be anything close to the impact of climate-related seeds, climate-related maize, rice, wheat, sort of a millet. And thank goodness, because of human genetics, we know how to do the editing. Thank goodness, because of AI, we know how to find the alleles. Because of drones, we can measure stuff in the field. So there's huge advance in terms of how the whole seed ecosystem moves at full speed. The timing is very tricky here. The warming doesn't stop the day you get to zero emissions. There's a lag in this system. It's about a 20-year lag. So you haven't seen that Earth Tempestor's not equilibrated to the atmospheric CO2 content. So when you get to zero, it's not like 2051. Take my air conditioner away. No, it starts quite a bit later. And so you have to look at what the peak is. And you can't just plan for OK, 2030, 2030 is where your maize production in central Africa's down 25%. By 2050, it's down 70%. And you will have switched in most of those areas from a fairly heat-sensitive crop to sorghum. Now sorghum productivity is super low. So we'll get people to do better maize for these next 15 years. And then they are going to have to switch to sorghum. It is tough when you see the floods in Pakistan. I mean, nobody expected that. If the goal of climate was to make us pay attention, wow, that is way beyond expectation. So some adaptation money literally will just be disaffirmative recovery money. The boundary of what's also pretty confusing. I mean, what is food aid? If climate's causing some food production losses, all world-proof program money is that all climate adaptation money? It's certainly the need for it's going up. That's a system that's about 6.5 billion a year, so relative to the systemic solution, which is the research piece, it's relatively larger, but the demand for that piece, which is the acute half-pacostani rice got flushed away. And so you're going to have malnutrition problems if you don't go in for that. That's also a type of adaptation. So I do think we're going to bring some rigor to this because the pressure now, the goal of doubling the adaptation money from, they say, 20 billion a year to 40 billion a year, the pressure on that is a- We still peanuts. No, it's very small. I mean, literally, yeah, if you start sticking food aid in there, you can use it up very quickly, rebuilding after hurricanes. I mean, we had hurricanes before, but the costs there are absolutely gigantic. There are ways of stopping wildfires, there are ways of dealing with sea level rise. So the innovation agenda, not just on seeds, the innovation agenda is going full speed on mitigation. That's where there's 100 companies break through energy's funded. And by mitigation, you mean mostly energy? You mean everything to do with energy? You mean generation of energy? You mean batteries? You mean transport? You mean all of the new? And there are some renewables that are already traditional, but more that need to come on. So that's the package that you're talking about mitigation. Yeah. Or are you also talking about agriculture as mitigation? Yeah. And every area of emissions, the world tends to be...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1286,2022-10-09 21:47:49
13061," So you're talking about mitigation. How are you also talking about agriculture as mitigation? Yeah, so every area of emissions, the world tends to focus on past near cars and electricity. That's not a third of emissions. And so the focus on the easiest third, now 4% of new cars are electric. So that's the field that we're further still long. About 4% of energy generation is wind and solar. And as you triple the size of your grid, you want that to be say, some people would say 100%. Other people might say 70 to 80%. The amount you have to build, we're not within a factor of 5 of the build rate of those. But those are the easy sectors. Cement, clean cement costs over twice as much as the way we make cement today. And it's partly the heating energy. It's partly the basic thing, remember in chemistry, when you take calcium carbonate and heat it, you get calcium, that's what makes cement. But the thing that goes away, that's CO2. And so we have to have a way of making cement, which a number of these innovative. And a steel and iron. Yep. There's a whole family of hard to obey sectors. That's true. If you get a dead industrial sector, if you get green hydrogen that's cheap enough, it actually solves quite a large number of those. Some of the industrial processes should go straight to electricity. And some you do your reduction using the hydrogen, where you would have used some hydrocarbon concept before. For steel, we actually have companies doing both. We have electricity steel and others doing electricity is the way of replacing the blast furnace. And then we have others that take hydrogen. And if you get the hydrogen cheap enough, you get the super magic thing, which is that the green product doesn't cost more. That's called green premium equals zero. And then your adoption scale is utterly different. If we tried to subsidize steel and cement, say rich countries say, OK, we want to get rid of that, which those two are 15% of emissions, that's greater than all foreign aid budgets put together. And so over 200 billion foreign aid never will pass that number. It's just not politically possible. It's a number that's at about 170 and going down today. Coming up, but more from the panelists and finalists here at the Earth's Shop Prize Innovation Summit. This is Bloomberg. Big, expensive cities have a lot going for them. But if you live in one, you probably notice that these big, expensive cities getting more well expensive. You could always move away. You might have just started working remotely, so there's really nothing keeping you there. But then again, moving is a hassle. Well, what if someone paid you 10 grand to do it? What if they threw in free office space, a bicycle, or a gym membership? Programs and cities and states around the US are doing exactly that. And they're getting a lot of interest. We had over 50,000 applications. About 90,000 applications. We had over 1,800 applicants from all over North America. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them? Or are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns for places looking for an injection of fresh talent? Watch Bloomberg surveillance early edition for the news. You need when you need it.

13062," Bergs of Alance. Be informed. Be prepared. Be ahead of the game. Welcome back to the Earth Shop prize innovation summit. Finalists of the annual award appeared alongside special guests, including worldwide business leaders, philanthropists and non-governmental activists. Now while the 2022 finalists have been announced, our panelists have their eyes on the future and here's what they have to say. This is the Earth Shop Decade. We are in a race to repair and regenerate the planet. Some will focus on policy, some will focus on activism. We are focused on supporting the game changes, the innovators, the entrepreneurs and the problem solvers. We believe in the power of human ingenuity, grit and determination to create solutions that if scaled could repair the planet. We have only 8% of the ocean protected today and our Earth Shop is as party said 30 by 30, 30% of the ocean at least, 30% of the ocean protected by 2030. And we know that if we protect the right 30%, not only will we prevent the extinction of many marine species, but also we will produce more fish. There's going to be these protected areas are going to produce a spillover that will exceed the foreground catch. So we're going to have more fish to eat, food security, livelihoods for people. And we know that for every dollar that we invest in a protected area in a marine reserve that produces 10 dollars in economic output and creates more jobs. So it's a triple win for marine life, for food security and for climate and of course for the economy. So that's the goal, the mission to in the next 8 years and that's where the Earth Shop is really, it's pretty crazy. In the next 8 years we need to quadruple all the ocean protection that has ever happened in human history. Are you optimistic that can be done? I am optimistic there's no choice. I've seen firsthand the potential that a breakthrough idea can hold and if we start seeing more of these transformative solutions across all the challenges facing our planet and suddenly our Earth Shop won't seem so improbable. The work will be difficult, it'll take extraordinary resources, determination, partnership, but we've got all the essentials right here in this room. So what is the challenge? It's the speed, scale and cost of making these green hydrogen generators. Well that's exactly what we are working on because to make green hydrogen the fuel source of the future it needs to be cheaper than fossil fuels and that means electrolyzers are going to need to be really, really cheap. If you want to take a solution around the globe as quickly as possible you need to make it standardized mass-produced commodity. A product that is easy to make and quick to build and cheap as well. And so while some believe electrolyzers need to be large machines we believe the electrolyzer should be a standardized mass-producible product that can make green hydrogen anywhere for anyone. In 2030 we imagine millions and millions of projects on restore and not just places on Earth where we see nature being brought back but all of the other nodes that are key to ensuring success. So the technology providers, the nurseries, the seed banks, the funders, the government incentive programs so that we have an ecosystem that really allows us to leverage the many, many connections within the nature-based solution space. And in 2030 we have been focused on another key area which is cities and cities require data and insights to take action on climate and to preserve nature to create more nature and tree canopy. So we've set a goal that we want to- We have more nature in cities exactly. Exactly right. And so we've been partnering with cities like Los Angeles to give them insights utilizing AI and geomapping on where all the places that you can create more tree canopy which reduces-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1288,2022-10-09 21:56:18
13063," And we've been partnering with cities like Los Angeles to give them insights utilizing AI and geo mapping on where all the places that you can create more tree canopy, which reduces urban heat islands, improves air quality sequesters, carbon. So we want to bring data and solutions to bringing nature into cities as well as of course preserving and restoring nature. And so one of the goals that we've set is we want to enable over 500 cities around the world. I know we're going to hear from the mayor of Paris after this to reduce a gigaton of carbon emissions by 2030. And so that's through data, tools, insights, whether that's evolving transportation systems or planting new tree canopy. So that's a big bold target that we want to see achieved by 2030. Anyway, I guess I'm in the wrong place. I came here to invite all of you to the Grouch Convention, but it turns out you're all about my least favorite thing, helping. Oh, you've got me, Oscar. I do like helping people learn how to reuse, repurpose and recycle. Together everyone in this room can build a world where nothing goes to waste. And that includes even you. Me? Sorry, Mike. I got to get going to that convention, but just between us. I do have a recycling bin right next to my can. But no, I think it out okay. It'll ruin my image. But my father believed in the power of the idea. And over time, the vision, the purpose, the courage it embodied has inspired each generation to take on its own challenges. Not because they're easy, but because they're hard. President Kennedy understood that the effort to land on the moon would bring out the best in us that everyone would have to contribute, that it would require innovation, creativity, teamwork, commitment and faith. And that world would be better because of it. The Earth Shot Prize has inspired the same spirit of optimism and ingenuity on a global scale to tackle the most pressing challenge we now face, repairing the planet. My family and I are so excited that the Prince of Wales will honor this year's Earth Shot Prize winners in partnership with the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, a city that is committed to scientific excellence, environmental justice and the fight against climate change. We're proud that President Kennedy's moonshot legacy still inspires hope and we look forward to welcoming all of you who are working to ensure a better future here on Earth.

Where's the greater pressure? I think it's definitely trying to win a championship. It's hard because when you invest and you know this, when you're investing, you can control a lot more things. When in a basketball court you can't control whether somebody's going to make a shot, you've got to get lucky. And what's the greater pleasure making five times your money on a distressed debt investment or winning the NBA championship? They're both fabulous. I wish I could do one each year. That would be great, but I think there's a great feeling in being right on an investment that you've done a tremendous amount of work and you've made money for your clients, which I think is great. I think winning a championship is, it's a very surreal feeling because there's a whole city or state that is actually behind you. We had 70,000 people at the finals and we are all outside.

Welcome to Deborah, Australia. I'm Heidi Stroudwats in Sydney. We're counting down to Asia's major market open. Good evening from Bloomberg's World Headquarters in New York. I'm Kathleen Hays. Top stories this hour. Asian stocks look set to fall as strong US jobs data heighten concerns over the impact of tightening monetary policy. Chinese markets returning after the Golden Week holiday. Chinese top leaders are fighting. Before the twilight decade communist party, Congress of course got blamed. That's likely to hand Xi Jinping a third time as president. Beijing warning the Biden administration's new chip restrictions will hurt supply chains and the world economy. Now, as for Wall Street, yes, that hot labor market news through some cold water on the stock market, 263,000 new jobs created. The unemployment rate back down to 3.5 percent last month. That's a 50 year low, 5 percent year over your gains and paychecks, average hourly earnings. All of that suggested the Fed is not going to look back over its shoulder and think about a pivot. You know, it's more rate hikes, possibly 75 for the next two meetings. That's what people are betting at this point. As you look at futures, you can see that they are both on the NASDAQ and the S&P down about a third of a percent. Very big losses on Friday, the S&P 500 down 2.8 percent, 95 percent of the companies in the end, next close lower. The NASDAQ was down 3.8 percent, nearly a 4 percent loss. So that is quite a move there. Moving on to the bond market, no surprise with that kind of market news, that kind of jobs news. The 10 year note yield, approaching 3.9 percent now, it's been up for 10 weeks in a row. And it's not just the question of the 75 basis point hikes at the next meeting. It's a terminal rate. The derivatives market is now pricing in a 4.7 percent rate by March. Dollar strengthening as well, you are actually a little bit lower on the screen now. But definitely it was higher on Friday. And oil, a very big story as you know Annabelle. Biggest weekly gain since March after OPEC plus announced those 2 million barrel, per day cuts. We have the WTI West Texas Internet Media. It was up 16 percent last week to about $93 a barrel. You can see it's back at that kind of holding city at that level. But it's concerns about supply and all that that is pushing the price up. We had been worried about global recession, hurting demand. What a difference, an OPEC plus production cut can make. That's right Kathleen, but the question of course, how long can this oil gains last? But certainly as you say, it's really all about this follow through from Wall Street, the risk of the fake.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1290,2022-10-09 22:04:55
13065," That's right Kathleen, but the question of course how long can this oil gains last but certainly as you say it's really all about this follow through from Wall Street the risk of the Fed continuing to stay aggressive so that is really the trading tone ahead of the open here in Asia got ASX200 futures last close like this New Zealand online to the downside a lot of markets in Asia are closed today for public holidays who got Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Malaysia all shut but we're still keeping an eye on what we're seeing in the currency space particularly the yen this morning so it's looking like this continuing to just weaken slightly against the greenback it is very close now to the levels that sparked intervention back at the inner September so that was 14590 the reminder on that one and then also keeping an eye on what we're seeing in the offshore you one as well this morning looking like this after it's best week since May but certainly we're starting to get that read through on just how weak consumer spending was during the key golden week period not great so far could put the PBOC under further pressure as we head into the fourth corners of your change on now so only the PBOC one of the real outliers with its easier policy settings compared to what we see around the rest of the world Kathleen around 90 central banks so far hiking boring costs this year the question is how aggressive they can stay when you're sparking at the risk of uneas amongst not only investors but general consumers and more recession headwinds well and that's certainly the big story this week isn't at Heidi because we've got the IMF World Bank meetings and all these the central bank aggressive high-grade story is something that emerging markets are already complaining about and of course there's a lot of questioning if it's going to be too much cause an unnecessarily deep recession others are saying you know what it's going to do exactly what it needs to do and no matter what the cost or matter what the pain it's going to bring down inflation let's listen to Larry Summers former Treasury Secretary who's been pounding the table long and hard for the Fed to go ahead and keep raising rates so it meets that objective I think it's a real mistake to suggest that somehow we shouldn't do the monetary policies that are necessary to avoid inflation becoming entrenched because of concerns about financial stability and of course it's not just the Fed it's the ECB as you know Heidi it's the Bank of England even the RBNZ last week go RBNZ they did their 50 basis point hike but they talked about 75 right and of course the outliers as Annabelle just mentioned you've got China you got Japan they're not going to do anything and the RBA was notable last week too right they did the 25 instead of the 50 so there's some there are few there's a handful that aren't being so aggressive but many others seem to be on that path and certainly not doing anything when it comes to following the rest of the pack but certainly the PIVIOC could be really made to do more because Kathleen even as we're going to get this drumbeat into the last week as we get into the party Congress meetings where we assume that we get a third term for President Xi Jinping a lot of analysts and economists hopeful that we could see a roadmap out of COVID-0 coming out of the party Congress but if you take a look at where cases are sitting 1600 when the 1600 new COVID cases on Saturday this is the highest for China since early September it comes at a pretty bad time when it comes to this key political gathering right and a lot of these have come over of course the National Day holidays the the Golden Week holidays I should say and it really does call into question will the leadership be willing to loosen the reins when it comes to COVID-0 even after this key political gathering has happened if not we could potentially see the PIVIOC being forced to do more also more heavy lifting on the fiscal side as well what it comes to US markers yes and 500 NASDAQ 100 index is both coming off their best weeks in a month where the market goes from here likely lies in a batch of eco data that will come to us over the next couple of days that's bringing our chief rates correspondent for Asia and M live contributor Garfield Reynolds and Garf obviously the the main topic is still whether we're going to see this central bank misstep right the policy arrow that is kind of being priced in if you take a look at some aspects of swap pricing for example for the Fed what are you looking at this week well I mean a big part of what I'm looking at this week is you know whether we get a return of dip buying either into inflation or even after inflation in a lot of ways this might sound a little bit weird I almost think the CPI is now a side show when it comes to what the Fed is going to do you know unless",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1291,2022-10-09 22:09:41
13066," In a lot of ways, this might sound a little bit weird. I almost think the CPI is now a side show when it comes to what the Fed is going to do. Unless you get an extraordinarily big cooldown in inflation, having the jobless rate go back down to 3.5%, strong jobs growth, strong wages growth, there's no reason whatsoever for Fed officials to say, okay, the job is done on inflation. And even when we have some very strong indications that there are major dangers for recession, they're going to be looking at that jobless rate and saying, 3.5%, why would we stop hiking rates? You could even argue if you get a slow down in inflation, they would say, well, this shows we should be doing this because jobs are staying resilient and inflation is coming down. So given that, I think there's a lot of dangers for people who do come into the by-inter by-the-dip. I also suspect there are going to be plenty of people who are willing to do that because we've got such a strong expectation across a range of asset classes that peak inflation is in and therefore peak rate heights are coming. So every little bit of horgishness that we get from central banks, a lot of people are treating that as, okay, that's another step closer to when they stop. That's a good way of looking at it. But I have to say, I second everything you said, Garfield, about the Fed and inflation and even a very weak CPI report would be near far, far away from that. And that's our chief rates correspondent for Asia and M-life contributor, Garfield Reynolds. Now let's move on to China where Chinese president Xi Jinping has begun the Communist Party's final meeting before the National Congress begins next Sunday. Meanwhile, COVID cases nationwide are mounting and we're seeing new evidence of slowing economic activity. Wow, our chief North Asia correspondent Steven Engle joins us. So it's a very interesting, a very, very, very, very, very, very, very important event. What do you think is going on behind closed doors in Beijing? Well, this is what's called the seventh plenum on this current five-year plan. And essentially the 370 members of the Central Committee, the members as well as the alternates are gathering behind closed doors. As of yesterday, they'll be meeting this week. Essentially, it's a bit more mundane. They're going to be formalizing perhaps Xi Jinping's speech on Sunday, which should cover the gamut of all the challenges and the priorities for the party going forward as Xi Jinping no doubt will secure his president's busting a third consecutive term because at the last party Congress, he essentially did away with term limits for the top man, EG Him, as well as age limits as well. We're likely to have that essentially go by the wayside for everyone except him, right? So there's lots to be had behind closed doors, but there are still obviously lots of challenges that Xi Jinping will no doubt have to address. The big one obviously is the drags on the economy caused by COVID, obviously. Steve, you're going into these big events in Beijing. You know, as well as I, everything is perfect. Right, the sky's blue. There's no traffic. Everything goes to plan. They don't want to be seeing this big surge in COVID cases just before this. Yeah, so surge, you have to put that into perspective. There were 1,645 new cases nationwide on Saturday, but that's too many for the leadership in Beijing to handle ahead of this highly politically charged Congress that starts next Sunday. The big clusters are far away from the power base, obviously. The new clusters forming in Xinjiang, as well as Inner Mongolia. But there were a handful of cases reported this weekend in Shanghai, as well as Beijing. Eight cases in Beijing outside of quarantine. And that is going to be a concern because, again, China is just coming out of a week-long holiday where people, not as much as in years past, did travel around the country. There could be more transmission chains that the leadership is comfortable with. So they're going to be watching that very closely. But again, Beijing at this time of year, yeah, there are blue skies, Heidi, as you know. But you know what? The security cordon and the security apparatus is going to be in full force. There's not going to be a lot of movement around the city as Xi Jinping has his big party Congress, obviously. I'd chief North Asia correspondent David Eng.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1292,2022-10-09 22:13:57
13067," In full force, there's not going to be a lot of movement around the city as Xi Jinping has his big party congress obviously. Our Chief Nolfei's correspondent, David Engel, there on that top story for us. Let's get over to Vodhi Kuin with our first headlines, Voney. Hi, V, thank you and good morning. China is criticizing the expanded U.S. restrictions on access to semiconductor technology. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Maoning called them unfair and said they will also hurt the interests of U.S. companies. The cheaper it is, they'll harm supply chains and the world economy. Recent U.S. measures seek to stop China's drive to develop its own chip industry and advance its military capabilities. South Korea says its military will boost security cooperation with the U.S. and Japan, including the deployment of what it calls U.S. strategic assets. This comes after North Korea test fired two more missiles Sunday. Seoul says the provocations violate U.N. Security Council resolutions and will strengthen sanctions against its neighbor. Russian President Vladimir Putin is blaming Ukraine for the attack that badly damaged a key bridge linking annexed Crimea to Russia. In his first comments on the attack, Putin blamed the Ukrainian Secret Service, alleging they had helped from some Russians, as well as unnamed foreign states. Kiev has not officially claimed responsibility for the blast, although it has celebrated the explosion with a new postage stamp. UK Prime Minister Liz Tross is planning to speak directly this week to mutinous MPs and our Conservative Party. Chancellor Kwasi Kwareteng was set to address a regular meeting of lawmakers on Wednesday, but Tross is now expected to replace him. A poorly received tax cut package and a fractious annual conference have Tross fighting to regain control of her party just a month into her tenure.

What's for? What's at stake at the upcoming Chinese Accompanist Party Congress? The former Australian ambassador to Beijing, Jeff Ravie will be with us with his insights. We're coming up next. We preview the Asian trading week with Bill Deriggs at Grady Wolfe, who hear what she's seeing as potentially a recession proof investments. This is Bloomberg. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the road today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building across America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels, we want to do that with our buildings. If we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. If we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. The street prepares for the latest read on inflation. The market has been right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1293,2022-10-09 22:18:01
13068," Street prepares for the latest read on inflation. Peek-fad, Peek-hole, Kishnests, we're getting carried away. The market's been right. Our rate hike starting to pay off. How long is it going to take to see progress on inflation? Fed just has a long way to go. Instant reaction on Bloomberg surveillance. Inflation is still stick to US economy, is still on track. And what it means for the Fed? The data will tell us. I think we're quite always away from the poll. This is a Fed that will blame the prudent thing to do is to ease off a little bit and just have a look around. Inflation, in focus, Thursday. On Bloomberg. Now let's take a look at the week ahead. The International Monetary Fund releases its latest world economic outlook as global finance chiefs gather in Washington. These will be the first fully in-person IMF World Bank meetings since the outbreak of COVID in early 2020. US inflation data for September do this week, after a hotter than expected reading in August. Tempered hopes of any kind of slowdown. India and China also releasing inflation numbers later this week. And minutes from this Fed September meeting will give clues into officials' tolerance for economic pain, even recession, as they battle price pressures. Meanwhile, many economists expect the Bank of Korea to make a many-you turn on the scale of rate likes during this decision this week as the Fed's rapid tightening piles pressure on the wann. And Singapore's monetary authority releases its policy statement on Friday, the central banks expected to tighten for a fifth straight meeting hiding. We'll also be watching, of course, the reopening of China's financial markets after the golden week holiday. The CSI 300 went into that week long break near its lowest levels since April 2020, but how long have grown investment group remember he called that big boom bust in the markets a few years ago. He says the focus for returning traders will be China's specific challenges, including, of course, COVID-0, the Elling property market, as we continue to count down to the party in Congress this week. Big bank earnings also in focus. At the end of this week, we're kicking off with JP Morgan, City Group Morgan Stanley, the first report they're quarterly numbers, analysts are looking for investment banking revenues to slump as clients stayed on the sidelines. And that is your week ahead. And, as Gersh says, she's shifted into stocks that perform well in a recessionary environment with high inflation. And interest rates adding to soaring uncertainty, let's bring in Grady Wolf, market analyst at Boulder. Grady, Grady, great to have you with us. So we were just talking to Gufford earlier about how it always feels like regardless of what the near-term CPI prints come in at. The Fed is on a track. What does that mean for markets? Given that it still feels like there are participants in these markets that are second-guessing what the Fed is doing. Absolutely. Well, we're seeing a shift out of growth stocks, a pandemic-favorite stock, so we're like the after-pays of the world. And the pandemic dialings, really. And we're seeing people with shiver investors shifting into the safe havens of the banks again because we know they perform well in a normalized yield curve. And then we've got the gold miners actually looking really good over the next 12 months as we're anticipating that turn around in the US dollar. So at the moment, we're seeing a lot of shift into consumers' stable stocks, the likes of Woolworth, Domino's Pizza. These perform well over a five-year period and generally perform really well in an inflationary environment. What happens if there is a policy misstep, though, because there's a great deal of uncertainty. And what are you expecting out of the next earnings season? Our valuation expectations low enough. They are low enough at the moment. And we're expecting a lot of revenues and profits to be hit at the moment with there on the back of that rising interest rates around the world, inflation around the world, and the outlooks that we're... Investors are looking for outlook. A lot of companies have failed to provide outlook in any guidance and certainty. And investors have been very, very quick to punish them on this front in knowing that there's no certainty in the markets globally. So when companies, the likes of App and Adown were sold off last week, after downgrading their earnings guidance. So at the moment, investors are looking for some form of certainty in this current inflationary environment. And if there is a downturn, investors are looking for the... We've seen rallies off the back of the RBA coming in lower than expected in the markets. So I think at the moment, investors, any rally is very short-lived. How about energy? I see that you have been positive on energy stocks for a while. I'm wondering if the OPEC Plus cut last week made you even more positive?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1294,2022-10-09 22:22:51
13069," You see that you have been positive on energy stocks for a while. I'm wondering if the Ulpec Plus cut last week made you even more positive? Absolutely. We're definitely really positive on the energy sector. We're seeing a lot of momentum in investing into the likes of boss energy, beach energy and more concentrated stocks as opposed to investors who are some of the investors are piling into the wood sides and santauses for their diversified portfolios. But the ones that are catching our eye at Bell Direct are the boss energies of the world for the uranium projects and we're seeing that Japan turning back on the nuclear power plant. So the drive for uranium is going up and commodity prices are through the roof. We're seeing energy or oil prices at that all-time high lately. So energy is definitely one sector. We're seeing a lot of momentum in at the moment and we can't see it downside anytime soon. And with Ulpec Plus cutting the daily oil production, it is a positive and a negative oil prices in both Australia and around the world, but demand is going to continue soaring. So what about gold? You seem to keep at least one of your eyes very firmly on commodities of all kinds. And you think when the dollar turns around gold miners locally in Australia will surge, but the dollar turn around is a big question at this point. The dollar turn around is a big question at the moment and when it will happen, but we see the recessionary outlook is pretty high in the UK and Europe, which will obviously weigh on the US market. So local gold producers have actually done really well through the last few months and years as the Australian spot gold price has maintained resilience throughout the downturn in obviously the US dollar. Well, sorry, the surging US dollar and downturn in commodity prices over in the US. So Australian gold miners are set to look really, really positive over the next 12 months. We're expecting a lot for new crest mining and degreigning and a lot of different gold producers on that front. When you take a look at bonds as a part of the balance portfolio, they become a bit more relevant now. They definitely are. And as we've seen, bond yields are absolutely soaring at the moment with the rising interest rates. So there's diversification across portfolios and investors are increasingly considering bonds as part of their portfolios, especially in this inflationary environment at the moment. You know, many analysts, no matter what market they're looking at right now, are talking about the earning season and looking at banks, et cetera. How are earning seasons in markets around the world, factoring into your expectations and what you're waiting to see? Well, from the big banks specifically at the end of this week, we're going to see starting of big banks coming out with their earning seasons. And we're expecting to see high profits, but also looking for the increased provision of doubtful debts on their profit and loss statements. As we know, a lot of people around the world increased their or took on loans that they didn't understand or couldn't quite afford and didn't have the outlook that we saw the RBA and global with the feds everywhere around the world, increasing interest rates at such aggressive rate hikes overseas. So I think at the moment we're seeing we're looking to see a provision for doubtful debts increasing as the banks. And just how big we're not sure. So eyes will be kept firmly on that metric as the report's coming out to see just how big the bank how the big banks are expecting the defaults to increase over time. Grady Wolf, market analyst at Bell Direct here in Sydney, will coming up, trying to blast expanded US restrictions on its access to chip technology, saying they'll harm supply chains and the global economy. We have that story ahead. This is Bloomberg. What do you think of when you think of a battery?

13070," What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most it's what we use to power devices for both work and play and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades they've gotten way more powerful, long lasting and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi trillion dollar opportunity and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. Now, quick check of latest business flash headlines. Renault said to be open to cutting a stake in Nissan. Sources say the partners are ramping up talks over the French car makers plans to split its electric car and combustion engine assets due in early November. We're told Nissan is pressing Renault to reduce its stake to 15% even if the two car makers shares in each other.

Trends from last week show a sharp slide in holiday spending as COVID-related lockdowns continue to sap consumer sentiment. Services activity contracted in September for the first time in four months. China is praising Elon Musk's proposal for a Hong Kong-like unification system for Taiwan. In a financial time's profile, Musk says he would support a special administrative zone for Taiwan. On Twitter, China's ambassador to the US thanked Musk, saying one country, two systems framework was key. Taiwan's president, Tsai Ing-wen, will pledge on Monday to strengthen the island's economy and deepen ties with Democratic allies in a national day speech. The Biden administration says it remains ready for talks with North Korea on removing nuclear weapons from the Korean Peninsula. The National Security Council spokesman, John Kirby, also says Washington is increasing military cooperation with South Korea and Japan to counter threats from Kim Jong-un. North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles Sunday, adding to 10 it launched over the past two weeks. French President Emmanuel Macron has urged citizens not to panic and to act responsibly after short his calls via a fine-re-strike left gas stations in some regions completely drained. And those are your first word headlines. Thank you, Bonnie. Now let's take a look at China criticizing US plans to expand restrictions on its access to semiconductor technology, saying they'll harm supply chains and the world economy. President Biden announced the export curbs on Friday. So let's get more now from Bloomberg's Tony Chuska in Washington. So Tony, we're looking at global resources. In the last session, chips industry kind of beaten up a lot of these companies. Why did the Biden administration move this move to do this now? Well, Kathleen, it's, I guess you can see it in the larger framework in one sense of the China-US competition. The US's argument is that China has publicly announced ambitions, especially on AI and also on chipmaking, and that it uses these capabilities or plans if one, you know, as they come online, these capabilities will be used to surveil the Chinese citizens and build up the Chinese military. And this is something that the administration has to take action against. And of course, it's not, you know, it's part of a bigger, whatever you want to call a competition or maybe antagonism between the world's two biggest economies. How do we see this impacting potentially US-based companies? Well, the US-based companies, after this dropped, for example, we heard from Envidia who said, well, in so many words, that they've already factored this in. But of course, it comes at a sensitive time as you pointed out at the top for the entire",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1297,2022-10-09 22:35:24
13072," in so many words that they've already factored this in. But of course, it comes at a sensitive time as you pointed out at the top for the entire industry and with sales under pressure. And then there's an international aspect to it, which is that the Biden administration, if you want to make something like this stick, it would also have to get semiconductor companies in other allied countries to go along with it. Because of course, the US is not the only country where this manufacture happens. And also not the only country that exports the machines needed to make these high-end chips. So Tony, there are a lot of complications here. But when you step back and you say, how airtight binding in these restrictions be given this is an international market, chips chip making equipment, one company depends on another. It's a very complicated chain. Right, that's exactly it. And that was the argument that was taken up by the Chinese foreign ministry in their response. They said this will backfire. First of all, it's unfair and legal under international trade rules, which of course is something that would have to be taken up elsewhere. But China said this will backfire, and it will harm global supply chains and the global economic recovery. And if you parse what the US companies were saying, for example, I mean, there is possibly some overlap there. It's a global industry. And this is something that, you know, the bottom line is it's something that's hard to enforce. When folks from New Shishko there in Washington, we're staying with China and the Chinese President Xi Jinping has kicked off the final meeting of China's top leaders' days before the opening of the Communist Party Congress that set to hand him a third term in power. Let's get more analysis with the former Australian ambassador to China, Jeff Rabie, who's now the chairman of Jeff Rabie and associates. He joins us now in Sydney. Jeff, always great to have you. From the program, obviously geopolitical tensions be it with the US, with Australia, you know, the inroads in the Solomon Islands and around the Pacific are all key. But does the shadow of COVID-0 really loom over everything that the leadership does going into this Congress right now? Well, certainly it's a huge issue for them. And it's had a very big drag on the economy. It's been seen throughout the course of this year since the obni-crime variant came along with random lockdowns, sudden extending for very long periods of time. But you touched on a very good point. I think we have to understand the full of the Congress. The domestic issues will prevail over foreign policy issues. There are signs, and we obviously, with censorship and things like that, it's difficult. You're not like you're going to get a survey of how people feel about COVID-0, but there are signs of breakthrough of the malcontent over such a long period. Do you think that is weighing into the leadership's ultimate desire for stability above everything else? Absolutely. I think the random lockdowns, the uncertainty, and the demonstration of the state's capriciousness is having a really big impact on how people in China, the middle classes, and the big cities like Shanghai or Guangzhou or somewhere, how they think about the state and the system and the political system they live under. And this is quite unusual. It's not just about COVID. It's about the uncertainty and risks of living in a system that's at one party state. There's also the credibility issue and the frustration of being invest or someone who does business with China, right? And you would know, obviously, a lot of your clients are the biggest names in Australian business that work with China. Has there been increasing frustration that this policy is still standing? Yeah, so very much so, because, again, there's a lack of certainty, the capriciousness, and the inability to get things done. And you don't really know if you're going to be able to meet a client or not, so difficult still to travel to China or for Chinese partners to come to Australia. So it is, I think, very damaging for the economy. Good, Jeff. We've all been...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1298,2022-10-09 22:40:01
13073," China, or for Chinese partners to come to Australia. With all this, even more public discontent, and I'm sure there's probably a lot more behind the scenes, everyone expects that Xi Jinping is going to be there for years. You know, that he's not just going to get one more term, he's going to get many more terms. What would it take? What will have to happen for someone somehow in the Communist Party to push back and gently let someone else take over? Well, Catherine, I think the key thing there is what you said about the Communist Party. First and foremost, China does have an institutional mechanism of governance, say, unlike really Russia these days, and Xi Jinping is a servant of the party. So, at the point of which the party feels that Xi is in some way undermining the party's legitimacy, its support in the broader community, then elite members of the party could well start to question whether Xi is the right person to lead the party. He has the presidency, there's a lot of focus on the presidency about the two term limit being removed at the last Congress. That's not the key institutional position, it's general secretary of the party and he has to maintain internal support from the party. I don't see anything happening between now and the next week, but certainly over time, if Xi is unable to maintain strong support for the party and legitimacy for the party, then his position could be undermined and he ultimately could be brought down. I can only imagine what's going on in the world coming out of COVID, looking at global recession potentially, this would not be a time for the leaders, the power base in the party to make any kind of move like that, the property crisis. How big of a black eye is that for Xi or does everyone just figure that it was necessary to stir that pot and the government ultimately helped create the crisis by putting focus on the indebtedness and causing bond holders all over China to start selling their bonds, etc. etc. Yeah, but the deal everging has been underway for best on two years now. To a certain extent, it's managed, controlled. I think amongst the leadership, there's acceptance and understanding that this excessively leveraged property sector needed to be and something had to be done. I don't think that by itself is an issue, but the point is, there's a confluence of issues that really challenge Xi. COVID and his management, weak economic growth as a result of his management of COVID to a large extent, and exceptionally weak growth, deleveraging in the property sector. And also, I mean, Xi has quite a lot of enemies because of the way he's run the anti-corruption campaign over the past 10 years. The pressures on him are enormous and each one adds to the weight that he has to carry and also builds the arguments of those who may want to see him dispatched. You know, our very own Tom Olic has a book called China, The Bubble and Never Birth. It's quite a fascinating reading when you look at this as a country that frequently encounters historical crises, but always surmounce them. Is that just a benefit of the top down policy making? And does that mean even with political risks mounting that the economic risks will always be managed somehow? Yeah. It depends on the circumstances, right? But Tom's book is a terrific book and I highly recommend it to everybody. A big part of Tom's book is really talking about how analysts and forecasters have got China wrong year after year after year. And then there must be something going on as to why people have got their calls on China so badly wrong and have been predicting the bubble to burst, but it's never burst. But quite clearly, when they're doing 2% growth this year and you've got a big clean out on the property sector, massive deleveraging, it may be getting close to a burst now. And the last word on the sort of geopolitical security direction after the Congress. Do you see a change in, say, the relationship, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1299,2022-10-09 22:44:41
13074," Now, and the last word on the sort of geopolitical security direction after the Congress, do you see a change in say the relationship that the dynamic between the US and China and also Australian China? We have seen these meetings between Penny Wong and her Chinese counterparts in recent weeks and months. Yeah, I think the US dynamic is pretty much stuck on geopolitical competition. I don't see any off-ramp at present and indeed some escalation of tension. Australia and China is quite interesting. It seems throughout the course of this year that the Chinese side has made overtures to the Australian side. So we've had two meetings between the Foreign Minister, Penny Wong and Wang Yi. We've had an exchange of letters between the Trade Ministers and one meeting between the Defence Ministers. As I wrote last week in the Australian Financial Review, there are clearly green shoots. The problem is getting a bit more excitement into the relationship and the problem there is on the Australian side to the extent that China quite stupidly imposed trade measures against several Australian products, five in fact. And no Australian government quite rightly can move forward with the relationship until China removes those trade measures. China should have imposed the trade measures, their counterproductive and now they are the major barrier in moving the relationship forward. So whilst one hand China is indicating a wish to move forward and normalise the relationship, they won't remove the trade measures uniquely because they'll lose face and the Australian government can't move forward until those measures are removed. So we have a problem that needs to be managed through quite skillful diplomacy. Jeff, I just have to get one more in here because one of the big concerns in the US is China's military might, how big it might get. Xi Jinping stays in leadership role, where does that go? Well, China will continue to modernise its military as its economy grows and as its global reach expands. That's to be expected. I think still, and most military analysts would agree with this, that the US is decades ahead of China in military capacity, experience in using the military and so on. So there isn't really any direct military threat to the United States or other people. The point I'd make, as I've made in my book, on China's grand strategy, is that China, unlike Russia even, is incredibly vulnerable to global sanctions. It depends on the rest of the world for all the iron ore, all the energy, a big part of the food it needs. China is utterly dependent on world markets and that constrains Chinese military adventurism. And I think the United Western sanctions against Russia over Ukraine, underscore the risks to Beijing of military adventurism anywhere, including in Taiwan. Jeff always creates a chat with you, especially on a key time like this going into the party congress, Jeff Rabie, former Australian ambassador to China here in Sydney. Well, coming up, we hear from the US Labor Secretary, Margie Walsh, who weighs in on the latest jobs numbers. What they say about the health of the economy, that conversation is up next. This is Bloomberg. Watch Bloomberg surveillance early edition for the news you need when you need it. I'm going to be watching retail earnings from both Home Depot and Walmart. Then surveillance for in-depth analysis. Long-sides homecane, at least of Rambut, some Jonathan Farrah. Across the board, these are good numbers. The big headline there is reaffirming the outlook.

13075," I'm at some John at the Fairock. Across the board these are good numbers. A big headline there is reaffirming the outlook. How much does this give faith that you can get some sort of resurgence in consumer spending? Bloomberg surveillance. Be informed. Be prepared. Be ahead of the game. This October delegates will meet for the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party. As questions mild about China's economy, COVID-0 policy and foreign relations, President Xi Jinping is looking to secure an historic third term. Keep it tuned to Bloomberg for the up to the minute coverage and expert analysis you need. Coverage begins October 16th with special Sunday programming on Bloomberg, your global business authority. U.S. employers continue to hire at a solid pace with the jobless rate unexpectedly returning to an historic low in September. In an interview with Bloomberg Television, Labor Secretary Marty Walsh flagged the risk of the labor market from rising prices. We need to continue to bring down the flesh-hury pressures that people have. Certainly, what OPEC made a decision on this week to do was not helpful to us. The President was disappointed with the disappointment that it was administration, but we need to continue to bring down those pressures. I mean, I think that, you know, I had a long conversation in my office today. I certainly don't want to see that unemployment number go up. I like to see people working. That's what the Fed is forecasting. Some people say that's the objective. How are you preparing for the pain that they're forecasting? And what can we do on the supply side when it comes to things like immigration? Well, on the unemployment, you know, we were talking for the last three months about seeing those numbers go down. And in the year 2022, we've had about 440,000 jobs per month. We're still seeing people 263,000 people going to work today. This month, I should say, the last month. We're still seeing those numbers going on. So I think that that's something that is important that we continue to put those gains. We still have job openings. People are still looking for work. Obviously, we'd like to see the participation rate a little higher. I mean, that number went down a little bit this month. I think one tenth of a percent. So we're going to, we have to see what's happening there. Clearly, the employee over the last couple of years is getting some leverage it hasn't had for a few years. A number of years may be even decades over their employers. You broke a deal with unions in the last few months with freight rail companies, the 12 unions. I understand four of them have ratified the deal, Marcy. Secretary Welsh, are you worried about the other rate? No, I'm not. I mean, they're out there explaining, when I say they, the union leadership now and the bargaining committees are out there explaining to the members what's in those contracts. It was a very painful negotiation, not what I had, but leading up to me. Two years of negotiation with really no movements. And I think that there's explaining to do in these contracts. And I look at these contracts. They have good contract. I mean, it's 24% over five years. Healthcare, freeze cap, work rules changed. It was a good contract for the employer and employee as well. So hopefully we can get the rest of these ratified in the next, I think, next six weeks. In the Rose Garden, the president said this, because of this labor agreement, those rail workers will get better pay. A 24% wage increase over the next five years, improved working conditions, peace of mind around their health care by capping across the workers will have to pay. Have the poor workers on the West Coast Secretary Welsh asked for the same conditions? No, I mean, I don't know, I didn't get in, I don't know what they're asking for for wages and benefits, but certainly those are all the conversations that generally on the table. A little different negotiation. The West Coast Port negotiation is a very fluid conversation that the both sides are at the table. They both have in conversations. It's a longer process than I anticipated, but that's just historically the way they've operated. They kind of take one segment at a time. I stay in close contact with both the employer side in the, in the unions in the West Coast port. You know, both sides express to me that they're still moving forward. They'll obviously be sticky issues that will pop up every now and then, but nothing that's making me be concerned that I have to have a 20 hour meeting in my office about. They were Secretary Marty Wall speaking of Blueberry's Jonathan Farrow earlier. Now sticking with US jobs numbers for morning.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1301,2022-10-09 22:52:58
13076," be concerned that I have to have a 20 hour meeting in my office about. The Secretary of State Marty Walsh speaking with Blueberry's Jonathan Farrow earlier. Now, sticking with US jobs numbers for morning calls, let's bring in Annabelle to discuss a read through from strategist Annabelle. What are we hearing? Yeah, well, basically as we know, Kathleen, the overall read through from these job numbers is that the labor market is still tight and that wage growth is not, uh, rather the supply of workers isn't growing fast enough to try and bring down wage growth. And so what we're seeing from markets, you can see here across the screen, basically, a lot of investors really coming to terms with this idea that the idea of peak corgishness from the Fed is not here yet. So we're seeing US futures still looking to open lower. ASX 200 futures were also 10 minutes out from the open for Sydney and that is extending declines their New Zealand also in the red. A lot of criticism, if you change your now, that the Fed was slow to act, we've heard that from a lot of different voices, but Jeffree is actually taking a different view here and they're saying it's not the Fed that actually has been transparent in telegraphing the heights ahead. Of course, we could see 75 basis points were basically a done deal. The next one possibly again in December, it's actually investors that have been slow really to catch up and that's why we're seeing Heidi, what Jeffree's calls a sort of emotional reaction to the physical realities. Plenty of critics, of course, of the Fed, Bell and of course, Mohammad Arian is one of the most outspoken. What are we hearing? Yes, so he was speaking on the US television, basically giving his views on the US jobs numbers and what that means. And he's saying that the odds of a contraction here are basically very high. As you said, yes, he has been very critical, but he's saying that the Fed has a dual mandate now, which is not only to bring down inflation, but also to restore its credibility. And as you said, or as he has said, rather the Fed is slow to act and that means that we have a very high chance now of a contraction or a recession that otherwise could have been avoided. In terms of what else Mohammad Arian spoke about, also the OPEC plus decision this week if you change on now. He says again, critical of the reaction that we had here because we did actually see oil having its best week since May on this. He says it was very understandable or could have been predicted, Heidi. Well, the EU is preparing several options to cut the price of natural gas amid an ongoing energy crunch. European leaders are looking to iron out specific plans when they meet in Brussels for a summit in two weeks time when both Maria Tadeo reports from Prague. European leaders stuck in a tricky balancing act in the energy crisis. They need storage up, demand down. They all agree that gas prices remain unacceptably high, but they cannot agree on the way to put a limit on it. When the Germans speak, they say they worry about supply the implications that a price cap could do in a global market. The Italians say the prices need to be intervened ahead of the winter. The French warned that lack of coordination could see European countries outbidding and competing among each other. And that would be unacceptable. Now, they don't have a magic solution when it comes to the intervention of the energy market, but they do have a date. A European diplomat telling us that by the next summit, and that would be the end of the month on October 20th and 21st, the European Commission needs to have something on paper. The European leaders can discuss and then decide. So this price cap seems to be approaching in time, but, of course, the formula, the design behind it, we're still far away from making senses. And Prague, Maria today, Bloomberg News.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1302,2022-10-09 22:57:14

There are not many jobs you can have as a young individual, but you're always, always learning. So look at how FX is trading at the early part of this session. We are just really seeing a little bit of weakness when it comes to the Aussie Dollar and the Kiwi. We are just really seeing a little bit of weakness when it comes to the Aussie Dollar and the Kiwi. So now you've been a JP Morgan for about 25 years. So now you run one of the most important parts of JP Morgan, which is the asset and wealth management business. What actually is wealth management and how is that different than asset management? Great question. The two are often used interchangeably, but they have distinctions. Asset management business is where we manage money on behalf of individuals, institutions, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, we manage them in mutual funds, we manage them in ETFs, we manage them in single stock, single bonds, hedge funds, private equity and the like. And that is the heart of the fiduciary business that we run here at JP Morgan. Wealth management is that plus understanding someone's entire balance sheet. So for the individuals where we manage money, we also help them with their mortgage. We help them with alone that they might need. We help them with their basic credit card. And so wealth management is trying to help someone with their entire life, both their assets and their liabilities, their planning, their gifting, the legacy that they want to leave for their families, the 529 plans they need to prepare to get their kids to go through college. And it's a great insight into people's entire journey. Is it possible the industries in an arms race that will lead to spending itself into an oversupply? I mean, that has happened before. You know, we've looked at this very carefully and the digitization of everything. Tell me what aspect of your life, Emily, isn't becoming more digital. I'm trying to prevent that, but yeah, I think it's happening. You know, and COVID has accelerated that. The industry cost $500 billion last year, the semiconductor industry overall. And estimates are a trillion dollars of doubling by the end of the decade at that point. I believe those estimates. It's not that there's not going to be some blips and turns on the way.

You're watching Daybreak Asia coming to you live from New York, Sydney and Hong Kong. A lot of markets shut today but Heidi Australia just online. Australia just coming online and of course we're counting down to the Chinese party congress as well. Some of our top headlines going into the start of the week. Asian stocks set to full. Strong at US jobs data, heightening concerns over the impact of tightening monetary policy. We do have Chinese markets returning thereafter that golden week holiday. And of course China's top leaders are holding their final gathering before the crucial Communist Party congress that set to hand Xi Jinping a third presidential term. Plus we check the impact of a week yen and supply chain snows on corporate Japan. We'll hear exclusively from the CEO of electronics giant Seiko Abson. Well Heidi one market in Asia just online. We've got Australia just getting into gear here. A bit of declines at the open were down to 10% for the ASX200 but futures had been indicating a drop of 1.6%. So we'll see how we go with the staggered start about 10 minutes for each stock to come online. But in terms of the overall direction of trade today, it is looking like a risk off session. Given those moves that we had in Wall Street of courses is all a read through or follow through Kathleen from what came through in the jobs numbers because we did see that the labor market still looking tight there and that the supply of new workers coming into the economy not enough to call the growth in wages there. In terms of other markets that we're keeping an eye on if you change on now as I said a lot of closures today. We've got Japan offline, Korea, Malaysia, and Taiwan but we've still got New Zealand trading down 1%. In terms of the direction of currencies also keeping a particular eye on the Japanese yen this morning. Very close to that level of intervention or rather the level that sparked intervention at the end of September 14590 is the one to watch and also seeing what's happening in the offshore. You are looking very flat here Kathleen but still a big day for Chinese markets that have been shot for the Golden Week holiday and they will be back online in a couple hours from now. And of course I know about that hot labor market that's strong jobs report is one of the things that's been pushing the dollar higher yet another reason to be watching dollar yen so closely today. And of course for the stock market S&P 500 on Friday down nearly 3%, 95% of the companies in that index closed lower NASDAQ was down 3.8% and we look where we are now. The momentum is zil to the downside. We were down just about a full percent about five minutes ago but still this is double the amount of decline we saw in the S&P futures and in the NASDAQ futures just an hour ago. Bond market the 10 year the benchmark is on Friday up to about 3.88% very close to 3.9 if not 4% and you can see today that we've got the red arrow pointing to prices down further the yield pressure to push higher again and I mixed crude after hitting nearly $93 a barrel the 16% increase in I mixed crude last week we're seeing that there's just a little bit of a pullback but certainly a lot of pressure pressure now as we look at the OPEC plus output cuts Heidi are for prices to move higher in fact we just had a guest in the last hour who likes energy stocks very much now. Yeah let's get some more on where these mark because I headed our chief race correspondent for Asia and live contributor.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1304,2022-10-09 23:05:49
13079," Let's get some more on where these markets are headed. Our chief raise correspondent for Asia and M-Live contributor Gafford, Reynolds, Jones and also Gaff. Is this a period of consolidating expectations for investors, particularly as we get the labour market numbers? What really is the relevance of CPI prints in the near term? Well, I mean, there is still some relevance, but as I was saying before and others have been saying, that jobs report on Friday really was an almost certain death sentence for optimism that the Fed is going to be pivoting anytime soon to even a slower pace of rate hikes. There have been a lot of focus on the idea of, well, if they do pivot how long do they keep rates at a high level and a lot of pushback from Fed speakers on the idea that they would be cutting rates? Next year, the jobs numbers really put the focus back on the likelihood that the Fed hikes 75 basis points in November and potentially follows up with another 75 in December because when you've got an unemployment rate at 3.5% and wages growth above 5%, why are you going to slow down in rate hikes? You're not causing huge pain in the job market and honestly, any softening in CPI is almost encouragement to the Fed because we'll look, the rate hikes are working on the inflation front and they're not hurting the job market too much as yet, the job market in fact remains a risk. So that sets up a pretty rough outlook for assets which ever way CPI goes and certainly if CPI was to surprise to the upside this week, that would cause a lot of turmoil even if it's a crisis to the downside, we might have a tough week because then I'd expect Fed officials to come out and reinforce their determination to keep hiking. Well, of course, I think that market hasn't even begun to come terms with the fact that more than one Fed official has said, we're not just going to push up rates and then start cutting them, we expect them to stay high, maybe possibly till the end of next year, which means we're probably going to have a continued, certainly a foundation for the dollar, even if it doesn't go higher. This is causing a lot of concern and we're going to hear this week at the IMF World Bank meetings that this strong dollar and the potential for it to move higher is is roiling a lot of other markets and particularly for the emerging market economies. This is a big deal, it's tough. Yeah, it certainly is and that's one of the things that a lot of investors are watching is both here in Asia and beyond and a lot of economies have spent decades building up war chests and reforming their economies and the decision-making processes so that they don't respond with the sort of restrictive, like trying to fix things in place, trying to lock in, try to fight the market when they do have capital outflows but more just trying to manage things appropriately. So a lot of economies have so far traveled reasonably well despite what's been going on, but as you said, Kathleen, with the full realization of just how aggressive the Fed will be and how likely it is to keep rates higher for longer, those stresses are only going to keep building and the question is which emerging markets actually start to crack under this and how much contagion might there be? And I'm looking mostly at European and some Latin American markets as perhaps amongst the most vulnerable, but then if some of those start to give way, there's a potential to even Asian markets such as Indonesia, Malaysia and to all this to understand India who have done a good job of shorting up their situations. They might face some fresh, severe pressure on their currencies, on their markets, your buy association. All right, let's move on to Chinese President Xi Jinping opening the Communist Party's final meeting before the National Congress begins next Sunday. Meanwhile, COVID cases nationwide are mounting and we're seeing new evidence of slowing economic activity as well.

13080," What's happening behind closed doors in Beijing as this whole thing gets going? Oh, I wish I knew, Kathleen. The Communist Party is a very opaque organization, if you will. They do things behind closed doors. But it's fairly predictable, obviously, with this plenum that is being held this week, ahead of the party congress, that starts on Sunday with that big speech from Xi Jinping, where he will likely outline some of his priorities and the party's priorities. And the plenum, what's happening this week, essentially does all the back room kind of negotiations and fine tuning of policy for Xi to unveil at the party congress. And then it will be legally formalized at the National People's Congress, the annual session of parliament, not until March. So this is behind closed doors, and there are lots of challenges, obviously, in the Chinese economy and Chinese society, with COVID-19, the umbrella pressure, obviously, weighing on all kinds of growth, manufacturing, tourism, and the like. And then there's also the social stability angle that we cannot ignore. COVID-19 has had a dampening effect, obviously, on sentiment as it is a prolonged pressure on the Chinese economy. But he has to balance expectations of the populist as well. You've all heard about this lying flat generation, of this lying flat mentality. Now, there's talk in Chinese social media that it's no longer lying flat. It's let it rot mentality. People just not engaging whatsoever. And that is a big stress, potentially, for Xi Jinping, who is obviously going to be maneuvering himself for an unprecedented or president's busting third consecutive term as General Secretary of the Party and president. So lots of challenges, obviously. Look at these scenes from Shanghai of lack of economic activity. That's a big threat to the Chinese economy and sentiment towards the party. So much of that social malaise, if you will, has come as a result of COVID-19, rolling lockdown, the uncertainty, the impact on mental health. We know that there's discontent there. So how do we expect that to be addressed, given that that's really the shadow that is cast over everything? Well, no doubt Xi Jinping is going to trumpet the successes of COVID-19, or static management as the propaganda organs I like to call it. They're trying to find the right euphemism to balance the expectations of the people and not necessarily tick them off. But essentially, even Hushijin, the former editor-in-chief of the party run global times, who's often times the staunch supporter of the policies of the party, obviously, he's even come out and said, static management, as it's now called, is becoming intolerable in society. So we will be trying to read the signs to see if there's going to be any relaxation. But society as a whole, we're starting to get some of this frustration seeping into social media, even though it's a highly censored social media and state media, obviously, is controlled by the party. But we'll have to see the tone that Xi Jinping strikes. Look, services PMI, the Taijing Services PMI, fell to 49.3 in September. We were expecting almost 55, and it was 55 in August. Tourism, let's change the page and look at the tourism slump. We just came out of the week-long national day holiday tourism and spending during these week-long holidays is way down. And it's not just in isolation. All these past holidays, tourism is down. And that's part of the services led to the economy right now and consumption led economy. So again, these are some serious pressures. And COVID is starting to flare up again. What is going to be the policy response? None of these municipalities, whether it's Chengdu, Dalian, or Lassa in Tibet, all three of these big cities have had COVID-zero lockdowns in September, which dampen consumer sentiment and consumer spending. None of these municipalities want to see a big flare-up ahead or during the party Congress. So it might get tighter before it relaxes. But right now we're having flare-ups in Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang, far away from Beijing, but still eight cases in Beijing on Saturday and several different transmission chains being detected.

So you're going to start seeing things tighten up closer to the party congress rather than relax. I'll change North Asia cars on this day, but I'm going to go there. Let's get you to Vony Quinn with the first-wed headlines, Vony. Heidi, thank you. China is criticizing the expanded U.S. restrictions on its access to semiconductor technology. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mauning called them unfair and said they will also hurt the interests of U.S. companies. She believes they'll harm supply chains and the world economy. Recent U.S. measures seek to stop China's drive to develop its own ship industry and advance its military capabilities. South Korea says its military will boost security cooperation with the U.S. and Japan, including the deployment of what it calls U.S. strategic assets. This comes after North Korea has fired two more missiles on Sunday. The missiles, as the publications violate UN Security Council resolutions and will strengthen sanctions against this neighbor. Russian President Vladimir Putin is blaming Ukraine for the attack that badly damaged a key bridge linking annexed Crimea to Russia. In his first comments on the attack, Putin blamed the Ukrainian Secret Service, alleging they had helped from some Russians, as well as unnamed foreign states. Kiev has not officially claimed responsibility for the blast, although it has celebrated the explosion with a new postage stamp. UK Prime Minister Liz Chos is planning to speak directly this week to mutinous MPs in our Conservative Party. Chancellor Kwasi Kvartyng was set to address a regular meeting of lawmakers on Wednesday, but Chos is now expected to replace him. A poorly received tax cut package at a fractured annual conference have Chos fighting to regain control of a party just a month into her tenure.

Well, big trading week ahead is China returns from a week-long break. Here I'm a quarry wealth management is still cautious on equities. This is Bloomberg. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the road today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building across America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's, just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels. We want to do that with our buildings. If we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. If we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.

13082," This October, delegates will meet for the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party. As questions mild about China's economy, COVID-0 policy, and foreign relations, President Xi Jinping is looking to secure an historic third term. Keep it tuned to Bloomberg for the up to the minute coverage and expert analysis you need. Coverage begins October 16th with special Sunday programming on Bloomberg, your global business authority. I think we are headed for a collision of some kind or other, and we just kind of manage that collision carefully. And I think the sooner we start managing for a slope, managing for some slowdown, the better we are going to do. I think German Powell was way late to come to that recognition, but he now has that recognition, and he should be supported in that. We are going to get inflation back down. I am confident of that. It does not necessarily mean that prices are going to revert to the old prices. My lasagna portray may not be going back down to $13. A tray. The former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, the Minneapolis Fed President Newcastle Shkari on the Fed's inflation fight. Next guest says he is looking at bonds and alternatives while remaining cautious on equities. With us now, it is Martin Leicos, the division director at McQuarry Wealth Management. I want to get your views on what you are finding opportunities in at the moment. But when you take a look at the jobs numbers from Friday, and obviously we have got CPI prints that are going to be still relevant, although you wonder if it is really in the short term going to change what the Fed has committed to doing. Does it feel like the markets are finally getting it? Definitely the markets are now taking into account the momentum that we are seeing. I think there is a hope and a wish. We are going to be seeing the peak of these rate rises soon. But until the narrative starts changing from the Federal Reserve, it is way too early to be trying to over anticipate that. We have seen that the markets get sold down really heavily in the last number of weeks. And hence we had that that bear market rally last week. But overall, at the end of the day, we really have to wait for those indications from the Fed and other central banks around the world before we can really be more confident of our so-called pivot at some stage next year. In the absence of a real meaningful policy change, how are you maneuvering these markets? Where do you find, you know, you talk about recession-proof stocks? A lot of people still like energy, for example. But you're actually looking at alternative asset classes altogether. Look, we have been shifting our clients portfolios for some time, underweighting equities, shifting where we've been positioning in defensive assets. So we've been shifting more towards sovereign debt as against from corporate credit. And certainly trying to hedge portfolios away from this volatility as best we can. There's no doubt there's ongoing downward momentum and that's going to continue. So alternative assets certainly are an area that we have had a big focus on. In fact, we doubled our ass outication to that class. That includes things, obviously, like private equity hedge funds that are long short, hard assets in particular infrastructure, which are long duration, and will basically last right through this cycle. So that's where we've sort of had a far greater focus in the shorter term. That's not to say we haven't stopped looking at the big picture thematics as well because we think they are important. But again, it's all around market timing and you know, that's the difficult component of managing money at the moment. Martin, well, after OPEC plus made its big cut and output, do you like energy stocks? And if you liked them before, do you like them better now? Well, I think we have to be more specific than just energy stocks. I think we're looking very much towards the gas side because when you're thinking what's happening around climate change, you know, clearly the transition material is going to be gas. And so therefore that's an area where we have far greater interest in at this point in time. I guess there's something we've said, you know, there's been a lot of commentary around the decision by OPEC plus. And that's, we have to take, clearly take that into account. But you know, given where we see both demand and the fact that we've seen, the oil price come off quite a bit already from those heavy levels of $120 a barrel back towards the 80s, you know, that's slightly mature. It's going to work its way through into inflation numbers as well. And interestingly enough, despite that announcement on production from OPEC plus, we really haven't seen",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1308,2022-10-09 23:23:19
13083," Interestingly enough, despite that announcement on production from OPEC Plus, we really haven't seen a significant move yet in the energy complex. So I think that's worth noting as well. Maybe people are sitting back and worrying about recession. When you talk about bonds, when you talk about credit, what were some of the more appealing types of bonds to you or bond markets? Yes, so we've really shifted away from credit, as I mentioned, towards sovereign debt. So we think that's a better way to be playing defensive assets at this point in time, particularly in sort of a growth slowdown scenario. So a bit more conservative and a little more safety. And we're obviously markets or investors in ourselves. We've seen your bond yields rising probably much higher than we had anticipated at the beginning of this year, for example. When is the biggest risk that investors are not comprehending at the moment? Obviously, if you take a look at the soft markets, there's almost a view that perhaps we're pricing a policy mistake. Is there still a camp or part of you that thinks that we could actually see that pivot sooner than expected? Again, I think it's more in the hope and wish category than harsh reality. I think there's been more than enough commentary from central banks about what they're setting out to do, particularly when investors see the inflation rates or as high as they are. Obviously, Australia is doing slightly better than other economies, but not much better in the inflation stakes. And so I think that investors totally understand that that inflation at those levels that are so well and truly above the ranges by which central banks want to manage inflation, that there's got a lot more work to be done by central banks in terms of rate rises before we start seeing that pivot. So I think that's starting to come out of investors' expectations. What are you seeing in terms of the, I guess, the arbitrage trade, right? As we potentially see the RBNZ, the RBA potentially head into a slightly different direction? Yeah, well, what was interesting, obviously, last week, with the Australia Reserve Bank that basically cut, but only cut by 25, where the market really was expecting 50. That's probably a combination of, you know, wanting to ensure that the central bank is not pushing the economy too hard towards a significant growth side down, but still trying to fight inflation as well. So that balancing act is really important. I think what's been an interesting observation is to see now more recently, how central banks are getting more active in markets, particularly around currencies. Obviously, you know, the very strong US dollar is starting to have an impact, and they want to cut tail, if they get as best they can, the depreciation of their own currencies, or at least slow down the momentum of that depreciation. So we're certainly seeing central banks becoming so much more active in the markets at this point in time. So what do you think this strong dollar means for when I'm looking at the world, when I'm trying to figure out where to put money, and do you think it's going to last? How long is this going to be an issue when I'm trying to figure out what to do with my money, or someone else's, if I'm a manager like you? Obviously, currencies are very important part of the overall scheme of what we look at. And obviously, we hedge out some of currency risk as best we can, but when you get these big currency moves, obviously that's where issues for portfolios and valuation starts to arise. We certainly see these movements as more short a term, but they're painful in the short term. There's no doubt about that. It's more about looking through the cycle, and that's really how we're positioning and having positioning clients put followers right through this year and the currency's part of it.

For most it's what we use to power devices for both work and play and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades they've gotten way more powerful, long lasting and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi trillion dollar opportunity and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. A quick check of latest business slash headlines. Chinese food delivery giant MET1 is said to be considering expanding into Hong Kong and international markets as domestic growth slows. I'll also say that plans are at an early stage and MET1 has not responded to requests for comment. Speculation about MET1's potential expansion has grown since it hired an executive from Quasho earlier this year. India's mint is reporting that Gautam Adani and his family are in early discussions with investors to raise at least $10 billion. The report says potential investors include Tomasek, GIC and other funds. Mint says the capital would be used to fund the group's expansion. Plenty more to come here on daybreak Asia.

13086," eye and supercomputing chips used in that and also tightens rules around how much and what kinds of equipment for making semiconductors China is allowed to buy. Obviously China's response is this is going to be really bad for an industry that is already suffering from demand destruction as a result of higher rates and slower growth around the world. China of course used to be, before all these restrictions back in a couple of years ago, used to be the world's biggest market for semiconductors, buying over 300 billion U.S. dollars worth every year. So what do you expect to happen next? Do you think this is something that's just going to sort of simmer on a back burner for the U.S.? Do you think the Chinese are going to have to come out with something a bit more aggressive than they've done so far? I mean, I think the Chinese strategy here is to try and go out and produce their own chips. Whether they're able to have any success at that initiative is still in question. Most recently they've had a number of high ranking officials involved in either the government side of the semiconductor push, as well as private enterprise sort of taken into custody for on allegations of corruption of bribery. And so there are still lots of questions about whether or not China throwing in tons and tons of money into this industry is going to have any success at being able to build these more advanced chips. And I think the U.S. position is not going to be changing anytime soon, depending either on Biden or another administration coming into power. They're going to be trying to stop the flow of technology to China in helping that effort. All right. That's Bloomberg. John Liu joining us in Beijing talks around the U.K. succession into CPTPP continued over the weekend as the group met in Singapore to discuss new areas of cooperation in digital and green initiatives, rising inflationary pressures and global uncertainty are being flagged as major risks now to trade and investment flows. Our next guest was part of those discussions. Mary Ning is Canada's international trade minister. Sounds like you had a very, very busy weekend, Mary, and your talks continue. In terms of what Canada is trying to achieve right now, you are working on the CPTPP. You're having bilateral meetings, you've got a free trade agreement you're working on with ASEAN and more. What is this going to do for Canada's economy? Well, thank you so much, Kathleen. It's terrific to talk to you in New York. And I've been here over the last number of days with my CPTPP partners. And let me just start there for Canada, the CPTPP. So this agreement here in this Asia-Pacific region, it really does work for Canada. We are seeing the increased trade and investment flows into this region both ways from pre-CPTPP. And what was really terrific for me to see is that the growth in this region into the CPTPP countries through Canada's trade, in fact outpaced that of our other trading partners. So it's an agreement that really works. I would also point out that the comprehensive and the progressive elements of the CPTPP is what Canada really fought for when we joined this agreement. So standards for the environment, for workers and for labor, making sure that the agreement is indeed inclusive. Our additions that Canada really felt strongly about when we entered into the agreement. And today, our partners tell this agreement as a high quality agreement precisely because of those additions, because who doesn't think about the global economy today without thinking about how we can transition into a greener or digital economy that is benefiting our people and our entrepreneurs who wish to get into markets like this one in this region? So UK accession is a very important question here, how much is that in your discussions? And how important is it to this whole trade arrangement? Well, this is the first session requests. We've always said to CPTPP partners that the high quality of this agreement, the gold standard agreement that CPTPP is, we encourage any aspiring economy wishing to join to meet those high standards and that they would be welcome. So we are very much working.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1312,2022-10-09 23:40:43
13087," TPP is we encourage any aspiring economy wishing to join to meet those high standards and that they would be welcomed. So we are very much working with the United States, some rather the United Kingdom on this agreement and on their session. Japan is the chair for the UK Ascension process. So they're taking a really leadership role here as part of the CPTPP partners, but our first session. So we are absolutely working with the United Kingdom on this. What about the issues when it comes to China and Taiwan potentially their involvement? Well we've always said that this agreement is a high standard agreement. We welcome those wishing to join to meet those high standards, but this is also the first session. And the first session is with the United Kingdom. We as the CPTPP partners want to get it right. And so we're taking our time to make sure we do get it right through this first session with the UK. There's a big push into Southeast Asia, including one of the Singapore as the trading hub. Why are the focus on this region? Where do you see I guess the benefits for all of the parties involved and particularly where do you see the growth opportunities for Canada within Southeast Asia? Well terrific question. I mean that's Canada's trade minister, but also the small business minister. And the mandate that I have from my prime minister and our government's commitment is to diversify and grow opportunities for market access around the world. I mean Canada is the only G7 country that has a free trade agreement with every other country. This region is dynamic, it is growing, we already have the CPTPP, we are at the negotiating table with the ASEAN countries, as well as bilateral negotiations with Indonesia, which is where I'm heading to later this afternoon. So making sure that we diversify and grow into this market and into this region is extremely important. Canada is a trading country. Two-thirds of our economy is dependent on trade. One out of six jobs is related to trade. So as a trading country, creating opportunities into this region is important. I announced a Canadian trade gateway anchored here in Singapore. And the way that will work is that I want people to see this as Canada's front door to the region. But the door swings both ways. So I want to see the region having a place to learn more about Canada. Where do investing Canada? How we can collaborate together so that the trade really is both ways benefiting the region, but also Canada. A slightly different topic, but I'm wondering about progress made with the US to bring it into the minimum corporate tax in line with the OEC agreement agreement of 15 percent. I know that's important to Canada as well. How's that going? We are working very hard and very focused on this important multilateral agreement through the OECD of which the US is part of. So we're at the table and we are working hard and hoping that what we will get at is a conclusion of this multilateral agreement reached with the OECD partners, including the US. Minister, I'm wondering how important the multilateral approach is in Asia with Canada and some of its partners, including the likes of Korea, that this multi-pronged strategy is also to counter China's weight across the region. Is that very significant in terms of avoiding a situation where you see multiple trading partners being pitted against each other? Well, for Canada, it is really important that we continue to diversify and to provide opportunities for our exporters and for our businesses. We often talk in Canada about having a creating economy that works for all as the small business minister, but also Canada's trade minister, helping businesses, whether they're women entrepreneurs, Indigenous owned businesses, small and medium-sized enterprises, take get the benefits of trade and to make sure that workers get the benefit of the trade means diversifying and looking into markets that are high growth markets, we're talking about opportunities in the digital economy.

13088," in the digital economy. We are increasingly finding partners to grow the green economy, to diversify and create those, that growth in green growth in Canada. But doing so with partners in this region, whether it be Korea, whether it be Japan, whether it's here in Singapore and with the many partners that are absolutely in the CPTPP, as I said, we've seen the growth in trade with our partners who are here. And we're looking to do more of that. Mary and Canada's international trade minister, a huge pleasure having you on with us. We appreciate your time. Let's get you to Vani Quinn, who has the first-wide headlines for us, Vani. Heidi, thank you. China is praising your most proposal for a Hong Kong-like unification system for Taiwan.

On Twitter, China's ambassador to the US thanked Musk, saying one country, two systems framework was key. Taiwan's president, saying when, will pledge on Monday to strengthen the island's economy and deepen ties with democratic allies in a national day speech. The Biden administration says it remains ready for talks with North Korea on removing nuclear weapons from the Korean Peninsula. But National Security Council spokesman John Kirby also says Washington is increasing military cooperation with South Korea and Japan to counter threats from Kim Jong-un. North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles Sunday, adding to 10 it launched over the past two weeks.

All right let's take a look at how we're trading when it comes to some of these yen trading pairs. We're seeing the dollar trading pretty mixed versus most of that G10 cohort in the early Sydney trade we're seeing that decline when it comes to the euro which is playing out when it comes to euro yen in a small way as well. But dollar yen holding at just over that 145 handle quite clearly all of the impact of the intervention has faded we're reaching now for really the uh",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1314,2022-10-09 23:49:10
13089," All of the impact of Yen Tvension has faded. We're reaching now for really the tolerance for Japanese policymakers to seeing increasing Yen weakness, Ozen Yen trading at that 92 handle, but there are expectations that we could see the testing of those intervention levels for the Yen. Let's bring in our senior reporter for FX and rates with Carson. In fact, that intervention is expected potentially the appetite to resist intervention, I should say, is expected to be tested this week. Absolutely. Everyone has their eyes on the Yen at the moment. And if we talk about intervention, it lasted about a week in terms of its effect. So as we continue to trade, Dollar Yen at about 145, hitting to that critical 145, 90 level intervention risks are definitely on a table. Strategies and investors from Sydney to Tokyo to London will be keeping their eyes on the pair. All right. Thank you, senior reporter for Foreign Exchange and Rates Ruth Carson. Let's move now to Japanese electronics giant Sikoepson, saying it may be forced to raise prices because of chronic supply chain of peoples. Our own animal driller spoke exclusively with CEO Yasunori Ogawa, who also gave us an update on the company's moves to reduce its environmental impacts. Yes, we're steadily making progress with our plans to shift all of our work. We're going to be working on our operations to renewable electricity by next year. It's all on track. We really hope that people around the world can share increased awareness of the climate change issues facing us. And we want them to understand Epson's contribution to mitigating this problem. When you talk about that greater focus on climate change, how would you see that shifting consumer patterns generally? To help relieve the climate change problem, we believe we have to put a lot more effort into making products more recyclable and easy to use. We want our customers to use our products much longer than they did in the past. And if we achieve that, I believe we can help people to deal with climate change. Epson's eco-printer doesn't use cartridges. And if you replace a laser printer with an inkjet printer, there is significantly less energy use as inkjet's don't use heat. Epson can also contribute to the environment by choosing a product with far fewer replacement parts. In commercial and industrial printing, traditional analogue textile printing uses a lot of resources. But by converting to digital technologies, we can dramatically cut down on waste. We can also make a shift towards much more on-demand printing. These are the kind of areas that Epson is putting a lot of effort into. I'd like to just ask a few more questions about Epson's business because that's a lot of interest to our viewers. So starting with higher material and logistics costs because they have been a big drag on the company profit in previous quarters, would you still see that being an issue now? Logistical issues are continuing and the cost of materials such as semiconductors well, that remains high. But there has been an improvement, however, both of these issues are still impacting our overall business. Epson is trying to respond to these difficulties. Though we're seeing strong demand for products around the world, we are making adjustments, for example, design changes to help mitigate the logistical issues. In terms of demand, because you've got three key markets, the US, Japan and China, how willing are you to pass those higher costs onto consumers, given there's a lot of concern around the overall health of this segment? This is a serious concern for us. Costs are rising significantly and we have strong demand. We're doing our best to control our costs as much as possible, but sometimes we cannot do as much as we would like. One of the factors that we've watched quite closely is this drop-off in demand that we're seeing in the PC market, so does that also signal the start perhaps of a demand slide for your market as well? We're not feeling significant impact there. We see strong demand for working from home products and printer demand is still very robust.
