No question Do I want to do that at the cost of not spending time with my kids not being around my family? Timing is always going to be key to that We've got a good process with me in the way I lean on her a lot and I think she has a good tail tail to give me some different things to think about and she always says That's ultimately your decision but I know it's both of our decisions You're one of the most fascinating entrepreneurs because you all started really young What did you learn? Did you always think that you'd be an entrepreneur? Probably yes I think which is a bit sad From age 5? I'm not sure I come from a family of entrepreneurs so even I probably can spell the word and still can't take it It's sort of in my blood but it's really fun starting a business and fun growing a business I feel it's a real privilege and I started my business officially at 18 But I think I knew I wanted to do it very differently from about 15 But I'm sure it's you know you if you're surrounded by it feels very natural So yes it's fun And you started how you started by making you want to Florence It was an IT-LE and you started handbags Yeah so I knew I was actually given a handbag by my mother when I was about 61 of her old handbags And I remember how it made me feel and I think fashion is fascinating for the mood changing The confidence boosting aspects and the tribal aspects of what fashion does And so I went at 18 to Florence knowing that was the home of Leatherguss which is what interested me I just wanted to learn actually I'm be surrounded by craftsmen who I'm making things as important And that's going to be very interesting I think over the next sort of 10 years I think the on-shoring of craft and manufacturing is going to be fascinating Actually I mean I watched the off-shoring and literally saw it And I think we're going to be seeing that coming back to local we have to When we're all looking at our objectives in terms of carbon you know Proximity is going to be key The cake is crucially important and I think we've moved from this attitude from It's an indulgence a waste of time almost an illness that needs a cure For something as universally important to human life as sleep Mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s And so it makes that a really exciting field because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there Can be harnessed to further expand our understanding It's easy to memorize that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts But if you want to be wise you really want wisdom you gotta know when and how and why to use that information And that's what you bring figures out while you're sleeping It seems like everything is going green these days But there's one mode of transportation that seems to be clinging to the traditional fuel loving ways And while commercial aviation has made strides through smarter design and cleaner engines Many of those gains have been nullified by more air traffic The challenge is enormous, this is a large industry, it will take decades to convert The good news is that we will have a solution as early as three years out That people can get into and start moving zero emission And it turns out that the solution could be all around us Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe And so if you had to use something it would be great The only product of the chemical reaction between hydrogen oxygen is water We looked at the fundamentals of what it would require to take an aircraft Alpinair of significant size",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5755,2022-10-23 00:02:44
17350," We looked at the fundamentals of what it would require to take an aircraft, up in the air of significant size over significant distance, commercially relevant. You get to hydrogen fuel cell being the best approach from the cost of fuel, efficiency of utilization of the fuel and the mitigation of the climate effects. Serial clean-tech entrepreneur Val Miftikoff started zero avia following his previous success in the EV charging industry. So the beauty about hydrogen in general is that the energy density of hydrogen as fuel is is actually three times better than jet fuel. So you can see any size of aircraft going for any distance that jet fuel aircraft can go over time, right? It will just take significant amount of time to get the industry over but this technology can scale to all sizes of aircraft that we use in commercial service. Zero avia uses a hydrogen fuel cell to produce electricity to turn a propeller. Unlike a traditional engine which uses combustion to create energy, a fuel cell generates electricity through an electrochemical reaction. In this case, hydrogen and oxygen are combined to generate electricity, heat and water. Zero avia has flown a six-seater aircraft on a hydrogen fuel cell a world first. Now they're aiming bigger at 20 seats. That's technically commercial. One side of the aircraft, the left side will replace the engine with our power plants. We still got the normal engine on the right side and part of this is you know innovation you want to ramp up a East profile on meaningful steps. So anything happens we have the second engine but even in the first flight test campaign what we're planning to do is to demonstrate operation of this aircraft purely on zero emission power on the left side engine. Once we take off we're able to switch over to completely zero emission power. Hydrogen is used throughout all sections of a flight that maximizes the efficiency of the entire operation that reduces the weight provides for best sort of mission capabilities payload and range. Building power plants and fuel cells is one thing. Creating a whole new infrastructure for supplying hydrogen is something entirely different. In automotive, the big part of the reason why hydrogen did not take off is because the fueling infrastructure needs to be so distributed. Let's say United States you have 100,000 fueling stations. Compare that with aviation where 95% or more traffic in the United States is concentrated in 100 locations. So that's a three-order magnitude difference which makes build out of the infrastructure much simpler. It's much larger, much more concentrated stations but there's much fewer in quantity. Calling it simpler might be underselling the challenge of distributing hydrogen which unlike other fuels that can be easily transported and liquid-form is usually found instead in a gaseous state. How do you get the hydrogen from point eight to point B? We don't have pipelines for moving hydrogen around. We don't have all the specialized trucks to move them around so we got thinking we need a solution that can be a low capital expenditure solution and that's the genesis of the company. John Paul Clark is the co-founder and chief innovation officer of Universal Hydrogen, a startup that is designed a modular tank system for the domestic turbo prop market. Like Zura Avia, it allows for retrofitting planes already in use. Each module has two capsules and so what we do is load it into the aircraft as if it was cargo, strap it down, connect it to the aircraft, close the loading door and that would be it. When you get to your destination you basically unload it, put it back in a truck, send it back to the production site to get refilled. We needed to basically come up with something that could fit in containers and also fit in the aircraft.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5756,2022-10-23 00:07:02
17351," um, production site to get refilled. We needed to basically come up with something that could both fit in containers and also fit in the aircraft, not require increases in the maximum takeoff way to the aircraft. This compromise is one of the biggest hurdles that may prevent widespread adoption of hydrogen. Obviously you're gonna have to take out some seats because the energy density of hydrogen is less than jet fuel and you can store it in the wings practically. So you're gonna have to take away some space in the fuel cell. In the ultra fine margins of aviation, removing 10 to 20% of your seats is a tough ask. But that hasn't deterred startups like ZeroAvia or Universal Hydrogen. The maintenance costs of a fuel cell motor system goes down and it goes down significantly because motors and fuel cells have much fewer moving parts than a gas turbine engine. And so the wear and tear is much lower and therefore the time between overhaul is longer. And so when you put all that together, our numbers indicate that the chasm cost per available seat mile actually goes down slightly or is at the worst equivalent to what you have now. So what you will have is a smaller cabin, a smaller number of seats, however the cost for each of those seats to operate it is the same or better with the hydrogen.

17352," 100 passenger jet. Beyond fuel cells, however, there is another hope for our lightest most abundant element. Burning. The first Ureqa moment I suppose is when we source team and exhaust because we are thinking to ourselves, burning something here when we are producing absolutely no CO2. An expert in gas turbine combustion, Professor Bobby Satie leads research at Kranfield University in the UK. Built on a former RAF base, the college runs multiple aeronautical programs. But what Bobby is focused on is burning hydrogen as cleanly as possible. So what we are trying to demonstrate in this rig is how we can conceive some hydrogen combustion technologies that can be integrated in the next generation aircraft engines, which will deliver not only low zero CO2 emissions, but also ultra-low NOx emissions. NOx or nitrogen oxides are a significant source of air pollution globally. They are the dirty particulates that cause smog and cities, usually spat out by diesel cars, scooters and buses. Hydrogen is characterized by much wider flammability limits, which means we can go to much leaner combustion and as a result we can burn at much lower flame temperatures and that's better for reducing NOx emissions. Going leaner means burning fuel with an excess of air in the engine. Using something like gasoline, lean burn emits far fewer hydrocarbons. Doing it with hydrogen also delivers cleaner emissions. While NOx is a pollutant, hydrogen combustion produces up to 90% less nitrogen oxide than caracene. So while burning hydrogen isn't technically as clean as using it inside a fuel cell, it's still a huge improvement over jet fuel. Unfortunately like any radically new idea, there are other potential byproducts of the process that aren't fully yet understood. NOx is clearly one of the main emissions we need to consider, but the aviation communities also are asking themselves and the community in general what about all the water vapour emissions and some studies have shown, albeit there's still a large degree of uncertainty about it, that controls and serious clouds that may be induced from controls could contribute to global warming about four times a month than CO2 does. We know that if we are going to be burning hydrogen, we are going to produce much larger amount of water vapour emissions. And if we are going to be producing a much larger amount of water vapour emissions, then the propensity for contra information is also going to increase. In spite of all these challenges, hydrogen is being taken seriously by the broader industry. Companies like Universal Hydrogen and ZeroAvia are gaining the attention of investors looking for viable and eventually profitable solutions. Industry giant Airbus wants to introduce a hydrogen powered passenger aircraft by 2035, recently announcing plans to retrofit a gas guzzling superjumbo with a hydrogen burning engine. The modified aircraft will add a fifth engine, adapted for hydrogen, and will be mounted on the rear fuselage. The A380 is the largest passenger aircraft in existence, so it offers plenty of room to store the 400 kilograms of hydrogen. The company's designs for a blended wing concept to store extra hydrogen also offer a glimpse of our flying future. Apart from the complex engineering challenges faced by airplane manufacturers, there are also difficulties in production of hydrogen itself. Nowadays, most of the hydrogen used in fuel is derived by splitting it off from molecules of natural gas. But that requires a good deal of energy and also produces carbon dioxide. To make green hydrogen, the electricity used to run the electrolyzer must come from a renewable resource, which is currently a lot more expensive. As with any new technology, however, initial costs are daunting, but time may be the best remedy here. If you look at economics of hydrogen fuel production, for example, versus fossil fuels, for instance, the cost of hydrogen is all based on capital expense, and very little operating expense. It's sort of similar to solar power. You put solar panels out there, and they produce power for 2025 years. The operating expense is relatively low. What that means is that as...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5758,2022-10-23 00:15:40
17353," Solar power, right? You put solar panels out there and they produce power for 20, 25 years. The operating expense is relative below. What that means is that as scale grows, as we've seen with the solar panels, the cost of outputs drops dramatically. So the first phase is not about the most efficient aircraft. It's not about the aircraft that will deliver the lowest NOx emissions. It's about demonstrating that we can carry hydrogen safely on boat. We can burn it safely on boat and it can be used to fly a passenger aircraft. The key thing is that we don't try to put everything in the first generation or we're just going to delay the entry into service, so to try and keep it as simple as possible. If there are some questions on the margin, they're all in the sort of business model and market adoption realm. It is very hard to create a technological argument or impossible to create a technological argument that says, well, it's not going to work, right? It is going to work. Hydrogen has a very special place in the universe. It's the first element on the periodic table. It is the most abandoned element in the universe and when clean energy advocates think about what can we find which would be as easy to use as fossil fuels they think about hydrogen. The fuel that will when burn only produce water. We like to imagine that if we just built enough of these and these, we could ditch fossil fuels and save the planet. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. There are some things where you just need good old-fashioned combustible fuel. Now startups around the world are betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century. Markets are preparing to close but the day is not over yet. Stock that is now up about 45%. A lot of volatility, right now. You need the power of the Bloomberg terminal to get you market moving data before anyone else. These numbers are much higher than they expect.

Bloomberg markets that close weekdays on Bloomberg. I've ever been cruising on a highway and wondered where the heck are all those trucks going. There's a behind-the-scenes world of logistics that makes virtually everything in our modern lives possible. Not only do we take it for granted, we're completely oblivious to its environmental cost. But thanks to a handful of companies, there's a hidden revolution happening that, as it turns out, is perfectly suited to delivering a cleaner future. For years, online ordering and rapid home delivery have been booming. And thanks to the pandemic, this trend has evolved into a way of life. But what actually happens when I click that tempting button to buy, let's say, an old school, real hardcovered book? For mighty Amazon, which tends to capture the lion's share of old book sales, they're troughed, along with other books, to one of several Amazon inbound fulfillment centers. Now the book is in Amazon's massive fulfillment network. Copies then journey along the so-called middle mile, and can be redistributed to any of the hundreds of smaller warehouses or nodes closer to customers in major population centers. The last step is the so-called last mile, how it gets to a buyer's home. The book might be sent to an Amazon delivery station and put in-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5759,2022-10-23 00:20:01
17354," and major population centers. The last step is the so-called last mile, how it gets to a buyer's home. The book might be sent to an Amazon delivery station and put in the back of a Mercedes-Bringer van and dropped off by Amazon itself at the customers front door. This system, while it's a marvel of modern-day logistics, still relies mostly on traditional combustion engine vehicles for middle and last mile delivery. As demand for rushed delivery rises, so does the number of gas guzzling trucks hustling between warehouses. Environmental, it's one of the biggest issues there is and the quicker that the globe can sort of decarbonize transportation, the better it's going to be. So if you look at total greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S., about 28% of that is transportation. And of that chunk of the 28% about a quarter of it come from minimum heavy-duty trucks. So middle mile and sort of long haul trucking. If you really want to move the needle on carbon emissions, this is a really good place to look. So how do we solve this growing emissions problem and still satisfy our addiction to same-bit delivery? As it turns out, the size, shape, and predictable limited range of these vehicles makes them the perfect candidate for a solution. I'm Dakota Summler. I'm the CEO and co-founder of XS Trucks. So we are a manufacturer of commercial electric vehicles. We manufacture trucks that are in the class five size all the way up to class eight regional haul tractors. And those are things like the UPS or FedEx stepvans that you see delivering packages every day. We actually started this because we were fleet operators ourselves. We had a fleet of medium-duty vehicles and we saw how challenging it was becoming to operate diesel vehicles. The technology exists to convert last mile fleets from diesel to electric batteries and the prices of those batteries have fallen dramatically in the last 10 years. And any routes that are around 200 miles or less are really ready to make that transition. So XS is trying to perfect the frame of the car, but they call it the chassis. So this is everything is sort of underpinning the car. The electric motors, the battery pack, all the battery software and cooling and technology and kind of the brains of the car, if you will. And then the business model is basically to sell that and let the end consumer dictate what goes on top. Our platform we call the X platform, UPS, is using an X platform with a parcel delivery van body on top of it. Lumis, who operates an armored car fleet, uses the same exact X platform, but with an armored body on top of it. XS is currently making their modular battery packs here in Los Angeles. And the packs can be customized for specific applications. But while one big problem, vehicle cost, is improving as battery prices continue to fall, there's still another major hurdle at the other end. The best way to describe the current state of charging infrastructure in the US is anemic. These companies don't want to build chargers unless they're electric vehicles. People don't want to buy electric vehicles unless there's chargers. That's a big problem for the personal EV space, where range anxiety is often cited as a roadblock to mass adoption. But when it comes to delivery, there's a much simpler solution. When you think about last mile vehicles, they're not operating in different bases of operation. They actually return to the same depot every single night where they do their charging. XS actually has a division helping fleets install that charging infrastructure. These fleets will actually bring their vehicles back to the yard. They charge them overnight. And then by the time morning rolls around for their next shift, those vehicles are fully charged, ready to go with the infrastructure that's on site. With pilot programs up and running with delivery giants, UPS, FedEx and Amazon, XS is quickly becoming a major contender in the electrification game. But there's another enormous part of this puzzle, which may end up eliminating more than just gasoline. So I'm got them, Narang. I'm the co-founder and CEO of Gatik. At Gatik, we do autonomous vehicles for the middle mile segment of the supply chain. Again, middle mile is one step back from last mile, trucking that goes from one factory or warehouse to another. The middle mile is evolving at a rapid pace. And with the pandemic, the middle mile has become super advanced as a comida production public sector.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5760,2022-10-23 00:24:33
17355," or change. You know, the usual suspects are where you're going to see adoption come first. You know, the larger, more stable companies. So Walmart, Amazon, UPS, FedEx, etc. I think you'll see them experimenting with it more and the more routes that they can get it to make sense on that the faster adoption is going to be. As the technology matures and batteries continue to get cheaper, there's another huge category of vehicles that's ripe for this kind of upgrade. So the Biden administration has been super aggressive about a pledge to electrify the entire federal vehicle fleet, which is just under 700,000 vehicles. What's interesting is the federal fleet is both really old and really inefficient. The average age of these cars and trucks about 14 years and the average cost is about a dollar a mile when you add up fuel and maintenance and depreciation, which are the three big ones. It's a good place to look if you're looking to get carbon out of the transportation system. While the most exciting and flashy developments in the world of electric vehicles are usually around personal EVs, the more impactful transition is happening behind the scenes. So the next time you order something online and it effortlessly appears in your doorstep, your package might have made at least some of its hidden journey without consuming an ounce of gasoline. Part of what I love about business is you get to build things from nothing. I don't have any investors. All this is all money and this is me just building it. It's pretty much full service shadow banking with nobody in charge. So what happens is that we create some icons and call them tags and they have a signal within them. And when you stare at that, your eye responds to it in a particular way. The way in which that eye response occurs is a signal that we pick up on the visual cortex of the brain at the back of the brain. So the sensor is looking for the signals we create here that come through the eyeball, through the brain and then onto the visual cortex. Once we've got it there as a signal, we can grab that, we understand what that signal looks like and we can turn that into a command or whatever we're trying to control. There's multiple places where we think this technology can be applied perhaps in driving or commanding a grand vehicle or a naval vessel, perhaps providing a menu selection and control within a control room environment, maybe in a nuclear power station, all those kind of things are perhaps in the bellywick of this technology.

Weekdays at 5 p.m. in New York and 2 p.m. in San Francisco. Thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for having me. What drives you? What drives me? Oh my God, I love the idea of just as simple as this uninclusive world. A world where people see themselves reflected. Because I was supposed to be invisible by your accounts. I was supposed to not be where I am. I was supposed to have disappeared a long time ago. And every turn in my life was about visibility. Yes, I will be this person who is not supposed to be here. Yes, I will fight through the hard times. Yes, I won't give up. And even though I was sort of the token black editor in the industry in the 90s, I knew even then that I needed to bring people up with me. I needed to bring other people up with me. And so that's really been a part of maybe it's maybe it was growing up in a family of six. I don't know. When you run a team, how do you instill that work ethic that kind of answering emails at all time? I mean, you know, I think you see an example. If you're an editor who leaves and has lunches and it's never in the office, you don't really sort of instill faith. My team know that we're on a mission. We have to reflect the world we live in. We have to reflect the beauty of multiculturalism. We have to reflect the beauty and diversity and inclusivity. So everybody takes it really seriously. And we really have intense conversations about the side guys and the world. And so I'm very lucky to have a team who are as passionate. And I can call my team. I can call somebody at six a.m. or they can call me at six a.m. and I'll pick up and they'll pick up. So, you know, we have something very special that we built over the past sort of five years. But there were difficult moments, right? I think the first time one of your first issues, you thought that you could have been fired for it. I'll just say that, right? I mean, I lived in America for a bit. I was working for W Magazine. And there was talk of Brexit. And of course, Americans were like your country's really, you know, I was in a phobic. So, you know, I came back and I thought, you know, oh, I'm going to be working with open arms and they're going to love me. And oh, my God, literally back to them by fire. But I remember thinking, you know, I wanted to create a magazine where every woman could see themselves. You know, where every woman, regardless of the backgrounds, regardless of their age, could just literally see themselves. And at the time, now it looks like it's the norm when you look at other magazines. But in 2017, that was a radical idea. But I also remember thinking, you know, with my background, you know, I've lost so much and gained so much that I thought, if I knew, if I'm fired, I would rather be fired for what I believed in. I would rather be fired for creating a magazine that reflected the world as it was than try to create a second-rate version of someone's vision. And that continues. I mean, there's this idea of always pushing forward. Yeah. Right? What's the end? How do you measure success? How do I measure success? I'm definitely not not financial. I mean, I think it's more about, for me, when I'm really exhausted, when I'm really tired, when I'm really questioning if I can go on, you know, I walk on the street and I see a little girl, a little black girl who's seeing the magazine. And it's the norm for them all, a curvy woman on a traitor, who's like, thank you for, you know,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5762,2022-10-23 00:35:14
17357," A little girl, a little black girl who's seen the magazine and it's the norm for them or a curvy woman on a traitor palace who's like thank you for you know seeing me you know that makes it worth what that for me is success. In anybody who knows or has known me for a while we'll witness that for me is success you know my job is done when that happens. Do you think people come up to you? They do but it's always in a positive way. It's always thank you for seeing us you know but I can relate because like as I said you know by all accounts I was meant to be invisible you know so for me shining in light of people and making them seen it's natural for me. They say that the fashion industry is changing you're changing it. Are others around you changing it? I mean now you know you look at other magazines and seeing real women in there it's no longer a radical act, seeing you know people of color women of color on covers is no longer a radical act so it's been normalized you know it's been normalized then for me I'm quite happy when I see that you know when you put Dame Judy Denture on the cover and she's 85 years old and the world just laughed it nobody questioned her you know she should be on the cover or you put hit you know a girl with a hit a hit job on the cover and it's not a problem that for me shows that you know we're advancing we're progressing so you know progress for me is very important. Which is important and so how do you take care of your team? How do you build a team around you? My team I mean somebody said to me once when you build a team make sure you employ people you like people when you see them work towards your office you're just so excited to see that was it. You build up your job and sort of a connection and being excited to see you know team members because you only have to go to see a team you know no man is an island you know I don't create the magazine on my own and so it's great to have a team who you respect and who's views your respect you know and who respect yours. How do you think you're seen by your team? Do you have to be fearful? Do you have to be? I mean I'm a worker I work very hard but I think I'm pretty open you can have conversations with me you know ultimately the final decision rests with me but I do listen I like conversation I like interaction and so that's I mean that's how I hope they think I'm a good boss and that's you know really all you can hope for because you know they work on a very good magazine they can get other jobs anywhere. So the fact that they're there makes me think that they must be happy. Edward how do you see the publishing world changing so people buy less magazines you've been I mean you've been doing pretty well in terms of selling more but in five years how does it look? I mean I was like you know five years ago I even I mean let's go back to ID when I was 18 you know I inherited a magazine you know which will come out we're all about club kids and you have to be out there and the only way you can see street fashion was through ID and then 2017 I inherited you know I inherited a magazine but now I oversee a brand you know the magazine is so that the magazine is sort of the highest or the high the best paper you know the best photographers the best you know cultural messages but at the moment you know when you manage a brand it's not just about that it's about digital it's about video it's about audio it's about events so for somebody who's so forward looking it's so great for me and people always ask oh it's a magazine's dead when we launch a cover Instagram it's our cover essentially so I've you know found a way we found a way of sort of making it work hand in hand and it's so great for me you know I think how do I just been doing the magazine I probably would have been bored so magazines aren't dead are they gonna go down yeah but they're gonna work in hand with digital platforms you know but also I'll tell you something new readers of folk young readers don't necessarily come to us through the new stands they come through that you know did you sell platforms or you know audio or videos we put out so yes now it's increased tenfold so yeah well that do you think that will change the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5763,2022-10-23 00:39:34
17358," or you know, all the old videos we put out. So yes, now it's increased 10 fold. So yeah. Well, do you think that will change the kind of readership that you will court, the either age of your readers, but also where they come from? Yes, I mean, at the moment, you know, I think the readership is getting younger because of, you know, the whole digital landscape. And I hope that as we move forward, it kind of, yeah, we have new readers and we also keep our loyal readers, you know. I don't, do you think there's ever a time where actually we won't have print magazines anymore? No, I think print will always exist sort of a long-side digital, but it'll probably be something more precious, sort of better paper, something more collectible that you want to keep in your house, almost like artwork. So no, I don't think print is going to die. So fewer copies. Fewer copies, but more quality. That's a better quality, you know, almost like a book. It's a table book. I love that. Right now, you need to. While Teslas and the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today won't electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total US greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building to crowds America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Teslas. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels, we want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of US greenhouse gas emissions.

I'm so much fun. I literally have to be held back. But the brilliant thing is, I'm so curious. I mean, I like all the digital platforms. I really like to keep my finger on the pulse. I'm not one of those people that leaves work and just shuts themselves in. I really want to be out there seeing the world as today's in all its beauty. So I'm very curious.

No, it's just a curiosity. I've always been like that. I've always wanted to know what's next. I didn't want to be the one that's just being told, oh, you're 50 or whatever.

But I'm really sort of excited about overseeing the European votes as well, Spain, Italy, Germany, and France, and sort of mentoring a whole new generation of editors. When there was this whole agonization, the whole world thought there was a global view that was going to dominate. But it's very much about local conversations, as well as global conversations. So I learn from these content leads, and I hope that they also learn. So the local global conversation, I'm very excited about moving into the future. Do you think it changes if we're in a recessionary environment? So you have such a glamorous lifestyle, or what you sell is so glamorous. Is it impacted by the cost of living or inflation of what we can live through? I mean, you know, I remember a few years ago, I put Taylor Swift on the cover, and the by-line was by better, by less. And it was a radical concept at the time. But now we all talk about sustainability. We know we can't keep shopping every day. We know we have to buy things that last, things that help the planet, things that we can pass on to sort of other generations. So I think that really is a conversation on the fashion industry is having right now that I find so exciting. And it's going to be sort of, you know, people are going to have less money so they have to buy things that last. And I'm really excited. And these are real changes. It's not just real changes. Real changes. Real changes, it's not just conversation. It's actually happening. Do you think fashion brands always need to have a political point of view when they're great injustices? I think fashion brands can do more. I feel that having a black model in your show, or having a feed on your Instagram post, it's not enough. We need diverse voices behind the scenes. I always say that I talk to sort of all the CEOs I know we need to employ more people from, you know, from diverse backgrounds. Because that's the only way you can even reach out to more people, you know. A variety of voices always better than just one. And I always also say, you know, let's not just have interns, let's have people on all different levels. And that's what I keep talking to people about. Do they listen? Some listen. But I think since, you know, George Floyd was murdered more and more companies sort of made pledges to people of color. And, you know, it's a slow process. Some have taken it seriously and some are still working their way through it. But, you know, we have to keep on. The problem is that you can make a pledge and then follow through. Right? You know, so you have to really sort of focus and keep asking that question for people to follow through. And so do you feel like you're a guardian of, also of that, of making sure that when you get promised something, they'll do it. And you'll hold them into account. I mean, yes, if they promise something, you know, that I ask for, then I would literally wear you down. I would literally chase you until you keep your promise. That's just who I am. And we actually have one of the diverse cabinets here in the UK with Liz Truss. Is that important to you? It is so important as somebody who came from another country and was sort of welcomed by the UK. It's very important to have a diverse cabinet. That's how change happens. You know, going back to what we discussed before, that's how you understand people who are on the periphery or who've been avid. It's so important to have a diverse cabinet. But this you think in terms of policies and what they can bring to the table or just also seeing a daily a diverse cabinet. You can have an effect on policy. I hope they can have an effect on the parties themselves, as well as policy. For me, it's about policy that makes people's lives better. I know you're also very close to Ghana still.

17360," scandalous anti LGBT will get through. I mean, you know, it's so funny. I was invited back to Ghana a few years ago by the president. It was the year of the of the return. And I remember the last time we were in Ghana, we were fleeing. And I really supported the changes. I love the changes that we're going through, but yes, they do have an LGBT problem. You know, some friends and I signed a whole... I don't know if you saw it. And we're doing what we can to change things on the ground. I think you can't also sit in the West and tell a country what to do. So it's about sort of forming alliances on the ground and seeing what is needed and how we can help. Whether than standing on our soap boxes, going, do this, do that, do this. So that's through what grounds... I mean, groundwork, trying to change from with it. Yes, from with it. Trying to change from with it, you know, trying to hit LGBTQ members and asking them what they need and what we can do to help. Rather than, you know, I'll say, do this. This is how you do it, because we don't live there. You have a memoir out. Yeah. Why put it down on paper? You know something about when you turn 50. You know something about when it's your 50th year at Vogue. You know, I got married this year. And you know, I'm normally not someone who looks back all the time, but it felt like the right time for me to do that. And also, you know, I just felt that a lot of young people sort of see people like you and I and they think, you know, we just got here and we were always here and for me it was really important to share the story of a journey about, you know, successors and, you know, failures. And, you know, that's the reason why I got here. So I just wanted to share that story with them. Sort of young people, as well as people who, you know, feel like they're on the outskirts of, you know, the outside of the industry, really. Do you feel like an outsider? I think I always feel like an outsider, but as I said before, you know, I grew up African in an African household in England, you know, different languages, different foods, and I now go to school and I've been in England. So I've always been about duality. I've always seen myself as an outsider, but also an insider. And even when, you know, I took a job at Britishville, I was the black gay working class outsider, but, you know, I'd been in the industry since I was 18. So I was, in essence, an insider. So that's really, it's about the duality that plays out in my life. What, who do you think made you the person you are today? I know you left home twice, right, Ghana, but also you had to leave your home. I mean, the puzzle made me who I mean, really is my mother. I mean, I mean, I loved my mother. She taught me about sort of beauty. She taught me about clothes, about fascist. She also taught me that beauty came in all forms. That, you know, women were beautiful, no matter what shaped they were, no matter what color, what religion. And so that really stayed with me. And I guess my creativity comes from her. And of course, I also had a military father. So the idea of precision and organization and sort of thinking ahead also comes from here. So the best of both worlds. How did your father, I know you had a difficult relation with your father. How did your father shape the person you are today? It's so funny you should ask this question, because I never thought I was like my father growing up. You know, I was very shy, very sensitive, you know, a little spacey. I prefer the company of women. To me and my dad was sort of, you know, sort of authoritarian, disciplinarian. You know, you had to, you know, be home a certain time. He ruled as an Iron Fist. And I thought, you know, I'm never going to be like him. You know, he kicked me out of the house, you know, when I was 18. But I found out that over the years, when it comes to work and discipline and sort of organization that that is him to a T.

I've never had great eyesight and I went through a series of sort of repnall detachments for to be exact. And with each detachment I'll have to end up looking down in a contraption for about three weeks. And in the dark room. And it was very harrowing. It was very harrowing time in my life. I always say you don't have to have vision to have vision. So in those dark rooms my imagination was even bigger. I dream bigger. And I came out of sort of the last surgery and the cover I did was for W. Magazine with Rihanna as the queen, with a gold in eye. And I look back at the end and I thought, oh my god, there are their eyes. Subliminally. So yes, it was very challenging. And even to this day, I go for checkups to make sure my eyes are okay. And they're great right now. And the more I look after myself, the better. The better I'll get. But it's amazing you power through adversity. Do you ever think actually this is too much? Have you ever thought this is too much? I mean there have been times when I felt this is too much, but it's not in my vocabulary to start. It's not in my DNA to start. You know, I am my mother's son, my father's son. You know, the edge to move forward is always there. And that's why when I was young I would always get up and work. I had a reckoning touch when I still got on a plane to go shoot the Hollywood book folio. But now I'm learning to say no. Now I'm learning I can't do that job. I can't fly. No. It takes time, but it comes with age. It takes courage to say no. Right? Definitely. So when you look at all your covers and there's so many beautiful ones, is there one that's special to you? Well, I say to someone, they're like my children. We always have a favorite mom. But I'm especially proud of the covers we did in lockdown. You know, when the world had essentially shut down, you know, the teams were sort of scattered all around London. And I had to go back to the days of I did when, you know, you had to really create and use your imagination. And we had a series of four covers, Judy Dantj, when they said, you know, anybody over 60, she stayed at home. The essential workers cover a cover of landscapes just so people could take a breather. And the activists cover when George Floyd was murdered. And I really think we create covers that, you know, in years time, people can look back and see what the top...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5767,2022-10-23 00:56:51

And I really think we create covers that in years time people can look back and see what the time, that period was like for me, an artist always has to reflect their times to paraphrase Nina Simone, and that's really important for me. I mean, there was a bit of controversy with Linda van Gelista. Yes. Yes, I mean, you know, there was a complaint that, you know, she should have looked a certain way, you know. And for me, I've known Linda in the 90s. I've known this incredible icon who really defined what a model should be. And I also saw my friend go through really dark days, you know, due to the complications for surgery. Let's really disappear from the world, really not the Linda the world needs. So when we were doing this cover, it was the collaboration. She wanted to be that Linda that everybody knew. She wanted to feel good about herself again. And I wasn't going to deny her that. And also, you know, whatever I would like to say, whatever woman wants to do with her body, it's up to her. So, you know, I'm very proud of Linda and I'm very proud of that cover. And I mean, sometimes you're almost like an activist. Is that how you, you're like a fashion activist or a political fashion? I'm a professional, but I'm definitely creative.

I don't know, even what would have happened to my family. So even when we ended up in a room, two rooms in a voxel, six of us, we were so happy to be there, penniless, but so happy to be there. So, you know, every day, I just, you know, I'm an optimist and I know it's not the most fashionable thing, but that's why I'm sitting here with you today. Bye. Edward, thank you so much for your time today. Thank you. Oh. What do Formula One cars and your local supermarket have in common? Well, strange as it sounds, they might both be using the same technology. A lot of innovation has trickled down from the world of high tech engines and it hasn't just found a new life in road cars. F1 cars have long been thought of as the peak of cool and technology in them is also helping to pull down our produce aisles. Engineers from Williams are using their knowledge from nine instructors championships, working with company Aerofoil to help reduce the energy consumption of supermarkets. The device they're building is based on the design of an F1 cars rear wing. It attaches to fridges to keep more cool air in the unit. They estimate it can reduce supermarket energy consumption by 25%. One innovation from F1 is also helping hybrids reduce their carbon footprint. That's curves or the kinetic energy recovery system. In common parlance, it's known as regenerative braking and works by storing energy of the car decelerating in a battery for later use. If that's not enough, F1 is now looking at curves or a thermal energy recovery system looking to harness the heat produced from braking and the engine exhaust. That could allow cars to generate the same power using 30% less fuel. So while F1 may have a reputation as a gas guzzler, some of its innovations in the name of speed are helping in the everyday fight against climate change. So what's the best investment advice you've ever put in? You haven't found anybody. The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance, and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day. And if you keep at it and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's not just interest. It was always said about compound interest returns, compound business returns, compound human returns. They're all very additive because you'll learn every day. And if you keep at it, it's very, very helpful.

Thank you, Andy, so much for coming down. It's really wonderful to have you here in person. It's my pleasure to be here. Thanks for having me. And I just found out we actually lived in the same dorm in college just a few years apart. So it's been almost a year since you took over from Jeff as CEO of Amazon and it's been a year of first, the first Docs Blitz since the.com bloom, the first vote to unionize an Amazon warehouse, your first Bloomberg technology conference. Thank you. I want to start with a quick report card. In February 2021, Jeff Bezos shocked the world by announcing plans to step down as Amazon CEO. A few months later, he passed the reins to Andy Jassy, his longtime top lieutenant, the architect of one of the company's biggest profit engines, Amazon Web Services. Bezos has stayed on Amazon for a long time. He's been a big fan of Amazon Web Services. He's been a big fan of Amazon Web Services for a long time. Amazon Web Services. Bezos has stayed on as executive chair, leaving Jassy to navigate a critical inflection point in Amazon's history. How does the company manage market turmoil, rising inflation and regulatory scrutiny, and a push by some warehouse workers to unionize all while keeping customers coming back? Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, Amazon's second CEO, Andy Jassy, he joined us from our flagship Bloomberg Technology Summit in San Francisco. I'd like you to grade your view of Amazon's performance, and we've got time later to really dig in. But quickly, how would you grade Amazon's performance over the last year with customers? Well, I think we've, you know, I'm not sure I'm the right person to grade myself during the year or not, but I'll give you my take. You know, I think with respect to customers, I think we've done a lot of good, you know, and I think if you look at during the pandemic, which really has extended till the early part of this year, you know, so much as the PPE and food and essential items and people equipping their home offices were bought from Amazon and, you know, to scale the way we needed to. Remember, in 2020, we grew 39 percent year over year on a $245 billion revenue run rate. I mean, it's unprecedented. It's never happened before, but it was really hard to do that. And we had to take the really big footprint of the fulfillment center footprint. We built the first 25 years of Amazon and doubled it in 24 months. We built out that transportation network in just a couple of years. You know, we nearly doubled the size of our workforce during that time. And I think you saw it in other businesses. AWS is a really big part of helping companies and governments have business continuity during the pandemic. And so many companies and organizations in the last year made the strategic decision that they were going to stop running their own infrastructure technology and disproportionately chose AWS to help them move to the cloud. And we spent a lot of time helping to make that transformation. So what about investors? I mean, the stock is down significantly from a peak last year. Obviously, there's broader market turmoil. Yeah, I think, you know, for investors financially, I'd say it's mixed. You know, I think we have some businesses that are growing really strongly. If you look at AWS in 2021, grew 37% year every year. It's not a $74 billion revenue run rate business. It's pretty unusual growth. We grew 58% year every year in our advertising business. You know, what's a $32 billion revenue run rate business? So some businesses growing really strongly. And we've continued to grow in our retail business despite pretty crazy comparable during 2020. But I think the real challenge for us there is on the cost side. And there have been several things that have happened. Some of which are more controllable than others. You know, I think the part that's less controllable is really around inflation. And I think we thought that inflation would start to attenuate in 2022. And with the war in Ukraine, it just went the other way. It has significantly accelerated. And so the cost of trucking and line haul and ocean and air and fuel has just substantially gone up. And I think that will attenuate at some point. No one knows how long that will take. I think the more controllable areas for us are really around fulfillment center.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5769,2022-10-23 01:05:43
17364," And I think that will attenuate at some point. No one knows how long that'll take. I think the more controllable areas for us are really around fulfillment center capacity and productivity. It was taking about 24 months to build new fulfillment centers during the pandemic. And so we had to make decisions, you know, in mid-2020 and early 2021 on how much demand we were going to plant for it. And so, you know, we end up with more capacity than we need right now. And there's a number of things that we're working on. And we've stopped building on properties where we don't need it yet. And we've let a number of leases lapse. And not a small number, you know, of both those things. We've had a lot of occasions in our history where we've worked on productivity and made improvements. And we have a lot of clearly defined niches. And I'm confident we're going to get back to the right level of profitability. You are going to sub-lease 30 million square feet of space. Is there a mistake in the execution there because of the overbuilding? Again, because you have to make these decisions two years in advance. And again, if you put yourself back in 2020 where we were growing 39% year over year on a $245 billion revenue run rate, it's very hard to know what's the right amount to build. And you have to make a decision. And we made the decision to err on the side of our consumers and sellers. Now, how would you grade Amazon's performance with employees, your colleagues? There has been some high profile. Yeah. I think that when I started in this gig, we had just created a new leadership principle to strive to be Earth's best employer. And I think we're, we spent a lot of time trying to think through what that really means. It's broad. And I think we've made a fair bit of progress, but it's still early, in my opinion. But I still think there are many areas that we can keep improving. And I think the first one I'd mention is safety. I think that in our fulfillment centers, that is the top priority. And when you get into the details and numbers and outside of all the spin of it all, we're about average there, but we're not trying to be average. We want to be the best in the industry and the best in the world at it. That's a high priority and an area that I'm passionate about and the team is passionate about. And I think we have a lot of work we can do to make our employees everyday lives easier. And we've identified kind of a top 100 list of areas that we can be better at, that we're just metronomically stepping through. And so we've made a lot of progress, but we've a lot of work to you still. Elon Musk just came out saying he has a super bad feeling about the economy, Tesla laying off 10% of his staff. Jamie Dimon says he's preparing for an economic hurricane. The world bank just slashed its forecast for global growth. How do you feel about the economic climate? Well, I wasn't planning on giving any guidance to the government. Please. But super bad or super super bad. I think there's some things that are related to Amazon that are useful to remember. I think the first piece is remember that 85% of the worldwide retail market segment share is offline. And if you believe that that equation is going to flip at some point, which we do, I think it will flip over a long period of time. If you look at different downturns, should we have one at some point? And we've been through a few, obviously, in the 25 years that I've been at Amazon, customers change their habits. And so I also think those two reasons, those two factors give me some optimism that even if we have a downturn that we have the potential to still grow. We have a roadmap that's probably three to five years long. And we're going to continue to invent. We're going to continue to be insurgent. And we have a lot of work to do to get to where we think we ultimately can get for customers. Now, when it comes to the stock, as I mentioned, it has fallen significantly. Do you think investors are missing something or has tech just been overvalued? And this also, of course, matters to employees who are significantly paid in stock? Well, you know, I look, I haven't been at Amazon for 25 years. I arrived at the company three weeks before we went public. I have never tried to predict what the stocks are going to do. In any time, I've tried to a little bit, I've been wrong. So I think it's a pretty hard to predict what's going to be in any short period of time. I do really believe that Benjamin Graham and Max from that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5770,2022-10-23 01:10:09
17365," Pretty hard to predict what's going to be in any short period of time. I do really believe that Benjamin Graham maximum that in the short term, the stock market tends to be a voting machine and the long term it tends to be a voting machine. I think if you, you know, we've been through a lot of points in 25 years at Amazon where the macro factors are off and stocks are down. Our stock is down, but you can't really control that. You know, we have a concept we talk about a lot of Amazon inputs and outputs, you know, and the ultimate output for a company is share price, you know, and then other big outputs are free cash flow or profit or revenue. You can't really manage the outputs. You have to manage at the input level and that's where we spend all our time. And so if you do the right things for the business long term, things tend to work out. I think we've had very good returns for investors and I expect that to be true again.

When you think of cutting edge technology at sea, you might be thinking of stuff like this, but there's an incoming revolution on the high seas that isn't quite as sexy but could be significantly more impactful. Consignation is the key component of global trade. About 80% and 90% of all the world's goods are transported at sea at some point. But there's a significant unseen cost to the modern era of global commerce. About 3% of all the world's CO2 emissions come from shipping. 3% may not sound like a lot, but that's roughly comparable to the entire CO2 output of Germany. Since reducing trade isn't a likely option, what about a technological improvement to help reduce the emissions from these well-stocked maritime behemoths? What are the moon shots at Amazon that are capturing most of your time and attention? What is going to define the next era of Amazon? I mean, is it Astro the home row butter? Is it something else? Well, you know, we have a unique way that we look at big new investments. And I'm not sure it's right or wrong. It just happens to be our way. And we ask ourselves when we're considering something for questions. We ask if it's successful, can it be big and move the needle in Amazon? Is it being well served today? Do we have a differentiated approach? And do we have competence there, and if not, can we acquire quickly? And if we like the answer to those questions, we'll go pursue it with a single threat of team that isn't distracted by the rest of the business. And sometimes that leads to innovation and investments that seem pretty obvious. Like, you know, when I got to that company, it was a book's only retailer, and then we expanded to music and video electronics and toys. It seems obvious to people. Other times that process does not lead to investments that seem obvious to people. I mean, AWS was something that people externally and internally thought was a little bit nutty at the time. But just imagine what Amazon would be today without AWS. And I think that you see the same thing here. You know, there are so many significant investments from making that I'm excited about. I'm going to have to constrain myself to a few. But, you know, I'm really excited about what we're doing in the prime video space. I think we're clearly on the right track there and building a significant business. That's interesting because Netflix also just announced some layoffs. Yeah.

Well, you know, we're very bullish on it and remember we all the models are a little bit different but for prime video we have 200 million plus prime subscribers who are you know get that entertainment for free by being part of prime and so we have a little bit different pricing model than some of the others but I'm incredibly encouraged by what we have coming. If you look I mean we launched this show reacher earlier in the year was a huge hit we you know we had the new Maisel season we we just launched the new boys season which is how you make boys fan I am a big boys fan. It's very good of course we have what are the rings coming up you know in September and Thursday and football so I'm very bullish about it. We also you know we're excited about what we've done with MGM you know I think some of the assets there will go very well with the rest of what we're doing entertainment wise. So if you look at Warner Brothers Discovery and Paramount and Stars and Global they're building really significant subscription businesses so I'm very bullish about that business. I'm optimistic that we have a chance to build a significant grocery business which is you know early stages for us. I am excited about Kuiper which is our low earth orbit satellite that we're building you gotta remember there are 300 to 400 million people in the world who have limited to no Internet connectivity. I mean just think about how different the world is when you don't have that type of connectivity and so I think that's a really significant opportunity that has some AWS characteristics to it. I continue to be very optimistic about Alexa you know building the world's best personal assistant we have a 200 million end points already that are using Alexa we're clearly on something there and then you are autonomous driving ride hailing service and zoos that we're building you know here in the Bay area. I just think with the way auto consumption is evolving I think that also is a chance to be really significant business now I don't know if I don't know if all of them are going to be successful. But if any one of them becomes the fourth pillar for us on top of marketplace and prime and AWS we're completely different company just like we were when AWS became successful so I think they're very worthwhile investments and bets and I'm optimistic about. We didn't mention Astro obviously the powered by Alexa but I mean our home robots going to be where I don't yet where is it it's not really widely available for sale what's the status. Okay thank you everyone's very curious about Jeff's role these days what kind of executive chair he really is he said when he left that he'd focus his attention and energies on initiatives that he really cares about as at Amazon but from the outside it looks like he's really focusing on philanthropy he's focusing on space what kind of executive chairmen is he. Well he you know Jeff is always going to be involved and he has you know I feel very lucky to have been in Amazon for 25 years I feel very lucky to have worked directly for Jeff for 20 of them and we have a really close relationship and have for a long time and I think we share a lot of the same values about customers and. How important is to optimize for customers and how I standards they need to be you know given how easy it is for people to switch and the importance of invention and speed and so I know I just feel very lucky to have had the chance to work so closely with him so is your relationship he was your only boss for 25 years right is relationship fundamentally different than it was when you were the head of. You know every single job you have the relationships different you know remember might the first couple years I work for Jeff I worked as what we call the shadow then what's really like a teeth of staff and that was different than when I was starting AWS which was different from when we got AWS going and it was you know a business that was starting to do well and it's different when I'm in the CEO role but you know the constant has always been that we have a great relationship and we collaborate really well. Amazon is poised to become the biggest private sector employer in the world second only right now Walmart is in that spot but Amazon will probably soon surpass it. First vote to unionize at Amazon warehouse I know you've been spending a lot of time at warehouses when you look at someone like Chris malls who I think some people look at as this modern day hero who got fired.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5772,2022-10-23 01:18:34
17367," I'm at Amazon warehouse. I know you've been spending a lot of time at warehouses. When you look at someone like Chris Smalls, who I think some people look at as this modern day hero who got fired, pulled off this union vote, what's your message to someone like him? Your message to the folks who think maybe we should join a union? Well, I think that the first thing to be clear about is that employees get to make that choice, whether they want to have a union or not. They always have had that choice and it continues to be their choice. And we happen to think they're better off without a union for a number of reasons, including the fact that, it's much harder when you have a union to have a direct relationship with your manager and to get things done quickly. So if you see something on the line that you think could be better for your team or you or your customers, you can't just go to your manager and say, let's change this. There's a whole process in bureaucracy that you have to go through to be able to do that. And when there's a union, we're going to get the feedback filtered by what the union decides is worth bringing up and we'd much rather hear from every employee whatever is on their mind. And so I think if you want to continue to have the structure that we've had for all this time, you have to have really competitive benefits. And then I think if you look at Amazon's, they're very unusual in this space. We championed the $15 minimum wage several years ago, the starting salary is now over $18 an hour, which is more than double the federal minimum wage. You get full health insurance and 401K and up to 20 weeks of parental leave. And if you want to get a college education, you haven't had one. We have a career choice program that that's our fulfillment center associate to be able to do so. That is a very unusual and compelling set of benefits. And those were all accomplished without a union. So I think that we realize that we have to continue to work on the relationship with our employees and we need to continue to provide the right benefits. And we need to continue to work on safety. And that's our intention. You made a huge mark on Amazon with AWS obviously. What is the mark that you want to make still? I think what we've seen during this period of time is that communicating via video is not a bad. We are using all aspects of our lives to work or learning, for communicating, for staying in touch. Lots happening on Wall Street. I think, Jay Powell said things that were indefensible. Need to catch up? This is Bloomberg Wall Street week. I'm David Weston. We've got the information and insights. We think that's the next secular shift. From business's most influential and instrumental. It's mocking it at the bullfrog. It's a challenging dynamic. This is a level of uncertainty that we've ever had to deal with. Bloomberg Wall Street week, live Friday with Replays All Weekend on Bloomberg Television and Radio. The FTC has revamped its antitrust inquiry into Amazon. And by some accounts is accelerating it. Are you preparing for an antitrust lawsuit from the FTC? If you are a large company that's growing to a significant extent like we have, you have to be prepared to be scrutinized. And we have known this for some time, many years. And we have tried to run the company with that in mind. And knowing that if somebody looked, that we would stand up to that scrutiny. I think that's what we've tried to do in running the business. We can't control whether organizations spring different suits against us. But I think if you look at our business, if you actually look at the fact, if you take out of the equation that there may not be the most objective leadership.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5773,2022-10-23 01:22:54
17368," I think if you look at our business, if you actually look at the fact, if you take out of the equation that there may not be the most objective leadership when it comes to Amazon in that organization, if you look at the facts in our retail business, we're about 1% of the worldwide retail market segment share. And remember, 85% of it is still offline. And if you look in our AWS business, we, depending on you measure it, 95% of the worldwide global IT spend is on premises. And then we have a cloud business, and then we have a portion of that. We have a leading market segment share in the cloud part of this, but we operate, you know, who we compete with, and AWS is really on premises, IT in addition to the cloud. So, you know, these are relatively small percentages of the entire pie, and you can kind of step through all the businesses. And I think simply because you've been successful in a few different businesses, doesn't somehow mean that you have a natural market power. It just means you've been successful in a couple of different customer experiences, but we still have a relatively small amount of market segment share in those areas. What about the SEC, or being sued by them over third party data, and how you've used it? Do you think in the past Amazon made mistakes with letting employees internally see how those third party sellers were doing? Well, yeah, we have pretty good control. I mean, you know, we, of course, disagree with the premise of that. But I would say that we have very good controls with respect to the data that different employees sets are able to see. And by the way, I think that we can be better for sellers. You know, I think that, you know, we can have better tools from the get started. We can have better tools from the manage what they're doing across their different Amazon units. I think we can communicate better. There's a whole bunch of things we can do better. And we agonize over every single email or communication we get from sellers, and we do very regularly robust surveying, and a lot more sellers are happy with Amazon than unhappy with Amazon. And I think if you look at what they're able to do as a business by virtue of selling on Amazon versus not, it completely changes what's possible. Sellers don't really long for e-commerce software. That exists in lots of places, and it's not very expensive. What they love about selling on Amazon is that they get access to our hundreds and millions of customers, and that completely changes what their prospects can be in terms of the businesses they're building. So we have a lot of work to do there, like we do in a lot of other places, but I think we have a very strong partnership with sellers. What's the view of the supply chain right now, and how much pain there is going to continue to be, and for how long? Well, you know, I think that there's a lot of challenges in the supply chain still. I mean, it's gotten better than it was, but there are all sorts of challenges, non-parasurable goods, electronics, chips, it's still a really significant issue for all sorts of businesses. We have worked really hard to open a lot more points of presence and ports, and to increase our capacity and getting products in, but I think it's going to be something that companies battle with for some time. You made a huge mark on Amazon with AWS, obviously. What is the mark that you want to make still on Amazon? I mean, in this new role, what's going to define the anti-Jacy era? Well, I don't really think of it that way, Emily. I mean, I don't think it's really about any anti-Jacy era or any one person. And by the way, AWS was not about any one person. If you spend a time on AWS, that is an unbelievable team, not just an incredible leadership team, which it is, but just top to bottom, the number of inventors and people care about customers and operate something where it has to work almost like a doubt on it. It's always teams. So I look at every single one of our businesses and take our retail business or our consumer business, which is the oldest for our businesses, 85% of it still lives offline. I think we have a lot of upside and a lot of growth. And I think as much invention as we've seen the last 25 years, you know, the time I've been...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5774,2022-10-23 01:27:17
17369," I think we have a lot of upside and a lot of growth. And I think as much invention as we've seen the last 25 years, the time I've been there, I think it's gonna look small compared to the next 25 years. There is a lot for us to invent on behalf of customers. And so I'm excited to be part of the team that makes that happen. We are continuing to increase the amount that we give back to the communities in which we have big presence. And that really matters to me. I think we have a responsibility to do that. And so it's a long journey that we're working on. But I'm excited to be part of it. And I hope to do it for a long time. Well, thank you for joining us and telling us about the way the journey is going so far. Thank you very much. And I appreciate it. Thank you, Amanda. Thank you. Thank you. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. Because Trussonomics is being dismantled, MPs behind the scenes are asking what's the point of having her at the top? In the strong dollar, amplified the world's risks of instability. The student-pings at complete reunification must be realized. With unmatched reach and resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. I think it's crucial and important. I think we've moved from this attitude, from its indulgence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s, and so it makes it a really exciting field, because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harness to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts, but if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what you bring figures out while you're sleeping. Before the COVID pandemic upended the way the world does business, logistics was one of those industries that might have been taken for granted. That's not the case anymore.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5775,2022-10-23 01:31:38
17370," Thus, business logistics was one of those industries that might have been taken for granted. That's not the case anymore. Due to all the turbulence over the last two years, customers are now realizing how important it is to have a reliable logistics partner on their side. Our people are doing a quite complex job. People think, oh, they just deliver passes somewhere, that's an easy thing. If you think about what our people are doing, it's quite complex. Businesses and consumers are suddenly thinking a lot more about how things they need reach places where they're needed. It's thrust the sector into the spotlight. Logistics and supply chain has become a household need. It's dramatically different than three pandemic. Yes, it's grown, whether that's in market power, revenue, profitability, investor and price. For Deutsche Post DHL Group, that's created opportunity to build on momentum and set ambitious goals for service and performance. When you look at our footprint, we're the most international logistics company there is. We want to become more digital and we want to be much more sustainable than we have been. DP DHL's revenue has soared since 2020 with full-year profit nearly doubling in 2021. CFO Melanie Christ is a key leader of the team that's delivered these results and she views her role as much more than just a number. There are unfortunately these clichés that finance is boring and it's kind of like been counting in the back office to be successful in finance. I mean, you have to have the financial expertise, right? But we also have to be credible business leaders in order to really impact the business and steer the direction. She is extremely smart and bright. You need somebody who is able to digest a lot of information that rapidly and can distinguish what is important, what is less important and she has tremendous skill in that. And she's not afraid to call people out, to call out other members of the executive team if she feels that something isn't being. She does that in a very nice way actually. She helps meet tremendously in steering of a company because she is highly regarded by my other colleagues in the senior team and typically if they have a problem they share at first with her before they come to me. When I think about the conversations I have with Frank, the shortest part is actually about the analysis and the facts. It's more the debate about, okay, on that basis, what are the options? What can we do? My role is essentially saying in three sentences, what is working well in this company, where do we have challenges and what should we do going forward? Deutsche Post DHL Group consists of five divisions, express, Germany's Post and parcel service, global forwarding and freight, supply chain and e-commerce solutions. Each of these segments has seen revenue growth in the last four years, while the surge of e-commerce volume during the pandemic has had a direct impact on the trajectory. Have you seen e-commerce as a very structural and fundamental growth driver for us as a company? What we now saw under the pandemic was a structural acceleration. It took us forward to a point in terms of e-compensation which we probably would have reached on the normal circumstances in three years' time. So it was a big step forward. DP DHL was well prepared to take this step. The company's strategic plan recognized e-commerce as a growing trend in the logistics landscape, but no one could have forecast the speed and breadth of the transformation. What we are now seeing that also under the pandemic, not only domestic e-commerce has taken a faster growth trajectories and anticipated, but also cross-border e-commerce. We see that very clearly in our express network, but also in our e-con solutions division. What are the other big structural shifts that you see on the horizon? Is it e-commerce B2B? Is it increased trade as globalisation restructures? What are the shifts that you're seeing? The board B2B e-commerce is still at a very early stage, so we believe that there will be a huge gross opportunity there. And we also see that when we are talking to our customers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5776,2022-10-23 01:35:55
17371," that there will be a huge post opportunity there. And we also see that when we are talking to our customers now, I guess everybody has been now realized that being dependent on just one supplier in one province in one country is probably not a good idea. So they want to build more resilience into the supply chain. I think our international footprint, our global strengths, is really something we can leverage for the benefit of our customers. Another factor in the company's favor is its balance sheet. Since Melanie Christ became CFO, Cashflow has improved significantly. One of my priorities over the last years has been to really focus the whole organization on better cash generation. It's not just a finance job. Making sure that ultimately a revenue convert into EBIT and into cash in the bank account is the responsibility of the whole organization. She says, we can't be successful as a company. If we are not collecting the cash for our services, we have provided. And she has not missed one single opportunity talk about that. I think it's a very comfortable situation, particularly in the current environment, to have a strong balance sheet. I think in that respect, I'm very conservative. And I'd rather have a bit more on the balance sheet and a bit more buffer. Spell out for us what the priorities are, the longer-term priorities, in terms of putting some of that cash to use for you. The first priority here is organic growth. We clearly indicated also with our CAPEX budget, 12 billion for the next three years, that we will keep investing into organic growth. We are very focused on our regular dividend payment. And then, if there is something left, which is, fortunately, the case at the moment, we will think about inorganic opportunities and we will also think about other means to allow our shareholders to participate. That is why we are currently running a 2 billion euro share-by-back program. Inorganic opportunities include M&A, like the recent purchase of beverage shipper, Hila Brand. But deploying cash is always subject to careful consideration. Does Melanie ever turn around and say, no, when you're pushing through or pushing for a particular package of spending? Yes, she does that quite often, you know, because she has... She is a person and that's great if you have a CEO who is risk-abuse, because you need somebody, you know, the business is always too optimistic. Melanie might be something too pessimistic, but that's a very healthy discussion. And if we then jointly come to the same conclusion after a debate, then we are probably in the right spot. How often do you find yourself saying no to divisional heads? So when I was promoted into the CFO position, my team gave me a stamp with rejected. It sits on my desk. I think the fact that people know it sits there already has instilled quite a lot of discipline in the organization. So I think when I get a proposal, it has already gone through a number of iterations and is normally of such a high quality that I don't need the rejected stamp too often. For the time being, Christ should be able to keep that stamp in a drawer. CEO Frank Appell has expressed a commitment to service quality and confidence that customers will accept higher prices that come with it. If you are too expensive, you will be out of business, but if you don't provide the right quality, you will be out of business as well. So we want to be, we will never be the cheapest in town. That's not doable. We are the premium provider. That's our strategy. Of course, it's also more challenging for us when our customers are under pressure. At the same time, I think, over all the last two years have shown that a reliable high quality supply chain comes at a certain price tag. I definitely see that inflation is having a huge impact on the logistics industry and there's been substantial price increases in the last few years. I do not see that changing. There's a lot of innovation happening and I don't see the inflation necessarily going away. It might level out a bit, but it's not going to go away. The logistics companies may have pricing power with customers, but their stock prices haven't been so robust. I think the issue there is the increase in interest rates as made everyone rethink and be concerned.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5777,2022-10-23 01:40:25
17372," haven't been so robust. I think that the issue there is the increase in interest rates has made everyone rethink and be concerned about the level of inventory that is out in the system, if you will, with the level of disruption. I think what's happened more in the last three months is the more of a view that we're going into certainly a new coming slowdown, maybe a recession. With more than half its revenue coming from Europe, investors may see DBDHL as more exposed to recession risks than its global peers. The company insists it can meet its revenue targets in the event of a downturn. It's counting on diversification as a cushion. I'm not so pessimistic that there is really a deep recession at our doorstep. But even then, our portfolio is very much balanced. We are everywhere in the world, but we're not going entirely into recession. Would it be a stretch to suggest that DBDHL is to some extent recession proof? I wouldn't go as far as to say recession proof, but I think we are very well positioned to deal with all different types of recession scenarios due to the breadth of support for you. It also portfolio really gives us a lot of resilience against any type of headwind. Coming up, a look at DBDHL's investments in action. Melanie Christ shows me around the company's state of the art in logistics. What I love about this building is it actually shows the big mega trends which formed our strategy 2025. This is Bloomberg. As the chief financial officer of one of the world's largest logistics companies, Melanie Christ has made her mark in global business. That's not what she originally attempted to do. I really wanted to go into research. I wanted to become a physicist and that was where my passion was. But then during my studies, some friends of mine started doing this strange thing. They went into management consulting. I didn't even know how to spell it. And I had no idea what it was about. But what they told me was quite interesting. And so I ended up doing an internship with a consulting firm. And I learned more in the two months there than I had in the last two years in my physics job at university. That is how I ended up in consulting. She started her career with three years at McKinsey. And spent four years in private equity with APAC's partners in London before joining Deutsche Post DHL Group in 2004. I was brought into the company to do international M&A project. That was at the time around 20 years ago when we were really building the company in the current shape, acquiring lots of logistics companies around the world. The M&A part was the first thing. And I then wandered into a more mainstream finance field here in the group becoming the CFO of our DHL Express division. So from then on it was more leading towards the CFO role eventually. Malenny Christ now heads the finance team with around 11,000 employees. Success in this role is as much an art as a science. If you do the greatest piece of analysis and you see it all and you know it all, but you can't convey that message and you can't convince the rest of the organization that we should move into a certain direction, it's useless. DHL is sending a consistent message with its investments. The company spent 123 million euros to upgrade its logistics centre at the Cologne-Born Airport, designing it around key strategic goals. What I love about this building is it actually shows the big mega trends.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5778,2022-10-23 01:44:37
17373," Clone Bon Airport, designing it around key strategic goals. What I love about this building is it actually shows the big mega trends which formed our strategy 2025, which was inaugurated in 2019 when this building opened. So globalization connecting the world. Ecomers, we have a lot of sortation facilities here for smaller ecomers shipments. Sustainability, it's a very sustainable building, there's solar panels on the roof and everything. And digitalisation and well you can obviously see that it is quite automated. How did the team pitch this investment to you initially and how hard was it as a cell for them? How quickly did you turn around say yes, this is worth 123 million euros. Of course you always have to make sure that you have the right capacity for the growth in the network. And at that time they came and said hey we will really see a strong growth in ecomers volumes on top of the regular B2B grows we need more sorting capacity, we need this building. And of course there are all the debates, does it really have to cost 123 million euros and so on. But fortunately they convinced us because then with Covid and the volume search we urgently needed the capacity. At the same time as Covid accelerated demand for logistics services, disruptions in the labour supply hurt productivity. Advances in technology like this digital sauter have helped offset some pressures. But automation also raises questions. Does this tell us that this is the business grows, this is going to become a more automated business, that there's going to be less need for labour for workers. Well you still see people here and I think what you can nicely, what you see is the combination of technology which supports people. So for example when you look at the customs area, it used to be a very manual and sometimes confusing process. Now the people are supported in picking the right shipments for customs inspections by lights and they are automatically sorted in this sauter to go to customs inspections. So it is also helping the people with the jobs they are doing here every day. We are all the sets in 2019-20. You know we might get one third less jobs in the current setup until 2030 if we digitalise the organisation. But we are very sure that our company will be at least 50, maybe 100% bigger and we will have more jobs to offer. At the beginning of a couple of years ago when we started that journey people said, oh you know I might lose my job, I haven't heard that in the last two years as a question any tone hold. This airport hub also showcases DP DHL's aviation fleet which both small than 320 dedicated cargo aircraft. The biggest tank of our aircraft but we also have short and medium and long term leases and visit growth in our business. We anticipate that the people keep going. You've talked about investing of course in sustainable fuel. Yes. When does that come online? How significant is it? Is it just the critics might say that's just window dressing around a part of the business that is of course very carbon intensive? At least a lot of emissions. Yes so you absolutely write the problem with our beautiful aircraft is the CO2 emissions. And when you look at our overall CO2 emissions two thirds are from aviation. It is about flying these birds with more sustainable fuel and we said that we are really willing to spend billions on it. We now really hope that we will see the uptick in supply over the next years. Spending billions isn't vague hyperbole. The company has pledged to put 7 billion euros towards sustainable technologies and fuels by 2030 with a goal of climate neutral logistics by 2050. Sustainability makes good business sense anyway especially if you are in a business that is energy or fuel hungry as a compliance element that not just operators in the logistics sector need to consider but also their customers. So being transparent becomes part of the service about their impact on the globe. We had a lengthy discussion should we make a financial commitment how much we want to invest for the next decade in our sustainability. We had a long debate is it right to say we want to invest 7 billion to 2030. There were pros and cons. But that was a very intense discussion melody in IHART where we finally came to the conclusion that the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5779,2022-10-23 01:49:02

Still ahead how one of the business world's most influential women is working to strengthen gender equality within her company.

Which opposed DHL Group's CFO Melanie Christ is often named to lists of the most powerful women in business. And while men still outnumber women as finance heads of large companies, there are signs that the balance is shifting. The number of female CFOs across major US companies has risen to an all time high, according to a study by Chris Colder Associates. And executive search firm Cohen Partners reports that 36% of new CFOs hired by notable companies in the first half of 2022 were women. I asked Melanie Christ if she's encountered obstacles as a woman rising through the executive ranks. I have to say, I have not made many negative experiences. Maybe I was also a little bit in the evenal thinking about these challenges so much. So I mean, when I studied physics, there weren't many women, so I was somehow always used to it. And it can also be an advantage when you're kind of like the only girl in the room. I mean, the boss at the end remembers your name and not the 19 guys who all kind of like were doxies and white shirts and look alike, right? So I never experienced it as an external stress factor. I have to say for me personally, it was more balancing my own expectations around kind of like getting family and to job combined.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5780,2022-10-23 01:53:20
17375," For me personally it was more balancing my own expectations around kind of like getting family and the job combined. But that was probably more of a pressure I put on myself thinking that I had to be perfect in every dimension and not something where the pressure was put on me from my male colleagues. So how do you take that experience and put it to play in terms of how you advance the role of women in this organization? I think the great thing is that now across the board in finance but also in the group overall we have role models which show young female talent that everything is possible. In finance we have a share of women in management of 32%. So we are ahead of the group. We want to get to 35% by 2025. I think we are now at a position where if we have a vacancy I want to have at least one woman on the short list because we have enough female talent. So every short list should contain a woman and then the best person in the race should win. CEO Frank Appell says Christ sets an example for the entire organization and he believes her success may influence the entire industry. She has proven that she is an outstanding CEO for all and she is definitely a role model in many dimensions that you know what I like about there. She is still you know a very warm and nice person and that makes such a big difference. So you can get to that level without compromising on how nice you are as a person. I think she is a great role model and I hope that this has had positive impact for many others. From the big picture down to the smallest operational details, Melanie Christ is fully engaged in guiding DP DHL into the future. I wanted to know what she sees when she looks ahead. What do you see as the biggest opportunities for DP DHL over the next 10 years? I think we have a fantastic portfolio and we just have to leverage the growth opportunities which are there both on the ECOM side and also on the traditional B2B side and the key differentiators for us will be digitalisation, sustainability and our great people. As you look ahead 10 years, what are some of the challenges, what keeps you up at night as you think about the business going forward? I think we have to keep this focus and the ability to adjust in a very agile way. Sometimes when you kind of like think about all the risk controlling and stuff, people tend to create the impression that you can preplan everything. That is clearly not the case. So I think we have to stay focused and keep the ability to react in a very agile way. But looking at what happened over the last 24 months, I'm very optimistic that we will also be able to cope with whatever happens next. And how do you see your role changing in the years ahead? I think it is changing at a very rapid pace which is a great thing because it never gets boring. Those elements I just mentioned for the group overall, digitalisation and sustainability are also hugely relevant for the finance role. It is like a new language you have to learn. And you learn vocabulary, but then you also have to develop a feeling if I kind of like put so much capital into this decarbonisation measure, I get so much in terms of return out of it. But that is a fascinating opportunity where we can make a huge difference for finance and for the group overall. As you look to the future Melanie, what do you think is going to be the skill sets, the knowledge bases, they're going to be essential to the success of future CFOs? Yes, probably the two most essential new skills will be to get even better at lifelong learning because we will have to learn so much new stuff every year. Be it in the digitalisation area, be it on sustainability. So this ability also has a 50 year plus old person to keep learning and keep the curiosity. I think that is going to be super essential and the second element will be being a great team player. The word is complex, you can't know it all, so you really have to work even more strongly with your team. What advice would you give to someone who's just recently been appointed CFO? That's a great question. I think I would probably simply say, be curious and ask as many questions as you can, try to learn as much as possible.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5781,2022-10-23 01:57:41
17376," That's a great question. I think I would probably simply say be curious and ask as many questions as you can. Try to learn as much as possible, not only in the finance area, but get close to the business. Try to really understand the business because only when you are close to the business and you understand the fundamental profit drivers, will you be a really great CEO. And Tom McKenzie, this is Bloomberg. At some point you had to fight for the trademark, right, for the red soul. Is that stressful? Very stressful. Very stressful. Especially, you know, we are a small company in a way and you have to fight people who have those huge companies who put you 27 lawyers on your back for something which is yours is very stressful. I mean, I wish it didn't happen. Every thing which happened to me is a lesson in a way that are good. Once it's done, it's done and you are sort of happy. I'm happy about it. That thing I could have definitely avoided, but it's done. Did you realize at the time when you started the company that you would become so successful and actually so big? No, no. When I started the company, I wanted to have a shop in Paris, which is my hometown. And I wanted to do pretty shoes for pretty girls. That was my goal. Now you look back and you say, actually, I still make pretty shoes, but for many more women. Yeah, absolutely. Do you think you would have been so successful without the red soul? I think the red soul definitely, of course, participates to my work, but also to the fame of my shoes because it's instantly recognizable. But then, you know, the design is very important. But definitely, when you have such a strong sign of recognition, it participates to... Imagine simply climbing a cable into space. The concept is known as the space elevator. Not only could it significantly change how we leave planet Earth, but it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space. And there are scientists who think we could have already built it. We have the material, we have the technology, we have the lasers, we have the climbers, we have all of it. If a private entity wants to build it or a government, they can build it. It'll change society. We have no clue how colonizing in the space, how really spreading on the space, really change our society over the next 50 to 200 years. It'll be completely different. The No one covers the world like Bloomberg. The pressure cooker just got far too hot in Birmingham for the government to handle. You foresee two-thirds of the crypto hedge funds will disappear. Are we close? The European Union will support and defend Ukraine's territorial integrity. Each and resources. From more than 120 countries. The moment news breaks, 24 hours a day, Bloomberg, your global business authority. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative, like just be honest. We've had sort of a shift in our way in some sort of sidelation fears moment. moment. People were talking about that all day yesterday. Welcome to the Earthshot Prize Innovation Summit. I'm Francing Lackoy here at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. This event powered by Bloomberg featured finalists selected by the Earthshot Council. Larns by Prince William, a shot is a global initiative that drives innovation on solutions to climate change and environmental issues in the following categories. Protect and restore nature. Clean our air, revive our oceans, build our waste-free world, fix our climates. So over the next half an hour we'll bring you all the highlights from this most important gathering. This is Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5782,2022-10-23 02:02:13
17377," Build a waste-free world, fix our climate. So over the next half an hour, we'll bring you all the highlights from this most important gathering. This is Bloomberg. Protecting the environment was of course close to my grandmother's heart. And I know you should be delighted to hear about this event and the support you're all giving our earth shot finalists. The next generation of environmental pioneers. Together in this room are the people and organizations who will help us to achieve the earth shot mission to repair, restore, and rejuvenate our planet within this current decade. That mission is not simple. Just as President John F. Kennedy so famously said, as he challenged the United States for America to unite behind the goal of putting man on the moon, we choose to do these things not because they are easy but because they are hard. I know that the world is an uncertain place right now that many families and communities across the globe are facing unimaginable challenges. From conflicts to energy crisis and food shortages. While addressing these in the short term, we must also remain resolutely focused on tackling the greatest challenges that threaten our tomorrow. Because if we don't, the changing climate will only serve to entrench these immediate challenges into fundamental global issues. So fairly impacting the lives of each and every one of us. That is why our collective mission is so urgent. But there is huge reason to be optimistic. The 2021 cohort of earth shot winners and fineness is evidence that we can succeed. That we can protect our world for our children, our grandchildren, and the generations that will follow them. These pioneers exemplify the leadership needed in this decade of change. They include inspiring activists, brilliant innovators, a forward-thinking city, and even an entire country making a real difference. But they cannot do it alone. This must be a team effort. We must come together behind their innovative solutions to ensure they reach their full potential with peace and scale. While my message today is one of gratitude and encouragement, I also acknowledge that you cannot succeed in isolation. As governments, we have a responsibility to create the incentives and the space for you to flourish. A receptive environment for change and the accountability that comes with guardianship. In many nations, the foundation for this approach has been flayed for us long ago if we choose to listen. Where I come from, I'll tear down New Zealand, a beautiful place you must visit. Our indigenous people hold a world view that every single living and non-living thing is connected. Our people, our plants, our animals, descendants of Rangamui the Sky Father and Papa Tuanuku, the Earth's Mother and their children. And so it follows that people and nature are kin, are family. And we must care for one another in the spirit of Kaitiaki Tanga, which translates into guardianship by the people of the land for the next generation. In short, koha ho te taiau, koh te taiau, koha ho, i am the environment. And the environment is me. Our life source, our economy, our future. Now, I've seen this in action first hand many times, not least in my own backyard, the Pacific, where the ocean is a source of protein, income, culture, and connection. Now that it is a source of challenge, as it rises up and begins to inundate small island nations, it can be confronting to hear and see the stories of just how real these challenges are. But none of us are here because we have given up. But because we believe there is a way to change the future. We are not only part of the nature, but we are nature. Nature is living element. For indigenous people, nature is whole. Our planet is alive. The rivers are her blood. The trees are her hair. The soil, her skin. The wind, her breeze. And indigenous peoples, our planet, they know, they are the doctor.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5783,2022-10-23 02:06:25
17378," Well, her skin, the wind, her breeze, and indigenous peoples, our planet, they know, they are the doctor. We are protecting 80% of the world's biodiversity because our way of life do not harm nature at the opposite. We are strengthening ecosystems. We improve biodiversity by cooperating with the birds and trees, listening to the winds, observing the cloud, learning from even the little insect. We protect nature by setting up our own limits. We don't take more that mother earth can give and we give back. We protect the sacred trees. We don't destroy the field of the medicinal plants. We choose, pre-susely, the animal that we can kill to just the kick the ballast of the ecosystem. As all of us know in this fight, no one can afford to sit on the sidelines. No one can claim that climate change is somebody else's problem or to forget of for future generations to address. We're all affected by a warming planet. We see that every day. And decisions being made right now will determine our shared tomorrow. So we must choose and we must act as united nations ourselves. Our progress depends on collective action, on collective ingenuity. If we stick together, we can make fixing the climate the greatest project and greatest achievement of our lifetimes. We have the science. We have the solutions. Now all the world needs is political will. Together we can create a future where rampant carbon is removed from the atmosphere, where green buildings and green business transform the legibility of communities, where easy access to renewable energy enables greater equity, where sustainable agriculture feeds a growing global population. The needs are urgent, and the costs of inaction are worse than any nightmare. But let us not be driven by hope, not fear, by optimism, not despair. Because hope is not passive. Hope is the ultimate source of renewable energy, pushing us forward every day to try and try again. Today, the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit in partnership with Mike Bloomberg and Bloomberg Philanthropies will ask each and every one of us what we can do to accelerate progress to repair our planet this decade. And offer solutions on how to collaborate to drive this ambitious but essential climate agenda. We will continue to drive impact around system-changing climate solutions and amplify the Earth Shop Prizes call to accelerate progress to repair our planet through collaboration and innovation. But most importantly, we will remind ourselves what can be achieved when we turn pessimism to optimism and optimism into action. Coming up, more from the panelists and finalists here at the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit, this is Bloomberg. We make it very transparent to the shopper before they accept an order, what the order is going to look like, how much work on the pays them, and how much like the consumer is paying them. And so they can decide whether they take an order or whether they refuse it. And that's the kind of flexibility that our shoppers really value and the kind of transparency that they want. Are you seeing a labor shortage right now? And what are you doing to combat that? It's different in different places. All demographic of shoppers is completely different from food delivery and our right sharing, where 70% women and half of them are moms. And that's because a lot of the job at Instacart is very different than just being in a car with strangers. It's about like going to the store, doing a good job of customer service of really picking the right...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5784,2022-10-23 02:10:42
17379," One of the job at Instacart is very different and just being in a car with strangers. It's about like going to the store, doing a good job of customer service, of really picking the right products for the consumer. And we are seeing that being very appealing to women. Welcome back to the best of the earth's shop prize innovation summit. The guests featured ranged from heads of state to leaders of grassroots environmental organizations. Well amongst them was philanthropist and Microsoft founder Bill Gates. Yeah it's too bad you can't do things overnight in either mitigation adaptation. When I last went through Europe people were the leaders were all saying hey give me technologies so I can tell Putin to get lost and I said hey in five years you're going to be able to call him up. They were like no we'd like it now. It's a year now. Okay that how's your planning permission regime and all the you know planning for that future grid seeds typically between the timing start and they get out in the farmers fields is about eight years. Now we have a pipeline of innovations. We've been funding the CG system for 20 years now. It's funded about a billion year. People care at all about adaptation. That thing will be funded at two billion a year. I mean there won't be anything close to the impact of climate related seeds, climate related maze, rice, wheat, sort of a millet. We think goodness because of human genetics we know how to do the editing. Thing goodness because of AI we know how to find the alleles because of drones we can measure stuff in the field. So there's huge advance in terms of how the whole seed ecosystem moves at full speed. The timing is very tricky here. The warming doesn't stop the day you get to zero emissions. There's a leg in this system it's about a 20 year leg. So you haven't seen that earth temperatures not equilibrated to the atmospheric CO2 content. So when you get to zero that's not like 2051 take my air conditioner away. No it starts quite a bit later. So you have to look at what the peak is and you can't just plan for okay 2030 2030's where your main production in central Africa is down 25%. By 2050 it's down 70% and you will have switched in most of those areas from a fairly heat sensitive crop to sorghum. Now sorghum productivity is super low so we'll get people to do better maze for these next 15 years and then they are going to have to switch to sorghum. It is tough when you see the floods in Pakistan I mean nobody expected that. But if the goal of climate was to make us pay attention wow that is way beyond expectation. So some adaptation money literally will just be disafter recovery money. The boundary of what's what is also pretty confusing. I mean what is food aid? If climate is causing some food production losses all world food program money is that all climate adaptation money? And certainly the need for it's going up that's a system that's about.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5785,2022-10-23 02:15:00
17380," All World Proof Program money is that all climate adaptation money? It's certainly the need for it's going up. That's a system that's about 6.5 billion a year. So relative to the systemic solution, which is the research piece, it's relatively larger. But the demand for that piece, which is the acute half of Pakistani rice got flushed away. And so you're going to have malnutrition problems if you don't go in for that. That's also a type of adaptation. And so I do think we're going to bring some rigor to this because the pressure now, the goal of doubling the adaptation money from, they say, 20 billion here to 40 billion here. The pressure on that is the pro- We still peanuts. No, it's very small. I mean, literally, yeah, if you start sticking food aid in there, you can use it up very quickly, rebuilding after hurricanes. I mean, we had hurricanes before, but the costs there are absolutely gigantic. There are ways of stopping wildfires. There are ways of dealing with sea level rise. So the innovation agenda, not just on seeds, the innovation agenda is going full speed on mitigation. That's where there's 100 companies break through energy's funded. And by mitigation, you mean mostly energy. Everything to do with energy. You mean generation of energy, you mean batteries, you mean transport, you mean all of the new, and there's some renewables that are already traditional, but more that need to come on. So that's the package that you're talking about mitigation. Yeah. Why are you also talking about agriculture as mitigation? Yeah, so every area of emissions, the world tends to focus on passenger cars and electricity. That's not a third of emissions. And so the focus on the easiest third, now 4% of new cars are electric. So that's the field that we're further still long. About 4% of energy generation is wind and solar. And as you triple the size of your grid, you want that to be say, some people would say 100%. Other people might say 70% to 80%. The amount you have to build, we're not within a factor of 5 of the build rate of those. But those are the easy sectors. Sement, clean cement costs over twice as much as the way we make cement today. And it's partly the heating energy. It's partly the basic thing, remember in chemistry, when you take calcium carbonate and heat it, you get calcium. That's what makes cement. But the thing that goes away, that's CO2. And so we have to have a way of making cement, which a number of these innovative. And a steel and iron. Yep. There's a whole family of hard to obeyed sectors. That's true. If you get a dead industrial sector, if you get green hydrogen that's cheap enough, it actually solves quite a large number of those. Some of the industrial processes should go straight to electricity. And some you go through, you do your reduction using the hydrogen, where you would have used some hydrocarbon concept before. For steel, we actually have companies doing both. We have electric steel and others doing electricity as the way of replacing the blast furnace. And then we have others that take hydrogen. And if you get the hydrogen cheap enough, you get the super magic thing, which is that the green product doesn't cost more. That's called a green premium equals zero. And then your adoption scale is utterly different. If we tried to subsidize steel and cement, say rich countries say, OK, we want to get rid of that, which those two are 15% of emissions, that's greater than all foreign aid budgets put together. So over 200 billion foreign aid never will pass that number. It's just not politically possible. It's a number that's at about 170 and going down today. Coming up.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5786,2022-10-23 02:19:26
17381," That number, it's just not politically possible. It's a number that's at about 170 and going down today. Coming up, but more from the panelists and finalists here at the Earth's Shop Prize Innovation side. This is Bloomberg. Back in 1997, I was interested in the following question, which is, there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called Saurapod dinosaurs, which had really long skinny necks. So Apatosaurus is an example. It was a really long skinny tail. So I made a computer model that showed that in fact the tail of these Saurapod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip, a bullfip. Now the way a bullfip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. And that crack is a sonic boom. I think the way they got a date was to impress the females by making loud booms. Markets are preparing to close, but the day is not over yet. Talk that is now up about 45%. A lot of volatility, right now. You need the power of the Bloomberg terminal to get you market moving data before anyone else. You need top analysts to bring you exclusive global insight into cross-asset markets. The meaning of market is a really big focus. Bitcoin ain't crying along today. It's going to be short term. Bloomberg markets that close weekdays on Bloomberg. Welcome back to the earth shop prize innovation summit. Finalists of the annual award appeared alongside special guests, including worldwide business leaders, philanthropists and non-governmental activists. Now while the 2022 finalists have been announced, our panelists have their eyes on the future and here's what they have to say. This is the earth shop decade. We are in a race to repair and regenerate the planet. Some will focus on policy, some will focus on activism. We are focused on supporting the game changes, the innovators, the entrepreneurs and the problem solvers. We believe in the power of human ingenuity, grit and determination to create solutions that if scaled could repair the planet. We have only 8% of the ocean protected today. Our earth shot is 30% of the ocean at least. We know that if we protect the right 30%, not only will we prevent the extinction of many marine species, but also we will produce more fish. We will have more fish to eat, food security, livelihoods for people. We know that for every dollar that we invest in a protected area in a marine reserve, that produces 10 dollars in economy output and creates more jobs. It is a triple win for marine life, for food security and for climate and of course for the economy. That is the goal, the mission to in the next 8 years. In the next 8 years, we need to quadruple all the ocean protection that has ever happened in human history. Are you optimistic that can be done? I am optimistic there is no choice. I have seen firsthand the potential that a breakthrough idea can hold and if we start seeing more of these transformative solutions across all the challenges facing our planet and suddenly our earth shot won't seem so improbable. The work will be difficult, it will take extraordinary resources, determination, partnership. But we have all the essentials right here in this room.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5787,2022-10-23 02:23:39
17382," Well, it'll take extraordinary resources, determination, partnership. But we've got all the essentials right here in this room. So what is the challenge? It's the speed, scale, and cost of making these green hydrogen generators. Well, that's exactly what we are working on. Because to make green hydrogen the fuel source of the future, it needs to be cheaper than fossil fuels. And that means, electrolyzers are going to need to be really, really cheap. If you want to take a solution around the globe as quickly as possible, you need to make it standardized, mass-produced commodity. A product that is easy to make and quick to build and cheap as well. And so while some believe electrolyzers need to be large machines, we believe the electrolyzer should be a standardized, mass-producible product that can make green hydrogen anywhere for anyone. In 2030, we imagine millions and millions of projects on restore. And not just places on earth where we see nature being brought back, but all of the other nodes that are key to ensuring success. So the technology providers, the nurseries, the seed banks, the funders, the government incentive programs, so that we have an ecosystem that really allows us to leverage the many, many connections within the nature-based solution space. And in 2030, we have been focused on another key area, which is cities. And cities require data and insights to take action on climate and to preserve nature, to create more nature and tree canopy. So we've set a goal that we want to create more nature in cities, exactly, exactly, right. So we've been partnering with cities like Los Angeles to give them insights utilizing AI and geo-mapping on where all the places that you can create more tree canopy, which reduces urban heat islands, improves air quality sequesters carbon. So we want to bring data and solutions to bringing nature into cities as well as, of course, preserving and restoring nature. And so one of the goals that we've set is we want to enable over 500 cities around the world. I know we're going to hear from the mayor of Paris after this to reduce a gigaton of carbon emissions by 2030. And so that's through data, tools, and sites, whether that's evolving transportation systems or planting new tree canopy. So that's a big bold target that we want to see achieve by 2030. Anyway, I guess I'm in the wrong place. I came here to invite all of you to the Grouch Convention. But it turns out you're all about my least favorite thing, helping. Oh. You've got me, Oscar. I do like helping people learn how to reuse repurpose and recycle. Together, everyone in this room can build a world where nothing goes to waste. And that includes even you. Me? Sorry, Mike. I got to get going to that convention. But just between us, I do have a recycling bin right next to my can. But no, I think it out OK. It'll ruin my image. But my father believed in the power of the idea. And over time, the vision, the purpose, the courage, it embodied has inspired each generation to take on its own challenges, not because they're easy, but because they're hard. President Kennedy understood that the effort to land on the moon would bring out the best in us that everyone would have to contribute, that it would require innovation, creativity, teamwork, commitment, and faith. And that world would be better because of it. The Earth Shot Prize has inspired the same spirit of optimism and ingenuity on a global scale to tackle the most pressing challenge we now face, repairing the planet. My family and I are so excited that the Prince of Wales will honor this year's Earth Shot Prize winners in partnership with the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, a city that is committed to scientific excellence, environmental justice, and the fight against climate change. We're proud that President Kennedy's moonshot legacy",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5788,2022-10-23 02:28:05
17383," committed to scientific excellence, environmental justice, and the fight against climate change. We're proud that President Kennedy's moonshot legacy still inspires hope, and we look forward to welcoming all of you who are working to ensure a better future here on Earth. And that's all from the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit. You can find complete coverage of the event, including full interviews and articles on bloomberg.com. I'm Françie Lacwap from New York, and this is Bloomberg. We don't have enough women founder CEOs who are getting funding, so basically less than 2% of VC funds go to women, less than 1% go to women of color. And so in this innovation space, I said to myself, what's the best way to use capital to move things for women? And that's when I started to say, okay, I actually need to move some money into the venture capital space, and I want to do it smartly. I mean, the first goal is to make money. I'm not putting my money out as a social impact. I'm putting it out to make money. But I wanted to go behind funds like aspect ventures that's run by Theresa Gaou and Jennifer Fondstadt, who are looking at these opportunities, and they have a thesis around my gosh. There are so many opportunities there if we go towards funding some of these women businesses. Some LPs have said to me, all we care about is returns. Some of the best investors may not be the best people, but they have the best returns. What do you have to say to those people? I have to say you're investing in what you know. And so you need to look at what trends are coming in the nation and how you're going to dress them. Women are 85% of consumer dollars spent. Women control 70% of financial decisions in the house. So if you're not investing in products that go towards females or a women led company, you're missing an opportunity because you just don't see it.

Australia Central Bank raises interest rates twice as much as forecast. Then surveillance for in-depth analysis. Outside some keen and Lisa Brownbottes, I'm Jonathan Fero, the NBA, Fronts and Sensor. How does Japan get away with not raising rates? Can it sustain its normal at a time when everybody else is facing a very different way? Bloomberg surveillance, be informed, be prepared, be ahead of the game. There's an old saying in finance that cash is king. But when it comes to payments, the debt is suggests that's no longer exactly the case. According to the latest world pay report, cash now figures in less than 20% of in-person transactions around the world. The payments tend to be different from the beginning, because it's really focused on getting people to use electronic forms of payment. In fact, if you look at the US, for example, you basically have been moving around 2-3% of payments from cash and check to some form of direct electronic, just about every single year. Total card volumes extra in it today are $20 trillion, and there's another $14 trillion worth of cash and check left to digitize. Even at 80% level, card penetration is growing.

17384," Moving towards a cashless society. A new technology is promised to kick these trends into a higher gear. The terminal on the till of the merchant. Now, depending on how old one is, one is used to that, at least in the developed world. But that is not everywhere. But everyone has a phone. So electronic payments can end up in a super simple way in everybody's hands. And for our business, that's a massive growth opportunity. Mastercard is already seizing that opportunity. After dipping in 2020, revenues shot past pre-pandemic levels in 2021, driven by a rebound to consumer spending. CFO Sachin Mehera knows this boom is likely to fade. And he's set on finding ways to keep the momentum going. The key to being successful in this kind of an environment is to have a diversified portfolio. You've got to be nimble from an expense standpoint. You've got to be very disciplined. As a finance officer, what I've got to do with, I've got to make sure that we are investing in those resources, which are currently in demand from a customer standpoint. But at the same time, I'm not losing sight of the long term. CEO Michael Meebak, Counts on Mehera, do more than just oversee the balance sheet. The top line for me is, um, advisor and confident. You're a conciliary. Yes, he's quite happy pushing back and saying vice versa. The role of the chief financial officer has actually changed fairly dramatically over this 20 plus year tenure that I've had. You know, in the past, it was more of a function of, you know, let's make sure the numbers are good, let's make sure we get a great control environment, let's make sure we're actually able to close the books on time, let's make sure we've got all the financial elements of the business in order. The job of the CFO in our view, in my view, is a function of making sure we're creating the right linkage between what the purpose of the business is, what the strategy of the business is, and delivering on the financial returns for the company, all while driving long term shareholder value. We're in the business of leading beyond the numbers. It's great that we know what the numbers are, how do we use those numbers to better drive execution of the business, to accomplishment of the strategy of the company. MasterCards core business is no surprise, cards. Carded products currently account for over half the company's revenue. The company said ambitious growth targets it is 2021 investor day, committing to expand this core and to diversify beyond it. We've been on our six year strategy to be a multi rail company in plain English that means whichever way you pay people enabled that. Despite the fact that card is in our name, it's essentially any type of payment. We have the reach, so I think we're reasonably well positioned. You've just got to recognize not only where the consumer is today, but where they're going to go because a lot of what we've got to do takes time to implement. And is it difficult? You'll get it right sometimes, you'll get it wrong sometimes, but hopefully you're getting it right more often than you can. You're wrong and you're working your way through that. Forecasting preferences is complicated by an uncertain economy. Consumer confidence has been plunging to historic lows and recession calls are getting louder. Still, a slowdown isn't likely to cause a crisis for MasterCard and its peers. Contrary to what people often perceive, I think payment as an industry will be quite resilient in a downturn. Generally speaking, even during a recession, the amount that consumers spend actually does not go down. It continues to grow. I think the thing that people are worried about more in the payments industry is kind of how does the mix of spending change? The first thing that typically happens if you're going into a recession environment is people tend to pull back on discretionary categories of spend. They move into the non-discretionary categories of spend. They pivot into food, they pivot into rent, those kinds of payments, which are most important for them to me. But the rails still stay the same. So the rails which run debit and credit are exactly the same. The technology is the same, the distribution models the same. So those areas don't necessarily change by virtue of moving into more of a debit or credit environment. One area that MasterCard has been moving vigorously into is B2B.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5790,2022-10-23 02:36:50
17385," Those areas don't necessarily change by virtue of moving into more of a debit or credit environment. One area that Master Card has been moving vigorously into is B2B payments, a market expected to reach 25 trillion dollars by the end of the decade. We think this tremendous promise in the B2B area, the card business as in the elements of the B2B space which are served by cards are doing well. Are they doing very well? And it's in the small business space and the mid market. It's in the large corporate space. All of them do really well. On the accounts payable site, I would say we're in the built phase. And here we're about building an open loop environment to enable payments on accounts payable rails. Where is the opportunity in that space is different to consumer payments where there is a global standard. The global standard is Master Card. The global standard are card payments because that's been established. That isn't quite established yet in B2B. And I think the more benefits we bring into the payments that are easier than just making a really complicated cross-border payment, I think we will find out way there and we're going to see an explosion of creativity and a lot of other companies coming in and using those rails innovating on top of them. Pursuing new opportunities takes capital. Master Card has spent billions acquiring companies that add capacity and diversifies infrastructure. Acquisitions and partnerships have helped Master Card offer more value-added services to their clients, tapping into a lucrative revenue stream. What we call services, which includes data, insights, consulting, management services, loyalty, and our fraud capabilities, is roughly 35% of the revenues of this company. Wow. Yeah. So it's not insignificant. So oftentimes people think Master Card and think card. Very important, but there's a very different part of Master Card as well. From a balance-cheap perspective, Master Card has maintained a healthy leverage ratio, even as it's put more resources into acquisitions and taken on more debt, given the company a flexibility to continue investing. We don't go in and say, well right now valuations are low and they were a year ago, let's go and buy something. That is an opportunistic approach and doesn't work for us. For me, it always starts, what are we trying to accomplish from a strategy standpoint? What are inherent capabilities we as a company have? What are the gaps in our inherent capabilities to meet that strategy? And then for those gaps, is it best to build by our partner? And then we're out there and we're trying to find the right companies together, and it's going to make sure that we have a clear view on short and long-term synergies and so forth. And then we both talk to shareholders and to investors to explain what we're doing and why we're doing it and why it's good. Shareholders have reason to appreciate Master Card's capital allocation strategy. It's included annual share buybacks, and steadily increased dividends. How do you prioritize the amount of money that you put toward innovation and toward building out different businesses versus share buybacks and dividends? Because Master Card has traditionally had robust program in rewarding shareholders. Right, first call of capital is towards growth of the business. After we have done that, it's about making sure we're being good stewards of capital and returning excess cash to shareholders with a bias towards share buybacks. And then once you start to come to say, I have dealt with my strategic priorities. I either have invested in my organic growth or in acquisitions. Then, excess cash, we will return back. Generally with a preference for buybacks over dividend, because it gives us more flexibility. But that's been a good model for us. It's been working well and it's been well received by the market. Coming up, how the tap has taken Master Card places that the swipe alone could not. What it's really made a difference on has been in terms of how it's driving a shift from cash to electronic forms of payment, particularly on the small ticket items. And later, how Master Card has staked out a place in the volatile universe of cryptocurrencies. In the crypto world, we play the role as an on-gram. This is Bloomberg.

Such and Merra joined MasterCard as group executive and corporate treasure in 2010. Over the next decade he took on several different roles before being appointed Chief Financial Officer in 2019. That's a very different path than the one he started out on. I grew up in India. I went to school there, I went undergrad there, I went to the family business there, it's a textile business which my grandfather started and my dad and my uncle took over and then my brother and I got into and I worked with him for three and a half years then I came here for business school. The moment of truth came on graduation day. My dad got on the phone, he congratulated me, he said well done, he graduated, I'm looking forward to having me back home. My brother was older than I am, went to business school, he went back home and worked with my dad, got on the phone, congratulated me and said so such and what are you gonna do with your life? And I'm going well why are we having this discussion? Dad wants me to come on work with the family business. He's like yep that's what dad wants you to do. What do you want to do? And then it really got me thinking and I said hey give him a chance I'd love to work in finance in the US. Merer took the chance even though it took him six months to land his first job at General Motors where he worked for over a decade. Then it was on to the energy industry at HES Corporation before finding his way to MasterCard. Today my dad couldn't be proud of the fact that you know I chose the path I did. Obviously he misses the fact that we're not there as a family but that's just part of life right. We've already grown in Blossom and Grume. Did he accept it at the beginning? It took him all of 30 minutes to get there. When Merer gets together with his team in the employee cafe at MasterCard's campus it's clear that he's in his element. Well more important, more fun stuff. What's the plan for the weekend? And of course the cafe provides a demonstration of the tap and go technology that's changed the game for payment companies. Can I just get a regular coffee with one coffee? With one please. Yeah. Okay that would be 571. You got it. Alright we're gonna make this work. There we go. I think contactless is a very powerful catalyst for accelerating gas Japan conversion. In the last two years what we have seen in the US is card penetration could road trade and you only has doubled versus what was the average in the prior five years. The pandemic was one of the reasons people didn't want to touch cash. There's a lot of e-commerce purchases. The contactless definitely contributed to the skirt as well. It's made a change. It's really made a difference. What it's really made a difference on has been in terms of how it's driving a shift from cash to electronic forms of payment particularly on the small ticket items which is really really important because at the end of the day our model is as much about converting the dollar value of the spend as it is about the number of transactions we can get over our network and even though it happens to be a two dollar transaction a transaction the transaction on which we make revenue on which we can deliver services and that's really important. Mastercard introduced PayPass its first contactless payment system in 2002 but the technology took some time to gain traction. I would say we first invested in this many many many many years ago the adoption rate on this in the early part even in markets like the UK Canada Australia was fairly slow in the early part. The inflection point of when it really started to hit its right was when it was used in the transit vertical. So what we figured is let's get all the transit systems around the globe enable for contactless technology that will create muscle memory for the consumer who will like the experience in transit and will use it elsewhere. How do you judge the revenue proposition for Mastercard with an innovation like that and the adoption and the pace of it? Look I mean for us we're agnostic as to whether somebody's using the chip technology or the contactless technology or you know using the MagStripe which was the old way of doing business. We own revenues which are quite similar across both of those. The revenue potential and upside.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5792,2022-10-23 02:45:28
17387," or the contactless technology or using the MagStripe, which was the old way of doing business, we own revenues which are quite similar across both of those. The revenue potential and upside for us comes from the fact that now more spend is being done on card-based forms of payment than was being done in the past. So we're converting that cash over to electronic forms of payment, which is where the incremental revenue comes from. If contactless payments is the current revolution, sweeping the payments industry, what's the next one? I think pay with you smile. So, biometrics, I think that's where it's going to go. And I think we've reached that point and people are sick of too many passwords. People are sick of typing in stuff. And there's also too many wallets and other IDs and stuff that is around. So why don't you just, everybody has a smile. So just play with you smile. There you go. How much are you investing in that? How quickly do you see that becoming the next tap and go? Yeah, so look, I think this is going to take a while. These things have an adoption curve, which typically is fairly flat in the early part and then you start to see some levels of steepness. MasterCards next breakthrough may be borne in one of its global tech hubs. The company has opened innovation centers in Australia, India, Europe, Canada, and the United States. These are spaces where we draw in customers, where we draw the local community. We have them in big cities, where the latest technologies and the players are all around us. In New York City, it's in Tech Alley, and everybody in the tech industry is around us. It's a point where people want to work and be attracted to best talent. And we go, and this brings us back to the CFO. We go and look at our vitality index. So how are our revenues looking? What is generated from new products? What do we see? Is there real momentum? Is there real growth? And if you overlay that and link that back to our tech hubs in these regions where we have them, clearly that is what is driving our new solutions. From an investment standpoint, we try and make sure we've got our foot in the door and all of these new and emerging technologies. Because what we don't want to do is play favorites with one versus the other. We want to make sure we're investing just appropriate amounts of money to have skin in the game to know that if this thing is got legs to it, we want to be at the inflection point for them to write out. In your tech hubs, can you act like Bond, James Bond? In one of the Q movies and the laboratories, we walk in and you sort of face off and clear the system and they sort of do this. There are some people who have revolution this company who can do that, not everybody can. And I'm not one of them. I can tell you that. No, that's not me. Coming up, how MasterCard has embraced the brave new world of cryptocurrency with all its ups and downs. So long as we follow our principles, we think we're in really good shape. And Sachin Merra tells me what advice he'd offer a CFO just starting out in the job. I think it's important to stay calm. I think it's important to recognize that change is going to happen. You can't fight change. This is Blumper. Big, expensive cities have a lot going for them. But if you live in one, you've probably noticed that these big, expensive cities keep getting more well-expensive. You could always move away. You might have just started working remotely, so there's really nothing keeping you there. But then again, moving is a hassle. Well, what if someone paid you 10 grand to do it? What if they threw in free office space, a bicycle, or a gym membership? Programs and cities and states around the US are doing exactly that. And they're getting a lot of interest. We've had over 50,000 applications. About 90,000 applications. We've had over 1,800 applicants from all over North America. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them? Or are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns for places looking for an injection of fresh talent? You will put a woman on Mars. You will bring forth global cooling.

17388," At news, you get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer disrupt, before you change the world, Bloomberg. When US jobs numbers are released, Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed and instant expert analysis. Nobody covers jobs day like Bloomberg. Like many of its counterparts in the payments and financial services industry, MasterCard has developed products and partnerships that bring cryptocurrencies into its networks. I think from the payments and payment system perspective, the players and members that make up that ecosystem are really agnostic. To them, crypto is just another occurrence, literally. Just another asset. At this point, the overall revenue contribution is still so small. It's very early. But if I am a hard company, it's better to invest and also lean in and partner with some of these companies. For future revenue growth rate versus kind of sitting on the sidelines. Crypto is a term that encompasses a number of different projects, including central bank digital currencies and private sector stablecoins. Also, digital assets like Bitcoin, whose volatile valuations and susceptibility to fraud, have raised plenty of anxiety among investors. MasterCard's long-term plans to stay in the space haven't wavered. We're not really in the crypto hype of investing around crypto. We like the fundamental technology and the promise that it brings to solve problems that have not been solved. If we see more revenue coming out of B2B solutions, that leverage blockchain technology, for example, tokenized bank deposits. Just to throw out one example. Cross-border payments, whatever it might be. In the crypto world, we play the role as an on-gram. People use MasterCard products to buy crypto or debit and credit products. We want to be on-gram if people want to spend money as in fiat currency to buy crypto and react as the off-ramp. The off-ramp is when people want to be in cash, we help them actually gain access to be able to use their crypto balances everywhere MasterCards accept it. We engage with central banks on central bank digital currencies. We engage with governments on how a policy could look like, how regulation could look like. We engage with the startup community and say, come on in. Let's sit around the table in one of our tech hubs and we discuss what solution actually is needed by whom and how we can bring it together. They have the greatest idea, but the greatest idea needs a path to scale. That's what we can bring. Is there a potential liability because of the volatility, because of how Bitcoin and certain other cryptocurrencies have been painted? Is there any liability for MasterCard? Yes. So long as we follow our principles, we think we're in a really good shape. The principles we care deeply about are stability as in stability of the currency in question. Point number two, it must meet consumer protection requirements. It must meet the laws of the land. This is not new news to us. We've done this in the space for the last 50 years for everything we've been working with regulatory financial institutions on. Which is why when we got into the space, the first thing we did was to find principles and we will keep abiding by those principles and what we do. I feel happy because we're in the discussion. We're shaping the ecosystem and then one day it'll look like what we have done in many other spaces over the past years. Such in Merra is a leader within a company that has the power and reach to shape ecosystems and help me making strategic and financial decisions that shape the business. I wanted to know what he sees when he looks ahead. What's the opportunity for MasterCard in the next 10 years that most excites you? There still remains a very sizable consumer payments opportunity which we stand very well poised to actually capitalize on. This is the trend of the shift from cash to electronic forms of payment. If you think about it globally, there's still a ton of cash which remains to be electrified and that opportunity is huge. The second pillar for me is around we have identified over the past few years a sizable...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5794,2022-10-23 02:54:07
17389," which remains to be electrified and that opportunity is huge. The second pillar for me is around, we have identified over the past few years a sizable total addressable market in what we call new payment flows. Bucket number three is around services. It goes back to our insights, analytics, our fraud management capabilities, and everything we're doing in that space. And then the last piece around new networks, which is around open banking and digital identity. What are some of the challenges for MasterCard over the next 10 years that keep you up at night? It's around staying plugged in on what's going on from a technology innovation standpoint. And making sure we're leading from the front, not turning our back to it and saying, we're going to walk in the other direction. We've got to engage with people who could potentially be disintermediators, competitors to let them know what value we can bring while they're executing on their strategy. So that's number one. Number two is, look, I mean, the world is getting more and more into a regulatory environment where regulators are playing a bigger role. Nationalism is playing a bigger role. It's important for us to continue to do everything we're doing by being deemed local. It's important to be a global company, but be deemed local. And that's going to be important for us to execute on. Because at the end of the day, sitting in my role as the CFO, strategies grade, visions fantastic, but what really matters is, can you really deliver and execute? And we've got to stay focused on execution. And that's what we do every day. What's the biggest change that you see a role having over the next 10 years? I had to do a good question. Honestly, I'm not really in the business of predicting that much as it relates to how it's going to change. What I can see happening is greater emphasis on making sure we're leading from the front on executing, but also failing fast. And that's where a CFO can play a big role. And by that, I mean, you're not always going to win. There are things you're going to do. Hopefully you'll get more right than wrong, but recognizing things which are not working out and making sure you actually fail fast on them and get out of them. Because you can fall in love with stuff, keep doing it, keep wasting resources to only realize that it's not going to pay off. And I think the emphasis around that is going to only increase for that for CFOs in a scarce capital resource environment. What advice would you give a CFO today? I think it's important to stay calm. I think it's important to recognize that change is going to happen. You can't fight change. What really matters is how you can get up and actually deal with that change. That's super important for a CFO. Being really clear and crisp in your communications. The outside world wants to hear in very simple terms what exactly this company stands for and why they should believe that you are a good investment. And notice I've said nothing about financials and I've said nothing about necessarily financial infrastructure and systems because I do believe as a CFO. Those things are table stakes. You've got to make sure that stuff happens. You've got to leverage technology. You've got to drive efficiency in the business. You've got to get the numbers right. You've got to have a good control environment. But what's going to call you apart is the other elements which I spoke about. If MasterCard can meet ambitious goals for growth in its core business and build on strategies that are taking payments to the next level, such in Merrill will deserve a lot of the credit. I'm Lisa Abramowitz. This is Bloomberg. When the price of anything goes up, the consequences reach far beyond what you'd expect. But perhaps most of all, when it comes to food. In 2010, surging food prices help spark the Arab Spring. Lives were lost, regimes fell, and the consequences are still with us. Once again, food prices are rising and fast. Energy costs, broken supply chains, and surging demand were just some of the factors that have driven food prices to their first record high since the Arab Spring. And that's all before a war between two of the world's biggest food producers. Ukraine is called the Bread Basket of Europe. And taken with Russia, the two account for about a quarter of global wheat trade. They produce more than half of the world's sunflower seeds in oil, nearly 20% of the barley.

17390," They produce more than half of the world's sunflower seeds in oil, nearly 20% of the barley. Now throw in rising energy prices and processing, transporting, even refrigerating food gets more expensive. Plus, fertilizer production is extremely energy intensive. Less fertilizer means lower crop yield and prices rise even more. The pandemic revealed how complicated and fragile global trade systems are. Global agriculture, perhaps even more so. Unlike metals, for example, food goes bad. And crops take months to grow and are vulnerable to unpredictabilities like the weather. Rising food prices will be felt everywhere, but the poorest countries in the world will be hit the hardest. And as all these factors compound, the real fear is that record high will lead to record high and ultimately to a global food crisis with vast consequences. It is crucially important and I think we've moved from this attitude, from its intelligence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s, and so it makes it a really exciting field because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harness to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts, but if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what you bring figures out while you're sleeping. I think we'll mark that over the past few weeks has made it clear it wants to go higher.

So before you invent pioneer, disrupt, before you change the world, Bloomberg. Hello! How are you? It's so great to see you. Thank you so much for doing this. What do you think about all this love getting into crypto? I think that I think was more last year. I think it's kind of a way of that past. No, I don't think so, but I think it's like any time that frankly it's when a lot of other people get into crypto. Right? Other audiences too. It's when it's in the news a lot. When does that happen? A lot of times when the prices are going up. She was a federal prosecutor going after gangs and the mob before being handed for next assignment. Taking down Bitcoin.

17391," It's the largest fund ever raised by a single investor. Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, CEO and founder of Han Ventures, Katie Han. Katie, it's so great to have you. Great to be back here in the studio with you, Emily. I want to start with a vibe check. Okay. What state of the crypto cycle are we in right now? It was hot. Yeah. And then it got pretty cold. Well, look, Emily, zooming back because I've been in crypto for a decade, if you can believe it. We've seen crypto be really hot and then all of a sudden not. And so we've seen this before. However, I think one of the things that's a little bit different now is with each new crypto cycle, more and more people come into it. And so it's more and more pronounced each cycle. And I would push back on it's not. I think it depends on what area of the ecosystem you're looking at. We think developers think crypto and Web3 is still really hot. I am seeing a lot less of those. We're all going to make it hashtags. I am seeing a lot less of them too, although I am spending less time on Twitter. So maybe that's why. But with each cycle, there are new acronyms. What hasn't happened is a crypto winter in the midst of kind of really serious global macro conditions. So we have inflation kind of at record highs for our generation, in our lifetime. And then we have also a war that's broken out in the Ukraine. And we have a number of other factors going on here. So that's very different. There was some serious carnage out there. Socius, Luna, three hours. What's been your takeaways from all of that? Yeah, I don't want to sit here and tell you that algorithmic stablecoins are bad. Because I actually think they're really interesting. However, I think what happened is you had, in this case you mentioned Luna and Tara. You know, that was an algorithmic stablecoin that was getting pretty widespread adoption relative to what the tech could do. I didn't realize you spent your teenage years living in Egypt and learning Arabic. Tell me about your upbringing. I was always uprooted. My dad worked for a large company and we were always moving just when I would get comfortable in one space. And I think actually that's pretty important if you fast forward and look at my career. I'm comfortable being in uncomfortable situations. You know, I didn't know a lot about venture when I got into it initially. I didn't know a lot about crypto when I got into it initially. And I was okay asking questions. I was okay not knowing the local acronyms or the Namanclature of a particular field. And I'm, you know, I'm taken right back to my teenage years in Cairo, moving from Houston, Texas one day to downtown Maddie in Cairo the next day. You studied law. I did. You clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. That's right. You became a federal prosecutor. You were taking on prison gangs and the mafia. That must have taken a really thick skin. I was doing it at each 25. And now if I kind of take a step back and you know, I think that happens at different points in your career. Like, whoa, if I would have analyzed that a little more at the time. And I'm kind of in some ways glad I didn't. I just dove right in because I felt fascinating. There was a human aspect to it and people's stories. And I felt like those stories mattered. So I was drawn to criminal law and became a federal prosecutor. And I did cases involving violent crime. But then really mistriing cases, being back in the courtroom, being before the grand jury. Like the prosecutor you would see on TV going to try those murder cases. Doing those two hour closing arguments. That's right. And so moved out here to California. I died at the largest prison gang in the world at the time. Outlaw motorcycle gangs. Hostage taking. Bank robberies. Armed bank robberies. There was really not a kind of criminal case by that point in my career. I hadn't done it. It was right around that time. 2012. One of my bosses came in and said, let's have that same energy that you brought to those gang cases, murder cases, and let's go ahead and have you investigate this new criminal technology that we really need to look into and possibly shut this down. So you created the first cryptocurrency task force? How would you describe it? Fortunately, several of us in the government realized at the time. It's not possible. Also not desirable. Because Bitcoin is not an entity. It's not a person. Right. It's a protocol. And it would be like saying, let's go shut down cash.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5797,2022-10-23 03:07:08
17392," Not possible, also not desirable, because Bitcoin is not an entity, it's not a person, right, it's a protocol. And it would be like saying, let's go shut down cash, let's go shut down the internet. It's not possible, probably wouldn't be a good idea either. I was using crypto and technologies like the Bitcoin blockchain, because that's all that existed then, this is 2012, 2013, to actually uncover criminal activity. So I didn't think that that technology was bad. Frankly, it was a tool that helped me uncover the various activity. And by the way, it was a step level function improvement better than compliance by banks. I'll just go ahead and say it. That's a little bit controversial, but I had spent a decade subpoenaing large financial institutions, and five times out of ten didn't get back what I needed. One case I worked on, and people always say, oh, you shut down the Silk Road. What actually happened? I was looking into something completely, not having to do with anything at all of the Silk Road and came across some, what looked to be some kind of odd activity. And it turns out that a couple of federal agents on the Silk Road Task Force out of Washington DC were cropped. And that is the case that I ended up in Diting, and I ended up prosecuting those agents, and they both went to prison. So that's the aspect of what the Silk Road case that I worked on. I would never, never have been able to uncover that criminal activity by those agents, because they were federal agents, they knew how to cover their tracks, had they not use Bitcoin blockchain. Right? So that technology right there, if they had just used wires or cash or bank wires, we would never have uncovered that. So hard as a telon, crypto fund, or a front scratch. Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world recalibrates. After decades of stagnation, Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation. For giants, policymakers and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that. Every week on Japan ahead, right here on Bloomberg Television. We will never break. We will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never break. Have a wide array of issues and the mountains shake. All of them will remain. We will never, long, we will never, no. So you became kind of a crypto convert after this. You joined the board of coinbase very early on. How did you and coinbase and Brian Armstrong come together? I hosted an event here in San Francisco at the Federal Reserve Bank and believe it was there that it wasn't just Brian, it was a lot of what I'll call legitimate actors and crypto who wanted to usher in this new wave, this new ecosystem. Then we brought together the heads of all kinds of agencies. Really in an effort to kind of talk about building bridges, you know, the government and the crypto industry. We're never going to see eye to eye on a lot of things, but we did think there were some commonalities. Coinbase is a company that has suffered. They've been losing share. The valuation of the public markets has plummeted. Why do you think that is and how do you think it can be fixed? Yeah. Well, I think again a few things it's tied to. One, a large aspect of Coinbase's business now, of course, is trading revenue. And that's down when prices are down. And you know, the company's been very transparent about that long before going public. I mean, also if you look at it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5798,2022-10-23 03:11:23
17393," says business now, of course, is trading revenue. And that's down when prices are down. And the company's been very transparent about that long before going public. I mean, also, if you look at its S1, it specifically identifies that. And just how volatile crypto cycles are. So I think that's part of it. It's judged by public markets as a technology stock or as a financial services company. By the way, I think it's both. I think it's not just a financial services company. I think it's so much more. I think it's really a portal to this whole new ecosystem. You were also on the board of OpenC until recently, there's an insider trading situation or accusation going on there. Coinbase has also had employees accused of insider trading. How much is this happening within crypto companies and within the industry and how big a problem is? Yeah. I think crypto is under the microscope. So where you have a case, two cases, three cases in crypto ecosystem, which now is a trillion dollar industry. I think multi-billion approaching trillion dollar industry, you're always going to be able to find examples like that. So I don't want to make too much out of a handful of cases. That said, the company, Coinbase, OpenC, take these things incredibly seriously. Along with your position at Coinbase, you became a partner at one of the most story venture capital firms in Silicon Valley and the United East and East, in Harowitz. What was your experience at A16Z-like? There I met Chris Dixon and I met Ben Horowitz and I met Mark Andreessen and I had worked with them for just about a year, maybe a little bit over when they asked me to come and co-run their crypto funds at Andreessen Hearts. Again, I jumped at that chance and I think, really, that speaks to the fact that, as I said before, things are a hell yes or there are no and it was a hell yes for me. So Andreessen Horowitz is the kind of place where if you make a partner, you don't leave. Yeah. How did Mark and Ben respond when you said, yeah, why don't you leave to start a crypto fund? Of my own. As you might know, Emily, they're an anchor. They're an anchor check into my fund and I'm very grateful for that. Mark and Chris and folks like them are also personal LPs. So I felt very supported when I shared that decision and I will say that it was not running away from Andreessen Hearts. It was running to another opportunity. And crypto is not, what do they say? It's not a spectator sport or it's like, you're in it. It's excuse very young. It's 24-7, it's global and it's hustle. And at this, and that's a trade off, it's a life trade off. And at this point in my career and in my life, if I was going to continue to make that trade off, I just wanted to do it and do it in a way that was really true to me. So you struck out on your own? Yes. To launch on Ventures, what gave you the courage to do that? What was the spark that lit the fire? Yeah. That got you to say, I need to do this and do this now. Sure. What I set out to do was to continue to invest in this ecosystem that I think is so broad that decision was very purposeful and the timing was very purposeful. We have an early stage fund that does seed stage, series A, even series B. And then we have what we call an acceleration fund, which is not a growth fund. It's a crypto growth fund. And I think those are different things. But it's later stage. It might be crypto-publics. Certain kinds of public tokens were set up to hold tokens and participate in the token ecosystem, or later stage companies. I mean, there are now several crypto, many crypto unicorns. The space has become really competitive. Even though you say, you know, crypto's had its ups and downs. The thing is, a lot of people in some of those last cycles have seen the kind of venture style returns that can be having crypto. And so you've had a lot of new funds enter the space. And that's driven up competition. So what differentiates on ventures then? From all of these other crypto funds, or even the more traditional venture capitalists, like entries in Harowitz or Sequoia, they also have crypto funds now. Well, I think a lot of traditional venture capital funds now have crypto funds. It used to just be like a regulatory designation. It was like, are you an RIA, which is registered investment advisor? I would say for crypto founders today, it's not enough to just be an RIA, right? They, frankly, I don't even know if a lot of them care. That's a regulatory designation. What crypto founders today want to know is, do you live and breathe crypto? Do you inhale the discourse? Are you part of the community? Do you participate in governance? Are you going to be staking these kind of crypto verbs out there? And if you're not really in the s...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5799,2022-10-23 03:15:52
17394," Are you part of the community? Do you participate in governance? Are you going to be staking these kind of crypto verbs out there? And if you're not really in this space full time, I think it's very hard to run a successful crypto fund. We don't have a hedge fund component. So we're not sitting here buying and trading and selling. That's a hedge fund structure. And there are crypto hedge funds. We're not one. We're making seven to ten year bets. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund from scratch? You know, it's hard, but it's not impossible. We don't have a crystal ball. I don't know. I can't predict cycles, but I knew that we were in a cycle where you saw so much for an excitement around the space. And I already talked about what makes this different. But I think one thing also is we are a nimble strike force. We don't fish in the same pond. We have the crypto natives. We have a fish and execution. We have operators, seasoned operators who really know how to stick the landing. And I think that's reflected on our culture. I would say the only thing that's changed in our strategy as a result of the market correction is really more of a focus on early stage, but we still have our late stage fund. And when we see valuations, which I think will still see correct, spoiler. I think we'll continue to see some corrections. And so we might deploy our later stage fund a little bit more slowly. It might not be on an even 50-50 cadence. And that's okay. Long term, our strategy hasn't changed. Long term, we're committed to this space. How much do you think valuations are going to correct? You know, it's just, I can't give you a one-size-fits-all answer because crypto is not a monolith. You have some crypto companies that really follow more of an enterprise-sass business model. You have others that are layer one protocols. You have still others that are consumer-facing applications. And I think one of the things we're seeing right now is the infrastructure layer. And that's where we're spending a lot of our time, by the way. And we think more and more use cases will come about when the infrastructure layers in place. So my own view is we are not rushing to deploy. We're certainly not getting caught up. You do get VC FOMO and having to avoid that. You know, look, I think it's very easy to get into that mindset, right? It's because it's a competitive sport. It's a competitive space. And I think I'd be lying if I said that that doesn't influence anyone. I try to, what I do, and I think I do differently, is I try to take stock of that. Oh, that's the FOMO mentality kicking in. That's bad. Again, you don't want to over-correct, though. What we look for is we look for amazing founders. It doesn't matter if I think valuations will correct if they're amazing founders. There's a huge tam. We also look for what's your regulatory plan? If you're launching a token, what's your plan to comply with the law? What's your plan for security, by the way? We've seen a lot of hacks in the space. We want to really dive in there and make sure that the founders have been thoughtful about, especially if they're cost-eating customer funds, keeping those funds secure. If it's a cross-chain bridge, what are the exploits? Have you changed your strategy at all, given the downturn? What? Have you backed out of any deals or decided not to do certain deals? Because the conditions have changed since you raised the phone. We have decided not to do certain deals. We've never backed out of a deal. We have decided not to do a few deals because we think that pricing was ahead of progress, candidly. And we might have been wrong about that, Emily. We might have been wrong about that. But I think if we were wrong not to do a couple of deals, better that we might have been right, because if we were wrong about that, I think we can find a way to still invest in those projects later. Well, one thing I'm hearing is that a lot of dry powder has just sacked up. Because all these funds raised a lot of money. Yeah. Raised, what was the biggest fund ever for a single person, not just a woman? Yeah. Anyone? Are you confident you're going to have a place to put all that money? I am, but if I don't have a place to put it, I'm not just going to go willing, nearly deploy it. One of the things that we told our LPs even during the period when we raised our fund, which was when crypto was undeniably still on a bull run, we said that we are going to be pretty steadfast, sticking to a tier deployment cycle. And I think one thing that's changed is that might have lengthened. It certainly hasn't shortened. But we will, again, we feel very good that we have the capital to back great teams when we see them. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind. I mean, we're falling behind. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. The pressure cooker just got far.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5800,2022-10-23 03:20:11
17395," I'm falling behind. And we're falling behind. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. The pressure cooker just got far too hot in banning him for the government to handle. You foresee two-thirds of the crypto hedge funds will disappear. Are we close? The European Union will support and defend Ukraine's territorial integrity. With unmatched reach in resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks, 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, you are global business authority. What about NFTs? Are you concerned about the declining demand? We are going to increasingly live in a digital world. And I happen to think that if you live in a digital world, you're going to want to own digital goods in that world. You're not just going to be satisfied to rent them, which is what we do now. We buy our content from walled gardens without digital scarcity, which is what? NFTs unlock. You don't really own anything. You're subject to the whims of a platform. And I think NFTs and digitally scarce goods fundamentally change that. I think you'll see NFTs back again. But we are spending a lot of time in the infrastructure layer. Like I tell you, zero-knowledge, technology, scalability. We think of that as the plumbing. If you think of the fiber-hubtic cables. Remember, you couldn't have had YouTube and Netflix with dial-up. You couldn't have streamed content. The same is true of crypto use cases. We think that there will be a lot of new use cases unlocked when the infrastructure is there, when it's more efficient, when it's more user-friendly. And so we're spending a lot of our time there. President Biden issues this crypto executive order. There are a number of ports that are coming due. What do you want to see from the administration when it comes to regulation? Are you optimistic that we will get there? Yeah. We were so delighted to see that executive order. It's not something you should normally be delighted about. But why we were is because it was to us a real recognition that this is a US government saying this field isn't going anywhere. This field is growing. It's growing so much that we are going to direct every single agency in the federal government to come up with a plan here. I think we take a step forward. But then you see we're a big government. We're a big system. We have states. We have local entities. So we take a step forward with the EO. And then we take some steps back sometimes too. And I think what I see as crypto founders are confused by that. They're starting to think, well, I could go to this jurisdiction where there's a single regulator. And you don't have 50 states with different rules. It's the US government that needs to start taking stock of the fact that right now, Emily in China, there's a quarter of a billion, ECNY wallets, a quarter of a billion. We're still talking about whether there should be a government central bank digital currency. We're still studying that. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind. And we're falling behind. What are the dangers of falling behind China? And the rest of the world. This is years ahead. So I don't want people to take a headline and say, oh, I think the US dollar will be no longer the global currency. Reserve global currency. I'm not saying that now. But fast forward decades. And if you no longer need to use the dollar because you have an alternative, I think that's a real problem. What would we use instead? Well, I think that there are going to be stable coins out there that people who have access to a smartphone will use. There is a demand for it. We see 285% year over your growth with stable coins. So people are clearly liking the idea of this. Now, again, there have been some spectacular failures too. But not all stable coins are created the same. But I think the important thing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5801,2022-10-23 03:24:26
17396," People are clearly liking the idea of this. Now, again, there have been some spectacular failures too, but not all stable coins are created the same. But I think the important thing is that we really do need to not just quash innovation. What do you think of how Gary Gensler, the chair of the SEC, and how he's approaching it? One of the things that I hear from founders is that they're very confused because they get told, come in, register, just come in and talk to us. But you have the one company who's done the ultimate act of going in and registering. Coinbase, filed an S1. And still, there's a lot of saber rattling still going on, I think. And again, I don't want to single out the SEC. And I don't want to suggest that anything they're doing is bad. I do think that right now there's a lot of confusion. And one of the pieces of confusion stems from the fact that it started with the ICO mania back in 2016, 2017, I can't remember which year now, where the SEC was very loud about securities. A lot of them were securities. But the space has changed. And so to still view it through the ICO lens, when so much has happened over the last five years in the space, I think is a mistake. What do you have to say to the skeptics out there who just don't believe in the future of one three? And don't see where this is going. I would say don't judge the current state of innovation by the end state of innovation. I hear from a lot of these skeptics. And by the way, I'm friends with a lot of these skeptics, too. I don't only want to live in a crypto bubble. They want to see the use cases, especially if they're not technical. Well, when am I going to use it? What will I use it for? And I think one of the things that's not appreciated is how quickly the infrastructure here is catching up. And once you have really scalable blockchains that can handle a lot of throughput and are very efficient, I think that unlocks a whole lot of use cases. People are spending more time on screens. That curve is up and to the right. Whether we like it or not, that is the future. I mean, those who have kids know that kids spend more time online. They want digital things, too. And I think to dismiss it, it is a bit generational. I do find not always, but it is a bit generational. If you talk to kids about being able to have money online, they instantly get that concept. They're comfortable not having to hold something in their hand to think it has value. Take us to the end state. Do Google and Amazon and Facebook and Apple still exist? I believe they will still exist. I mean, it depends what you talk about when you talk about the end state. I think that for decades, those companies will still be around. But the important thing is I think this new ecosystem is going to represent a challenge to them. I do think that those entities, decentralized forces are coming and we'll cut into those entities, profits, and revenues. So we have a little rapid fire section. If you could belong to any altcoin tribe, the 20p. Gosh. There is no way I'm answering that, because I will get trolls on Twitter by every other altcoin tribe. I'm a crypto-maximalist.

When I'm on the football field, I'm in between those white lines. My job is to piss everybody off. And so if I don't do that, I'm not doing my job. At six foot four inches and more than 300 pounds, Dominik Kansu has done his job in the NFL for 12 years now. Sometimes, maybe too well. You got frozen feet and didn't realize you were stepping on my calf. You also stopped doing one of my teammates at one point. He's been, you know, at my time one of the most dominant three techniques in the game. And I understand not everybody is going to like me, and that's OK. But I guarantee the people that don't like me don't know who I am. And have me taken the time to get to know me. After spending a few days with the Dominik in here in the rainy city of Portland, I've gotten an insight into a soft, spoken native Portlandian, family man, restaurant, tour, and real estate investor who's endeavoring to have more impact with his businesses than he's had against quarterbacks in the NFL. It's a simple concept of like, I don't want to be at the top of the pyramid or be amongst the 1% and be there by myself. I want to bring other people with me that are like mine, didn't want to work with them. And when you have the opportunity to help other people at the same time, it's a smart business decision.

And the car is full throttle right into it, right away. For someone who is so single-minded on the field, seeing Sue in his native habitat, it's a bit startling, and not just because he's a dad. From his home office bouncing from zooms to calls to texts, he's methodically creating an empire. It includes investments in tech companies like Quip and Ember and hospitality investments, including restaurants in Portland and beyond. But the primary focus for Sue has been real estate. Over the past decade, much of his investments have been focused on multi-family and commercial projects. So tell me your business philosophy like in a nutshell. Like, how do you distill it down? Just understanding that, investing and social impact can go without question-hand-hand. And I think you can impact other people's lives and do good. But at the same time, make smart business decisions where it's I've always seen it as a true give-and-take relationship versus just someone always taking. And I think that's where that capitalistic mindset, that majority of America lives in. Yeah, and this guy. It's a short trip from where we're sitting to see where Sue came from. His home in the offseason is here in the Irvington District of Portland. And his house is only a few streets away from where he grew up. This hoop's been here for ages. Oh my gosh. And the family that own this house, their son actually played the NBA. There used to be at the far end, we called it our little hood, where we'd have our main death contest. What was Portland like when you were growing up, I mean now it's seen as this like boom town, right? But was it like that 20 years ago? No, Portland was very, very small. Everybody knew everybody pretty much. Growing up in Portland, Sue was surrounded by sports. Nike's headquarters was just 20 minutes away, and he still works out there when he's home. His older sister in Goom Sue also became an elite athlete. She'd end up going to the 2004 Olympics as a soccer player, playing for their father's home country of Kimmeroo. Often times in a family, especially when you have multiple superstars, it's clear that like this family's in the business of growing superstar athlete. My parents could care less about it. They wanted us to be in athletics and have that fulfillment of being in sports, but hands down education was a number one. And my sister's super smart. She got a degree in kinesiology and biological sciences. Sue's parents divorced when he was two, but stayed close. His mom was an elementary school teacher and his dad owned an HVAC company. As a young kid, I enjoyed going to work with him. I got to spend a lot of time with my dad on job sites. And it's really what got me into the business. As I got a little bit older towards middle school, it would be me going to the job site and being out and say, you can earn $5, $10 towards your bike. He just wanted to see if I'd be willing to get up at 6 o'clock in the morning. This is my dad's house that we grew up in. We bought the building, lived on one side and rented the other side. And that's where we really started to learn about real estate, or how I started to learn about real estate. From those early days, Sue's fascination with an ambition in real estate only grew. Especially as a pro football career gave him the means to iBigger and Bigger projects. He's been buying and building property in his hometown of Portland as well as across the United States, including luxury residential, office and hospitality space, and affordable housing. All with the mission to help build generational wealth through real estate. And real estate is one of the most tried and true places to store and grow wealth. Buying and owning property, commercial or residential, when done right can be a source of income as well as a crew value over time. That's if you choose projects wisely and have patience. Over the past few years, the pandemic both increased demand and lowered the supply of housing leading to skyrocketing values. At the same time, low interest rates made acquiring the capital needed to purchase properties even easier. More recently though, rising mortgage rates and new supply have begun to change that picture. And rents have been...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5804,2022-10-23 03:37:27
17399," The capital needed to purchase properties even easier. More recently though, rising mortgage rates and new supply have begun to change that picture and rents have been increasing at historic levels. Owning real estate has the additional benefit of influencing maybe even transforming the neighborhood and the community around you. That's an idea passed down to Sue from his father. Hey! He assembled a handful of different lots and projects and this is one of them that has been, I won't say a unicorn, but it's been very, very profitable. If you look at the building, you have the exterior. So we gutted everything inside and kept the exterior facade and then built on top of that. It was originally a chop shop when we first took over. People at night when I was growing up in the 90s and early 2000s would not walk up and down these streets by any means. You see it's live, you got great restaurants up and down, coffee shops further down. You got everybody probably knows assault and straw. They're right up the street. There's no way they would be here back in the 90s. So my dad had a great vision and focus for seeing where the city was moving. Out of these investing in real estate properties in order to renovate them, isn't that remarkable at its face. What separates Sue is his fluency and the details of the business. He learned that on the job of his dad as well as in the classroom. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today won't electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building to crowds America burn fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels. We want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Choose one struggling advantage. If you just want to have the goal of applejack and previous source of energy then it's normal at a time when everybody else is facing a very different way.

17400," But his play on the field allowed him to meet and maintain relationships with future mentors in his business career, including the Oracle of Omaha himself Warren Buffett. I loved the Wall Street Journal story last year. They called you a secret finance nerd. Let's talk a little bit about that because... Yeah, you're not something. Ever since then, we've been close friends, confident, and really a true mentor, being able to bounce a bunch of different ideas off, and then also understand how he envisions the world. Although he's not fully into real estate, and he's changed a little bit because he now has brick-try halfway homes, you whatnot. That long-term vision and that being able to buy and hold is one of the greatest things ever that I learned from him. Sue also met with one of the most interesting people who has split time between the locker room and the boardroom, Joe Moglia. Moglia's career began in the coaching world, but he would rise through the ranks to lead TD Ameritrade as CEO from 2001 to 2008, and chairman from 2008 to 2020, navigating the company through the global financial crisis and its aftermath, as well as its eventual combination with Schwab. He was around my entire senior year, and one day I just asked him, like, you always leave every Friday before our games and come back Saturdays ready to go. Where do you go? It's always like a black car going out. It's like I go to New York, I take care of business with TD Ameritrade, I'm the chairman there, and then I come back and obviously have my role here with you guys, and I was like, well, that's pretty interesting. I'd love to learn more, and so he said, well, make sure you follow up with me after the season. All right, so I asked him this exact same question. Check out what Joe had to say. So our first step, our first step is going to be, I want you to come down to my office. The season was over, and I want to see the budget that you would put together. So he comes down, it's about a month later, and I got to tell you, I was impressed. He comes into my office with a suit on, tie on, he looked great, and we sat down, he showed me his budget. The budget was about $60,000. Now, now we've talked about that a little bit, two or three months. He was going to get a pretty significant contract, and he was going to make a shitload of money, and $60,000 budget with regards to all the different things that people is going to be interacting with, is probably not going to quite work out. Yeah, that's exactly right. He's like, man, you're going to be spending anywhere from $20,000, $30,000 a month, and I was like, there's no way I'm in college right now. My rent's like $1,500. Yeah, I didn't imagine ever getting there. Along the hole I'm there. There was, of course, one other pivotal person he'd meet in cultivated relationship with during his college days, his future wife, Kaccia. I have only been a champion. It is beautiful. Lady in my life. We met all the way back in 2009. I was a women's basketball player, and he was a football player. And the best way that I like to explain it is he ran after me a lot, and would always try to kind of say he's going to break my ankles, or what do we play one-on-one, and I was like, hi, who are you? And so after some time, I finally gave him a little chance, and I got to know him, and truly he became my best friend. The two have had a whirlwind past few years. They moved in together in 2018, were engaged in 2019, and had their then traditional zoom wedding back in 2020. In February of 2021, Endowment could win his first Super Bowl with a Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and just a few months later, the two would welcome their twin sons, Kari and Kingston. When the two aren't changing diapers or doing the latest TikTok trend, they're business partners, working together out of the same home office for much of the off season. We really both listen to each other's calls. We kind of have what's going on in the mornings after workouts, and when the boys are doing breakfast, we'll be like, what's your plan for today? How many calls do you have? When are your calls? Are the ones that I can listen in on? Are the ones that he's like, you know what? I want to be a part of that. I want to participate or just listen in. The two also work together on the Sue Family Foundation, the charitable arm of Sue's business ventures that focuses on empowering people with resources for long term success.

So before you invent pioneer, disrupt, before you change the world, Bloomberg. What is Sue's restaurant investments is here in downtown Portland. A fast-casual restaurant called Bees Fry Chicken, he started with a previously successful Portland-based restaurant tour named Mike at Camden. To understand it, I ordered a chicken sandwich for myself for journalism. Tell me about where we are. We are in downtown Portland. This building was built in 1882, so that's an old building. You don't get much older than that in Portland. We got the fry chicken sandwich, we got the chicken strips. It's easy, it's approachable, it's super great quality. And we opened this up, we went straight to organic on all the chicken, which was awesome. It was very, very juicy, so be careful. But good food and a good location aren't guarantees of success in the restaurant world. Restaurants are tricky businesses for athletes, seemingly easy to understand, but complex to conceive, operate and market. Actually, they're hard businesses for anyone, even food pros. While Micah himself has had successful ventures with restaurants like Boxer Ramen, Little Big Burger and Blue Star Doughnuts, in 2016, he had just shut down a previous attempt at a fry chicken restaurant. Restaurants are high-risk, what's appealing to you about being in this particular restaurant business? It's one, this is a foodie town. I got amazing chefs, people that enjoy high quality food and kind of giving back to my community, something that was missing. And then also, you come out and see there are a pandemic a lot of people supporting people on their levers. The last few years have been far from the salad days for the restaurant industry. The pandemic altered dining, living and working habits, and everything from lockdowns to labor shortages have plagued the food business. Bays opened this location only a few months before the global pandemic shut down much of the country, and George Floyd's murder led to a reckoning around racial inequality. As protests and counter-protest swept the country, Portland became a focal point. Images of property destruction by protesters, who themselves were often the victims of violent attacks by extreme right-wing groups, as well as Portland police, ricocheted across social media, giving rise to a flood of disinformation by opponents of police reform. It was ground zero, right out our front door was ground zero, for the night we protested and we went on first.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5807,2022-10-23 03:50:39
17402," media, giving rise to a flood of disinformation by opponents of police reform. It was ground zero. Right out our front door was ground zero for the night we protested at Lennon for three or four months. Thankfully enough this community knew that this location was owned by Sue and then we didn't get stuffed on door windows, you know stuff like that. But the attention that was brought to Portland via those protests, it hit its cause, it hit its nerve and it started the conversation that is still going on today. Portland has in recent years been an almost cartoonish example of a liberal stronghold. And while coffee shops and breweries are a thing here, the real Portland is a complicated place in a state of near existential crisis facing issues around affordability, the unhoused and crime. People of color in Portland have been historically disenfranchised, especially when it comes to one of Sue's biggest businesses, real estate and development. Like in many cities across the US nearly a century ago, redlining practices allowed white neighborhoods easier access to capital and excluded black and immigrant communities, including Sue's home in the Northeast of Portland, where Irvington was, quote, still desirable, just a few blocks north, Alberta was considered, quote, hazardous. And while redlining was made illegal in the 60s, its effects are still being felt. Investment in areas like Alberta, where Sue and his father-bought a property have helped revitalize neighborhoods. But it's also led to gentrification driving out home prices and pushing people of color out. Through his development company HMS, Sue is hoping to change the traditional narrative. We are down on Alberta, further down from what we're up before, but this is 30th where we are creating Alberta Alley, which is going to be a nice collection of BIPOC type of restaurants. Beyond creating a space for black indigenous and people of color owners of restaurants, Sue has also brought in more black investors, including another profile player with Portland Roots named Brennan Scarlet. We went to take a look, but as you might expect, we had to go inside. Let's go inside. Right now, Alberta Alley is still very much a work in progress, but the intention is to create a space for multiple restaurants and eateries in a communal, well-alley type experience. Currently, they're working to bring a Latino owned expansion of puppies chulos and another base-fried chicken location to the space. You guys are native sons, putting a different mark on this city. Tell me about your process of being an owner and not just a participant, not just a customer to some extent. Portland's an interesting place and has a long history of racism, of marginalizing certain groups. The house that I grew up in on the deed that says that a black person couldn't own that house, but my dad purchased that house back in the 90s. Right now, you think about purchasing commercial properties like this, under black ownership, and then also the cycle of having tenants here and being intentional about having tenants here that are represented that may have historically not been able to have an opportunity to be represented. When I grew up here, it was predominantly in black neighborhood and a lot of different people just kind of starting out their businesses here that really in the bipod space. And so a lot of justification moved those things out and brought up new developments and not really looking for a way to bring those people back in. And so this is an interesting way to fold them back into having that opportunity of kind of getting kicked out and now coming back and hopefully being successful and finding ways to help them be successful. We have a very altruistic view when it comes to our real estate endeavors and have multi-family units and be able to create them and mix used developments. I think one of the most things I'm going to be proud of as we're getting this journey and started is our allied projects to Tandable Living Initiative where we really want to have the ability to afford a Tandable Living for everybody and we're starting here in Portland. It's never...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5808,2022-10-23 03:54:42
17403," TANNED OF ALIVING INITIATIVE, WHERE WE REALLY WANT TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO AFFORD A TANNED OF ALIVING FOR EVERYBODY, AND WE'RE STARTING HERE IN PORTLAND. There's never been a greater need for housing, and yet it's almost impossible to get housing done and developed. Sue's partner at HMS is Joel Anderson, a third-generation contractor and developer-based in Portland. And while the two have developed a portfolio of everything from high-rise residential to industrial, one of the common threads is their vision of the social impact real estate can have. Both Sue and I have been very fortunate and worked very hard, some lucky bounces that they win our way, and there's a whole bunch of people that we interact with in our communities that just didn't have those same opportunities, and have never had access to investing commercial real estate. While real estate investments have been a great place to store wealth, the recent housing market has left many unable to participate, especially when it comes to BIPOC communities. I think one of the ways that we can do that with all the cap as we call it is giving them the opportunity to not only pay rent and understand those other pieces and keep it afloat, but also give them the opportunity to be a part of it, and one thing you know about people when they have ownership into a building, they take care of it that much more better. All of these people are really... Affordable Housing, which about half of Americans say their community lacks, is a hot button issue long-frated with racism. Some say they oppose it over perceived increases in crime, erosion in the tax base, and increased traffic. Sue and Joel believe they can ultimately flip the script by better knitting residents into the community economically by affording everyone a stake. Altruistic capital, alt cap, it's very intention is to bring people in that have been excluded. If we take an accredited investor, somebody and say, okay, you're going to invest $100,000 in this project. They'll yes. But you're only going to get credit for 95% of that. And $5,000 or 5% of your investment is going to go to a nonprofit, alt cap community reinvestment fund. And we say to them, now, okay, you can participate from $500 to $5,000, and for every dollar you invest, we will match you through the alt cap reinvestment fund dollar for dollar. And so if you have somebody who invest $500, they now have $1,000 investment into this project. They've effectively doubled their return. It may seem complicated, but Joel and Sue believe that programs like alt cap can give people who've long been excluded from real estate, an attainable investment option. While some investors might pocket giving up some of their economics, proponents of this shared ownership believe it's long overdue. If we can get real estate transactions to include everybody, you're talking about trillion dollar industry that has the ability to engage everybody in a micro fashion earned at a disproportionate rate, you can transition the wealth of our country in short order. Of course, undoing centuries of economic disparity and systemic financial bias, that's a long game. For Sue, it's his life's work, and he'll be able to devote even more time to it once he leaves the game of football. How do you think about the idea of transition, especially given everything that you've already done in business? Yeah, the transition to difficult one for me. I look at it consistent and have over the last couple of years from a standpoint, especially since the boys came into my life. If I want to spend as much time with him and not miss out on things. How do you balance the economics versus the emotions? I mean, this is a deep analysis. This is one of the most important decisions you'll ever make. Yeah, I think the analysis is very straightforward. It comes down to numbers in a lot of ways, but then also just do I believe I have more to offer it without question. And do I aspire to be in the hall of fame? No question. Do I want to do that at the cost of not spending time with my kids and not being around my family? Timing is always going to be key to that. We've got a good process with me and the wife. I lean on her a lot, and I think she has a good tail tail to give me some different things to think about. And she always says it's ultimately your decision, but I truthfully know it's both our decisions. What are the moonshots at Amazon that are capturing most of your time and attention? Well, you know, we have a unique way that we go get big new investments. I'm not sure it's right or wrong. It just happens to be our way.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5809,2022-10-23 03:59:11
17404," that are capturing most of your time and attention. Well, you know, we have a unique way that we go get big new investments. And I'm not sure it's right or wrong, it just happens to be our way. And we ask ourselves when we're considering something for questions. We ask if it's successful, can it be big and move the needle in Amazon? Is it being well served today? Do we have a differentiated approach? And do we have confidence there? And if not, can we acquire quickly? If we like the answer to those questions, we'll go pursue it with a single thread team that isn't distracted by the rest of the business. When it comes to the stock, it has fallen significantly. Do you think investors are missing something or has tech just been overvalued? I have never tried to predict what stocks might do. In any time I've tried to a little bit, I've been wrong. I do really believe that in the short term, the stock market tends to be a voting machine and the long term it tends to be a weighing machine. We have a concept we talk about a lot of Amazon inputs and outputs. The ultimate output for a company is share price. And then other big outputs are free cash flow or profit or revenue. You can't really manage the outputs. You have to manage at the input level. And that's where we spend all our time. And so if you do the right things for the business long term, things tend to work out. I think we've had very good returns for investors. And I expect that to be true again. So what's the best investment advice you've ever put in? You haven't done anybody. The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day. And if you keep at it and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's not just interest. It was always said above compound interest returns, compound business returns, compound human returns. They're all very additive because you learn every day. And if you keep at it, it's very, very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make? Selling it the wrong time. And they sell when the prices go down? Yes. Or yes. And they're just trying to keep at it. Call it the rescue week with a president trying to rescue buyers at the gas pump. Earnings trying to rescue troubled markets. And a British government just plain needing a rescue period. This is Bloomberg Wall Street week. I'm David Weston. Placent down. If your deficit projection starts to get out of control and your real interest rates start to rise, you can get into a kind of doom loop. And Debra Lair of the Pulsen Institute on whether President Xi's ideology can get China's economy growing again. Xi's facing a lot of headwinds when it comes to the economy. It was a tough time on global Wall Street, but nowhere was it tougher than at number 10 Downing Street, where Liz Truss is on her way to becoming the shortest serving Prime Minister in British history. First resign, after concluding, she just couldn't get done what she'd set out to do. I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party. I have therefore spoken to his majesty, the King, to notify him that I am resigning as leader of the Conservative Party. It wasn't easy for President Biden, either, as he continued to fight high gas prices for which he largely blamed the oil companies and counted with yet another release from the strategic petroleum reserve. The Department of Energy released another 15 million barrels from the strategic petroleum reserve, extending our previously announced release through the month of December. The markets spent the week looking for some form of rescue from earnings, and they did get a bit of it from companies like Netflix with read hastings giving thanks. Well, thank God we're done with shrinking quarters. So that's the big feeling of we're back to the positivity. Tesla didn't help much by discipline.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5810,2022-10-23 04:03:28
17405," feeling of we're back to the positivity. But Tesla didn't help much by disappointing on sales, though Elon Musk predicted it would make it up in the fourth quarter. As our factors ran, we're looking forward to a recovering Q4. So it's really talking off on the word. It looks like we'll have an end-to-end of year. And although Goldman Sachs earnings were a pleasant surprise, Chief DJ officer David Solomon said they have a fair amount of work to do. Importantly, talent is moving around tremendously at Goldman Sachs to align behind David Solomon's new, new vision. What is this? The remix. I like that. Oh boy. And at the end of what was a wild wig, the markets did find similarly finally with the S&P 500 up 4.74% for the week, while the NASDAQ was up 5.22%. And it was all pretty much driven by anticipation of where the Fed is heading. As the yield in the 10-year climb for much of the week, but after peaking over 4.33% mid-dan Friday, it fell to 4.2% to end the week. While the two-year fell 13 basis points on Friday alone, after speculation grew that the S&P might just slow its rate hikes after November. To take us through the week in the markets, we welcome now Yuri and Timmer. He's director of Global macro for Fidelity Management and Sonal Desai, CIO for the Franklin Templeton Fixed Income Group. Welcome both of you back to Wall Street Week. Good to have you here. Sonal, let me start with you because so much of to this week, I think was driven off of fixed income, particularly those treasury rates. So what did we see this week? And why were there so many apparently violent moves up and down? So you know, David, I think that we're going to continue just, it was a crazy week, but it's been several crazy weeks. I think until the market gets a sense of where the Fed is going to go and stop, we're going to keep getting these wild bouts of volatility. We've been expecting it for a while. In a sense, you know, there was not that much of news in the Fed saying that they're close to being done. Well, of course, they are. We already know that we're going to get up to five, maybe five point two five, maybe a bit more, but quite early in the New Year, it's pretty clear that they will be getting close to an end. We get a 75, maybe we get another 50, after which do we get another 50 and another 25? I think the more interesting thing is what happens after that. Once the market feels that they know that the Fed is not going to pivot on a dime, I think we might get to a point where we stop seeing these wild back and forth, because these are truly massive moves in the Treasury market. And I would just note that every single data point is going to carry with it this level of gravity in terms of moves that we see until we get to the stage that the market buys what the Fed is selling. And that is they're going to raise and then they're going to keep it high for a while. And you're in where are we headed? Where is the Fed headed? Because I look at Bloomberg right now, the Fed futures rate looks like it's about 5.05. At one point this week was up close to 5.2 in terms of a terminal rate. Yeah, so when you look at the sulfur curve, it peaks at around 5%. And you look at the implied terminal rate, it's around the same. The markets have been in a relentless mode of price discovery this year, right? And the glass has been half empty for the last nine months where every time we think maybe the markets are bottoming and the Fed's going to be close to being done, that moving target starts to move again in the wrong direction. But I do think we're getting to a more glass half full mode. And I think that's what the stock market is starting to signal here, that at this point, the expectations for the Fed are so bad, meaning they're going to go so far, that the possibility of a surprise may start to go more in our favor. So maybe the Fed doesn't have to go all the way to 5. Maybe only needs to go to 4.5. Financial conditions have tightened significantly. So maybe the Fed is closer to being done than we think. But as Sunal mentioned, that's only half the equation, right? Like even if we know with clarity, where the Fed's going to go and when, whether it's 4.5.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5811,2022-10-23 04:07:53
17406," As Sunal mentioned, that's only half the equation, right? Like even if we know with clarity, where the Fed's gonna go and when, whether it's four and a half or five or five and a half, we don't know what the path will look like after that in terms of reverting back to a neutral policy. And we don't even really know what neutral is. Is it three percent? Is it three and a half? But you know, I think the Fed is pretty committed to getting inflation back towards its target of, let's say two, two and a half percent. And you know, we're a long ways from that. And so I think the risk is not so much that the Fed overshoots or undershoots in the near term, but that it's gonna take longer to get back to a neutral policy after it gets to that terminal point. So you're, you know, we were talking about this earlier today. And when I listen to what you're saying, I can't help but feel that for most in the market, there is this desperate desire to believe that we have the Fed that we've had for the last 17 years. And we can't because the environment is so different than it has been, well, maybe not last 17 because the last year, year and a half has certainly been this new world we're living in. But don't you think that a part of the volatility is markets which have become used to dramatic V-shaped recoveries and asset prices. So you miss the trade. So people keep jumping in, suddenly realize it's not gonna happen yet. Come out and so you see these bouts of extreme volatility largely because markets have been trained to expect that the Fed is going to step in when it gets too shaky. Yeah, now I agree. And since the financial crisis, the Fed has been able to not so much put the inflation mandate on the back burner because I don't think it ever is. But it was able to spend most of its time dealing with the full employment mandate. And then when financial conditions were tightening, they could exercise the Fed put as we call it, of course, and ease conditions and get the economy going. And inflation was never a clear and present danger. And of course, now it is. And ironically, now the Fed is in the position where it needs to not only maybe tolerate a higher unemployment rate, but even have that at its goal in order to compensate for the overstimulation that clearly was happening a year or two ago in the economy with that combination of fiscal and monetary policy. So that Fed put is either gone or out the money. And that does create a different response function in the markets. And so, and again, to the point I made earlier, knowing with clarity, which we don't know anyway, where the Fed's gonna go and whether it's going to overshoot because it waited too long to start tightening policy in the first place. So now instead of doing too little too late, it's doing perhaps too much too late. But even then we don't know how quickly the Fed will be able to go to a neutral policy. And I do think that that factors into valuation, because as you know, short rates, the Fed's terminal rate, real rates are important drivers, not only of course, of the bond market, but of equity valuations as well, per the discounted cash flow and calculating that present value of future cash flows does depend on where rates go. And how far they go up and how quickly they go back down is gonna be an important factor. So now let me jump in here with a question to you. Is the Fed put ever truly gone? Because we thought maybe a BOE put was gone over the UK, but when the things got really rocking in the Guilt Market, it had to come back in. What about what happened in the UK? What does it tell us potentially here as well about the fragilio markets and maybe the need for a central bank to step back in to give support? So you know, I think that the UK, I'm not going to say, the UK historically, we always use that phrase, right? Canary and a coal mine. However, I think in this particular case, the UK, what happened there is emblematic of what can go wrong. The immediate cause, certainly, was the mini budget, which was quite disastrous.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5812,2022-10-23 04:12:11
17407," The UK, what happened there is emblematic of what can go wrong. The immediate cause, certainly, was the mini budget, which was quite disastrous, the combination of spending and tax cuts. Clearly, it was the wrong time for a budget like that. But we tend to forget it was 17 years again in the making. We've had a very extended period of extremely loose monetary policy, and that forced the UK, where you have a higher proportion of defined benefit, pension plans, the UK is in a different position. Let's put it that way, which is not to say that the US and other countries should not look at the UK and worry about the unknowns. We don't know where markets will break, and the reality is, we are in a position where there is some possibility that something breaks. Will the Fed put, has it gone away? I think the Fed might be left in this completely internally, in coherent position that the Bank of England is in, where simultaneously buying guilt will continue to raise rates. You're in a way to tell us what it is. In a sense. Yeah, and exactly. The Fed put, maybe gone for the stock market, but I think it will be coming back for the bond market. And, you know, actions have consequences, right? And policy actions have consequences. And we only have to look to the Bank of Japan to see an example where they have, the Bank of Japan owns half of the JGB market and has completely tamed the bond market. The annualized volatility of long JGB is three. In the US, the long treasuries have an annualized volume of about, I think, 12 or 13. And so if you're going to make fiscal decisions that have wide ranging impact, and you're a central bank that has really dominated, the bond market, as, of course, the Fed has, as the Bank of England has, as the Bank of Japan has, you can't really leave that market. So I think that's how the Fed put is going to reappear, but just in a different market. So now, one more here, maybe the Bank of Japan has tamed the bond market, it sure hasn't tamed the FX market. And then on Friday, we got that news at a NICA, at least, that they are now intervening to support that language and weaken so much. We've got the BOJ next week. Tell us about that. What does that mean? Is the yen broken? So, you know, we're seeing something we haven't seen in a very long period of time. We have the EU, Japan and the US, all the dramatically different monetary policies. And so I think about this. And when times were good to, a fiscal toll story, all good markets, functioning markets look the same. And all of these markets, as they're breaking, they're breaking in different ways. And I think that is, that could just, it could, it's never been more apparent than what you see in Japan. The reality is, the yen is moving in line with interest rate differentials with the US. You look at US 10 year yields and you look at where Japan's yen is. And it continues to move. Can the Bank of Japan actually be, actually, can they control the yen? I have my doubts. You know, they might take some of the air out of it, but ultimately this is a global system, which is very interlinked. And the interest rate differential is simply to extreme right now, to simply intervene, to fix it. The other issue, of course, is Japan does not have the US's inflation issue. And speaking to the size of the bond market that is held, the US, depending on what bonds you're looking at, the fair loans between 25 and 33 percent of the bond market, right? So it's huge, it's a huge impact. So now the sign you're in Timur are going to be staying with us as we turn to what investors should be doing in these uncertain times. That's going to be next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5813,2022-10-23 04:16:36
17408," Okay, so you're moving in on me quick. I'm going to deal with your knight because it's really bothering me. Ah, my knight. Yeah, he's a troublemaker. Yeah. What did you get up to this weekend? You know, just robot stuff. A lot of chess. I was practicing for, uh, for you. I know you're pretty good. Ooh, I don't like that. I will take this. Uh, put it over here here. Not cool. Not cool. All right. I will. I will concede. I can see. You've got me, Bid. Very good game. Well played. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Does Governor Reagan now concede that it would be inflationary if we just cut federal taxes and didn't cut federal spending? I don't know whether he does or doesn't, but that's not his program. His program is in fact to cut taxes significantly, 10% a year, over the next three years each year, but also to restrain the growth in federal spending. That, of course, is Lewis Rukhizer talking with a pre-chairman, Alan Greenspan on Wall Street Week back on October 24, 1980, back when Alan was simply part of Townsend Greenspan and company. It was just before Governor Reagan was elected president, and the concern back then was about tax cuts without spending cuts, something that frankly we're still talking about today. The top movie back then was Goldie Hahn's private Benjamin and Woman in Love. Do you remember it? By Barbara Streisand, top of the Billboard Hot 100 chart for the week. Still with us, Arsenao Desai of Franklin Templeton and you're in Timber of Fidelity Management. So, let's start with you. What's an investor to do in this environment? Where we do have inflation that seems to be broad, maybe entrenched, we have a Fed that's on the move. What does an investor do? What's overpriced? What's underpriced? Well, you know, the good news is in a period where there isn't very much of it, is that both the 40 and the 60 side of the 60 40 paradigm, I think are now, you know, really attractively valued. I mean, you can get a 10 year yield at the 10 year note at 4.2, a two year note at 4.5. You can buy the S&P 500 at around 15, 16 times forward earnings. Now, that PE is only as good as the forward earnings. So, we will find out whether the earnings hold so far they have. So, valuations have had a tremendous reset from the over valuation days, you know, following the COVID lockdown. When the Fed basically repressed interest rates down to much lower levels than they really deserve to be. And that raised, you know, asset price inflation in the stock market, because again, interest rates are an important factor in valuation. And so, it's been a very painful nine months during which neither the 40 nor the 60 has worked. That's a very unusual environment to be in. But I think, you know, the good news is that if the Fed does overshoot, I think the 40 will really present a lot of value at 4% plus yields. And maybe the 40 will start becoming negatively correlated again to the 60. If our recession is averted, then the 60, I think, will do well because earnings then will likely hold up.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5814,2022-10-23 04:20:46
17409," becoming negatively correlated again to the 60. And if our recession is averted, then the 60, I think we'll do well because earnings then will likely hold up and valuations are now much more reasonable. So for me, the glass half full view here is that at least one of those two engines is going to start working. I can't tell you which one it is, unfortunately. But I do think it's not going to be any longer this monolithic market where basically nothing works. So now when will the bond market be the engine that starts working? Are bonds getting cheap enough now? There's time to go back in. They're beginning to look interesting. Let's put it this way. Because if I look at investment-grade bonds, I look at short paper. We just discussed, her and just discussed, that we were talking about 4.4, 4.5. I think we're getting to interesting levels. We're seeing something, finally, that we haven't seen for, again, close to 17 years, fixed income, delivering income. What a concept. I think income becomes more and more important as we look forward. I do think that 10-year yields are likely to still go up. But having said that, it does start becoming attractive. So over the coming weeks and sorry, coming weeks and months, I think the first step would be areas like investment-grade because you're getting paid healthily to hold good credit. And our baseline is not to have a steep recession. We'll have a recession. But I think we might be able to avoid a steep one, which means that fundamentals can still look good. And furthermore, if I look in areas like high yield and emerging market, we are now getting paid between 8% and 10% in these areas, which means that finally, liquid fixed income starts becoming a very decent alternative to alternatives, which up till now have really been the only area in the last multiple years that could deliver those style of return. So I actually, I'm also glass-hop full at this point for the first time in quite a while. You're just coming back to you and just kind of cash flow away of looking at stock valuations. As I understand it, in fact, you've taught me. In fact, the Fed has been buying bonds for them, also buying tips. Is that skewing that as a measurement? It's interesting you mentioned that, because I'm trying to figure that out actually in my latest research, because the Fed owns 33% of the Bloomberg Tips Index. So that may not be all of all tips. So the overall number will be less than that. And so it makes you wonder whether there's any price signal left. But when I compare, for instance, the tips break even to the inflation swap market, which is a direct swap, I don't really see a tremendous amount of price distortion from the Fed owning so many tips. And of course, the Fed owns a bunch of nominals as well. So maybe one cancels out the other. So I think the jury is still out. But clearly, the tips market is saying a different message than the headline inflation numbers are, because the tips break even are around 2.5 across the curve. And that's totally different from an 8% CPI. It's a great discussion. I really owe it to both of you. Thank you so much. That's Senegal de Saia, Franklin Templeton. And you're in Timmer of Fidelity Management.

China's closely watched party congress wraps this weekend and investors will be awaiting the likely release of GDP and activity data that were delayed during the meetings. When the reports finally land, Bloomberg economics expects them to show an anemic third quarter recovery. Elsewhere, the Bank of Japan will likely stand pat on its ultra low interest rate and asset purchases, despite a plunge in the yen that's driving up import costs. And in Australia, the central bank's preferred measure of core inflation is likely to hit a 31 year high. It is a big week for European earnings. It's an even bigger week for European bank earnings. We've got a whole range of numbers including HSBC, UBS, Unicredits, Standard Chartered, Barclays and Deutsche Bank. But the big one really comes on Thursday with the numbers that we're going to get from Credit Suisse out of Zurich. But the numbers are not going to be the focus. The focus will be the upgraded strategic plan. The management is also expected to announce on Thursday in Zurich. In Frankfurt that day, we have the ECB on deck as well. We are expecting the ECB to hike by circa 75 basis points. We're also potentially expecting the ECB to deliver some changes to other policies, including the cheap loans it offers to banks in the form of teletros. We could see some shifts there as well. Friday, we get the industrials, we get Airbus and we get Volkswagen. More than 160 members in the S&P 500 are scheduled to report earnings next week. That includes big tech companies, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta and Amazon. There will also be earnings from UPS, Chipotle, General Motors, Craft Hines and McDonald's. Economic data include the U.S. government's first estimate of third quarter GDP. Crost domestic product did contract in both the first and second quarters of the year, but is projected by economists to have reversed that trend, rising by more than 2%. The week rounds out with Friday's release of the personal consumption expenditures data, which the Fed uses for its inflation target. That data expected to show a continued re-exceleration in consumer prices. David? Thanks to Julius Sally, Guy Johnson and Romaine Bostic.

Welcome to the world of decentralized finance, Bloomberg's covering all things crypto, the people, the transactions and the technology, Bloomberg crypto Tuesdays. Ten years of remarkable growth, that's what President Xi Jinping of China focused on in his speech to the party congress last Saturday. It brought about a historical rise in China's economic strength. In the past decade, China's GDP has grown from the 55 trillion to 114 trillion and come to account for 18.5% of the world economy. Not a bad track record during Xi's time in office, but if President Xi had been willing to go back to before he was president, the story is even more dramatic. Since Deng Xiaoping initiated the open door policy in 1978, China's economy has gone from under $150 billion to nearly $18 trillion last year. Now that growth is slowing down, with possible repercussions for the rest of the world, according to the head of the WTO. If China's economy continues to slow, the way we are seeing that will have a big impact on what happens to the world economy. And US officials like Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adyemo say that the open door isn't as open as it used to be. In addition to Deng Xiaoping's brilliant supply chains, we want to make sure that American companies are competing on the level playing field with companies in China and around the world and that's why we've taken actions like restraining the ability to ship some key components. But Bridgewater's Ray Dahlia, who's been back and forth to China over the last 30 years, insists that despite all the problems, he wouldn't bet against Beijing over the long term. I think the longer term picture in China is still bright, because I know the people and I know the culture and I think it's good, but they have major issues now. And when it comes to China, the person we turn to here at Wall Street Week is Debra Lair. She is the CEO of Edelman Global Advisory and Executive Director of the Pulse and Institute. Debra, welcome back. Good to have you. We are all focused on President Xi and what's going on over in Beijing this week. Give us your sense about what we're learning. It strikes me that one of the biggest challenges he has is the economy and growing the economy. And yet I'm not sure we're hearing much about his economic policy. I hear a lot about politics, a lot about security. That's right. I mean, Xi Jinping gave his all-important work report at the beginning of the plenum. And it gave us a few-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5817,2022-10-23 04:34:01
17412," They hear a lot about politics, a lot about security. That's right. I mean, Xi Jinping gave his all-important work report at the beginning of the plenum. And it gave a few previews of how he's going to start to look at the economy. One of the things that he's emphasizing is common prosperity, his slogan about how he brings greater equality. One of the things that he's looking at is also how the party can continue to play an important role in the economy. And also, he did give reassurance to foreign companies that they will continue to push for market opening in key areas. So will we get a sense from the person now that surround him of where it might be headed? Because as I understand it, eventually, we will see him come out from behind the curtain. We assume everybody assumes that he will get his third term. But there's going to be a critical question of who's with him as he comes out. Absolutely. The important thing, and we're all watching for this weekend, when the new party lineup is going to be announced, there's a lot of rumors starting to fly around, although not as many as there usually are. But it's a big guessing game, because that will give us really our first clue into what the third term is going to look like. And I think there are three important things to watch. One is going to be what happens to Lika Chang, the current premier. Does he continue to stay on the standing committee? He's turned out of staying on as the premier, but could they make him the number two and head of the National People's Congress? Two, who will be in the lineup to then take the premier position? And the two leading candidates appear to be Wang Yang, whose view is being more open on the economic issues, and Wang Huning, who really is an idiotia log. And the third to watch is what happens to Liol-Ha, who's currently the vice premier, who's in charge of the economy and finance. Does he stay? He has good relations with many foreign firms, or who really comes in to take his portfolio? Debra, one of the things that we watch in the West, and we may be right or wrong in watching it, is the extent to which the markets in some way play a substantial role in economic policy over there. It strikes me that it's possible to interpret a presidency thus far as moving somewhat away from the markets. A lot of what he emphasis right now is ideology. And I think it's what he came out of, more than perhaps we've seen in the past. Absolutely. We're seeing much more emphasis on ideology under Xi Jinping. And if we look back under Jiang Zemin, Jiang Zemin was saying the party is big enough to include business. She takes it in a different way. He says the party is all encompassing, and it should be forced into business. And so ideology is playing a much bigger role. Also, we need to keep an eye on how Xi's favorite slogan, common prosperity is going to be implemented. China, surprisingly, is actually much more unequal than the United States. And one of the things that he's trying to do through this common prosperity slogan is say, there should be a cap on executive salaries. We should be looking at big companies, particularly the private sector, giving back to the community. And how that's going to be implemented at the same time when he's trying to grow the economy, when he's trying to encourage entrepreneurship and create jobs, is going to be a very tough thing for him to balance. Well, I was going to ask exactly about that, Debu, because through history, a lot of people have said we should have more equality, less inequality, whether it's income or wealth. But a lot of attempts to get that done actually do get in the way of growth overall. Absolutely. And China, and we've talked about this before, the overwhelming majority of Chinese companies are small and medium-sized enterprises. It's up into the 90s. They are responsible for about 60% of China's growth and about 60% of job creation. And so if you can't create the right atmosphere for them to grow, you're going to have a significant impact on China's ability. And right now, she's facing a lot of headwinds when it comes to the economy. He's got issues still to deal with with real estate market. It's one of the only places that Chinese people can invest. And obviously, housing prices are going down at the moment. The world is facing a global recession, and she is still very dependent on exports to grow the economy. He needs to find a way to unlock consumer.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5818,2022-10-23 04:38:16
17413," is facing a global recession and she is still very dependent on exports to grow the economy. He needs to find a way to unlock consumer spending. And that's very hard to do when you don't have confidence in the path of the economy. And particularly when you don't have the kind of social safety nets in place, particularly around health, that make people feel comfortable enough and have confidence to spend their money. If you put it a longer course of Chinese history because you've been really very active in China for a good long time now, are we seeing something of a turn back toward Mao in a way from Deng Xiaoping? Well, certainly we're seeing a difference in the way that she is governing the economy. You know, the Chinese Communist Party has about 93 million members. And to put that in context, that's 10 million more people than the whole population of Germany. And he used this as the way to govern the economy. And so therefore, the party is involved in every aspect. As we look at this new leadership coming in, watching the ideology versus the technocrats is going to be really important and give us a sense of what the government appointees, which will take place next March, will look like and how they're going to approach the economy. Is there going to be this emphasis on a more socialist economy? Or are they going to be more emphasis in what they call the socialist market economy? The fact that they didn't put out the GDP numbers this week on time, I think is very disconcerting for the world's second largest economy to place politics over just the standard transparency and publication of data is not an encouraging sign. Debra, looking into your crystal ball there, what do you think this might mean for US-China relations? I mean, it strikes me at least that going back five or ten years, a lot of it was about economics. It was about trade, things like that, increasingly from Beijing, but also from Washington, when they talk about one another, it's about geopolitics. It's about Taiwan. It's about Russia. It's about security in the Asia area. Well, national security definitely dominates the headlines. And there are some very serious issues that we're dealing with. I was just in the UK and they were telling me Taiwan didn't even use to really be on their agenda and now they're spending about 75% at their time. These are the China experts focused on this. So those are absolutely definite important issues to watch, but I think the real story here is going to be what happens with the economic and trade relationship. Traditionally, it's been the foundation of the relationship and it's created the people-to-people ties and built some levels of trust. Without these exchanges, with Western companies reconsidering both because of the politics, but also because of the state of the Chinese economy and the complications that have come with dealing with COVID-0, they're reconsidering their strategies. And not having that level of trust, I think really is going to have an impact and ensure that there are going to continue to be fraught relations between the United States and China. Do you have Deborah Hopes, if not expectations, that after we're through the party Congress and maybe actually after they meet in the spring and confirm that he's present in the country, that that will free President Xi up to reach out to the United States or will it embolden him to become even more assertive? Well, I think once we know what the lineup looks like, I think it's going to be easier to answer that question. I think whatever happens on the political front, Xi Jinping needs to find a way to grow his economy because his power both internally and internationally stems from their economic might. China right now is the largest trading partner to 70 percent of the world. The US used to have that role 20 years ago. And in order to maintain that, he has to show that he can grow the economy. He can't grow the economy through ideology. He has to grow it through basic economics. Okay, Deborah, it's always such a pleasure to have you here. You are really our China expert.

So thank you so much for being with us, Larry. Once again, much of the week was consumed with the drama over the United Kingdom, which is good and serious business for people who are living in Great Britain. But what lessons might it have for the rest of us? Look at one level, Britain is unique. They went through Brexit. They've had some unique political challenges that have taken place within their Tory party. They've rarely seen the kind of extreme incompetence that was represented by the original trust proposals. But I think there are two lessons that policymakers around the world need to heed. The first is that things can change extraordinarily fast if you lose credibility. First is it takes a long time to grow a forest, but you can burn it down very quickly. Something similar is true with respect to credibility and confidence. I think at a time of rising government debts and rising interest rates, that's a lesson to be careful that policymakers in many different countries need to take a counter. I would say the second, more specific lesson just goes to the potential instability in government debt markets. And that's got both a macroeconomic aspect that if your deficit projection starts to get out of control and your real interest rates starts to rise rapidly, you can get into a kind of doom loop. And it also has to do with liquidity in the markets and the possibility that you'll get a situation where they'll be selling, but there won't be buying, which will be get a kind of liquidation cycle.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5820,2022-10-23 04:46:44
17415," Many people, and you included our warning that we may well be heading to a recession here. In the past several years, it's thought that if there's a recession, we can just write some fiscal checks for it. If we don't have the ability, that way it turns out Liz trust did not have over in the United Kingdom. What does that mean of our ability to pull out of it? What is the prospect that when we've had so many years of feasts, we may be handed for some famine on higher interest rates, lower growth, and lower productivity increase? Look, David, there's always a tendency at the beginning or in the early stages of very problematic periods to assume that everything is going to be resolved much more quickly than actually proves to be the case. Think about COVID. I was early on your program and was very worried about COVID. But I certainly didn't envision that it would be something that would still be on people's minds going into the winter of 2023. And I think it's a mistake to think that all of our economic challenges are going to be met quickly, particularly if we heed what I think would be the dangerous advice that are coming from the erstwhile members of Team Transitory that the Fed can back off already and not carry through on the increases that the market is now expecting. I think for that to happen would be to almost guarantee a protracted period of stagflation as we had both we lacked both price stability and confidence. I think we need to remember that apart from anything we do with discretionary policy, we have a whole set of natural stabilizers that kick in in our economy as the economy goes down, tax collections go down as unemployment crosses certain thresholds. There are increases in unemployment insurance payments. But unfortunately, I think we fired the fiscal canon so strongly that there's going to be limited room for discretionary fiscal policy if we have another recession. Finally, Larry, one of the other events of the week was the release for the release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve by President Biden, who swears this is not a political issue. But could you give us the economic potential effects of those sorts of releases? David, I think the initial sprow release was a power powerful thing that over the last months has done a lot to contain oil prices. And I think the Biden administration was exactly right to do it strongly, do it for a long time, do it in coordination with others. I think it's much less clear how much scope there is for that policy to work further going forward. In part, that's because of the many of the constraints are on the refining side. In part, that's because what is a little bit like QE for the Fed, whatever you put out there, you're going to have to get back in at some point. And that's going to have the opposite impact on oil prices. So I think you've got to be careful about that instrument from here. And I think that we've all got to be very apprehensive about the degree of confrontation that now exists between the United States and what might be called the Russia and Saudi axis. This is going to be a very complex time. And I hope that we get through it while avoiding oil price spikes. My guess is that that's going to happen. But I think that's a major downside wild card from here, both with respect to inflation and with respect to recession. OK, Larry.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5821,2022-10-23 04:53:00

That's Larry Summers of Harvard. Coming up, what's up and down with Great Britain? Bloomberg Stephanie Flanders gives us one more thought on a wild and wacky week for the British government and the economy. That's next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. However you get your news. This is Bloomberg Daybreak, but let's on Bloomberg Daybreak. Welcome to Daybreak Australia. This is Bloomberg Technology. I'm Sir Bloomberg, crypto. On TV, radio and the web. This is Bloomberg.

Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge, and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer, disrupt. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. Finally, one more thought. And this week, it comes from Bloomberg Senior Executive at her for economics and government. And it's about her native land. Here is Stephanie Flanders. I think Liz Truss started off with the right idea, which is the UK has been held back by a slow growth since the global financial crisis. Actually in the two decades before 2008, we'd averaged around 2.5% growth, which was higher than many of our trading partners. We caught up a bit with Germany. We caught up a bit with the US during that period. But since then, growth has been less than half that, and certainly much slower than other countries. So it did make sense to focus on growth. And it made sense to also to be spending some money in her initial mini budget on supporting households through a massive energy squeeze as we approach the winter. I think the problem for financial markets is that the government showed no willingness to engage with the difficult trade-offs that all governments are facing in this environment, where they want to stimulate growth. They want to help households face rising energy bills, but they don't want to make it harder for the central bank to bring down inflation. And they don't want to be building up a lot of debt just at a time when we know the cost of money, the cost of borrowing, all around the world is going up. So it was not what she did, but the way she did it and the kind of gay abandon with which the government was proposing tax cuts that were not funded by any form of spending constraint. And not targeted to the people who in this particular environment needed help the most. I think what we also saw in the UK, there had been this nervousness in financial markets that maybe dates back to the Brexit referendum that some of the constraints, the institutional constraints on policymakers in the UK that had prevented, you know, silly politicians from doing silly things, that those have been worn away in the years in the tumult since Brexit. And I think what happened when you saw the new Chancellor installed, the seventh since 2016, you saw potentially those institutions...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5822,2022-10-23 04:57:22
17417," Brexit and I think what happened when you saw the new Chancellor installed, the seventh since 2016, you saw potentially those institutional constraints come back that the Treasury, the Bank of England is still in charge, that's the message to market, even if politicians are still messing around at the edges. There's a lot of Shadden Freude potentially and certainly there, but for the grace of God go I, central bankers and Treasury officials around the world, they are looking at the UK and wondering what's happened to this previously great nation, but they should also be looking at potential pitfalls that they too will face as we go into this environment in which interest rates are going to be higher, the cost of government borrowing is going to be higher, and potentially strains are going to be put on financial markets. We saw a particular investment strategy, the liability driven investments in the UK which are particular to the UK, mess up the pension market, force the Bank of England to intervene, but we know we saw similar fragility in the US Treasury market back in March of 2020, and there may be other things out there that we should be nervous about as we see this very significant shift to a higher interest rate environment. This is really a reminder isn't it just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see some pressure on the U.N., we did see some pressure on the future. That is now being reversed. Back in 1997 I was interested in the following question which is there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called Saurapod dinosaurs which had really long skinny necks, so Apatosaurus is an example. Now there's a really long skinny tails, so I made a computer model that showed that in fact the tail of these Saurapod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip, a bull whip. Now the way a bull whip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. And that crack is a sonic boom. I think the way they got a date was to impress the females by making loud booms. Thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for having me. What drives you? What drives me? Oh my god, I love the idea of just...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5823,2022-10-23 05:01:41
17418," for joining us. Thank you for having me. What drives you? What drives me? Oh my God, I love you know the idea of just a simple as this uninclusive world, a world where people see themselves reflected because I was supposed to be invisible by your accounts. I was supposed to not be where I am. I was supposed to have disappeared a long time ago and every turn in my life was about visibility. Yes, I will be this person who's not supposed to be here. Yes, I will fight through the hard times. Yes, I won't give up. And even though I was sort of the token black editor in the industry in the 90s, I knew even then that I needed to bring people up with me. I needed to bring other people up with me. And so that's really been a part of, you know, maybe it's maybe it was growing up in a family of six, I don't know. When you run a team, how do you instill that work ethic, that kind of answering emails at all time? I mean, you know, I think you say an example, you know, if you're an editor who leads and has lunches and it's never in the office, you know, you don't really sort of instill faith. My team know that, you know, we're on a mission, we have to reflect the world we live in, we have to, you know, reflect the, you know, the beauty of multiculturalism, we have to reflect, you know, beauty and diversity and inclusivity. So everybody takes it really seriously. And we really have intense conversations about the side guys and the world. And so, you know, I'm very lucky to have a team who are as passionate. And, you know, I could call my team, you know, I could call somebody at 6 a.m. or they can call me at 6 a.m. and I'll pick up, and they'll pick up. So, you know, we have something very special that we've built over the past sort of five years. But there were difficult moments, right? I think the first time one of your first issues, you thought that you could have been fired for it. Oh, just that, right? I mean, I lived in America for a bit and I was working for W Magazine and there was talk of Brexit. And of course, Americans were like, your country's really, you know, xenophobic. So, you know, I came back and I thought, you know, I'm going to be welcome with open arms and they're going to love me and oh my god, literally back to them by fire. But I remember thinking, you know, I wanted to create a magazine where every woman could see themselves. You know, where every woman, regardless of the backgrounds, regardless of their age, could just literally see themselves. And at the time, now it looks like it's the norm when you look at other magazines. But in 2017, that was, that was a radical idea. But I also remember thinking, you know, with my background, you know, I've lost so much and gained so much that I thought, if I knew, if I'm fired, I would rather be fired for what I believed in. I would rather be fired for creating a magazine that reflected the world as it was, than try to sort of create a second-rate version of someone's vision. And that continues. I mean, there's this idea of always pushing forward. Right? What's the end? How do you measure success? How do I measure success? I'm definitely not, not financial. I mean, I think it's more about, for me, when I'm really exhausted, when I'm really tired, when I'm really questioning if I can go on, you know, I walk on the street and I see a little girl, a little black girl who's seen the magazine and it's the norm for them or a curvy woman on a traitor palace, who's like, thank you for, you know, seeing me, you know, that makes it worth, like that for me is success. And anybody who knows or has known me for a while will witness that that for me is success. You know, my jaw is done when that happens. Do you think people come up to you? They do, but it's always in a positive way. It's always thank you for seeing us, you know. But I can relate, because, like I said to you, by all accounts, I was meant to be invisible, you know. So for me, shining in light on people and making them seen, it's natural for me. They say that the fashion industry is changing. You're changing it. Are others around you changing it? I mean, now, you know, you look at other magazines and seeing real women in there, it's no longer a radical act, seeing, you know, people of color, women of color on color.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5824,2022-10-23 05:06:11
17419," I have magazines and seeing real women in there, it's no longer a radical act. Seem, you know, people of colour, women of colour on covers is no longer a radical act. So it's been normalised and for me I'm quite happy when I see that. When you put Dame Judy Dengue on the cover and she's 85 years old and the world just laughed it. Nobody questioned her, you know, should she be on the cover or you put, you know, a girl with a heat job on the cover. And it's not a problem, that for me shows that, you know, we're advancing, we're progressing. So, you know, progress for me is very important. Which is important. And so how do you take care of your team? How do you build a team around you? My team, I mean, somebody said to me once, when you build a team, make sure you employ people, you like. People, when you see them working towards your office, you're just so excited to see. That was it. Being good at your job and sort of a connection. And being excited to see, you know, team members, because you only have good as your team, you know. No man is an island, you know. I don't create the magazine on my own. And so it's great to have a team who, you respect and who's views you respect, you know, and who respects you. How do you think you're seen by your team? Do you have to be fearful? Do you have to be, I'm a worker, I work very hard. But I think I'm pretty open. You can have conversations with me. You know, ultimately the final decision rests with me. But I do listen. I like conversation, I like interaction. And so that's, I mean, that's how I hope they think I'm a good boss. And that's, you know, really all you can hope for. Because, you know, they work on a very good magazine. They can get other jobs anywhere. So the fact that they're there makes me think that they must be happy. Edward, how do you see the publishing world changing? So people buy less magazines. You've been, I mean, you've been doing pretty well in terms of selling more. But in five years, how does it look? How does it look? I mean, I was like, you know, five years ago, I, even, I mean, let's go back to ID when I was 18, you know, I heard it at a magazine, you know, which would come out. We're all about club kids and you had to be out there. And the only way you could see street fashion was through ID. And then 2017, I and I had, you know, I inherited a magazine. But now I oversee a brand. You know, the magazine is so that the magazine is sort of the highest of the high, the best paper, you know, the best photographers, the best, you know, cultural messages. But at the moment, you know, when you manage a brand, it's not just about that. It's about digital. It's about video. It's about audio. It's about events. So for somebody who's so forward looking, it's so great for me. And people always ask, oh, it's a magazine instead. When we launch a cover, Instagram is our cover, essentially. So I've, you know, found a way, we've found a way of sort of making it work hand in hand. And it's so great for me, you know, I think, how do I just been doing the magazine? I probably would have been bored. Yeah. So magazines aren't dead. Are they going to, you know, down the street? Yeah, but they're going to work in hand with digital platforms, you know. But also, I'll tell you something, new readers of folk, young readers don't necessarily come to us through the new stands. They come through that, you know, did you sell platforms or, you know, audio or videos we put out. So yes, now it's increased 10 folds. So yeah. Well, that, do you think that will change the kind of readership that you will court? The either age of your readers, but also where they come from? Yes, I mean, at the moment, you know, I think the readership is getting younger because of, you know, the whole digital landscape. And I hope that, you know, as we move forward, it kind of, yeah, we have new readers. And we also keep our loyal readers, you know. Do you think there's ever a time where actually we won't have print magazines anymore? No, I think print will always exist, sort of a long-side digital, but it'll probably be something more precious, sort of better paper, something more collectible that you want to keep in your house, almost like artwork. So no, I don't think print is going to die. So fewer copies. But more quality. But more quality. You know, almost like a book. A cable book. I love that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5825,2022-10-23 05:10:32
17420," Better quality, you know, almost like a book. A table book. I love that. Right now, me too. Big, expensive cities have a lot going for them. But if you live in one, you probably notice that these big, expensive cities keep getting more, well, expensive. You could always move away. You might have just started working remotely, so there's really nothing keeping you there. But then again, moving is a hassle. Well, what if someone paid you 10 grand to do it? What if they threw in free office space, a bicycle, or a gym membership? Programs and cities and states around the US are doing exactly that, and they're getting a lot of interest. We've had over 50,000 applications. About 90,000 applications. We've had over 1800 applicants from all over North America. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them? Or are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns for places looking for an injection of fresh talent? Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world recalibrates. The decades of stagnation, Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation. Corporate giants, policymakers, and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that. Every week on Japan ahead, right here on Bloomberg Television. You're recently on TikTok. Yes. Is that fun? Well, not so much fun. I literally have to be held back. But the brilliant thing is, I'm so curious. I mean, I like all the digital platforms. I really like to keep my finger on the poles. I'm one of the people that leaves work and shuts themselves in. I really want to be out there seeing the world as today. It's in all its beauty. So I'm very curious. I have a very curious mind. And I'm glad. I'm glad. It keeps everything moving and exciting. Is that for Gen Z? Is that a commercial purpose to get also get closer? No, it's just out of curiosity. I've always been like that. I've always wanted to know what's next. I didn't want to be the one that's just being told, oh, you're 50. Or whatever. I pay attention to everything. But the world is such a beautiful place for me. And it goes back to my childhood again. Well, the biggest challenge to grow the brand in the next five years. Because we still keep it relevant. We have such great digital traffic. Almost 6 million every month to British folk. But I'm really excited about overseeing the European Vogue as well, Spain, Italy, Germany, and France, and sort of mentoring a whole new generation of editors. When there was this whole agonization, the whole world thought there was a global view that was going to dominate. But it's very much about local conversations as well as global conversations. So I learned from these content leads. And I hope that they also learned. So the local global conversation I'm very excited about moving into the future. Do you think it changes if we're in a recessionary environment? So you have such a glamorous lifestyle. Or what you sell is so glamorous. Is it impacted by the cost of living or inflation of what we can live through? I mean, you know, I remember a few years ago I put Taylor Swift on the cover and the violin was by better, by less, and it was a radical concept at the time. And now we all talk about sustainability.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5826,2022-10-23 05:14:49
17421," The swift on the cover and the by-line was by better, by less. And it was a radical concept at the time. But now we all talk about sustainability. We know we can't keep shopping every day. We know we have to buy things that last, things that help the planet, things that we can pass on to sort of other generations. So I think that really is a conversation of the fashion industry is having right now that I find so exciting. And it's going to be sort of, you know, people are going to have less money so they have to buy things that last. And I'm really excited. And these are real changes. It's not just real changes. Real changes. It's not just conversation. It's actually happening. Do you think fashion brands always need to have a political point of view when they're great in justices? I think fashion brands can do more. I feel that having a black model in your show or having a feed on your Instagram post, it's not enough. We need diverse voices behind the scenes. I always say that I talk to sort of all the CEOs I know we need to employ more people from, you know, from diverse backgrounds. Because that's the only way you can even reach out to more people, you know. A variety of voices always better than just one. And I always also say, you know, let's not just have interns, let's have people on all different levels. And that's what I keep talking to people about. Do they listen? Some listen. But I think since, you know, George Floyd was murdered more and more companies sort of made pledges to people of color. And, you know, it's a slow process. Some have taken it seriously and some are still working their way through it. But, you know, we have to keep on. The problem is that you can make a pledge and then follow through. Right? You know, so you have to really sort of focus and keep asking that question for people to follow through. And so do you feel like you're a guardian of, also of that, of making sure that when you get promised something, they'll do it. And you'll hold them into account. Yeah, I mean, yes, if they promise something, you know, that I asked for, then I will literally wear you down. I will literally chase you until you keep your promise. That's just who I am. And we actually have one of the diverse cabinets here in the UK with Liz Truss. Is that important to you? It is so important. As somebody who came from another country and was sort of welcomed by the UK, it's very important to have a diverse cabinet. That's how change happens. You know, going back to what we discussed before, that's how you understand people who are on the periphery or who've been avid. It's so important to have a diverse cabinet. But this you think in terms of policies and what they can bring to the table or just also seeing how they can have a diverse cabinet. You can have an effect on policy. I hope they can have an effect on the parties themselves. As well as policy. If I'm made to have a policy that makes people's lives better. I know you're also very close to Ghana still. I mean, there's a pretty scandalous anti-LGBT you'll get through. I mean, it's so funny. I was invited back to Ghana a few years ago by the President was the year of the return. And I remember the last time we were in Ghana, we were fleeing. And I really supported the changes. I love the changes that we're going through. But yes, they do have an LGBT problem. Some friends and I signed a whole. I don't know if you saw it. And we're doing what we can to change things on the ground. I think you can't also sit in the West and tell a country what to do. So it's about sort of forming alliances on the ground and seeing what is needed and how we can help. Rather than standing on our soap boxes, going, do this, do that, do this. So that's through what grounds, I mean, ground work, trying to change from with it. Yes, from with it. Yeah. Trying to change from with it, you know, talking to LGBTQ members and asking them what they need and what we can do to help.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5827,2022-10-23 05:19:11
17422," Trying to change one within, you know, talking to heads of LGBTQ, LGBTQ members and asking them what they need and what we can do to help. Rather than, you know, I'll say, do this. This is how you do it, because we don't live that. You have a memoir out. Why put it down on paper? You know something about when you turn 50. You know something about when it's your fifth year at Vogue. You know, I got married this year. I'm normally not someone who looks back all the time, but it felt like the right time for me to do that. And also, you know, I just felt that a lot of young people see people like you and I and they think, you know, we just got here and we were always here and for me it was really important to share the story of a journey about, you know, successors and, and, you know, failures. And, you know, that's the reason why I got here. So I just wanted to share that story with them. Sort of young people as well as people who, you know, feel like they're on the outskirts of, you know, the outside of the industry really. Do you feel like an outsider? I think I always feel like an outsider, but as I said before, you know, I grew up African in an African household in England. You know, different languages, different foods, and I now go to school and I've been in England. So I've always been about duality. I've always seen myself as an outsider, but also an insider. And even when, you know, I took the job at British Folk, I was the black gay working class outsider, but, you know, I've been in the industry since I was 18. I was, in essence, an insider. So that's really, is some of the duality that plays out in my life. What, who do you think made you the person you are today? I know you left home twice, right, Ghana, but also you had to leave your home. Yes. I mean, the puzzle made me who I mean, really is my mother. I mean, I mean, I loved my mother. She taught me about sort of beauty. She taught me about clothes, about fascism. She also taught me that beauty came in all forms. That, you know, women were beautiful, no matter what shaped they were, no matter what color, what religion. And so that really stayed with me. And, I guess that my creativity comes from her. And of course, I also had a military father. So the idea of precision and organization and sort of thinking ahead also comes from here to the best of both worlds. How did your father, I know you had a difficult relation with your father. How did your father shape the person you are today? It's a funny to ask this question because I never thought I was like my father growing up. I was very shy, very sensitive, you know, a little spacey. I prefer the company of women. To men, my dad was sort of, you know, a sort of authoritarian, disciplinarian. You know, you had to, you know, be home at a certain time. He robs on iron fist. And I thought, you know, I'm never going to be like him. You know, he kicked me out of the house, you know, when I was 18. But I found out that over the years when it comes to work and discipline and sort of organization, that is him to a T. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. The pressure cooker just got far too hot in Birmingham for the government to handle. You foresee two-thirds of the crypto hedge funds will disappear. Are we close? The European Union will support and defend Ukraine's derrige world integrity. With unmatched reach in resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. Let's just be honest. We've had sort of a shift in are we in some sort of circulation fears. The moment people were talking about that all day yesterday.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5828,2022-10-23 05:23:27
17423," We're talking about that all day, yesterday. So at some point you lose your eyesight. What was that like? Basically I have very high myopia, so I've never had great eyesight and I went through a series of retinal detachments for to be exact. I would have to end up looking down in a contraption for about three weeks and in the dark room. It was very harrowing, it was very harrowing time in my life. But I always say you don't have to have vision to have vision. So in those dark rooms my imagination was even bigger. I dreamt bigger and I came out of the last surgery and the cover I did was for W Magazine with Rihanna, Queen with a golden eye. I was very challenging and I go for checkups to make sure my eyes are okay. They're great right now. The more I look after myself the better. It's amazing, you power through adversity. Do you ever think this is too much? Have you ever thought this is too much? I mean there have been times when I felt this is too much but it's not in my vocabulary to start. It's not in my DNA to start. I am my mother's son, my father's son. The edge to move forward is always there. That's why when I was young I would always get up and work. I had a refundy touch when I still got on a plane to go shoot the Hollywood portfolio. But now I'm learning to say no. I'm learning I can't do that job. I can't fly. No. It takes time but it comes with age. It takes courage to say no. Right? Definitely. So when you look at all your covers and there are so many beautiful ones, is there one that's special to you? I say to someone, they're like my children. I'm always having a favorite child. But I'm especially proud of the covers we didn't lock down. When the world had essentially shut down the teams were scattered all around London. And I had to go back to the days of I did when you had to really create user imagination. And we had a series of four covers, Judy Dinch. When they said, you know, anybody over 60, she stayed at home. The essential workers cover a cover of landscapes. Just so people could take a breather and the activists cover when George Floyd was murdered. And I really think we create covers that, you know, in years time people can look back and see what the time. That period was like for me an artist always has to reflect their times as Nina to paraphrase Nina Simone and that's really important for me. I mean, there was a bit of controversy with Linda van Gillespie. Yes. Yes. I mean, you know, there was a, there was a complaint that, oh, you know, she should, she should have looked a certain way, you know. And for me, I've known Linda in the 90s. I've known this incredible icon who really defined what a model should be. And I also saw my friend go through really dark days, you know, due to the complications for surgery, literally disappear from the world. Really not the Linda the world news. So when we were doing this cover, it was the collaboration. She wanted to be that Linda that everybody knew she wanted to feel good about herself.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5829,2022-10-23 05:27:43
17424," So when we were doing this cover, it was the collaboration. She wanted to be that Linda that everybody knew. She wanted to feel good about herself again, and I wasn't going to deny her that act. And also, you know, whatever I would like to say, whatever a woman wants to do with her body, it's up to her. So, you know, I'm very proud of Linda and I'm very proud of that cover. And I mean, sometimes you're almost like an activist. Is that how you're like a fashion activist or a political fashion? I'm not sure, but I'm definitely creative, but you know, I've always believed, you know, look at my life story in my book, you know. I wasn't like, I keep saying I wasn't supposed to be here. You know, had my dad not left, I don't know even what would have happened to my family. So even when we ended up in a room, two rooms in a voxel, six of us, we were so happy to be there, penniless, but so happy to be there. So, you know, every day, I just, you know, I'm an optimist. And I know it's not the most fashionable thing, but that's why I'm sitting here with you today. Bye. Edward, thank you so much for your time today. Thank you. So, is there more pressure when you're trying to win a basketball championship than when you're trying to please investors? Where's the greater pressure? Oh, I think, I think it's definitely trying to win a championship. It's hard because a lot of, like when you invest and you know this, when you're investing, you can control a lot more things. When, you know, in a basketball court, you can't control whether somebody's going to make a shot, you've got to get lucky. And what's the greater pleasure making five times your money on a distressed debt investment or winning the NBA championship? They're both fabulous. I wish I could do one each year. That would be great. But I think there's a great feeling and being right on an investment that you've done a tremendous amount of work and you've made money for your clients, which I think is great. I think winning a championship is, it's a very surreal feeling because there's a whole city or state that is actually behind you. You know, we had 70,000 people at the finals and we had them all outside. It's 17,000 in stands. And then literally like 60,000 people outside. And when we won, like just the joy that you had brought to the city was phenomenal. It is crucially important. And I think we've moved from this attitude, from its indulgence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s. And so it makes that a really exciting field because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harnessed to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize. That makes you smart. If you can spit back a lot of facts. But if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what you bring to use out while you're sleeping. Thank you, Andy, so much for coming down. It's really wonderful to have you here in person. It's my pleasure to be here. Thanks for having me. And I just found out we actually lived in the same dorm in college just a few years apart. So it's been almost a year since you took over from Jeff as CEO of Amazon. And it's been a year of first, the first Docs Blitz since the.com bloom, the first vote to unionize an Amazon warehouse, your first Bloomberg technology conference. Thank you.

17425," In February 2021, Jeff Bezos shocked the world by announcing plans to step down as Amazon CEO. A few months later, he passed the reins to Andy Jassy, his longtime top lieutenant, the architect of one of the company's biggest profit engines, Amazon Web Services. Bezos has stayed on as executive chair, leaving Jassy to navigate a critical inflection point in Amazon's history. How does the company manage market turmoil, rising inflation and regulatory scrutiny, and a push by some warehouse workers to unionize all while keeping customers coming back? Join me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, Amazon's second CEO, Andy Jassy. He joined us from our flagship Bloomberg Technology Summit in San Francisco. I'd like you to grade your view of Amazon's performance. We've got time later to really dig in. But quickly, how would you grade Amazon's performance over the last year with customers? Well, I think we've, you know, I'm not sure I'm the right person to grade myself during the year or not. But I'll give you my take. I think with respect to customers, I think we've done a lot of good. And I think if you look at during the pandemic, which really has extended till the early part of this year, you know, so much of the PPE and food and essential items and people equipping their home offices were bought from Amazon and, you know, to scale the way we needed to. Remember, in 2020, we grew 39 percent year over year on a $245 billion revenue run rate. I mean, it's unprecedented. It's never happened before. But it was really hard to do that. And we had to take the really big footprint of the fulfillment center footprint. We built the first 25 years of Amazon and doubled it in 24 months. We built out that transportation network in just a couple of years. You know, we nearly doubled the size of our workforce during that time. And I think you saw it in other businesses. You know, AWS is a really big part of helping companies and governments have business continuity during the pandemic. And so many companies and organizations in the last year made the strategic decision that they were going to stop running their own infrastructure technology. And disproportionately chose AWS to help them move to the cloud. And we've spent a lot of time helping them make that transformation. So what about investors? I mean, the stock is down significantly from a peak last year. Obviously, there's broader market turmoil. Yeah, I think, you know, for investors financially, I'd say it's mixed. You know, I think we have some businesses that are growing really strongly. If you look at AWS, you know, in 2021, grew 37 percent year over year. It's not a $74 billion revenue run rate business. It's pretty unusual growth. And we grew 58 percent year over year in our advertising business. You know, it's a $32 billion revenue run rate business. So some businesses growing really strongly. And, you know, we've continued to grow in our retail business despite pretty crazy comparable during 2020. But I think the real challenge for us there is on the cost side. And there have been several things that have happened. Some of which are more controllable than others. You know, I think the part that's less controllable is really around inflation. And I think we thought that inflation would start to attenuate in 2022. And with the war in Ukraine, it just went the other way and has significantly accelerated. And so the cost of trucking and line haul and ocean and air and fuel has just substantially gone up. And I think that will attenuate at some point. No one knows how long that'll take. I think the more controllable areas for us are really around fulfillment-setter capacity and productivity. It was taking about 24 months to build new fulfillment centers during the pandemic. And so we had to make decisions, you know, in mid-2020 and early 2021 on how much demand we were going to plant for. And so, you know, we end up with more capacity than we need right now. Right. And there's a number of things that we're working on. We've stopped building on properties where we don't need it yet. And we've let a number of leases lapse. And not a small number, you know, of both those things. And we've had a lot of occasions in our history where we've worked on productivity and made improvements. And we have a lot of clearly defined niches. And I'm confident we're going to get back to the right level of profitability. You are going to sub-lease 30 million square feet of space. Is there a mistake in the execution there because of the overbuilding? Again, because you have to make these decisions two years in advance. And again, if you put yourself back in 2020 where we were growing 39 percent year over year and you're going to have a $245 billion revenue run rate, it's...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5831,2022-10-23 05:36:35
17426," two years in advance. And again, if you put yourself back in 2020 where we were growing 39% year over year on a $245 billion revenue run rate, it's very hard to know what's the right amount to build and you have to make a decision. And we made the decision to err on the side of our consumers and sellers. Now, how would you grade Amazon's performance with employees, your colleagues? There has been some high profile. Yeah, I think that when I started in this gig, we had just created a new leadership principle to strive to be Earth's best employer. And I think we spent a lot of time trying to think through what that really means is broad. And I think we've made a fair bit of progress, but it's still early, in my opinion. But I still think there are many areas that we can keep improving. And I think the first one I'd mention is safety. I think that in our fulfillment centers, that is the top priority. And when you get into the details and numbers and outside of all the spin of it all, we're about average there, but we're not trying to be average. We want to be the best in the industry and the best in the world at it. And that's a high priority and an area that I'm passionate about and the team is passionate about. And I think we have a lot of work we can do to make our employees everyday lives easier. And we've identified kind of a top 100 list of areas that we can be better at, that we're just metronomically stepping through. And so we've made a lot of progress, but we've a lot of work to you still. Elon Musk just came out saying he has a super bad feeling about the economy, Tesla laying off 10% of his staff. Jamie Dimon says he's preparing for an economic hurricane. The world bank just slashed its forecast for global growth. How do you feel about the economic climate? Well, I wasn't planning on giving any guidance to the government. Please. But super bad or super bad? Bad. I think there's some things that are relates to Amazon that are useful to remember. I think the first piece is remember that 85% of the worldwide retail market segment share is offline. And if you believe that that equation is going to flip at some point, which we do, I think it will flip over a long period of time. If you look at different downturns, should we have one at some point? And we've been through a few, obviously, in the 25 years that I've been at Amazon, customers change their habits. And so I also think there's those two reasons, those two factors give me some optimism that even if we have a downturn that we have the potential to still grow up, we have a roadmap that's probably three to five years long. And we're going to continue to invent. We're going to continue to be insurgent. And we have a lot of work to do to get to where we think we ultimately can get for customers. Now, when it comes to the stock, as I mentioned, it has fallen significantly. Do you think investors are missing something or has tech just been overvalued? And this also, of course, matters to employees who are significantly paid in stock? Well, you know, I look, I haven't been at Amazon for 25 years. I arrived at the company three weeks before we went public. I have never tried to predict what the stock's going to do. In any time, I've tried to a little bit, I've been wrong. So I think it's a pretty hard to predict what's going to be in any short period of time. I do really believe that Benjamin Graham Maxson, that in the short term, the stock market tends to be a voting machine. And the long term, it tends to be a waiting machine. And I think if you, you know, we've been through a lot of points in 25 years at Amazon, where the macro factors are off and stocks are down. Our stock is down. But you can't really control that. We have a concept we talk about a lot at Amazon, inputs and outputs. You know, and the ultimate output for a company is share price. You know, and then other big outputs are free cash flow, or profit, or revenue. You can't really manage the outputs. You have to manage at the input level. And that's where we spend all our time. And so if you do the right things for the business long term, things tend to work out. I think we've had very good returns for investors. And I expect that to be true again. Do you see Amazon strategy as fundamentally different from Netflix and Disney, and if so, how?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5832,2022-10-23 05:40:54
17427," And I expect that to be true again. Do you see Amazon Strategy as fundamentally different from Netflix and Disney and if so, how? From Instagram instead of Instagram, YouTube given it the quality of our immersion through personal investment, but also, our renewable resources and limiterates are Spain and Canada. A lot of the satellites have propulsion systems they can kind of move to get out of the way of each other or change their orbit a little bit. It's a service that you guys offer to help these companies know how to maneuver their machines. Yeah, we offer a collision avoidance service. It's a subscription service. We'll send you an alert up to seven days in advance if your satellite is going to come dangerously close to a piece of debris or another satellite. Companies have been doing that for decades moving satellites around, but it's sort of like a harder problem now. The risk of a collision is a lot higher now. Just because we've installed so much more hardware into space. You have a big collision that creates a cloud of debris and now all the other satellites are flying through this whizzing mess of debris as we add all of the new satellites into space. The risks of the collision, the likelihood of the collision is going up. What are the moon shots at Amazon that are capturing most of your time and attention? What is going to define the next era of Amazon? I mean, is it Astro the home road butter? Is it something else? Well, you know, we have a unique way that we look at big new investments. I'm not sure it's right or wrong. It just happens to be our way. And we ask ourselves when we're considering something for questions. We ask if it's successful, can it be big and move the needle in Amazon? Is it being well served today? Do we have a differentiated approach? And do we have competence there? And if not, can we acquire quickly? If we like the answer to those questions, we'll go pursue it with a single threaded team that isn't distracted by the rest of the business. And sometimes that leads to innovation investments that seem pretty obvious. Like, you know, when I got to that company, it was a book's only retailer and then we expanded to music and video electronics and toys. It seems obvious to people. Other times that process does not lead to investments that seem obvious to people. I mean, AWS was something that people externally and internally thought was little bit nutty at the time. And just imagine what Amazon would be today without AWS. And I think that you see the same thing here. You know, there are so many significant investments from making that I'm excited about. I'm going to have to constrain myself to a few. But, you know, I'm really excited about what we're doing in the prime video space. I think we're clearly on the right track there and building a significant business. That's interesting because Netflix also just announced some layoffs. Our subscriber lost in a decade, Disney cutting back on costs. Do you see Amazon's strategy as fundamentally different from Netflix and Disney and if so, how? Well, you know, we're very bullish on it. And remember, we, all the models are a little bit different. But for prime video, we have 200 million plus prime subscribers who, you know, get that entertainment for free by being part of prime. And so we have a little bit different pricing model than some of the others. I'm incredibly encouraged by what we have coming. If you look, I mean, we launched this show. Reach earlier in the year was a huge hit. We, you know, we had the New Maisel season. We just launched the new Boys season, which is our biggest fan. Are you a May Boys fan? I am a big boy. Because Amazon bought. It's very good. Of course, we have, where are the rings coming up, you know, in September and Thursday and in football. So I'm very bullish about it. We also, you know, we're excited about what we've done with MGM. You know, I think some of the assets there will go very well with the rest of what we're doing entertainment-wise. And so if you look at Warner Brothers Discovery and Paramount and Stars and Global, they're building really significant subscription businesses.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5833,2022-10-23 05:45:20
17428," We'll go very well with the rest of what we're doing entertainment-wise. And so if you look at Warner Brothers' discovery and Paramount and stars and global, they're building really significant subscription businesses. So I'm very bullish about that business. I'm optimistic that we have a chance to build a significant grocery business, which is early stages for us. I am excited about Kuiper, which is our low-earth orbit, satellite that we're building. You've got to remember there are 300 to 400 million people in the world who have limited to no internet connectivity. I mean, just think about how different the world is when you don't have that type of connectivity. And so I think that's a really significant opportunity that has some AWS characteristics to it. I continue to be very optimistic about Alexa. You're building the world's best personal assistant. We have 200 million endpoints already that are using Alexa. We're clearly onto something there. And then our autonomous driving, ride hailing, service, and zoogs that we're building here in Bay Area, I just think with the way auto consumption is evolving, I think that also is a chance to be really significant business. Now, I don't know if all of them are going to be successful, but if any one of them becomes the fourth pillar for us on top of marketplace and prime and AWS, we're a completely different company, just like we were when AWS became successful. So I think they're very worthwhile investments and bets that I'm optimistic about. We didn't mention Astro. I don't yet. Where is it? Yeah, it's not really widely available for sale. What's the status? Oh, I hope you get one. OK. Thank you. Everyone's very curious about Jeff's role these days. What kind of executive chair he really is? He said when he left that he'd focus his attention and energies on initiatives that he really cares about as Ed Amazon, but from the outside, it looks like he's really focusing on philanthropy. He's focusing on space. What kind of an executive chairmen is he? Well, Jeff is always going to be involved. And I feel very lucky to have been in Amazon for 25 years. I feel very lucky to have worked directly for Jeff for 20 of them. And we have a really close relationship and have for a long time. And I think we share a lot of the same values about customers and how important it is to optimize for customers and how high standards they need to be given, how easy it is for people to switch. And the importance of invention and speed. And so I just feel very lucky to have had the chance to work so closely with him. So is your relationship, I mean, he was your only boss for 25 years, right? Is your relationship fundamentally different than it was when you were the head of your... Yeah, of course. Every single job you have, the relationship's different. You know, remember, the first couple of years I worked for Jeff, I worked as what we call his shadow then, which is really like a teeth of staff. And that was different than when I was starting AWS, which was different from when we got AWS going. And it was a business that was starting to do well. And it's different when I'm in the CEO role. But the constant has always been that we have a great relationship and we collaborate really well. Amazon has poised to become the biggest private sector employer in the world. Second, right now Walmart is in that spot. But Amazon will probably soon surpass it. First vote to unionize at Amazon warehouse. I know you've been spending a lot of time at warehouses. When you look at someone like Chris Smalls who I think some people look at as this modern day hero who got fired, pulled off this union vote, what's your message to someone like him? Your message to the folks who think, maybe we should join a union. Well, I know I think that the first thing to be clear about is that employees get to make that choice, whether they want to have a union or not. They always have had that choice and it continues to be their choice. And we happen to think they're better off without a union for a number of reasons, including the fact that, it's much harder when you have a union to have a direct relationship with your manager and to get things done quickly. So if you see something on the line that you think could be better for your team or you or customers, you can't just go to your manager and say, let's change this. There's a whole process in bureaucracy that you have to go through to be able to do that. And when there's a union, we're going to get the feedback filter by what the union decides is worth bringing up.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5834,2022-10-23 05:49:36
17429," to go through to be able to do that. And when there's a union, we're going to get the feedback filtered by what the union decides is worth bringing up. And we'd much rather hear from every employee whatever is on their mind. And so I think if you want to continue to have the structure that we've had for all this time, you have to have really competitive benefits. And then I think if you look at Amazon's, they're very unusual in this space. We championed the $15 minimum wage several years ago. The starting salary is now over $18 an hour, which is more than double the federal minimum wage. You get full health insurance and 401K and up to 20 weeks of parental leave. And if you want to get a college education, you haven't had one. We have a career choice program that lets our fulfillment center associate be able to do so. That is a very unusual and compelling set of benefits. And those were all accomplished without a union. So I think that we realize that we have to continue to work on the relationship with our employees. And we need to continue to provide the right benefits. And we need to continue to work on safety. And that's our intention. You made a huge mark on Amazon with AWS, obviously. What is the mark that you want to make still?

The FTC has revamped its antitrust inquiry into Amazon. And by some accounts is accelerating it. Are you preparing for an antitrust lawsuit from the FTC? If you are a large company that's growing to a significant extent like we have, you have to be prepared to be scrutinized. And we have known this for some time, many years. And we have tried to run the company with that in mind. And knowing that if somebody looked, that we would stand up to that scrutiny. I think that's what we've tried to do in running the business. We can't control whether organizations spring different suits against us. But I think if you look at our business, if you actually look at the fact, if you take out of the equation that there may not be the most objective leadership when it comes to Amazon in that organization, if you look at the facts in our retail business, we're about 1% of the worldwide retail market segment share. And remember, 85% of us is still offline. And if you look in our AWS business, we, depending on you measure it, 95% of the worldwide global IT spend is on premises. And then we have a cloud business, and then we have a portion of that. We were leading market segment share in the cloud part of this. But we operate, who we compete with, with AWS is really on premises, IT, in addition to the cloud. So these are relatively small percentages of the entire pie. And you can kind of step through all the businesses. And I think simply because you've been successful in a few different businesses, doesn't somehow mean that you have a natural market power. It just means you've been successful in a couple different...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5835,2022-10-23 05:53:52
17430," How mean that you have unnatural market power, it just means you've been successful on a couple different customer experiences, but we still have a relatively small amount of market segment share in those areas. What about the SEC, you're being sued by them over third party data and how you've used it? Do you think in the past Amazon made mistakes with letting employees internally see how those third party sellers were doing? We have pretty good control. I mean, we of course disagree with the premise of that, but I would say that we have very good controls with respect to the data that different employees sets are able to see. And by the way, I think that we can be better for sellers. I think that we can have better tools from the get started, we can have better tools from the manage what they're doing across their different Amazon units. I think we can communicate better. There's a whole bunch of things we can do better. And we agonize over every single email or communication we get from sellers, and we do very regularly robust surveying, and a lot more sellers are happy with Amazon than unhappy with Amazon. And I think if you look at what they're able to do as a business by virtue of selling on Amazon versus not, it completely changes what's possible. Sellers don't really long for e-commerce software. That exists in lots of places, and it's not very expensive. What they love about selling on Amazon is that they get access to our hundreds and millions of customers, and that completely changes what their prospects can be in terms of the businesses they're building. So we have a lot of work to do there. We do in a lot of other places, but I think we have a very strong partnership with sellers. What's the view of the supply chain right now, and how much pain there is going to continue to be and for how long? Well, I think that there's a lot of challenges in the supply chain still. I mean, it's gotten better than it was, but there are all sorts of challenges. Non-parasurable goods, electronics, chips are still a really significant issue for all sorts of businesses. We have worked really hard to open a lot more points of presence and ports, and to increase our capacity and getting products in. But I think it's going to be something that companies battle with for some time. You made a huge mark on Amazon with AWS, obviously. What is the mark that you want to make still on Amazon? I mean, in this new role, what's going to define the Andy Jassy era? Well, I don't really think of it that way, Emily. I mean, I don't think it's really about any Andy Jassy era or any one person. And by the way, AWS was not about any one person. If you spend a time on AWS, that is an unbelievable team, not just an incredible leadership team, which it is, but just top to bottom. The number of inventors and people care about customers and operate something where it has to work almost like a doubt, it's always teams. And so I look at every single one of our businesses and take our retail business or our consumer business, which is the oldest for our businesses, 85% of it still lives offline. I think we have a lot of upside and a lot of growth. And I think as much invention as we've seen the last 25 years, the time I've been there, I think it's going to look small compared to the next 25 years. There is a lot for us to invent on behalf of customers. And so I'm excited to be part of the team that makes that happen. We are continuing to increase the amount that we give back to the communities in which we have big presence. And that really matters to me. I think we even responsibility to do that. And so it's a long journey that we're working on. But I'm excited to be part of it and I hope you've started for a long time. Well, thank you for joining us and telling us about the way the journey is going so far. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Thank you, Amanda. Thank you.

Before the COVID pandemic upended the way the world does business, logistics was one of those industries that might have been taken for granted. That's not the case anymore.

17432," Bentham and set ambitious goals for service and performance. When you look at our footprint, you're the most international logistics company there is. We want to become more digital, and we want to be much more sustainable than we have been. DP DHL's revenue has soared since 2020, with full-year profit nearly doubling in 2021. CFO Melanie Christ is a key leader of the team that's delivered these results. She views her role as much more than just a number. Unfortunately, these clichés that finance is boring, and it's been counting in the back office to be successful in finance. You have to have the financial expertise. But we also have to be credible business leaders in order to really impact the business and steer the direction. She is extremely smart and bright. You need somebody who is able to digest a lot of information that are rapidly and can distinguish what is important, what is less important, and she has tremendous skill in that. And she's not afraid to call people out, to call out other members of the executive team if she feels that something isn't being. She does that in a very nice way, actually. She helps me tremendously in steering the company, because she is highly regarded by my other colleagues in the senior team. And typically, if they have a problem, they share first with her before they come to me. When I think about the conversations I have with Frank, the shortest part is actually about the analysis and the facts. It's more the debate about, okay, on that basis, what are the options? What can we do? My role is essentially saying in three sentences, what is working well in this company? Where do we have challenges? And what do we do going forward? Deutsche Post DHL Group consists of five divisions, express Germany's Post and Parcel Service, global forwarding and freight, supply chain and e-commerce solutions. Each of these segments has seen revenue growth in the last four years, while the surge of e-commerce volume during the pandemic has had a direct impact on the trajectory. Have you seen e-commerce as a very structural and fundamental growth rival for us as a company? What we now saw under the pandemic was a structural acceleration. It took us forward to a point in terms of e-compensation, which we probably would have reached on the normal circumstances in three years' time. So it was a big step forward. DP DHL was well prepared to take this step. The company's strategic plan recognized e-commerce as a growing trend in the logistics landscape, but no one could have forecast the speed and breadth of the transformation. What we are now seeing that also under the pandemic, not only domestic e-commerce has taken a faster growth trajectories and anticipated, but also cross-border e-commerce. And we see that very clearly in our express network, but also in our e-commerce solutions division. What are the other big structural shifts that you see on the horizon? Is it e-commerce B2B? Is it increased trade as globalisation restructures? What are the shifts that you're seeing? The board B2B e-commerce is still at a very early stage, so we believe that there will be a huge post-opportunity there. And we also see that when we are talking to our customers now, I guess everybody has been now realized that being dependent on just one supplier in one province in one country is probably not a good idea. So they want to build more resilience into the supply chain. I think our international footprint, our global strengths, is really something we can leverage for the benefit of our customers. Another factor in the company's favour is its balance sheet. Since Melanie Christ became CFO, cash flow has improved significantly. One of my priorities over the last years has been to really focus the whole organisation on better cash generation. It's not just a finance job, making sure that ultimately revenue converts into EBIT and into cash and bank account is the responsibility of the whole organisation. She says, we can't be successful as a company. If we are not collecting the cash for our services, we have provided. And she has not missed one single opportunity to talk about that. I think it's a very...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5838,2022-10-23 06:07:00
17433," It's a company if we are not collecting the cash for our services we have provided. And she has not missed one single opportunity to talk about that. I think it's a very comfortable situation, particularly in the current environment, to have a strong balance sheet. I think in that respect, I'm very conservative and I'd rather have a bit more on the balance sheet and a bit more buffer. Spell out for us what the priorities are, the longer-term priorities, in terms of putting some of that cash to use for you. The first priority here is organic growth. We clearly indicated also with our CAPEX budget, 12 billion for the next three years, that we will keep investing into organic growth. We are very focused on our regular dividend payment. And then, if there is something left, which is fortunately the case at the moment, we will think about inorganic opportunities and we will also think about other means to allow our shareholders to participate. That is why we are currently running a 2 billion euro share-by-back program. Inorganic opportunities include M&A, like the recent purchase of beverage shipper, Hila Brand. But deploying cash is always subject to careful consideration. Does Melanie ever turn around and say, no, when you're pushing through or pushing for a particular package of spending? Yes, she does that quite often, you know, because she has... She is a person and that's great if you have a CEO who is risk-abuse because you need somebody. The business is always too optimistic. Melanie might be something too pessimistic, but that's a very healthy discussion. If we then jointly come to the same conclusion after a debate, then we are probably in the right spot. How often do you find yourself saying no to divisional heads? When I was promoted into the CFO position, my team gave me a stamp with rejected. It sits on my desk. I think the fact that people know it sits there already has instilled quite a lot of discipline in the organization. So I think when I get a proposal, it has already gone through a number of iterations and is normally of such a high quality that I don't need the rejected stamp too often. For the time being, Christ should be able to keep that stamp in a drawer. CEO Frank Appell has expressed a commitment to service quality and confidence that customers will accept higher prices that come with it. If you are too expensive, you will be out of business, but if you don't provide the right quality, you will be out of business as well. So we want to be. We will never be the cheapest in town. That's not doable. We are the premium provider. That's our strategy. Of course, it's also more challenging for us when our customers are under pressure. At the same time, I think, over all the last two years have shown that reliable high quality supply chain comes at a certain price tag. I definitely see that inflation is having a huge impact on the logistics industry. And there's been substantial price increases in the last few years. I do not see that changing. There's a lot of innovation happening. And I don't see the inflation necessarily going away. It might level out a bit, but it's not going to go away. The logistics companies may have pricing power with customers, but their stock prices haven't been so robust. I think the issue there is the increase in interest rates has made everyone rethink and be concerned about the level of inventory that is out, you know, in the system, if you will, and with the level of disruption. I think what's happened more in the last. That means pre-mance gives us more of a view that we're actually heading into. Certainly in the coming slowdown, maybe a recession. With more than half its revenue coming from Europe, investors may see DBDHL as more exposed to recession risks than its global peers. The company insists it can meet its revenue targets in the event of a downturn. It's counting on diversification as a cushion. I'm not so pessimistic that there is really a deep recession at our doorstep. But even then, our portfolio is very much balanced. We are everywhere in the world. The world will not go entirely in recession. I doubt that. Would it be a stretch to suggest that DP.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5839,2022-10-23 06:11:19
17434," Then, our portfolio is very much balanced. We are everywhere in the world. The world will not go entirely in recession. I doubt that. Would it be a stretch to suggest that D.P. DHL is, to some extent, recession proof? I wouldn't go as far as to say recession proof, but I think we are very well positioned to deal with all different types of recessions in our scenarios due to the breadth of support for you. The balance of support for you really gives us a lot of resilience against any type of headwind. Coming up, look at D.P. DHL's investments in action. Melanie Christ shows me around the company's state-of-the-art logistics hub. What I love about this building is it actually shows the big mega trends which formed our strategy 2025. This is Bloomberg. Markets are preparing to close, but the day is not over yet. It's thought that is now up about 45%. A lot of volatility, right now. You need the power of the Bloomberg terminal to get you market moving data before anyone else. There's numbers much higher than expected. I'm afraid it's a day to overweight. You need top analysts to bring you exclusive global insight into cross-asset markets. The mini-bond market......kind of is a really big focus. This one ain't playing along today. It's going to be a short term. Bloomberg markets the close weekdays on Bloomberg. As the chief financial officer of one of the world's largest logistics companies, Melanie Christ has made her mark in global business. That's not what she originally attended to do. I really wanted to go into research. I wanted to become a physicist and that was where my passion was. But then during my studies, some friends of mine started doing this strange thing. They went into management consulting. I didn't even know how to spell it. I had no idea what it was about. But what they told me was quite interesting. So I ended up doing an internship with a consulting firm. I learned more in the two months there than I had in the last two years in my physics job at university. That is how I ended up in consulting. She started her career with three years at McKinsey. Then spent four years in private equity with APAC's partners in London. Before joining Deutsche Post DHL Group in 2004. I was brought into the company to do international M&A project. That was at the time around 20 years ago when we were really building the company in the current shape, acquiring lots of logistics companies around the world. The M&A part was the first thing. And I then wandered into a more mainstream finance field here in the group becoming the CFO of our digital express division. So from then on it was more leading towards the CFO role eventually. Malely Christ now heads the finance team with around 11,000 employees. Success in this role is as much an art as a science. If you do the greatest piece of analysis and you see it all and you know it all, but you can't convey that message and you can't convince the rest of the organization that we should move into a certain direction, it's useless. DP DHL is sending a consistent message with its investments. The company spent 123 million euros to upgrade its logistics centre at the Clone Bonn Airport, designing it around key strategic goals. What I love about this building is it actually shows the big mega trends which formed our strategy 2025, which was inaugurated in 2019 when this building opened. So globalisation connecting the world. E-commerce, we have a lot of sortation facilities here for smaller e-commerce shipments. Sustainability, it's a very sustainable building, there's solar panels on the roof and everything, and digitalisation. And well you can obviously see that it is quite automated. How did the team pitch this investment to you initially? And how hard was it as a sell for them? How quickly did you turn around and say yes, this is worth 123 million euros? Of course you always have to make sure that you have the right capacity for the growth in the network. And at that time they came and said hey, we will really see a strong growth in e-commerce volumes on top of the regular B2B growth, we need more sorting capacity, we need this building. And of course there are always debates, doesn't really have to cost 123 million euros.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5840,2022-10-23 06:15:37
17435," On top of the regular B2B grows, we need more sorting capacity, we need this building. And of course, there are always debates, does it really have to cost 123 million euros and so on? Unfortunately, they convinced us because then with COVID and the volume search, we urgently need it to capacity. At the same time as COVID accelerated demand for logistic services, disruptions in the labor supply hurt productivity. Advances and technology like this digital sauter have helped offset some pressures, but automation also raises questions. Does this tell us that this is the business grows? This is going to become a more automated business, but there's going to be less need for labor for workers. Well, you still see people here and I think what you can nicely witness here is the combination of technology which supports people. So for example, when you look at the customs area, it used to be a very manual and sometimes confusing process. Now the people are supported in picking the right shipments for customs inspections by light and they are automatically sorted in this sauter to go to customs inspections. So it is also helping the people with the jobs they're doing here every day. We've over set you know, in 2019-20. You know, we might get one-third less jobs in the current setup until 2030, if we digitalize the organization. But we are very sure that our company will be at least 50, maybe 100% bigger and we will have more jobs to offer than that. At the beginning of a couple of years ago when we started that journey, people said, oh, you know, I might lose my job. I haven't heard that in the last two years as a question any tone hold. This airport hub also showcases DP DHL's aviation fleet, which both small than 320 dedicated cargo aircraft. We own the biggest chunk of our aircraft, but we also have short and medium and long term leases. And visit growth in our business. We anticipate that the people keep going. You've talked about investing, of course, in sustainable fuel. Yes. When does that come online? How significant is it? Is it just the critics might say that's just window dressing around a part of the business that is of course very carbon intensive, at least a lot of emissions? Yes, so you absolutely write the problem with our beautiful aircraft is the CO2 emissions. And when you look at our overall CO2 emissions, two-thirds are from aviation. It is about flying these birds with more sustainable fuel. And we said that we're really willing to spend billions on it. We now really hope that we will see the uptick and supply over the next years. Spending billions isn't vague hyperbole. The company has pledged to put seven billion euros towards sustainable technologies and fuels by 2030 with a goal of climate neutral logistics by 2050. Sustainability makes good business sense anyway, especially if you are in a business that is energy or fuel hungry as a compliance element that not just operators in the logistics sector need to consider but also their customers. So being transparent becomes part of the service about their impact on the globe. We had a lengthy discussion. Should we make a financial commitment? How much we want to invest for the next decade in our sustainability? We had a long debate. Is it right to say we want to invest seven billion until 2030? There were pros and cons. But that was a very intense discussion, melancholy in I-hat, where we finally came to the conclusion that this is the right number. This is the right approach. We convinced our colleague and that's the reason why we are, where we are, where we are seen as somebody who really commit. They're not meant many companies who have quantified their future investment. Still ahead, how one of the business world's most influential women is working to strengthen gender equality within her company. I think the great thing is that now across the board, in finance, but also in the group overall, we have role models which show young female talent that everything is possible. This is Bloomberg.

Deutsche Post DHL Group's CFO Melanie Christ is often named to lists of the most powerful women in business. And while men still outnumber women as finance heads of large companies, there are signs that the balance is shifting. The number of female CFOs across major US companies has risen to an all-time high according to a study by Chris Calder Associates. And executive search firm Cohen Partners reports that 36% of new CFOs hired by notable companies in the first half of 2022 were women. I asked Melanie Christ if she's encountered obstacles as a woman rising through the executive ranks. I have to say I have not made many negative experiences. Maybe I was also a little bit in the even not thinking about these challenges so much. So I mean when I studied physics, there weren't many women, so I was somehow always used to it. And it can also be an advantage when you're kind of like the only girl in the room. I mean the boss at the end remembers your name and not the 90 guys who all kind of like were dark suits and white shirts and look alike. So I never experienced it as an external stress factor. I have to say for me personally it was more balancing my own expectations around kind of like getting family and the job combined. But that was probably more of a pressure I put on myself thinking that I had to be perfect in every dimension and not something where the pressure was put on me from my male colleagues. So how do you take that experience and put it to play in terms of how you advance the role of women in this organization? I think the great thing is that now across the board in finance but also in the group overall we have role models which show young female talent that everything is possible. In finance we have a share of women in management of 32%. So we are ahead of the group. We want to get to 35% by 2025. I think we are now at a position where if we have a vacancy I want to have at least one woman on the short list. Because we have enough female talent so every short list should contain a woman and then the best.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5842,2022-10-23 06:24:18
17437," If you have a vacancy, I want to have at least one woman on the shortlist. Because we have enough female talent. So every shortlist should contain a woman, and then the best person in the race should win. CEO Frank Appell says Christ sets an example for the entire organisation. And he believes her success may influence the entire industry. She has proven that she is an outstanding CEO for all. And she's definitely a role model in many dimensions. That you know what I like about there. She is still you know a very warm and nice person. And that makes such a big difference. So you can get to that level without compromising on how nice you are as a person. I think she's a great role model. And I hope that this has had positive impact for many others. From the big picture down to the smallest operational details. Melanie Christ is fully engaged in guiding DP DHL into the future. I wanted to know what she sees when she looks ahead. What juice is the biggest opportunities for DP DHL over the next 10 years? I think we have a fantastic portfolio. And we just have to leverage the growth opportunities which are there, both on the ECOM site and also on the traditional B2B site. And the key differentiators for us will be digitalisation, sustainability and our great people. As you look ahead 10 years, what are some of the challenges? What keeps you up at night as you think about the business going forward? I think we have to keep this focus and the ability to adjust in a very agile way. Sometimes when you kind of like think about all the risk controlling and stuff, people tend to create the impression that you can preplan everything. That's clearly not the case. So I think we have to stay focused and keep the ability to react in a very agile way. But looking at what happened over the last 24 months, I'm very optimistic that we will also be able to cope with whatever happens next. And how do you see your role changing in the years ahead? I think it is changing at a very rapid pace, which is a great thing because it never gets boring. Those elements I just mentioned for the group overall, digitalisation and sustainability are also hugely relevant for the finance role. It's like a new language you have to learn. And you learn the vocabulary, but then you also have to develop a feeling if I kind of like put so much capital into this decarbonisation measure, I get so much in terms of return out of it. But that's a fascinating opportunity where we can make a huge difference for finance and for the group overall. What do you think is going to be the skill sets, the knowledge bases, they're going to be essential to the success of future CFOs? Yes, probably the two most essential new skills will be to get even better at lifelong learning because we will have to learn so much new stuff every year. Be it in the digitalisation area, be it on sustainability. So this ability also has a 50 year plus old person to keep learning and keep the curiosity. I think that is going to be super essential. And the second element will be being a great team player. The word is complex, you can't know it all. So you really have to work even more strongly with your team. What advice would you give to someone who's just recently been appointed CFO? That's a great question. I think I would probably simply say, be curious and ask as many questions as you can. Try to learn as much as possible, not only in the finance area, but get close to the business. Try to really understand the business because only when you are close to the business and you understand the fundamental profit drivers will be a really great CFO.

17438," Stagg does stand out because, first of all, it's an energy manifesto. So it transformed something that was dependent on fossil fuels. It uses all the technology to produce something which is essentially carbon neutral and there's a public building. That's a statement. It's a symbol of a city. It's a symbol of a nation. It incorporates works of art. It's recycling and existing building which, as I mentioned earlier, is the ultimate in sustainability. If you can give a new life to a building, it also creates public space at the roof level. It's the most visited parliament in the world, so it puts the public above the politicians who are answerable to them. And that, of course, was made possible by the politicians. So it's a demonstration of democracy in action. Hydrogen has a very special place in the universe. It's the first element on the periodic table. It is the most abandoned element in the universe. And when clean energy advocates think about what can we find which would be as easy to use as fossil fuels, they think about hydrogen. The fuel that will, when burned, only produce water. We like to imagine that if we just built enough of these and these, we could ditch fossil fuels and save the planet. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. There are some things where you just need a good old-fashioned combustible fuel. Now startups around the world are betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century.

What do you think about all this love getting into crypto? I think that that I think was more last year. Do you think it's a way of that past? No, I don't think so, but I think it's like any time that frankly it's when a lot of other people get into crypto, right? Other audiences too. It's when it's in the news a lot. When does that happen? A lot of times when the prices are going up. She was a federal prosecutor going after gangs and the mob before being handed for next assignment. Taking down Bitcoin. Katie Han soon realized this new technology was much more than a tool used by criminals. She dove deep and became a crypto convert, swapping her prosecutor hat for a board seat at Coinbase, and became the first female general partner, Adventure firm and recent Horowitz. Han, now a prolific crypto investor, recently launched her own fund with one and a half billion dollars to deploy. It's the largest fund ever raised by a single investor.

17439," And sure, Katie, huh? Katie, it's so great to have you. Great to be back here in the studio with you, Emily. I want to start with a vibe check. OK. What state of the crypto cycle are we in right now? It was hot. Yeah. And then it got pretty cold. Well, look, Emily, zooming back because I've been in crypto for a decade, if you can believe it. We've seen crypto be really hot and then all of a sudden not. And so we've seen this before. However, I think one of the things that's a little bit different now is with each new crypto cycle, more and more people come into it. And so it's more and more pronounced each cycle. And I would push back on. It's not. I think it depends on what area of the ecosystem you're looking at. We think developers think crypto and Web3 is still really hot. I am seeing a lot less of those. We're all going to make it hashtags. I am seeing a lot less of them, too, although I am spending less time on Twitter. So maybe that's why. But with each cycle, there are new acronyms. What hasn't happened is a crypto winter in the midst of really serious global macro conditions. So we have inflation, kind of at record highs for our generation, in our lifetime. And then we have also a war that's broken out in the Ukraine. And we have a number of other factors going on here. So that's very different. There was some serious carnage out there. Yeah. Socius, Luna, three-houros. What's been your takeaways from? Yeah. I don't want to sit here and tell you that algorithmic stablecoins are bad because I actually think they're really interesting. However, I think what happened is you had, in this case, you mentioned Luna and Tara. That was an algorithmic stablecoin that was getting pretty widespread adoption relative to what the tech could do. I didn't realize you spent your teenage years living in Egypt and learning Arabic. Tell me about your upbringing. I was always uprooted. My dad worked for a large company, and we were always moving just when I would get comfortable in one space. And I think, actually, that's pretty important. If you fast-forward and look at my career, I'm comfortable being in uncomfortable situations. I didn't know a lot about venture when I got into it initially. I didn't know a lot about crypto when I got into it initially. And I was OK asking questions. I was OK not knowing the local acronyms or the Namanclature of a particular field. And I'm taken right back to my teenage years in Cairo, moving from Houston, Texas one day to downtown Maddie in Cairo the next day. You studied law. I did. You clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. That's right. You became a federal prosecutor. You were taking on prison gangs and the mafia. That must have taken a really thick skin. I was doing it at each 25. And now if I take a step back and you know, I think that happens at different points in your career. Like, whoa, if I would have analyzed that a little more at the time. And I'm kind of in some ways glad I didn't. I just dove right in because I found it fascinating. There was a human aspect to it and people's stories. And I felt like those stories mattered. So I was drawn to criminal law and became a federal prosecutor. And I did cases involving violent crime, but then really mistriing cases, being back in the courtroom, being before the grand jury. Like the prosecutor you would see on TV going to try those murder cases. Doing those two hour closing arguments. That's right. And so moved out here to California. I died at the largest prison gang in the world at the time. Outlaw motorcycle gangs, hostage taking, bank robberies, armed bank robberies. There was really not a kind of criminal case by that point in my career. I hadn't done it. It was right around that time, 2012. One of my bosses came in and said, let's have that same energy that you brought to those gang cases, to those murder cases. And let's go ahead and have you investigate this new criminal technology that we really need to look into and possibly shut this down. So you created the first cryptocurrency task force. How would you describe it? Fortunately, several of us in the government realized at the time it's not possible, also not desirable. Because Bitcoin is not an entity. It's not a person. Right, it's a protocol. And it would be like saying, let's go shut down cash. Let's go shut down the internet. It's not possible. Probably wouldn't be a good idea, either. I was using crypto and technologies like the Bitcoin blockchain, because that's all it exists.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5845,2022-10-23 06:37:23
17440," Let's go shut down the internet. It's not possible. Probably wouldn't be a good idea either. I was using crypto and technologies like the Bitcoin blockchain, because that's all it existed then. This is 2012, 2013, to actually uncover criminality. So I didn't think that that technology was bad. Frankly, it was a tool that helped me uncover the various activity. And by the way, it was a step-level function improvement better than compliance by banks. I'll just go ahead and say it. That's a little bit controversial. But I had spent a decade subpoenaing large financial institutions and five times out of 10 didn't get back what I needed. One case I worked on, and people always say, oh, you shut down the Silk Road. What actually happened? I was looking into something completely, not having to do with anything at all of the Silk Road, and came across some, what looked to be some kind of odd activity. And it turns out that a couple of federal agents on the Silk Road Task Force out of Washington, DC, were cropped. And that is the case that I ended up in dining, and I ended up prosecuting those agents, and they both went to prison. So that's the aspect of what Silk Road case that I worked on. I would never have been able to uncover that criminal activity by those agents, because they were federal agents. They knew how to cover their tracks. Had they not used Bitcoin blockchain. So that technology right there, if they had just used wires or cash or bank wires, we would never have uncovered that. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund in front scratch? You will put a woman on Mars. You will bring forth global cooling. You will be the first chief crypto officer. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge, and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer, disrupt, before you change the world, Bloomberg. While Teslas and the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the road today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total US greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building to crowds America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy, the electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Teslas. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels. We want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of US greenhouse gas emissions. So you became kind of a crypto convert after this. You joined the board of coinbase very early on. How did you and coinbase and Brian Armstrong come together? I hosted an event here in San Francisco at the Federal Reserve Bank. And I believe it was there that it wasn't just Brian. It was a lot of what I'll call legitimate actors in crypto who wanted to usher in this new wave, this new ecosystem. And then we brought together the heads of all kinds of agencies, really in an effort to kind of talk about building bridges. The government and the crypto industry were never going to see eye to eye on a lot of things, but we did think there were some commonalities. Coinbase is a company that has suffered. They've been losing share. The valuation of the public markets has plummeted. Why do you think that is? And how do you think it can be fixed? Yeah, well, I think again, a few things it's tied to. One, a large aspect of Coinbase's business now, of course, is trading revenue. And that's down when prices are down. And you know, the company's been very transparent about that long before going public. I mean, also, if you look at its S1, it specifically identifies that. And just how volatile crypto cycles are. So I think that's part of it. It's judged by public markets as a technology.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5846,2022-10-23 06:41:38
17441," S1, it specifically identifies that. And just how volatile crypto cycles are. So I think that's part of it. It's judged by public markets as a technology stock or as a financial services company. By the way, I think it's both. I think it's not just a financial services company. I think it's so much more. I think it's really a portal to this whole new ecosystem. You were also on the board of OpenC until recently there's an insider training situation or accusation going on there. Coinbase has also had employees accused of insider trading. How much is this happening within crypto companies and within the industry and how big a problem is? Yeah. I think crypto is under the microscope. So where you have a case, two cases, three cases in crypto ecosystem, which now is a trillion dollar industry. I think multi-billion approaching trillion dollar industry, you're always going to be able to find examples like that. So I don't want to make too much out of a handful of cases. That said, the company Coinbase OpenC take these things incredibly seriously. Along with your position at Coinbase, you became a partner at one of the most storied venture capital for American Valley and that is Andrewson Horowitz. What was your experience at A16Z-like? There I met Chris Dixon and I met Ben Horowitz and I met Mark Andrewson. And I had worked with them for just about a year, maybe a little bit over when they asked me to come and co-run their crypto funds at Andrewson Horowitz. Again, I jumped at that chance. And I think really that speaks to the fact that, as I said before, things are a hell yes or there are no. And it was a hell yes for me. So Andrewson Horowitz is the kind of place where if you make a partner, you don't leave. How did Mark and Ben respond when you said, yeah, why don't you leave to start a crypto fund of my own? As you might know, Emily, they're an anchor. They're an anchor check into my fund. And I'm very grateful for that. Mark and Chris and folks like them are also personal LPs. So I felt very supported when I shared that decision. And I will say that it was not running away from Andrewson Horowitz. It was running to another opportunity. And you know, crypto is not, what do they say? It's not a spectator sport. It's like, you're in it. It's excuse very young. It's 24-7. It's global. And it's hustle. And at this, and that's a trade-off. It's a life trade-off. And at this point in my career and in my life, if I was going to continue to make that trade-off, I just wanted to do it and do it in a way that was really true to me. So you struck out on your own. Yes. To launch on ventures, what gave you the courage to do that? What was the spark that lit the fire? Yeah. That got you to say, I need to do this and do this now. Sure. What I set out to do was to continue to invest in this ecosystem that I think is so broad that decision was very purposeful. And the timing was very purposeful. We have an early stage fund that does seed stage, series A, even series B. And then we have what we call an acceleration fund, which is, it's not a growth fund. It's a crypto growth fund. And I think those are different things. But it's later stage. It might be crypto-publics. Certain kinds of public tokens were set up to hold tokens to participate in the token ecosystem. Or later stage companies. I mean, there are now several crypto, many crypto unicorns. Space has become really competitive. Even though you say, crypto's had its ups and downs, the thing is, a lot of people in some of those last cycles have seen the kind of venture style returns that can be had in crypto. And so you've had a lot of new funds enter the space. And that's driven up competition. So what differentiates on ventures then? From all of these other crypto funds, or even more traditional venture capitalists, like entries in Harowitz or Sequoia, they also have crypto funds now. Well, I think a lot of traditional venture capital funds now have crypto funds. It used to just be like a regulatory designation. It was like, are you an RIA, which is registered investment advisor? I would say for crypto founders today, it's not enough to just be an RIA, right? They, frankly, I don't even know if a lot of them care. That's a regulatory designation. What crypto founders today want to know is do you live in Brith crypto? Do you inhale the discourse? Are you part of the community? Do you participate in governance? Are you going to be staking these kind of crypto verbs out there? And if you're not really in this space full time, I think it's very hard to run a successful crypto fund. We don't have a hedge fund component. So we're not sitting here buying and trading and selling.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5847,2022-10-23 06:46:05
17442," It's a very hard to run a successful crypto fund. We don't have a hedge fund component. So we're not sitting here buying and trading and selling. That's a hedge fund structure. And there are crypto hedge funds. We're not one. We're making seven to ten year bets. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund from scratch? You know, it's hard, but it's not impossible. We don't have a crystal ball. I don't know. I can't predict cycles, but I knew that we were in a cycle where you saw so much further an excitement around the space. And I already talked about what makes this different. But I think one thing also is we are an nimble strike force. We don't fish in the same pond. We have the crypto natives. We have a fishing execution. We have operators, seasoned operators who really know how to stick the landing. And I think that's reflected on our culture. I would say the only thing that's changed in our strategy as a result of the market correction is really more of a focus on early stage. But we still have our late stage fund. And when we see valuations, which I think will still see correct, spoiler. I think we'll continue to see some corrections. And so we might deploy our later stage fund a little bit more slowly. It might not be on an even 50-50 cadence. And that's okay. Long-term, our strategy hasn't changed. Long-term, we're committed to this space. How much do you think valuations are going to correct? You know, it's just, I can't give you a one-size-fits-all answer because crypto is not a monolith. You have some crypto companies that really follow more of an enterprise-sass business model. You have others that are layer one protocols. You have still others that are consumer-facing applications. And I think one of the things we're seeing right now is the infrastructure layer. And that's where we're spending a lot of our time, by the way. And we think more and more use cases will come about when the infrastructure layers in place. So my own view is we are not rushing to deploy. We're certainly not getting caught up. But you get VC FOMO and have you not to avoid that. Look, I think it's very easy to get into that mindset. Right? It's because it's a competitive sport. It's a competitive space. And I think, I'd be lying if I said that that doesn't influence anyone. I try to, what I do, and I think I do differently, is I try to take stock of that. Oh, that's the FOMO mentality kicking in. That's bad. Again, you don't want to over-correct, though. What we look for is we look for amazing founders. It doesn't matter if I think valuations will correct. If there are amazing founders, there's a huge tam. We also look for what's your regulatory plan? If you're launching a token, what's your plan to comply with the law? What's your plan for security, by the way? We've seen a lot of hacks in the space. We want to really dive in there and make sure that the founders have been thoughtful about, especially if they're custodian customer funds, keeping those funds secure. If it's a cross-chain bridge, what are the exploits? Have you changed your strategy at all, given the downturn? Have you backed out of any deals or decided not to do certain deals? Because the conditions have changed since you raised the phone. We have decided not to do certain deals. We've never backed out of a deal. We have decided not to do a few deals. Because we think that pricing was ahead of progress, candidly. And we might have been wrong about that, Emily. We might have been wrong about that. But I think if we were wrong not to do a couple of deals, better that we might have been right, because if we were wrong about that, I think we can find a way to still invest in those projects later. Well, one thing I'm hearing is that a lot of dry powder has just sucked up. Yes. Because all these funds raised a lot of money raised, what was the biggest fund ever for a single person, not just a woman? Anyone? Are you confident you're going to have a place to put all that money? I am, but if I don't have a place to put it, I'm not just going to go willing, nearly deploy it. One of the things that we told our LPs even during the period when we raised our fund, which was when crypto was undeniably still on a bull run, we said that we are going to be pretty steadfast, sticking to a two-year deployment cycle. And I think one thing that's changed is that might have lengthened. It certainly hasn't shortened. But we will, again, we feel very good that we have the capital to back great teens when we see them. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind. We're falling behind.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5848,2022-10-23 06:50:21
17443," EC The market's come down in Europe from the financial centers of the world. Bloomberg markets European foes with Guy Johnson in London and Alex Diel in New York. You will shed light on dark matter. You will make aging optional. You will turn 5G up to 11. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent a pioneer disrupt, before you change the world, Bloomberg. It will start dropping out of theёт it will start dropping out. that is like the plumbing, if you think of the fiber-optic cables. Remember, you couldn't have had YouTube and Netflix with dial-up. You couldn't have streamed content. The same is true of crypto use cases. We think that there will be a lot of new use cases unlocked when the infrastructure is there, when it's more efficient, when it's more user-friendly. And so we're spending a lot of our time there. President Biden issues this crypto executive order. There are a number of ports that are coming due. What do you want to see from the administration when it comes to regulation and are you optimistic that we will get there? Yeah. We were so delighted to see that executive order. This is not something you should normally be delighted about. But why we were is because it was to us a real recognition that this is a US government saying, this field isn't going anywhere. This field is growing. It's growing so much that we are going to direct every single agency in the federal government to come up with a plan here. I think we take a step forward, but then you see, we're a big government. We're a big system. We have states. We have local entities. So we take a step forward with the EO. And then we take some steps back sometimes too. And I think what I see as crypto founders are confused by that. They're starting to think, well, I could go to this jurisdiction where there's a single regulator. And you don't have 50 states with different rules. It's the US government that needs to start taking stock of the fact that right now, Emily in China, there's a quarter of a billion, ECNY wallets, a quarter of a billion. We're still talking about whether there should be a government central bank digital currency. We're still studying that. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind China. And we're falling behind. What are the dangers of falling behind China and the rest of the world? This is years ahead. So I don't want people to take a headline and say, oh, I think the US dollar will be no longer the global currency, reserve global currency. I'm not saying that now. But fast forward decades. And if you no longer need to use the dollar, because you have an alternative, I think that's a real problem. What would we use instead? Well, I think that there are going to be stable coins out there that people who have access to a smartphone will use. There is a demand for it. We see our 285% year-over-year growth with stable coins. So people are clearly liking the idea of this. Now, again, there have been some spectacular failures, too. But not all stable coins are created the same. But I think the important thing is that we really do need to not just quash innovation. What do you think of how Gary Gensler, the chair of the SEC, and how he's approaching it? One of the things that I hear from founders is that they're very confused.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5849,2022-10-23 06:54:47
17444," is that we really do need to not just squash innovation. What do you think of how Gary Gensler, the chair of the SEC, and how he's approaching it? One of the things that I hear from founders is that they're very confused because they get told, come in, register. Just come in and talk to us. But you have the one company who's done the ultimate act of going in and registering coinbase, filed an S1. And still, there's a lot of saber rattling still going on, I think. And again, I don't want to single out the SEC. And I don't want to suggest that anything they're doing is bad. I do think, though, that right now there's a lot of confusion. And one of the pieces of confusion stems from the fact that, you know, and it started with the ICO mania back in 2016, 2017. I can't even remember which year now, where the SEC was very loud about securities. A lot of them were securities, but the space has changed. And so to still view it through the ICO lens, when so much has happened over the last five years in the space, I think is a mistake. What do you have to say to the skeptics out there who just don't believe in the future of Wem 3? And don't see where this is going. Yeah. I would say don't judge the current state of innovation by the end state of innovation. I hear from a lot of these skeptics. And by the way, I'm friends with a lot of these skeptics, too. I don't only want to live in a crypto bubble. They want to see the use cases, especially if they're not technical. Well, when am I going to use it? What will I use it for? And I think one of the things that's not appreciated is how quickly the infrastructure here is catching up. And once you have really scalable blockchains that can handle a lot of thorough put and are very efficient, I think that unlocks a whole lot of use cases. People are spending more time on screens. That curve is up and to the right. Whether we like it or not, that is the future. I mean, those who have kids know that kids spend more time online. They want digital things, too. And I think to dismiss it, it is a bit generational. I do find not always, but it is a bit generational. If you talk to kids about being able to have money online, they instantly get that concept. They're comfortable not having to hold something in their hand to think it has value. Take us to the end state. Do Google, Amazon, and Facebook and Apple still exist? I believe they will still exist. I mean, it depends what you talk about when you talk about the end state. I think that for decades, those companies will still be around. But the important thing is, I think this new ecosystem is going to represent a challenge to them. I do think that those entities, decentralized forces, are coming, and we'll cut into those entities, profits, and revenues. So we have a little rapid fire section. If you could belong to any altcoin tribe, that's what it be. Gosh. There is no way I'm answering that, because I will get trolled on Twitter by every other altcoin tribe. I'm a crypto-maximalist. I'm a crypto-maximalist. All right, well, I'm not picking one. Booker podcast, you're binging now. Yeah. OK, yes, I am. Gosh, I'm binging on wheat crashed. Something that brings you simple joy. You know, one of the things that I love, and I've missed being away from this summer is swimming. I just love, I find like some of my best thoughts come to me while I'm moving. Career philosophy. Yeah. Do a job where you know 50% of the job, and where you're going to learn 50% of the job. Again, that goes back to no growth in the comfort zone, no comfort in the growth zone.

17445," MUSIC Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world recalibrates. Often decades of stagnation Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation. Corporate giants, policymakers and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that. Every week on Japan ahead, right here on Bloomberg Television. So what's the best investment advice you've ever given by anybody? The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day and if you keep added and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's not just interest. It was always said about compound interest returns, compound business returns, compound human returns. They're all very additive because you learn every day and if you keep added, it's very, very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make? Selling at the wrong time. And they sell when the prices go down? Yes. Or yes. Not keeping. But people have conviction or they invest for the, if they invest for the right reasons, they just keep added.

My job is to piss everybody off. And so if I don't do that, I'm not doing my job. At six foot four inches and more than 300 pounds, Dominic and Sue has done his job in the NFL for 12 years now. Sometimes maybe too well. You got frozen feet and didn't realize you were stepping on my calf. You also stopped doing my teammates at one point. He's been, you know, at my time one of the most dominant three techniques in the game. And I understand not everybody is going to like me and that's okay. But I guarantee the people that don't like me don't know who I am. And having me even taken the time to get to know me. After spending a few days with the Dominic in here in the rainy city of Portland, I've gotten an insight into a soft spoken native Portlandian, family man restaurant tour and realist state investor who's endeavoring to have more impact with his businesses than he's had against quarterbacks in the NFL. It's a simple concept of like I don't want to be at the top of the pyramid or be amongst the 1% and be there by myself. I want to bring other people with me that are like mine didn't you want to work with them. And when you have the opportunity to help other people at the same time, it's a smart business decision.

17446," One who is so single-minded on the field seeing Sue in his native habitat, it's a bit startling and not just because he's a dad. From his home office bouncing from zooms to calls to texts, he's methodically creating an empire. It includes investments in tech companies like Quip and Ember and hospitality investments, including restaurants in Portland and beyond. But the primary focus for Sue has been real estate. Of the past decade, much of his investments have been focused on multifamily and commercial projects. So tell me your business philosophy like in a nutshell, like how do you distill it down? Just understanding that investing and social impact can go without question-hand at hand. And I think you can impact other people's lives and do good, but at the same time, make smart business decisions, where it's I've always seen it as a true give-and-take relationship versus just someone always taking. And I think that's where that capitalistic mindset that majority of America lives in. Yeah, in this guy. Yeah. It's a short trip from where we're sitting to see where Sue came from. His home in the offseason is here in the Irvington District of Portland, and his house is only a few streets away from where he grew up. This hoop's been here for ages. Oh my gosh. And the family that own this house, their son actually played the NBA. There used to be at the far end, we called our little room, where we'd have our main death contest. What was Portland like when you were growing up, me now it's seen as this like boom town, right? But was it like that 20 years ago? No. Portland was very, very small. Everybody knew everybody pretty much. Growing up in Portland, Sue was surrounded by sports. Nike's headquarters was just 20 minutes away, and he still works out there when he's home. His older sister in Goom Sue also became an elite athlete. She'd end up going to the 2004 Olympics as a soccer player, playing for their father's home country of Kimmeroo. Oftentimes in a family, especially when you have multiple superstars, it's clear that like this family's in the business of growing superstar athlete. My parents could care less about it. They wanted us to be in athletics and have that fulfillment of being in sports, but hands down education was a number one. And my sister's super smart. She got a degree in kinesiology and biological sciences. Sue's parents divorced when he was two, but stayed close. His mom was an elementary school teacher and his dad owned an HVAC company. As a young kid, I enjoyed going to work with him. I got to spend a lot of time with my dad on job sites, and it's really what got me into the business. As I got a little bit older towards middle school, it would be me going to the job site and being out and saying, you can earn $5, $10 towards your bike. He just wanted to see if I'd be willing to get up at 6 o'clock in the morning. This is my dad's house that we grew up in. We bought the building, lived on one side and rented the other side. And that's where we really started to learn about real estate, or how I started to learn about real estate. From those early days, Sue's fascination with an ambition in real estate only grew. Especially as a pro football career gave him the means to hide bigger and bigger projects. He's been buying and building property in his hometown of Portland as well as across the United States, including luxury residential, office and hospitality space, and affordable housing. All with a mission to help build generational wealth through real estate. And real estate is one of the most tried and true places to store and grow wealth. Buying and owning property, commercial or residential, when done right can be a source of income as well as a crew value over time. That's if you choose projects wisely and have patience. Over the past few years, the pandemic both increased demand and lowered the supply of housing, leading to skyrocketing values. At the same time, low interest rates made acquiring the capital needed to purchase properties, even easier. More recently though, rising mortgage rates and new supply had begun to change that picture and rents have been increasing at historic levels. Oning real estate has the additional benefit of influencing maybe even transforming the neighborhood and the community around you. That's an idea passed down to Sue from his father.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5852,2022-10-23 07:07:41
