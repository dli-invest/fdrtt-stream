14074," When I was 24 years old, I saw the UFC on a paper view on TV and I was so overwhelmed by the athleticism, the skill. And then at the end of the fight, the combatants hugged, they shook hands and I just fell in love with it. Part of UFC's appeal is it doesn't look like a ballad athletic display of martial talent in mastery as much as it looks like a bar fight. We choose to do this because we love this sport but it is a business and if you do not treat it like a business, I guarantee you that the promoter is and you will be left broken, broken at the end of your career. Each of us have an individual story but as with anything you take enough of these individual stories and you see not only crossover but intersectionality. A group of former UFC fighters that are suing the UFC scored a key legal victory on Thursday when a federal judge said he would grant their lawsuit class action status. There have been fights in every major US sport about workers' power in the labor market. I don't think there's a guy in the sport from the guy who just got his first fight all the way up to the Conor McGregor's that is pleased with the way the UFC treats fighters. The way we've been strong armed, the way we've been coerced. Fights over unionization in some sports, fights over free agency in baseball and in boxing the Muhammad Ali Act which restricts the kinds of contract terms that can be imposed on boxers. The fighters who brought this lawsuit see it as the continuation of a tradition in sports of athletes fighting to have agency and power in the terms of their work and who they do it for. Mixed martial arts used to be pretty culturally and legally fringe in the United States. It was banned by most states. John McCain had famously called it human cock fighting. There are some rules in the UFC but to a large extent all sorts of body parts and tactics and attacks are on the table and people get seriously injured at times. My nose has been broken multiple times. I had my right pectoral torn off how to get that reattached. I've had my jaw broken in two places I've had my neck broken. I had my left ankle broken how to get that repaired. I've had a torn right labor in my shoulder. He broke my eyeball. I mean the bone that holds up my eyeball. I've had my left eye or a little fracture twice when my eye caved in. I was falling my own blood. I knew don't blow your nose or both eyes of the world. At the time that UFC was bought for just $2 million by the former boxing coach Dana White and a casino owner. He'd been friends with Lorenzo Fertida and his brother Frank Fertida. UFC was struggling as were other mixed martial arts promoters. It was pretty much a fixer upper. The money that they spent to actually purchase it for $2 million was much less than the money they quickly had to sink into it in order to revitalize it. They've hold off a multi pronged strategy that was quite successful. First they did what White has referred to as running towards regulation. They found ways to make compromises with state regulators so that the sport would not be illegal. And at the same time, they also popularized it. They made gambles like paying the production costs themselves for the first season of a reality TV show The Ultimate Fighter on Spike TV. UFC.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2300,2022-10-13 00:00:49
14075," show the ultimate fighter on Spike TV. UFC under Dana White had a gift for weaving, compelling personal narratives and rivalries, people throwing shoes, a guy coming to the oxygrapant with some of the dogs out playing while he was dragging another guy on a leash. My first contract with the UFC is kind of an interesting story because here I am on this reality show the ultimate fighter and they started to realize how big of a stepping stone this was going to be for the UFC. It's at us all down individually, put a contract in front of us and said, hey we realized this is going to be huge and we really want to have you all a part of it. UFC family moving forward so we want to go ahead and get this out of the way just sign this simple contract and we'll be able to move forward as one unit. But as I'm looking at this thick contract and wondering what I should do, Dana White looks at me and says, don't worry, this thing takes off, we'll take care of you. The fighters would say at the heart of UFC's power is the contract that it signs with fighters. Before boxing had competition boxing used to be dominated by a few dominant promoters and the contracts were ported over from boxing and the contracts are basically designed to control every aspect of a fighter's career. There are long-term, they last multiple fights. Fighters under these contracts are bound to fight only for UFC for a period of time and UFC can extend that time if a fighter declines a match or if a fighter gets injured. They control who the fighter fights, they control when the fighter fights and then they have a number of different clauses that make it very difficult for a fighter to ever break free from UFC if that fighter ever did want to become a free agent. Contracts are so one-sided there really is no negotiation room for any of the things especially as you're coming up and as there's stranglehold on the sport of MMA got so much stronger. Part of what's at the heart of this lawsuit is the ways that UFC successfully took other competitors off the board. The UFC had such a stranglehold on mixed martial arts and as they were buying up so much of the competition shutting them all down they really became the the only option for anybody that wanted to do this professionally. If you follow Dana White's Twitter or watch him on YouTube you could have seen Dana White calling himself the grim reaper and bragging about how he has defeated or derailed or acquired one after another company that tried to compete with the UFC. In 2011 UFC acquired strike force which at the time was the most prominent rival still standing. The CEO of strike force Scott Hoker has said in the past that he saw himself like Luke Skywalker up against the death star trying to compete with UFC. Eventually when strike force was bought out by UFC my only option was go to UFC because they had the rest of my contract. Now I'm under a contract where it's only an 18 month contract with six fights but five years later I'm still stuck in the contract.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2301,2022-10-13 00:05:20
14076," The month before UFC's parent company, Zufa, completed its acquisition of Strike Force, a UFC executive sent an email and the subject line of that email was, we own MMA. And the UFC has admitted in documents that have now become public, that they've almost never lost a fighter that they wanted to keep. In internal UFC emails, we now know the company referred to what it was doing as choking off oxygen to the competition. The most important oxygen that UFC allegedly ran a foul of the law by cutting off to its competitors is the fighters themselves. And not only did they make it clear to us, they made it clear to the whole mixed martial arts world, there is no negotiating. These are our very strict, never-ending contract. You sign here, if you don't want to, we've got 20 other guys that will take your spot. They have 70, 80, 90% of the top fighters under exclusive contract, meaning that those fighters are not available to any other MMA promoter. And fighters, even if they wiggled their way out of the very restrictive contract that UFC imposed on them, didn't have another professional mixed martial arts option because there weren't robust rivals to go sell their work to. On Tuesday afternoon, a class action lawsuit was filed in US District Court in San Jose against a Zufa LLC with fighters, Kung-Li, Nate Corey, and John Fitch attached to the suit. The Rampey Jackson came to me and said, hey, Kung, I know this lawyer, he will help get the fairness for the fighters in the marketplace. And I decided I wanted to step up for all the fighters that he affected. At the end of 2014, more than six years ago now, a group of now-all former fighters filed an anti-trust class action lawsuit against UFC. And in broad terms, the case is an antitrust case where we're claiming that the UFC is both a monopoly and a monopsony. Usually, when we talk about monopoly, we're talking about the power that a company has when it becomes the only one selling something. Money is about the power of being a monopoly purchaser of something, and particularly a monopoly purchaser of labor. A key argument in this lawsuit has been about as UFC succeeds in its revenue sores, how much should we expect that absent illegal conduct, the fighters pay would soar as well. When UFC, year after year, the share of the company's revenue that goes to actually paying the workers doing the fighting, has hovered around or below 20%. And what this analysis shows through complex statistical regression modeling is that if the UFC was competitive and did not allegedly violate the antitrust laws, it would pay its fighters 50% or more of the revenues generated just like baseball, just like hockey, just like basketball, boxing. If instead of paying 20% of the revenues generated, it paid 50% or more of the revenues generated, the fighters would have made $1.6 billion more during the period that we measured 2010 to 2017. Sometimes when you write about allegations against companies and particularly about lawsuits against companies, those companies don't want to say a whole lot about them or are pretty dismissive of the significance of litigation against them. UFC in their comments to me has been pretty feisty.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2302,2022-10-13 00:09:26
14077," or are pretty dismissive of the significance of litigation against them. UFC in their comments to me has been pretty feisty about this, saying that they see this lawsuit actually as a threat to the ability of businesses to take risks and succeed, and that they don't want to roll over, that they want to fight it and they want to defeat it. The fighters I talked to described having side jobs, being reliant on UFC in part because after taxes and expenses, they weren't making enough money to feel financially secure. The overview of my career from a financial perspective is something that had a challenge in admitting, I can tell you now that I lived in my mom's attached to Rob's the entire time I was fighting and I had a second job as a bouncer and a bartender, a third job as a personal trainer, just to make ends meet. Nate Quarry told me that over his time in UFC, he fought fights while he was tens of thousands of dollars in debt coming into the fight. It gets so disheartening because I've seen fights that are called the fight of the year. This is just this brutal war and they battled for four and a half rounds until one guy's body just gave up and then you find out, oh that guy made $60,000 for that fight. In one of the hearings in this lawsuit, UFC's attorney argued that if the fighters were really the product, if all that UFC were selling were the fighters, then the fighters wouldn't need UFC at all, that a fighter is not themselves the UFC product any more than an Apple engineer who makes a cool iPhone is the product that Apple is selling. We the fighters make this whole thing happen and it's been driven by Chuck LaDelle, it's been driven by Reyna Couture, it's been driven by Conor McGregor, it's been driven by Brock Lesnar, it's been driven by all the greats that have walked before us and that walk this path right now. We are the product. If the fighters are not the product, then go ahead and release us from our contracts. You'll do fine without us, clearly. It's the identity and rank and popularity of those fighters that attract the eyeballs and make the sport what it is and if you can lock all those up and keep them from other promotions, you can dominate the sport, which is what they've admitted they've done. Well, you're my ex-in, a lawyer for UFC, said in a statement that UFC has spent many years building a world-class organization, enhancing the brand of our athletes and championing the sport of MMA. UFC pays its fighters more than any other MMA promoter with average fighter compensation rising by over 600% since 2005. Our efforts have raised the global popularity of the sport and the overall revenue potential of all MMA organizations and athletes. In December of 2020, the judge announced a crucial step in this lawsuit, which is that he is going to certify it as a class action. Class certification makes this lawsuit a much more significant threat to UFC and the judge made clear long before saying how he planned a rule that he expected whatever he did to be appealed into federal appeals court and on from there to the US Supreme Court. So we are likely in for many more months and years of wrangling over this. Kyle Kingsbury said that he doesn't think any settlement would be acceptable unless it includes a change to the restrictive contracts that UFC uses to keep fighters bound to the UFC. My son is about to turn six years old and it started when he was in the womb. You know, we're in this thing to the end to change the sport forever. We want the same freedoms that are offered in any other major sport and we're, every other major sport has gone through what we're going through right now. People tell fighters, you know, just shut up. Look at how lucky you are. Well, no, actually we're fighting for what we believe.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2303,2022-10-13 00:13:55
14078," People tell fighters, you know, just shut up. Look at how lucky you are. Well, no, actually we're fighting for what we believe in. We're going to continue being fighters, and that's how we, how we're made. We're going to continue being fighters, and that's how we're made. We're going to continue being fighters, and that's how we're made. Every nation that's a coastal state has some region of the sea floor that falls in their territorial waters, and many countries including the U.S., the area that's underwater exceeds the area that's above water. So huge amounts of nations, areas and regions are just really unexplored, uncharacterized. We don't really know what's there. We know less about our sea bed than we do about the surface of the moon or Mars. Only 20% of it has been mapped. A map of the sea floor could lead to all kinds of discoveries, like numerous species, and rare earth minerals like cobalt that we need for electric cars and mobile phones. The value of all the gold deposits are loan on the sea floor is estimated to be around $150 trillion. The map could also help us when tragedy strikes. Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared from radar screens. The mapping of the ocean floor has been carried out. The problem is that the southern Indian Ocean is just so incredibly huge. To me, a map is a fundamental piece of understanding of who we are, where we are, where things are. Once you understand something, you start to value it more. When you start to value something, that's when you start to really think about making it healthy and preserving it and keeping it going. A map is the first step. It's the basic understanding that you need to figure out where you are. Oceans. They cover over 70% of the planet, but most of what lies underneath is a mystery. The sea floor is a really fascinating landscape. We don't have a lot of data to describe the shape of it in detail. But in places where we do, there are spectacular features. There's meandering channels with all kinds of interesting topography. There are canyons, there are sea mounts, mid ocean ridges, all kinds of things that we see on land that are just basically hidden from us by the water. As it stands, this is what a map of the sea bed looks like. All that black? Those are the parts we haven't mapped yet. At present, most people think that the sea floor is actually mapped because you'll see a world ocean map and you can see some shape of the sea floor. But most of that is based on prediction. Roughly 80% of what you see for the world ocean floor is modeled based on measurements of the sea surface height and a computation based on gravity. In 2017, the Nippon Foundation and the General Barthometric Chart of the Oceans, or JEPCO, launch Sea Bed 2030. It's a collaborative project to collect and collate data oceanwide and create a complete map of the sea floor by the end of the decade. To do this would take one ship around 350 years at a cost of up to $3 billion. That's why data is harvested by all kinds of vessels from fishing boats to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2304,2022-10-13 00:18:12
14079," To do this would take one ship around 350 years at a cost of up to $3 billion. That's why data is harvested by all kinds of vessels from fishing boats to freighters. Because there is so little data, it's important that vessels that are capable and willing to acquire data when they're just moving around the ocean do so. So we have a lot of data that's collected during transit. There's a lot of academic requirements to make data publicly available. There's industry data that's starting to become more and more available. There's government data. So there's a lot of different ways that this data is coming in and it's a really messy and challenging puzzle to put together. But what's exciting is that it's a puzzle to put together. Since SEBA 2030 launched, the area map has risen to 20 percent and all the information collected is freely available. The more data we have collectively and other people can access, the faster the discoveries are made, which really pushes forward our understanding at a faster rate than if you held on to that data and it was only you with that data. Things like machine learning and artificial intelligence are also going to kick in in the next decade. Because with all this data, they'll be able to make connections that are a lot faster than perhaps we would have been able to, which then again feeds our human understanding and also gives us new ideas, new ways of thinking, of exploration. Until the early 20th century, mapping technology was simple. Usually a weight attached to a long rope known as a lead line. After the Titanic sank in 1912, explorers proposed using sound waves to find its hull in the North Atlantic. This led to Sona, the most common technique used for mapping today. Operated by the Schmidt Ocean Institute, the Falcore is an 82 meter long research vessel equipped with two multi beam Sona systems that have helped Deborah Smith and a team of other marine technicians to map over a million square kilometers of the sea floor. You know, you go from somebody with a rope with some knots to Sona or Acoustics, that is I call it math magic, but it is incredibly advanced mathematical technology to be able to measure the distance and time of travel of sound on a moving ship. Multi beam mapping works by using Sona's. So Sona is taking sound and the measurement of time. So you have a multi beam Sona and it sends out a ping of sound. That sound travels through the water column, hits the sea floor and comes back to the ship and we measure that time and we're able to calculate the distance. Each individual ping of sound has many, many beams. So it looks like a giant fan across the sea floor and that fan is moving along the sea floor. So you have many tiny little beams going across and they're traveling along a track. You can look at that data and look at both the peaks and the valleys and the highs and the lows and sort of create a three dimensional image of the sea floor. The accuracy of multi beam Sona really depends on the water depth that you're in. Think of it like a flashlight beam and if you're holding a flashlight and you're shining it on the floor, the closer you get to the floor with your flashlight, the smaller that beam is. If you have 400 of these beams all across, so think of 400 people holding a flashlight. The closer they hold that flashlight to the sea floor, the smaller your beam is, which also means the smaller that you can find information or data about. So it really depends on the depth of the sea floor in order to see how much you can define an object. This variation in depth means that mapping resolution will range from 100 by 100 meters in shallow waters to 800 by 800 meters in the deepest parts of the ocean, which go down as far as 11,000 meters. Remotely operative vehicles or ROVs can then be sent down to investigate sea bed features up close. We've just crossed the 1000 meter mark. It's 4.6 degrees C and now we're going to drive the ROV down at a high rate towards the sea floor. On a recent mapping expedition, scientists on the Falcon were discovered a 500 meter tall coral structure in Australia's Great Barrier Reef.

14080," On a recent mapping expedition, scientists on the Falcourt discovered a 500 meter tall coral structure in Australia's Great Barrier Reef. The first to be discovered in over 120 years. A place that is incredibly popular, well-visited, well-traveled, you know, we're still finding new things. You don't know until you map it. And so until you get that sort of high resolution picture, you don't know the sand waves or the old river beds that used to be there. Or the waterfall is off the side of a volcano that used to be above the surface and now is below the surface. It's a little bit of everything. Think of let's say Hawaii or someplace where you see a volcano above the water. Picture that below the water. I'm really kind of obsessed with the whole concept of scale here. Although we can create 3D models and, you know, kind of come up with these visualizations, it's not the same as that feeling of looking out over this big landscape. But, I mean, I think we'll get there soon with VR and other kinds of technology. But it's really spectacular to think about, especially with the familiarity that some of us have with these features, like what it looks like. We look out at the ocean and it just looks flat, maybe with little bumps. We really don't think about all of this that's underneath. It's really an amazing landscape that's just hidden from us. With more than 90% of the ocean deeper than 200 meters, fleets of autonomous vehicles could make the data gathering process faster, cheaper and safer. And new discoveries might help with exploration of all kinds. I think the ocean can actually provide us with huge incidences, we go out into space as well and look for life and other kinds of life forms. I also think in this next few years, we will have a different kind of access to the ocean because of virtual reality and augmented reality. And so that will allow us to sit in our living rooms and really experience what's underwater in a different way and see this different alien planet. You You Since the dawn of man, meat has been on the menu. And even with growing trends of vegetarian diets and plant-based substitutes, around 89% of the world population consider themselves omnivores. We have come a long way from our hunter and gatherer roads. We have managed to establish a whole industry designed to feed almost 7.7 billion people. We've maximized production and we managed to reduce hunger over the past couple of decades. And although we've become exceedingly efficient at putting meat on the table, raising livestock animals by the billions comes with its own set of consequences. If animal agriculture continues to expand the way it has, there is a race that we won't be able to stop climate change. But with rapid advances in technology, we might soon see a food industry that leaves all those problems behind. I'm Biped To Be one of the world's",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2306,2022-10-13 00:26:46
14081," I'm baked to be one of the world's first commercial customers for lab-grown meat, cultured meat. It's eat-just as the company and I'm very, very excited. Here is the chicken meat. It's pretty crispy outside. It's really good. I mean, look, it's really tasty. Here at 1880 in Singapore, cultured chicken is being served under a regulatory approval granted by the Singaporean government. It's the very first time a cultured meat product, meat made from animal cells grown in a lab, has been approved for commercial sale. Eat-just, the company behind these chicken nuggets style dishes is based out of San Francisco and got their start in 2011 developing plant-based egg substitutes like mung bean scrambled eggs and mayonnaise. But it wasn't until 2017 that they announced they were shifting focus to a cultured meat product. In order to feed the world that we live in, a lot of animal protein, we need to take a third today and it'll be more tomorrow of our world and make it dedicated to feeding chickens and cows. We go to areas that are filled with biodiversity and biodiversity, taking a bulldozer to them and planting soil and corn, to feed the chickens that we climate change is accelerated by the kind of animal production that we engage in. We bring animals in tiny little spaces that accelerates the probability that more zoonotic diseases are going to impact our families. And from a morality perspective, why do we need to cause any harm to any other living thing, to have dinner that tastes good? It does not have to be that way. And those things underlie the force of this idea. The meat alternatives that have made it to the market thus far have been plant-based. Imitation, beef and pork made from ingredients like pea protein and coconut oil by companies like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods. That's a very different proposition from cultured meat, which is made from actual animal cells. I'm a huge fan of any company of any person trying to make a product that's improving the food system, including all the plant-based proteins. Maybe in some future menu you'll have this kind of cultivated chicken and you also have a plant-based version. That's fine. But I guess you have to ask yourself in our lifetime, is that diner likely to also remove the conventional option on the menu too? We do think we need a more permanent solution. We do think we need, if you will, an end game to this problem. And we just think this is more likely to be the path to achieve that. So animal cell technology has been around for several decades for applications such as development of vaccines and other biotherapeutics. The first known prototype of cultured meat was done by Mark Post earlier in 2011. And essentially it was developing beef patty. It was a very expensive prototype. If I'm not mistaken above 250,000 euros at the time to produce just one beef patty. It was more of a group of concepts to really demonstrate that this technology is possible and that it can be done. The way that we grow and produce culture chicken is essentially a week isolates chicken cells from the chickens without having to kill them. So from a small biopsy, for instance, be mercy cells in a liquid broth that contains the nutrients that the cells need to survive and be healthy and to grow. We really need these cells to multiply, to reach the numbers that are sufficient to make a meat product. We're looking into the cells that are really important for meat. So we think about muscle cells, fat cells, by the isolation we are able to form those muscle tissues in culture. The culture happens inside of a fermentation tank, what we call the bioreactor, which is essentially providing the same conditions as the animal body. We've got warm temperatures, some sort of mechanical stimulation so that the cells are exposed to very similar conditions that they have inside of the animal. We're the cells proliferate and reach the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2307,2022-10-13 00:31:16
14082," emulation so that the cells are exposed to very similar conditions that they had inside of the animal. After the cells proliferate and reach a certain density, the final step is essentially to separate those cells from the liquid broth that they are in. We just make sure that the product meets our quality and safety standards and then those cells are ready for consumption. Milk, cheese, yogurt, a lot of those derived from fermentations. The only difference is that they are starting from a different cell type. In this case we're just using the animal cells as the initial and beginning of the product. Eat just has developed chicken nuggets so far with far more textured chicken breast plan for the future. But another cell-based meat startup Memphis meats has already started working on culturing other animal cells as well. We've done beef, we've done duck, we've done chicken, and these are things that are favourites in various parts of the world. For instance, you know, people in America love beef and chicken. People in China love duck so we wanted to show that we at Memphis meats can produce meats that we as a global population love to eat. There's a lot of similarity on how we grow the meats from various animals or fish. But they're also different because of nutrients they need and how they actually come together to form the final product the meat. And I think it's very similar to how we also grow various animals. There's similarities in the feed that we gave cows and pigs and chickens. But there's also differences how we cultivate and it's very similar for us as well. So we've been working with the FDA and the USDA for the last three years and really developing the guidelines on how this food should be regulated when we come to the market. As soon as we get regulatory approval in the United States, people will be able to go to the supermarket and buy it and enjoy it. They'll be able to go to a restaurant near them and order meat directly from animal cells. But it's not just getting the meat right. Once approved, the gates open to a very high potential demand and scaling becomes the next big hurdle. Before we can only make chicken for myself, my friends, my friends, my family, my colleagues, now we actually have the ability to make chicken for millions of people. So that allows us to invest and to allow the economies to scale, to drop the price. The second is we need to reduce the cost of the nutrients that we sell are consuming. So they chicken feed, raises or drops a price of chicken. The nutrients we feed ourselves those are the same things. We need to drive that down. The cell density is another technical element. We need to continue to increase that and hammering on those things. So of the course of the next five, 10, 15 years, we'll put us in a place where we're significantly below the cost of this animal protein. And that will be one of the main inflection points that we'll lead to a new way of eating meat. So here's a close-up of a half-eaten crispy chicken bite. You know what? What I'm really thinking is, I'm just I'm eating chicken. I like chicken. You know, the normal chickens eat. I don't know where they came from. And so I don't know why I should be very stressed where this came from either. The meat market is worth more than one trillion dollars annually and there are over 60 startups in the cultured meat field. Cultured meat has attracted several prominent investors including Sergi Brin, Richard Branson and Bill Gates. What is also interesting is that even meat giants such as Cargill and Tyson have invested in space. It's this destructive potential of the the market as well as the promise to greatly reduce the climate impact of meat production that has attracted investors. It remains to be seen who will get regulatory approval in which countries and whether consumers will like lab-grown meat enough to make the switch. And while there's no evidence that lab-grown meat is any less healthy than traditional meat, there's an ongoing debate over how healthy eating meat is in general. But if these products are a success they could be the beginning of a more humane less destructive meat industry. The food and ag industry is the most innovative industry in the world.

And it's been very clear to us that we are part of that and we're going to figure out how to feed the next three billion people joining us. And I just see an evolution. We can do this a bit differently. We can do this in a way that is consistent with the kind of people that we want to be, the kind of planet that we all want to live in. We can build a food system that reflects really the best characteristics of who we are. And that makes me really hopeful. eBay. In possible foods might be the world's most ambitious company. Just listen to founder and CEO Pat Brown. People wonder how big the plant-based meat industry is going to be. It will be the meat industry in 20 years. We're going to look back and basically say, well, remember back in the day when we used to use animals to make meat? Yes, impossible stated goal really is to replace the use of animals as a food production technology globally by 2035. That would mean supplanting a $1.2 trillion industry not to mention a source of sustenance as old as time. To be fair, the company has got a lot of people talking about its products. So there's this thing called the Impossible Burger. What's called artificial meat? The realest, fakes, burger in the world. But before impossible foods can take over the world, it's going to have to overcome strong competitors, penetrate tough new markets and generally transform its product from a conversation piece into a ubiquitous staple food. With the coronavirus turning the world of food upside down, this could be the moment when impossible's new fangled meat goes mainstream. When possible foods was founded in 2011, when Pat Brown, a longtime vegan, was nearing the end of an accomplished career in biochemistry. I've been a scientist my whole life and just came to this realization that by far the most important scientific question in the world is what makes meat delicious? Pat Brown, someone call a zealot for his mission. He really doesn't hold back when it comes to talking about wanting to completely replace animal agriculture. The fact that we're producing meat from animals is the most destructive technology on Earth. And if we're going to avert catastrophic climate change, we have to find a better way to produce meat. You've probably heard about the dangers of cow flatulence. Their digestive systems produce large quantities of the powerful greenhouse gas, methane. In fact, it's estimated that livestock farming is responsible for nearly 15% of all greenhouse gas emissions. In possible claims, it takes 89% less GHGs, 87% less water, and 96% less land to produce its burger. The key, of course, would be to get people to actually eat the thing, which is where the company's secret ingredient comes in. Him, a genetically engineered substance with a bloody iron-rich taste like red meat. So heme is a very controversial part of the Impossible Burger. It's also what makes the Impossible Burger what it is. There are a lot of consumer groups and anti-GMO groups that oppose the Impossible Burger because of the heme.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2309,2022-10-13 00:40:09
14084," Oh groups that oppose the Impossible Burger because of the heme. The studies on its safety are pretty short term, but the FDA has approved it and the company says it's completely safe. And there isn't any evidence that it isn't. Critics have also challenged the company's claim to health advantages over traditional meat, pointing out that while the Impossible Burger has less fat, sodium and calories than its beefy cousin, it's also more highly processed. But let's be real, we're talking about minicking hamburgers here, not kale salads. These burgers are definitely better for the environment, so that's a plus, but they are not necessarily better for your health. After years in the lab, Pat and his colleagues were confident they had a product even Ron Sponson could love. And the Impossible Burger made its debut in 2016. Their burger began its life in the public when it was sold at David Chanks' Mama Fuku. And they went from sort of higher-end, fine dining restaurants into higher-end burger restaurants like Bare Burger and Mommy Burger. And then suddenly they started popping up everywhere. This tastes like a burger, it tastes like meat. This is all made from plants. All made from plants. This tastes like beef. Doesn't it just look like real meat? So meat-like. They always say. They always say. It tastes like a burger. It tastes like yuckers. Beef foam is the world's reliance. Yeah, it doesn't taste like a burger. Opinions differed on the Impossible Burger's relative meatiness, but the debate itself was fantastic free advertising, helping to propel Impossible into major chains like white castle and then in the summer of 2019 into more than 7,000 Burger Kings across the US. To date, the company has raised over a billion dollars and a funding round in March valued the company at around 4 billion. But fake meat is a happening space these days and impossible faces some daunting competition. So I'm now for the stock of the hour and that is Beyond Meat Shares of the Faux Meat or Plant-Based Protein Company are soaring today. Beyond Meat is also making a very meaty burger from plants. They're very non-GMO. They stress that all the time to differentiate themselves from impossible. You'll be much easier to genetically modify plant material to make it take on the texture and appearance and aroma of animal protein. Right. But we won't do that. Beyond Meat had one of the biggest IPOs of the year in 2019. So impossible, which is still privately held, has some catching up to do. But you won't hear Pat Brown knocking his biggest competitor. I wish them nothing but success. They have the same mission we have. The only rival we care about is the incumbent animal-based industry. Rivals or not, impossible and beyond, certainly agree on one thing. The true prize isn't the American market. It's China. 27% of the world's meat is consumed in China compared to just 9% in the US. The Chinese population eats a ton of meat, they are a huge market. China is a really interesting case because they have long had vegetarian cuisine as part of their culinary culture. And whether they are looking for meat replacements is still an open question. What we found in our reporting is that some consumers are excited about them. It's just, we don't know if it's going to be enough. To improve its prospects, impossible is developing a plant-based replacement for pork. Globally pork is the most widely consumed meat. It's almost 40% of all the meat consumed globally. Number one in Europe, number one in China. So if we're going to achieve our mission, pork is right up there. No word yet on when impossible pork will be available. This morning, growing concerns about the nation's food supply. The future is to national supermarkets, supplies now limited and prices rising. The impact of the coronavirus on the price and availability of meat has given a boost to companies like Impossible Foods. Over the four weeks ending April 19, sales of plant-based meat increase.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2310,2022-10-13 00:44:28
14085," and availability of meat has given a boost to companies like Impossible Foods. Over the four weeks ending April 19, sales of plant-based meat increased. But Impossible has acknowledged some negative effects from the pandemic as well. This being a product that has primarily been served in restaurants, they took a pretty big hit with all the food service shutdowns, although the company doesn't want to say how much of a hit. They have however announced some new retail rollouts. Recently they announced that they're going to be rolling out with Kroger supermarkets. And that's big, that's great for them. The question of whether this is like a long-term sea change for these companies. I don't know, just after Wayne Seek. It's safe to say Impossible stands a slim chance of achieving its goal of replacing the entire meat industry. But it's early days for the science of plant-based meat and it's not impossible that these products could one day contribute to a greener, more humane future. In the meantime, as the technology improves, we get to look forward to many more years of this. This is meat. No, this isn't possible. Yeah, that's what I thought. This is the meat burger. I like it better. It's not even close to a veggie burger or a tofu burger or anything. Without that, very, very much. What are, is a strategically important point on the map of Pakistan. It sits very close to Iran, actually, on the very southern coast. It's about a 10-hour drive west of Karachi, but it's only about an hour drive to Iran. The area is extremely poor. It's very arid. It doesn't have enough water. Electricity has been very spotty. One of the most surprising things about visiting Guadar is the high degree of security that is absolutely everywhere. There are armed guards that are required to escort foreign visitors everywhere you go because it is contested region because there have been militant attacks in the past. Despite all this, Guadar is a key part of the China-Pakistan economic corridor, also known as CPEC. The Crown Jewel of President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative. We will leave no stone unturned in ensuring that CPEC and all the projects under its umbrella are materialised in time and in full. So far, just one-third of all CPEC projects have been completed. In Guadar, none of them have been, and the promised improvements for local people, like job creation and better infrastructure, have not materialised. So what has China got to gain from developing this seemingly obscure city on the Pakistani coast? The US has been doing infrastructure projects. Those early projects helped the US gain Pakistan as an ally against the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The US has provided about $80 billion in aid to Pakistan since its independence, but overall the result is disappointing. One of the recent attempts was in the late 2000s, as part of the US effort to combat terrorism in",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2311,2022-10-13 00:48:29
14086," independence, but overall the result is disappointing. One of the recent attempts was in the late 2000s as part of the US effort to combat terrorism in Afghanistan. The number one item on that aid package was to build these high visibility infrastructure projects. So there are literally projects that the United States tried to do or Pakistan proposed to the United States in the 2000s during that period that have become Belt and Road and Projects. China is stepping into a gap which has been left by retreating ambition from the US. The Belt and Road Initiative is China's President Xi Jinping's signature foreign policy initiative. It changed in 2013. It comprises an overland belt stretching through China Central Asia into Europe and a maritime road stretching around Southeast Asia through the India Ocean and up past East Africa. So a benign way of characterising China's Belt and Road Initiative would be infrastructure for influence. So when Xi Jinping announced the Belt and Road Initiative, shortly afterwards China designated Pakistan as its showcase flagship project. So the China Pakistan Economic Quarter was going to be the biggest and most important showcase for the success of the Belt and Road. Pakistan is in great need of infrastructure development. They wanted to create a railway, highway, roads, all kinds of economic development that is intended to help Pakistan and it's meant to provide jobs, 2.3 million jobs for Pakistanis. It's meant to provide a 2.5% boost to GDP growth. And China would gain economically as well. XiPek was intended to reduce oil and gas routes from the Middle East by thousands of miles, a way to cut overland into Western China instead of going around Southeast Asia by ship. Projects in Pakistan also provide Chinese state owned companies with an additional market. Chinese workers have brought to Pakistan to build infrastructure and then take wages home. XiPek is also strategically significant for China and Pakistan. China wants to strengthen this relationship to counter their shared rival India. XiPek is both an instrument of Chinese power as well as a test of Chinese power. If it succeeds, China will be demonstrating that it's able to do what great powers have not been able to do in Pakistan, including the United States. Which is why Guadal is so important. It's in Pakistan's Balochistan province, an area with serious electricity and water shortages. Balochistan province is actually populated by people who are of Baloch origin. There are different ethnicity. They speak a different language from the majority in power in Islamabad. And they feel as the poorest province in Pakistan, they have not sufficiently benefited from some of the economic achievements that the rest of Pakistan has had. That area is quite contested by the Balochistan Liberation Army. The people who feel that even Pakistani people have encroached into their territory. So quite a number of people are still staging attacks and they attacked the biggest international hotel in Guadar, shot up the lobby and killed I think five people. But this unsettled city is where the China-Pakistan economic corridor is supposed to lead to. Authorities plan to develop Guadar into an international port city. Guadar port has an interesting history and an interesting location too. It's located in Balochistan. It's about 120 kilometers from Iran. Pakistan purchased this territory from Oman, I think, in the 1950s. So for a long time, Pakistan has had on its agenda trying to develop this area. Since the 70s, it's wanted to build a port in Guadar, actually approached the United States in the 1970s.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2312,2022-10-13 00:52:58
14087," has had on its agenda trying to develop this area. Since the 70s, it's wanted to build a port in Guadar, actually approached the United States in the 1970s and tried to convince the Nixon administration to pay for a port, even offered naval access if the United States was willing to pay for that. The US rejected Pakistan's offer, concerned that the port would not be commercially viable and would cause geopolitical tension. But in the early 2000s, a Chinese company was awarded the contract to build the port and they completed phase one of construction in 2006. The port was then managed by a Singaporean government entity. In 2013, a Chinese port operator took over from the Singaporeans. In 2015, China announced that it will expand the port as part of the CPEC initiative, but five years later, little has happened. When you look out at the port, you can see it has only three births and all of them were empty, and the only ship that was in the port at the time was a Pakistan naval forget. And so it indicated to me that the port is not particularly operational for commercial purposes, and a number of analysts have talked about the strategic importance in a military sense if eventually China were able to use the port of Guadar as a military base. No one would be surprised if China did use it in that way. I don't think in the short term, like it is set up in Djibouti, where it has a permanent base. I think it's more likely to use it as almost like a sort of forward-based resupply option, something it can use when it wants to. Other projects like building Pakistan's largest airport in Guadar and two special economic zones have been delayed. A 19 kilometer highway linking the port with the Macarang Coastal Highway in Balochistan is under construction too. Most of the people who live there and work there already are fishermen. They rely on access to the sea. The way that the express highway from the port was originally proposed would have cut off their sea access. And so that was a real point of contention with the community. There have been some proposals to allow them at underpass. It's still a little bit unclear how that is finally going to be resolved. Even if those projects are eventually built, there are serious questions about who will work there. There is a problem with manpower, of course, in Guadar. It's a very small city. And so one proposal has been well will just ship Chinese workers in from China and build lots of fancy housing for them. The first Chinese-built community in Pakistan, a $500 million development spanning over 10 million square feet with over 60% open spaces. That kind of proposal is what makes a lot of the Pakistani local people quite upset. A Guadal-based journalist expressed concerns to Bloomberg over projects like this. The journalist spoke anonymously for fear of persecution from the Pakistan government. These projects are creating jobs, but they're not really creating jobs for the local people of Guadar. They're not against economic prosperity, but they're against the development that leads them behind. Pakistan doesn't have the money to build these projects. It's gone to the IMF for its 13th bailout since the 1980s. By engaging in CPEC projects, the government of Pakistan has incurred more debts from China. Not only posing challenges for Pakistan, but possibly the international community, if Pakistan eventually defaults on its debts. But CPEC is still set to go on. Even if most current projects haven't been completed, the two countries have recently signed new projects worth $11 billion. Pakistan's Prime Minister said the country's economic future is linked with China. It's hard to imagine how the China-Pakistan economic quarter is going to be the game changer that the Pakistan government would like it to be. We're not seeing the economic growth or benefit from the projects that were set out. We're supposed to have seen by now. We're not seeing the job creation. Project delays, accumulating debts, commercial viability. These problems of CPEC are also typical of Belt and Road projects around the world. For China, though, it's never the now.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2313,2022-10-13 00:57:25
14088," Mulating debts commercial viability. These problems of CPEC are also typical of Belt and Road projects around the world. For China though, it's never the narrow accounting perspective that matters. It's the bigger strategic benefits. As China's dollars continue to flow, as China's concrete continues to pour, China's influence continues to increase. There was some degree of runaway expectations. I think there was also some degree that they weren't extremely forthcoming with the state of the game. The cyberpunk 2077 story is very much kind of a story of everything that can and will go rock in game development. What is this bug? Jack is AI flipped out. It wasn't there before. Where's my gun? Keep her steady. I can't shoot. The release of Cyberpunk 2077 in December of 2020 will go down as one of the most disastrous game launches in history. And it instantly rewrote the narrative of its celebrated developer, CD Projekt Red. Larger studios with bigger budgets weren't able to create the same quality of open-world game. The inside story of the making of Cyberpunk depicts a process marred by unchecked ambition, unrealistic timelines, and a focus on marketing at the expense of development. When CD Projekt Stock was at its high, it was the largest stock in the Polish stock market. Cyberpunk was supposed to be the biggest game of 2020. This was a game that was starring Kiana Reeves. This is a game that was from the makers of The Witcher 3. This was supposed to be the big temple release of last year. And for it to become such a disaster for so many people, I think, will have pretty far-reaching consequences. CD Projekt's origins are somewhat unique in the game's industry. In the West and Japan, the late 80s and 90s were dominated by games through the home console market, and characters like Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog were becoming household names. The same was not true in a post-Soviet and economically depressed Poland. Most games were done on PCs, and most games were copied and sold in small markets around the country. You could go to the market down the street in Warsaw and buy and sell CDs. And these two guys, Marchinewinsky and Michal Kocinski, decided they were gonna start selling CDs, and they wound up striking a deal with the people who made a game called Baldur's Gate, which was kind of like the seminal role-playing game in the late 90s. It was never a business, it was kind of lifestyle, so we're actually pretty bad with counting money. So you can kind of think of it almost like Nike, where Phil Knight was selling shoes out of the trunk of his car. You can kind of think about it the same way. It was just selling physical goods and then evolving that into a much broader enterprise. CD Projekt, named for selling CDs, would move on from just reselling games to localizing Western and Japanese made games into the Polish language. But it wasn't until 2002 that the company would make its own game, The Witcher. The Witcher is a huge, huge series, huge fantasy series in Poland. And so it was a pretty big deal that these guys got the race.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2314,2022-10-13 01:01:49
14089," The Witcher is a huge, huge series, huge fantasy series in Poland, and so it was a pretty big deal that these guys got the race to make the video games. The Witcher book series is a source of national pride in Poland, and as CD Projekt released The Witcher 2, the video game series would become an important economic symbol for Poland as well. The CD Projekt Red had become this behemoth of an institution in Poland, and they were really big in the Polish technology scene because they were getting more worldwide attention than most Polish companies do, and making a lot of money. In 2011, when Barack Obama came to visit Poland, the Prime Minister actually gave him a copy of The Witcher 2. I confess I'm not very good at video games, but I've been told that it is a great example of Poland's place in the new global economy. But it would be the launch of The Witcher 3 in 2015 that would elevate CD Projekt Red from representing the best of Poland to representing the best of the game's industry. I mean really the thing people look for first and foremost I think is that the game is just good and Witcher 3 was just a phenomenal game. There's a level of just storytelling, an emphasis on making every side quest count. On top of the atmosphere, the dialogue, the character interactions, the different way stories can end. They nail that. Other open world games felt empty and forced, and the developers of them gave excuses as to why there couldn't be more rich story or interactions, and The Witcher 3 blew them out of the water. CD Projekt Red was beloved. They were seen as a studio that was willing to make what the player wanted, and to truly put in the love and effort required to make a high quality game that really connects with the people playing with it. And the winner for Game of the Year 2015 is The Witcher 3. The Witcher 3 would go into an over 250 game of the year awards, but along with being a critical success for CD Projekt it was also a financial success. Estimates put the sales of Witcher 3 at around 28 million copies in 2019. A huge step up, considering by 2014 the Witcher and the Witcher 2 had only combined to sell 8 million copies. And with two large expansions for The Witcher 3, CD Projekt also helped separate themselves from other AAA publishers at the time. And the game award goes, oh man, I have to pay a micro transaction to unlock. That's so stupid that this has to hold on. I got this guys. Here we go. Other games, and the most notorious one to do this was EA's Star Wars Battlefront 2. They got really aggressive on micro transactions in a game that already cost at least $60. You could have paid more if you bought the premium editions, but not only was it that they were being very aggressive and trying to get you to spend money, but you could actually get items that helped you win. Well, gamers kind of draw the line in the sand there, and they don't like them. CD Projekt had done this phenomenal job of marketing themselves as a gamer friendly company. We've said this a million times, and I'll say it again, we're gamers first of all, and we all like to be treated fairly. So it only makes sense that as developers, we apply the same principle to everything we do here at CD Projekt Red. So giving everyone a bunch of free DLC was an absolutely no brainer. They said, we're not going to sell you DLC that's like horse armor packs and other nonsense. We're going to just give you a free stuff, and then we're going to sell big expansions as part of the Witcher 3. And not only were they really good, they were offered at a fair price. And this is a company that was seen as just like a company that really cared about quality and cared about its customers, and we're not doing anything to kind of screw fans over the way that fans see that EA and Activision and all the other big publishers do. With a critically and financially successful game, as well as the goodwill from the gaming audience, all the focus would shift to CD Projekt's next release.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2315,2022-10-13 01:06:03
14090," to shoot his tale. With a critically and financially successful game, as well as the goodwill from the gaming audience, all the focus would shift to CD projects next release, Cyberpunk 2077. It's actually funny, they first announced it through like a press release. CD Predic Red though wouldn't put out another trailer for Cyberpunk until 2018, at the E3 trade show. And then they showed behind the scenes for E3 attendees for press and anyone else who could get a score in appointment in there. They showed this 45 minute demo and it blew people away. Welcome to the gameplay demo walkthrough of CD Project Red's upcoming title, Cyberpunk 2077. The gameplay you're about to see is from a work in progress version of the game. Everything you see is potentially subject to change. This, if they can live up to what they showed me, it's game over. It all looked incredibly impressive. They had enough action, enough narrative beats with just the right amount of tension. They touted how each of these NPCs, their thousands of them, each one with their own daily routines and everything. We've greatly enhanced our crowd and community systems to create the most believable city in any open world game to do this. So yeah, so people were certainly blown away by the demo of 23 awards and just people left the theater just in awe. What they didn't know of course is that the demo was completely fake. Fake demos are common at E3. Studios put together builds of games to show off what they tend the game to be like rather than the actual state of the game. What was unique about this demo was that it was impressively long. It kind of plays into this idea that CD Project is very much a marketing driven company and so demos were really, really important to them. So it was really important that they make this demo blow people away, which it did, but that might have come to the cost of like some time they could have been spending on the game. A year later, at E3 2019, fans will get another big surprise. Whoa, no way, oh what, of being there, of walking the streets of the future is really going to be breathtaking. You're a breathtaking. The Cyberpunk trailers showed gorgeous cities, beautiful lighting, really cutting-edge technology when it comes to the rendering of the game itself. People were very excited to be immersed in this gorgeous Cyberpunk world. They saw over 8 million pre-orders, which is a ridiculously large amount for any title to sell, let alone pre-sell.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2316,2022-10-13 01:10:08
14091," World. They saw over 8 million pre-orders, which is a ridiculously large amount for any title to sell, let alone pre-sell. And you saw the stock price start to go up and up and up and up into the right, you know, pretty, pretty much in a straight line. If you just look at like the Polish stock market, like the Wig Index, when CD Projekt Stock was at its high, it was the largest stock in the index. And that was around the time that they announced that the game would be coming in April of 2020. Behind the Seaheens, people were pretty shocked that they were saying April. I don't think a single person who worked on that game actually thought they had a chance of coming out in April of 2020. So in April of 2019, I published an article for Kotaku about the making of a game called Anthem, which was a game from Byware that was disastrous in many ways and the article kind of ran through why that was. Afterwards, I started hearing from other developers who had stories to share that they said sounded a whole lot like Anthem. The deadline is unrealistic, the direction keeps changing, things are floundering, we're going through a lot of problems. This sounds exactly like what you wrote about Anthem. Around that same time, perhaps coincidentally, I heard from VCEO of CD Projekt Red who wanted to reach out to me specifically to talk about Crunch. CD Projekt Red had a reputation for Crunch, especially during the development of Witcher 3. Their management wanted them to have a reputation for training workers well and not forcing them to go through Crunch. So Marchinevinsky, who's a co-founder and co-CEO of CD Projekt Red, came to me and said, hey, I want to make a vow right now that we're not going to force anybody to crunch, that people will not have to work mandatory overtime on this project. Over the course of reporting, Bloomberg has conducted interviews of more than 20 current and former CD Projekt staff, most of whom requested anonymity so as not to risk their careers. CD Projekt declined a comment on the process or provide interviews with this story. The company would end up delaying the game three different times, first pushing from an April 2020 release to September, then November, and once again to December 2020. In order to meet the deadline, the studio would scale down the size of Cyberwanks main city, as well as canceling some features, and while those measures helped, developers still said they were under significant crunch, including one former audio programmer who claimed to work up to 13 hours a day, five days a week, and stating he had seen friends who had lost their families over this. This was not a big secret in the office that a game was not going to be ready, but a similar sort of thing happened with Witcher 3, and a similar sort of thing happens with a lot of games where they don't seem ready until suddenly everything just clicks. Some of the best games ever made, like we're created through this process. I don't know that it's the most efficient or the wisest way to make video games, but it's what a lot of people do. I think that management there has genuinely tried to change it early, said they wanted to change it, but it has proven very difficult to change that when you make games in this one specific way. Game studios, some of them see Crunch is part of their core culture that all of their games that they've made under Crunch have been successful, so it must be a core element to the magic recipe for creating good games, and that's really not the case. We've run studies and seen that at eight weeks of working 60 hours plus, the output of a professional is the same as if they were working 40 hours a week. So, chronic overwork degrades how effective someone is to the point where then it becomes negative, and overworking them is just getting new less and less productivity. And so, these guys, the People at CD Project, having made the Witcher 3, we're kind of riding on that high, you could call it arrogance or confidence, or whenever you want to call it, of having made the Witcher 3. And I think that like having a certain level confidence can certainly be a good thing, but in this case, it could also be dangerous because it kind of blinded them to the reality, which was that this game wasn't going to call us.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2317,2022-10-13 01:14:45
14092," [♪ INTRO PLAYING sert & hympoly music starts playing playds...] So many pictures entertainment is reeling from what may be the biggest and most devastating computer hacking in Hollywood's history. Hackers attacked in waves, first crippling Sony's internal systems, then leaking five Sony movies online. Today the US government pointed the finger of blame directly at North Korea for the devastating cyber attack against Sony pictures. Sony pulling the plug on the interview, saying it will not show the controversial comedy about an assassination attempt on North Korea's leader. The Sony pictures hacking was taken very seriously because it wasn't an attack on the free world. What we have been building in terms of our civilization and our freedom and our ability to exchange information freely have been disrupted by a country that we knew very little about. North Korea has reportedly made attempts to steal COVID-19 vaccine technology by hacking pharmaceutical giant Pfizer. The Justice Department has charged three North Korean hackers over a wide ranging scheme that included the attempt theft of billions of dollars for multiple companies. Despite so many attacks blamed on North Korea, there was not much known about the people behind the hacking attacks and my aim was to reveal who these people are and what they are like, what their operations are like, and on what their dreams and fears were. My name is Sam Kim. I'm a reporter for Blue MIRG News and I wrote a story for Business Week about North Korean hackers. My story is about people who are sent from North Korea to countries like China to hack for the regime, spy on enemies, and make money. North Korea's cyber abilities began about in the 1970s with a lot of students going to countries like Russia, China and even East Germany to learn coding was aimed at improving the productivity of factories at home, but in some time in the 1980s and 1990s, the current leader Kim Jong-un's father Kim Jong-un thought that it would be a good idea to develop a team, an army of people who could hack for North Korea's military. So they began this team of hackers who would spy for the North Korean regime and also go out there and make hard currency for the regime. I think Kim Jong-un takes the hacking ability more seriously than his father. He also enjoys a bit of tech sadness as well. He's often shown traveling on his airplane where on the desk there's a Mac computer. He understands the importance of computers. He understands the importance of employing technology to improve productivity of his economy. North Korea is an isolated country with its economy pretty much dilapidated nowadays. It's been under increased pressure and sanctions from the US and the international community, basically.

14093," It does not have the resources and money to build a conventional weapons that other countries are able to build. So what happens is North Korea concentrates its resources on building nuclear arms and missiles, which exports called a symmetric weapons. It's the kind of weapons that gives North Korea an instant edge. In terms of cyber-hacking abilities, in that context, it doesn't cost them much money, but if you have the right people, and if you have the right training, you are able to cultivate an army of people who are able to penetrate into computer systems of other countries. And that's what North Korea is after. But if you consider the fact that there are only about 1,000 IP addresses in North Korea available, and many of them are basically loaned from Chinese communications companies, you can kind of tell why North Korea is willing to send its hackers abroad rather than operate from within. What's the matter with operating from within? Well, first of all, it would mean that a lot of information would have to be coming in from the outside world, which could risk exposing the government and the people to whatever truth there might be about them. So they're sending their trained hackers to China and other countries where access to information is better. But at the same time, because these are allies, and also because they have their diplomats stationed in countries like these, like China, they're able to regulate and control these hackers better. But formally, North Korea denies engaging and hacking and describes accusations to that affect as enemy propaganda. It took me at least half a year to track down these people. It felt like a wild goose chase in the beginning, because see a lot of the people like these are protected by the government in South Korea. But at the end, I was able to find a person who had pretty extensive ties to the North Korean defective community here. And then I was also able to gain access to the people who had actually done programming hacking from North Korea before coming to South Korea. And Jung is one of them. Jung actually is not a real name. I knew before meeting Jung that he was in his late 30s. But when I actually met him, he looked at least a decade older. He wouldn't open up. I mean, it took me, I think, at least an hour to make sure that he would trust me enough that he would share with me his life story. When he was first sent to China, he was a student studying computer science at a university near the border with North Korea. And he came back and realized that there was a lot more to do in China because he had more access to information. And he asked that he'd be sent back to China. And there was also recruitment going on for people who would actually do coding officially, but really hacking from North Korea. So he applied and he got the job. Once he got to the border, he crossed by foot and from there he took a bus. And then when he arrived at the station that he would spend years in later, he learned that the three-story building in the heart of a city was actually provided for free actually by a Chinese man who had business ties in North Korea. There were actually two other people that I had met. They all said that they'd gone to this freelance website for programmers and clients from around the world would come and give them orders, give them jobs to do. Some of the jobs given to Jung were cracking open, commercially successful anti-virus.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2319,2022-10-13 01:23:17
14094," Jobs to do. Some of the jobs given to Jung were cracking open, commercially successful anti-virus programs. And once he was able to open that up, he replicated that program into another product, which his client would repackage as a whole different product, to be sold to other people. He also created what we now call bots. There are very popular online games, including lineage. He would create a bot that would just roam around without any supervision from the user and basically trade items without a user on that game. He would grow that bot on lineage and sell it for almost $100. Another defector said the money from clients was primarily via PayPal to accounts controlled by minors because they were the only ones with access to legitimate bank accounts. Jung had to make at least $100,000 a year and he doesn't get to keep most of it. Actually, most of that money goes to the minors to the North Grand Regime. But if you don't meet the quota, the minors will make sure that they'll put enough pressure on you. And if that happens repeatedly, you will face the growing odds of being sent back home. Among the three people that I spoke to, there's a common thing that they all tell me, which is that on every Saturday, they have to do this propaganda session, which is basically about gathering all the hackers together into a room and they have to recite whatever messages, whatever lines come from Pyongyang, about the Kim family, about socialism. If you're especially someone with a free set of mind, that's stressful. One person actually was really stressed out what he heard about North Korea. Once he was in China, during the propaganda sessions, he just couldn't take it. Jung was a senior member of the unit that he belonged to and he was good at Chinese as well. Whenever a senior North Korean official came from North Korea to check on the hacking units in China, Jung would accompany that official. He doesn't provide me details, but he calls it unsavory instant that happened between him and an official that he was traveling with. And that altercation prompted him to defect. But there was no one that he could turn to after defecting. He would, in disguise, roam around China. He called me that he actually enjoyed it. He actually enjoyed the freedom of not being known to anybody, just roaming around a country that was huge. How did he make the money that he needed to carry on? He did the same thing he did at the North Korean unit. He would take orders, he would reverse engineer himself to make money. But at one point, he said he was just sick and tired of all of a sudden. He wanted to find a place where he could just settle down and he contacted South Korean authorities. Now, he lives in Korea. He met a woman here. You know, last time I checked, they had a baby. He worked for a software company, ironically, an antivirus company. What keeps coming up in my head, even long after I spoke to these people, is there was one common thing about them, which was the sense of disillusionment. One day had access to outside information. One day, we were able to freely roam in the Internet.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2320,2022-10-13 01:27:34
14095," The solution went. One day had access to outside information. One day, we were able to freely roam in the internet. There was a spark. And one day realized that there was a discrepancy between what they think is really happening and what North Korea is telling them every Saturday morning. That's when the spark gets bigger. The little fire is what eventually drives them to decide to leave, even if it takes a huge risk on their lives. Since they started popping up in the 1950s, malls have been the quintessential American shopping experience. Muscling temples dedicated to the wonders and excesses of retail, food service, and entertainment, the rise of the mall coincided with the growth of the suburbs. The heyday of the malls really is the 1970s, sometimes referred to as the malling of America. They really thrived at providing some sort of public gathering space, some sort of social life, in addition to actually giving people places to shop. Over the past few decades before then, lots of developers were building malls and it kind of coincided with the growth of highways. So as more people started traveling and interstate started being built, developers really wanted to put something to attract people to stop. Take a look at an average American mall today, however, and you'll see a very different picture. Closed stores and empty hallways became the norm in many malls even before COVID-19 delivered them another set of problems in 2020. So what happened? This is the story of the rise and fall of American malls. When malls work best, they survived and thrived, thanks to their anchor stores. Those are the stores that are on the edges of the malls and that are outward facing to the parking lot. So if you're a shopper, you're going to walk through one of these big, usually a department store. So if you're thinking about maces or sears or j...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2321,2022-10-13 01:32:06
14096," our outward facing to the parking lot. So if you're a shopper, you're gonna walk through one of these big, usually a department store. So if you're thinking about macy's or sears or JC Penny, those are called the Inker stores. So once shoppers are done shopping there, maybe they wander to the middle part of the mall, shopping at the other apparel shops or even going to buy some food, but you really had to have a reason for people to shop in the first place. Because anchors bring in all those people, they tend to pay very little rent. Around 80% of income from mall owners come from the inline stores inside the mall. Over the past few decades, malls have been facing challenges from all sides. The first being, there's just too many of them. As early as in the 90s, the malls were beginning to compete with each other. We have a lot more retail square footage per capita than Canada. We have on seven times more retail square footage per capita than Europe. After the 2008 financial crisis, lowered retail spending across the board, malls, and especially their department stores, also had to contend with a new challenge that was growing fast. Mall started to suffer in the early 2000s with the rise of online shopping. Suddenly, they didn't have that captive audience who had to go to the mall to buy something. You didn't have to get up, get in your car, drive all the way to the mall, and then see a bunch of other people. You can just do it from the comfort of your own. Department stores overall have become less relevant over the years. Many have fallen totally off, and that's Sears, JCPenney. Several bankruptcies in this space have really hurt the industry. But as department stores go, so does the mall, often times. So if department stores start closing locations, that means they're usually leaving malls. This is the Green Briar Mall in Southwest Atlanta, Georgia. It's in many ways emblematic of the problems facing malls today. It's been there since 1965. So for more than half of a century, it's been serving this area of Atlanta that's predominantly black, and also as middle-class neighborhood. It started with anchor stores that were department stores. So you had JCPenney and then Riches, which was later bought by Macy. So you had these two national chains. It had the first Chick-fil-A in a mall, like that type of format. So when you think about the history of malls, like Green Briar had like the perfect template, but now Macy's will be exiting the mall, meaning that the mall will be left without an anchor, which is vital to attracting other shoppers to come into the stores. Green Briar then because it's kind of an example or a test for all these other middle-ing malls across America, about what do you do when these large department stores as a business decision on their end are trying to just stay in the high quality malls? How does a middle-ing mall survive? What's their next strategy?Narratoraging The Greenbrier is a textbook example of how closely the deterioration of the middle class in the US is tied to the health of its malls. The median income for the surrounding area has reduced by $6,905 over the past 15 years, to a total of $20,756 per year. And yet, residents and store owners hope that Greenbrier mall will see better days. Maws are made up of the people and communities that help fuel them. Greenbrier is still a place that people go to and cherish, even if on paper it doesn't have.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2322,2022-10-13 01:36:36
14097," see better days. Mals are made up of the people and communities that help fuel them. Greenbrier is still a place that people go to and cherish. Even if on paper, it doesn't have the elements that make it a thriving mall. A lot of the existing constituents and residents there feel in many respects that they worked hard their whole lives to be able to experience the American dream, the single family, suburban house, and a leafy yard near a big mall that had a great NACE's. And they're very reluctant to see that taken away from them. Now that NACE's is gone, Greenbrier may try to take inspiration from what many mals were doing in the years following the financial crisis, focusing not on shopping, but experiences. That was a trend we were seeing in 2016 up into the pandemic pretty much. And by experiences, I mean, everything as dramatic as a water park or hosting concerts to have people want to come other than just to buy stuff. Having Instagramable moments, making sure your store is pretty that people take a photo and post it on Instagram or Twitter. Historically, the mall has always been a place for teenagers. You like to hang out, see your friends, and also kind of be seen at the mall. And that hasn't completely changed. Like before the pandemic, about 95% of Gen Zs. So today's teenagers had gone to a mall in a three-month period. So teenagers are still going to the mall. And they've always been key to having thriving malls because they're coming into their spending power. And once you win over teens, hopefully, you're really winning over a loyal customer for life. But thanks to lockdowns across the country, most malls at one point or another were shuttered in 2020. That means no one using the multi-billion-dollar American Dream malls indoor ski slope. No one going to the King of Prussia malls indoor skydiving attraction. Basically, the pandemic gave malls what they didn't need. Another problem. What would your net income or net operating income have been in 2022 without COVID? And what is it now in a post-COVID world? So our views is roughly 10% hit to net income over that period. That's Vince Taboni from the Analytics from Green Street Advisors, which rates American malls from A to D just like a report card. And if malls did have a report card, they wouldn't exactly make honor roll. Here in the US, out of the 1,000 malls in the country, there are roughly 250 malls. We grade A minus or better. The DNC quality malls, which is the vast majority of the malls by count, we think are on a negative trajectory. And it's going to depend on a lot of the local dynamics, ownership, decisions around how much money do invest in the property. We'll determine whether this mall can survive as retail or rapidly melting ice cube. While there have been a few bankruptcies among real estate investment trusts that own mostly B to D malls in the past few years, A malls really are doing just fine. Some of the most productive shopping centers in the country are super high-end. So I'm talking about bal harbour shops down in Miami, Florida. There is Americana man has it in Long Island's gold coast, the grove in Los Angeles. These are places that have all high end stores and have done quite well. A lot of that has to do with efficiency of their properties, so their sales per square foot are really high. But also, they've invested a lot in their actual mall, because it has to look beautiful. It has to have all the services that a wealthy shopper expects. So what will the future hold for less sought-after malls that can't revive their golden years? For many of these malls, it will mean closure and then hopefully conversion. If they can't get a new use to come in, it's expensive, but you can just demolish it. And there are still quite a lot of sites just sitting with...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2323,2022-10-13 01:40:48
14098," They can't get a new use to come in. It's expensive, but you can just demolish it. And there are still quite a lot of sites just sitting waiting. Amazon has been picking up more and more of those building their big fulfillment centers. Also, a lot of communities think this is an opportunity, you know, to redevelop, re-enhabit this dead mall to help that community meet the challenges it was never originally designed for. The number one reuse of an existing mall is as workspace. It's actually pretty easy to just throw some carpeting down, cut a few more windows, and turn it into office space. Sort of number two reuse of malls is either medical, healthcare, or education. Lots of great examples of community colleges all the way down to elementary schools. Moving into malls. Then the third strategy that I wish happened more is actually just demolishing the mall and re-greening. Either reconstructing the wetlands that used to be there, and that frankly, we never should have built on in the first place, or providing community parks and gardens. While most analysts say post-pandemic retail shopping could breed some life back into the American mall, many are not long for this world. Depending on where you live, it might be time to make one last visit, grab some food, do some shopping, and say farewell. When former President Donald Trump announced plans to scale back two national monuments in Utah, there was outcry from a lot of people. One company, in particular. Patagonia is a resistance brand. They embraced the liberal resistance against President Donald Trump, and really put themselves at the forefront of that movement. In 2017, it sued the Trump administration for sort of slashing the size of these two national monuments in Utah that were kind of mechas for climbers. It's said at the time joining the legal fracas was both extraordinary and obvious to the company's general counsel said it took exactly one email to the board to decide to actually do that. I send the case is still out. Well, I think the only thing this administration understands is lawsuits. We're losing this planet, and we have an evil government, and I'm not going to stand back and just let evil win. This year it got even more active, that changed its mission statement to quote, Patagonia is in business to save our home planet.

14099," of it changed its mission statement to quote, Patagonia isn't business to save our home planet. And then it manufactured these little tags on some of its clothes that if you flip them up, it says, vote the assholes out. Very implicit running up to the election. And it launched a digital tool to help people find the polling place. And on that digital platform, it says, vote the climate deniers out of office. Again and again on the loop. This isn't the first time that taking a stand has paid off the Patagonia. The business which is now worth over a billion dollars was built on it. I couldn't care less about making more money. But by doing the right thing, it always ends up making me more money. So it's this all a strategy, a sort of premeditated strategy. Who knows? I mean, Sean Arts been very vocal from the start and makes no bones about. He calls himself a dirtbag climber and an accidental entrepreneur. So I don't think he's fudging this. But what's important is that it's sort of a textbook marriage of philanthropy and profit. If you want to understand the entrepreneur studied at juvenile delinquent, because they're saying, this sucks. And I'm going to do it my own way. Of course, like every other teenage kid, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. When I was 16 years old, I took off and drove across the country, went into the Wind River Range and discovered mountains. Patagonia was born out of rock climber of Bonchioen Arts first business, Schuwenarde equipment, which made in soul climbing supplies. He Bonchioenarde was a blacksmith in the 50s, and he started selling climbing gear out of the back of his car. That was less harmful to rock faces. This is sort of the origin story of the company. It's called itself the activist company, an activist company. Six months out of the year, Bonchioenarde is a blacksmith. He makes mountain climbing gear. The other half of the year he climbs. In 1968, Bonchioenarde and four friends, including Dag Tomkins, the late founders of the North Face brand, embarked on the ultimate road trip from California where they were based to Patagonia in Argentina. This trip became a documentary about these friends who were hippies in the 70s, climbing in Yosemite where the sport became a lifestyle, and how these friends became pioneer of the outdoor industry. Schuwenarde moved from selling peatons to polyester, and in the 70s Patagonia was born. In 1973, Schuwenarde and his wife Melinda opened the very first Patagonia store in Ventura, California, where the company's headquarters remained today. Melinda Schuwenarde was the driving force behind many of the employee benefits, like on-site childcare, that helped the company achieve an impressive 4% employee turnover rate. The retail and consumer product sector average is more than triple that at 13%. I do think that Patagonia was a leader, one of the first corporations to take into account the human capital and make sure that their staff, all their employees were cared for in many ways, not just wages, but also they just cared about their people and knew that that's a good business model.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2325,2022-10-13 01:49:16
14100," for in many ways, not just wages, but also they just cared about their people and knew that that's a good business model. Patagonia began donating 10% of its profits to grassroots organizations in 1985. This later became the 1% of sales that Schu and Ad labels and Earth tax. I don't think it's for land three. It's rent for us living on this planet. While Patagonia was creating the blueprint of how to be a socially conscious brand, it was also turning a profit. It even made ink magazines list of the fastest growing privately held companies. So every time the company makes a decision to do something socially environmentally active, it is met with success and that isn't lost on Schoenart or any of the other leaders of the company. The more money Patagonia made, the more it gave away under its philanthropic program. Between 1989 and 1991, the payroll grew by 40%. But trouble was on the horizon. I think for 1991, we are looking at a recession. The question is how deep that recession is going to be and how long will be in it? Sales fell flat and the bank called in the companies revolve in loans. A company that prided itself on taking care of its own laid off 120 people, roughly 20% of its workforce. That was when we decided that we were going to start doing things different. And we're going to start running the company as if it's going to be here 100 years. With a renewed sense of purpose, Patagonia was ready for what it called business unusual. It started with the costly move to recycle an organic materials before launching a clothing repair service to discourage fast fashion. And Patagonia's influence was growing. What was intended as Schoenart's philosophical handbook for employees became an international blueprint for sustainable business printed in ten languages. What's interesting to me is that all this, I hate the term on brand, but it's very on brand. It really works for the kind of company he's created. It works for the kind of employees he's been able to recruit and retain. It all is very seamless in terms of the identity of him and the company and what it means in the marketplace. So over time, the company's mission and its marketing have become the same thing. The inflection point came in 2011, actually Black Friday, Patagonia took out a huge ad in the New York Times that said don't buy this jacket. And it sort of got into the nitty-gritty on the carbon footprint and the water footprint that goes into a piece of a peril like a parke. And at the time Schoenart said the best jacket for our planet is one that already exists. So the company at that time said it needed to address the issue of consumerism, which coming from a for-profit business hits pretty hypocritical. As the company encouraged its customers to buy less, its annual sales increased by almost 40%. The stance of this is hypocritical is loud and constant talking about consumerism in a critical light while very much being a part of it. Fast fashion is top on the list of environmental destruction and not just destroying the environment but impacting human health. They are in the fashion industry, they're clothing retailer and to come head to head with that is courageous. You're not only just trying to create a product that'll last but you're also educating an entire generation of people to understand that whole ideology that you don't need to change out our outfits. In 2014, Rose Macaria was appointed as CEO. During the next six years, she grew Patagonia into a billion dollar company while also scaling up its environmental goals and bringing a more political voice to its activism. Yvonne had this model where he was basically saying you can have a great business, you can make quality product, but you can also do the right thing by the environment, by your employees, by your community.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2326,2022-10-13 01:53:42
14101," business, you can make quality product, but you can also do the right thing by the environment, by your employees, by your community. And that to me was like the most holistic vision of business that I'd ever seen. So right now Patagonia has a team of about 20 people, solely focused on activism and grants. And this all comes at a time in the past decade when consumers are paying much more attention to the social footprint of companies and where they buy their goods. So what's happened is all this is good business for Patagonia in the past 10 years, revenue and profit at the company of roughly quadruple. It's private, but estimates are it does about a billion dollars in annual sales, which is sizable. And that's part of the reason why it's been such a fortuitous cycle as it's ramped up its activism and become more vocal on these things that's resonated with the market. As the company branched out into other areas including a venture capital fund for environmental causes and sustainable food, revenue reached a new peak of over one billion dollars in 2017. But this was still small change compared to fast fashion heavyweights like Nike, who made 37 billion dollars that same year. Patagonia's conscience hasn't always been reflected in its customer base either. Personalized vests have become the go-to corporate uniform and the expensive price tag has helped the brand and the nickname Patagucci. It's expensive stuff, it's expensive apparel and that is part of their calculus in terms of the activism, you know, a lot of the more sustainable parts of the supply chain are there's a premium for organic cotton or sustainable down. The Patagucci label is a symptom of that. So Patagonia products are very popular of course with people who are active in the outdoors, but also with people who are not as active. For instance, you know, people in finance where the Patagonia vests to go to the office and that's because of the image that the brand projects and so they have to leave with the fact, although they, you know, preach for the environment and want to stand for good, they're victims of their own success. Patagonia set sales records in the first three years of the Trump administration. Now in 2020 things have changed. Is COVID-19 brought the business well to a halt and the American people voted in a new administration? Patagonia appointed Brian Gellert as CEO. As far as its CEO transition goes, this one's happening quite strangely. There's no real budget for next year yet because of everything that's going on and all the uncertainty around that. Patagonia's new focus is going to be on forging a relationship with the Biden administration. It should be a more close relationship, but Gellert still has his guard up. During the Obama administration, they didn't always agree and he expects the same with Biden in the White House. They plan to bring litigation wherever needed against any government needed about the issues that they care about and that's climate change in the environment.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2327,2022-10-13 01:58:02
14102," Ready I think you built this. So this is all. This is new since the pandemic. We assume Googlers would want more indoor outdoor options. I mean, it's so exciting. It's such a fun... It is. It is. But I would say the thing we're really excited about are these new buildings because we're building sustainability and everything we do. So really forward-looking. More? More? Good? Okay.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2328,2022-10-13 02:02:46
14103," Good? Okay. From one of the newest workspaces at the Googleplex in Mountain View, California, this is Bloomberg Studio 1.0 with Alphabet CFO, Ruth Porat. We're not far from her childhood home. Her father was a physicist at Stanford, her mother, a psychologist. After graduating from Stanford herself and then earning a couple more advanced degrees, Porat landed her first job on Wall Street in 1987, where she would spend almost three decades until Google's co-founders lured her to Silicon Valley. It's wonderful to be here with you. It's great to have you here at the Googleplex. Thank you for having us. So we are at Google headquarters in Mountain View and at this very same time you are making massive investments in New York office real estate. You're expanding headcount in Atlanta and Chicago and Washington, D.C. What's the strategy behind all of this? Well, at the core we believe in hybrid work. So we do want to bring people back on campuses, but not full time. We're thinking it'd probably be a three to work week, but we think coming together is just such a core part of innovation, serendipity, culture, every element of it. And we're growing at a really rapid clip. So we are excited to be expanding our real estate footprint. And then we also wanted to make sure that we're meeting people where they want to be. And so enlarging the number of sites that we have available for people in particular sites where you have great, diverse populations. Sundar just told me that Googlers will have this option to work in a hybrid mode forever, like literally forever. Obviously, you're embracing this massive cultural shift. But what are the risks? What are you worried about? So the positive we've seen is there's a productivity uplift we believe in giving people the opportunity to be at home some of the time, not do the commute, be able to deal with everything else in their life, and coming into the office. So the risk is, I think, about my career. And so much of the benefit in my career was the informal coaching being pot-pronented meetings, all of the touch points that you have. And so I think that one of the most important things for all of us as leaders is we need to evolve the way we lead. We need to make sure that we're thinking about this hybrid work life and why that's the way to be the best magnet for talent and make sure that we're continuing to reinforce all of those great practices while opening up new great practices. Speaking of your career, before you were CFO of Alphabet, you were CFO of Morgan Stanley and you started your career on Wall Street in 1987. What was about the journey of going from big banks to big tech? Why did you make that leap? And what impact did you want to have? Well, I love being at Morgan Stanley and I became CFO the day James Gorman became CEO yes, needed to join him in that journey and that was January 2010. And we were still recovering coming out of the financial crisis. There were still some pretty rocky days and a lot of decisions that needed to be made. And then I got to a point where I felt like we were in a great spot at Morgan Stanley. And obviously it's continued to do really well. And I just wanted that next chapter. On my view, in my career, I've always been focused on continually learning and I feel like when you hit a plateau the right questions, what's my highest and best use and it's been an extraordinary time. You also survived Wall Street in the 80s and 90s, which is notorious boys club. And Silicon Valley has sort of come to be known as a boys club of its own. How would you compare those two cultures? Well, when I was, you know, starting my career many decades ago, it was much tough and much worse than it is now and it evolved. No question about it. Not where it needs to be, but certainly evolved and I saw it through my career. I would say the biggest difference out here is the level of impatience. And I love it. The view is if you can do some of the extraordinary breakthroughs that we have out here, if you can do natural language translation, everything we do with AI, with VR, with self-driving cars, why can't you fix this now? And that level of impatience I think is fantastic.

14104," driving cars, why can't you fix this now? And that level of impatience, I think, is fantastic. Legend has it that when you got to Google, you were gonna rain in the spending, tighten up on the moon shots. Your nickname, I believe, was Ruth Vader. Was that a tough job to take on? So I think the narrative was written before I got here. And what I find most interesting about that is I firmly believe the single most important thing in capital allocation is investing for long-term growth. I think if you don't, you were sowing the seeds of your long-term decline. And I learned that really early on in my career. Now, if you're investing in an industry like this and trying to do truly transformative things, by definition, everything can't succeed. And so by definition, you should have the metrics and data and milestones to assess, is it working or is it not? Because if everything's working, or if you think everything's working, I would say one of two things are wrong. Either you're not reaching high enough, or you're not being honest enough with yourself about the pace of breakthrough, whether you're gonna get there. So to me, a really natural part, kind of a sister organization to investing for long-term growth is actually thinking about, how are you doing with the risk that you're taking, stack rack them, and figure out what's at the bottom so you can redeploy those resources to the top. They go together, actually. And so I find the narrative, it's a false choice to think that it's either about growth or it's about pruning, stack ranking. They go together, and you have to think of them as actually empowering one another. You advised the Treasury Department during the Great Recession, what lessons did you take away from that? What struck me is a lot of the lessons from the financial crisis are relevant in good times and bad times. So the most important is it's easier to prevent into effects. And so that was really clear during the financial crisis. The financial crisis was about liquidity, and it dried up quickly. And it would have been really easy, six to 12 months prior to build a interable liquidity. You couldn't do it in the moment. And so this notion about really building a solid foundation on which you operate, you need to do that ahead of time. It needs to be all of the work we do on trust and safety and content, moderation, security. That is the foundation on which you can build everything else. The hand calls at one point said to me, you have to have the will and the means. And too often by the time you have the will, you no longer have the means. His comment was, be decisive, act early, even in the absence of information. I think that's true in this whole notion of investing for long-term growth. Because if you're not actually assessing progress along the way, and you just assume, you know what, we can keep investing in everything. At some point down the road, you'll say, I wish I had made those tough calls to double down on the things that really mattered. What times are we in now? What's your read on the economy today, especially with rising inflation? Well, look, I think back to March of 2020 and where we were. And I think of all of the intervention and steps that have been taken since then. And you've certainly seen the recovery coming out the back. And it's been really gratifying from those painful days to see the breakthroughs that we've had not just on the medical front, but we've also seen the improvement across businesses. I think one of the biggest concerns in particular, as you're seeing us, go through a digital transformation and the acceleration of it is ensuring that everyone has the skills, the digital training and skills to thrive in this new economy. MUSIC Google now reaches more than half the people on the planet. Why shouldn't we view Google as a monopoly? We often say that people come to Google not because they have to, but because they want to. It's really opening the world for so many people. So that's the intent.

14105," [♪ music playingordinarily starts to compressor-like Healthcare Solo. happyacker throat playing acabou Rhodes Hip hop I want to talk a little bit about regulation. You were drawn to M&A in your early days at Morgan Stanley. Microsoft is making some big acquisitions, deals that some think Google maybe would have wanted to win in a former life. Is antitrust scrutiny constraining any of your business plans and your ability to compete? So the main thing that we've done throughout our life of Google is really invest in innovation as organic growth and we're continuing to do that at a really rapid clip. We have then layered onto it, tuck in acquisitions and larger acquisitions. We're continuing to be active, more on the smaller ones and the add-ons to be fair. But we think there's a lot of opportunity still ahead of us. And so we're continuing to invest in partnerships, in some acquisitions and do you think that there's still upside in a lot of different areas? So would you say this regulatory scrutiny isn't slowing you down? It's really important for those of us in certain leadership positions to be very focused on constructively engaging and working with regulators on what are the issues, what is it they're trying to solve and how can we constructively engage with them. At the same time, our engineers should focus on innovation and continuing to kind of up the bar on everything we're doing, address what is most helpful for our users. Google is facing more serious legal threats at this time in the United States than the other big tech companies. How are those conversations with regulators going? Are they frustrating at this point? Well, there's certain elements that are frustrating because I listened to the outline of some of the proposed legislation. And I think it's inconsistent with some of the priorities for public policy. So as an example, there's a lot of focus on what is called self-preferencing. Are you putting too many of your own products together? But during the pandemic, one in three small businesses said they would have failed without digital skills. Why? Because what they were able to do is connect with their users in different ways. So if you go search for a small business, you can then go to a map and you can get directed to the small business, that's a good thing. We have 6,000 small businesses who wrote in and said, you know what, we need these digital tools and skills. Same with a number of things on racial equity. Real surge in searches about where can I, where's a black owned business near me and the ability to direct people through search and maps. So I think that what's really important, and that's why I said it's about constructive engagement, let's make sure we understand what they're trying to solve and work with them on what is it that we're trying to address through products so that the products are helpful in the ways that they want. Facebook has taken a serious reputational hit. Has that had ripple effects or created collateral damage for Google? Well, I think that whenever there's a backdrop that's challenging, it has ripple effects. But what we're really underscoring is all of the steps and investments that we are making to really protect the ecosystem the way we are commitment to our users. So we know how sacrosanct that trust is and it's all...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2331,2022-10-13 02:15:25
14106," making to really protect the ecosystem the way we are commitment to our users. So we know how sacrosanct that trust is. And it's all about privacy and what are the steps that we're taking to make privacy protected for our users. What is it that we're looking at to protect content and content moderations? Google now reaches more than half the people on the planet. Why shouldn't we view Google as a monopoly? So I go back to the earliest days when Google, I first learned about Google back in 1998. And in those earliest days, when I heard about this eight search engine, the question is, why do you actually need it? And back at Morgan Stanley, it's working with our research analyst, Mary Meeker. She actually had her team put up white pages all around the conference room and was doing this comparison. Well, provided the most responsive results most rapidly. And all of a sudden, you could see, well, when did this Google thing actually, maybe we do need something new. And that's been the ethos at Google since inception. It's just continued to innovate to make this eight never better experience for users. And so if we can deliver on that, which is what drives people here, it's really opening the world for so many people. So that's the intent. Facebook and Twitter are exploring digital currency. What is your thought on the crypto market? And is there a play for Google? So we look at it. There's nothing to comment on now. I think we're much more interested in blockchain and the underlying technology and the implications for the business and also for the way we can support our cloud customers. So certainly a lot of effort there. There's considerable chatter in the crypto universe that Web 3 and the blockchain could circumvent the power of Facebook and Google and more. What do you think about the next frontier of the internet? At this point, I think there are a lot of different things ahead of us that are actually studyingly exciting that enable us to actually continue to address different needs and requirements. Like I look at, for example, in something like health, where I think blockchain will be very valuable when you think about health and health records. There also a whole host of other areas where the data analytics that we provide are absolutely critical. Should we make excuses to our employers? Should we tell our, like, if I have to head to a parent teacher conference or take a kid to the doctor, do I tell my boss that I'm trying to? You don't tell your boss. You've got to get over the guilt. If you pay me I'm a fucking loser, but if like, why, why? You survived breast cancer twice. What was your biggest fear at that time and how did you overcome it? Well, the biggest fear was I wouldn't make it. I remember when someone at some interview while I was...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2332,2022-10-13 02:19:52
14107," And how did you overcome it? Well, the biggest fear was I wouldn't make it. And I remember when someone at some interview while I was going through chemo said, where do you want to be in five years? And I froze because it was, I want to be alive. And I learned a couple of really important things. One, given breakthroughs in medical technology, I learned to love the word manageable. This journey does become manageable, not for all cancers, but for many more cancers. And that gave me a lot of confidence talking with other survivors about it is manageable, get the best care. And just plow through it. I was just very grateful. I'm grateful for all of the investments people have made over the years, but for anybody out there. And I think everybody sadly will be touched by cancer, either themselves or someone they know and love. Many of these cancers are manageable. And just go at it with gusto. So that's what I did. You're a mom of three sons. And I find that especially remarkable, because I also have three sons. How have you managed that over the course of this incredible career? How do you find that right mix of focus and free time to spend time with your family and doing the things that you love? So my kids give me energy. They're remarkable. And I think one of the important things for me is this notion that you do have to have a mix. It's not about trying to find balance, the physics of which is really challenging. I think when people try for balance, they always feel they're failing on something, because something's out of whack. So this metaphor that life is like a kaleidoscope. And you need to have different shaped pieces of glass and different color. And sometimes one is larger than the other. And what's beautiful about life is when it's constantly moving around. And so to me that metaphor has actually been sort of an anchoring principle. The other is you have to put the kids first. So they know that I'm there when they need always. And I think that just making sure that you're setting the boundaries the way you need to, I would say it's much easier today than when I was growing up in banking. We had a cubicle. There was a computer room. You were anchored to the computer room. One of the many beautiful things about going through this evolution in work is understanding that hybrid works. So how do we get rid of mom guilt? Especially in this new work world. I want to shake my mom guilt. How do I do that? OK, so even when you feel it, just say, you know what, it's an investment in my career, because I can stay in this longer and be operating at a higher level if I'm really getting the stimulus from all parts of my life. So you've got to drop the mom guilt and when on the other side mom guilt with kids, I think they get it. I think they understand what we're doing. And you know, I'll never forget during the financial crisis at one point I was working on, AIG. We went around the clock. I came home to shower that one like right as we were landing AIG. And my three kids had each written me a yellow sticky note with a message on it. And one of them was based, you know, the essence of which was, I get why you're doing this. And they saw it as the right thing for the country. I don't need to over dramatize what it was, but that's what it felt like at the time. And that level of pride, I still have those three stickies right by my bedside because I get it. I get the mom guilt. I wish there were certain elements I could have done differently. But I also see the relationship we have and they understand what it means to actually be engaged in society and doing something you care about. No mom guilt. No mom guilt. Thank you. It's not allowed. Thank you. Should we make excuses to our employers? Should we tell our, like, if I have to head to a parent teacher conference or take a kid to the doctor, do I tell my boss that I'm wrong? You don't tell your boss. You don't tell your boss. Guys don't tell their boss. So what do we say? I don't think you say anything. I actually made this point at an event at Morgan Stanley. I'm like, do not tell your boss. You've got to get over the guilt. The only way to move on from it is realize, I'm a professional. I do things when I can and it makes sense and I get it all done. I just do it on my own timeline. And I actually had a woman who emailed me afterwards and said, I know you said I'm not.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2333,2022-10-13 02:24:16
14108," Do things when I, when I can and it makes sense and I get it all done. I just do it on my own timeline. And I actually had a woman who emailed me afterwards and said, I know you said, I'm not supposed to tell my boss. So I won't, but I can't not tell somebody. So I'm going to email you. And I'm like, okay, that's step one of five step journey. Do not tell your boss. You're tell your boss, you know what? I need to do certain things for myself. And I, it's getting, I feel guilty doing it, but I get everything done. There's no question you are so beyond having to check in with people. Well, thank you. So, do not. We're in the middle of this so-called great resignation. And people are reflecting and changing and making big decisions. What's your advice to people in this big evolution? You know, huge choices ahead. Well, I think you framed it really well. I don't think it's the great resignation. I think it's the great reshuffle. And people are reflecting on what do they want and how do they want to work? And how do they want to live their life? So I think for all of us thinking about what does that mean for our institutions, it is about evolving the way we work, the way we interact, the expectations that we have to say, but I grew up in a cubicle on the 26th floor of a skyrise. It doesn't work anymore. And so what should we do as leaders? And I think that our, this generation appropriately, and it's very exciting, expects more from all of us. And so it's not just in how we work, but it is in what we do. And I think all elements of what's the mission, are you delivering on the mission? Is really important. OK, so if you rapid fire questions, someone you'd love to have dinner with? Well, I'd love to say my parents, because they passed away in over years ago. Favorite family ritual? We do this crazy thing that we've done for years, which is everybody gets to pick where we travel. We come up with the five different locations, and then we all vote, and then we get the grid. And that's where we go. What's your favorite getaway? Probably, I would say maybe Iceland was the vast. That's an amazing one. New York or California? Ooh, so unfair. Well, sitting here outdoors right now, and knowing I can do that for the rest of the years for you guys, for the energy from New York. So I'm not going to, it's like, I don't pick amongst children. So, in closing, Google is a massive company, multiple divisions, many bets. Where are you spending most of your time now? I'm spending most of my time on your very more in question about capital allocation, because if it really goes to this core point, you've got to invest for long-term growth, and making sure that you're investing with the right intensity, I often say, I don't want to get to the two-yard line, but not score. So you need to make sure you're investing with the right intensity to support long-term growth. That's the most important area where I would say I spend the bulk of my time, and then, of course, you have to prioritize in order to recycle to support those efforts. What kind of discussions are you having with Larry and Sergey now about this next phase of Google? So when they made the announcement about the role of change, they were very serious about moving to this board role, and they've been, they're amazing board members. Sundar, of course, relies on them for counsel, wherever, whenever, but most of the interaction is really around what are we doing at the board level? It's been great. And you have your freedom to allocate capital as you like. I work closely with Sundar and Philip and Thomas. Yes, we work as a great team. So what's the vision for Google then ten years from now? You know, it's fascinating to... I think I had the same reaction you did when I heard Sundar say search is the biggest moonshot. And I think that continuing to find ways to be helpful to users to solve what they need, where so many people are coming online and it is video going to be the first... the way they understand it's going to be about... you know, search is going to be a different type of experience. So much of it's going to be about voice, first, and language translation. So it's going to continue to evolve. And what about for you, personally? Like, where will you... You know, it's been so amazing to hear about your journey. And I'm just curious about your personal growth. What you feel you've accomplished in the last, you know, since you've been here and what you hope to accomplish.

14109," What you feel you've accomplished in the last, you know, since you've been here and what you hope to accomplish. I find that the opportunity to try new things and to invest in new things and as we think about, well, what does that mean for each one of our areas? There's, I think that intellectual curiosity keeps you young and I think that continuing to learn is like your brain, it's like silly putty getting pulled in a lot of directions. So to me, it's continuous learning. Ritpoorat, thank you so much for joining us. It's been wonderful to be here. Thank you. Great to have you on campus. Let's go inside. Thank you so much for doing this. Well thanks for doing it. Of course. So sorry I'm late and I'm coming late for it. Not at all. It gave us more chance to tweak the lights for the 50,000th time. So you're doing well? Yes. How often are you coming into the office these days? About two to three days a week. How about you? I guess you come in. Yeah, I'm in every day now. So no more kids on the set. I have to ask, is your son still mining Ethereum? He and I literally were talking about it last night. He's like that. You were the one who made me give up on it. I'm like, no, I didn't. But yeah, the thing that's good about this is I think it excites a whole new generation about technology, which is good. I really appreciate taking this time. Well, thank you for doing it and thank you for coming down to do it. I'm ready to go in you guys are. From Google headquarters in Mountain View, California, this is Bloomberg Studio 1.0 with Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai. Born and raised in India, Pichai had almost no access to a computer until college. But just years later, found himself rising through the ranks of the world's largest search engine. In 2015, it was Pichai that Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin chose to run Google and later Alphabet. Now valued at more than $2 trillion. It's one of the most powerful companies on the planet. Sundar, it's great to be with you today. Thanks for doing this. Great to be here in person. Google just hit a $2 trillion market cap. Alphabet, I should say. Where is the next trillion dollars going to come from? You know, I've always felt, you know, your market cap valuation is an effect of the value you provide. And I feel fortunate our mission is timeless. You know, there is more need to organize information than ever before. I still feel searches are biggest moonshot as a company. You know, people will want radically more conversational experiences. They will want what we call multimodal experiences. They may speak to search. They may look at something and ask what the information is. Being able to adapt to all that and evolve search will continue to be the biggest opportunity.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2335,2022-10-13 02:32:49
14110," they may speak to search, they may look at something and ask what the information is. Being able to adapt to all that and evolve search will continue to be the biggest opportunity. We are so excited about the YouTube, cloud, or hardware products, Google Play. So we're building a diverse set of businesses, but underlying all of it is the investments we are making in AI. We've invested $100 billion in R&D in the past five years. And so applying AI in a deep way is probably where we will create the biggest opportunity ahead. Microsoft is making some big acquisitions. Apple's anti-adtracking technology is shaking up the industry. What do you make of these competitive moves? Your competitors say they're on the right side of history. Are they? Look at the fact that there are three billion people who have access to knowledge of their fingertips. I look at the opportunity we provide. I look at the skills people are learning through YouTube. You know, I feel that everywhere when I go talk to people and providing access to information and knowledge, I think will end up being on the right side of history as well. Your predecessor, Eric Schmidt, told me that he feels the latest Facebook revelations are disturbing. Google also has access to massive amounts of our data. Why should half the world's population more than half the world's population trust Google to do the right thing? We are trying to do more with less data. One of the biggest changes we made was making order delete the default setting for new users signing in and now over two billion users have their data continuously being deleted. Look, we rely on trust for people, you know, every day when people come to Google, you know, they place their trust to us and vulnerable moments. Maybe a healthy shoe on which they are trying to understand. There's no more important responsibility we have than doing right by that trust. You know, when we provide Gmail to journalists and realize that their accounts may be under attack by an authoritarian government. I mean, that's what motivates us to make sure be privacy, be security, be trust. We are doing the right thing. Over time, regulation will have an important role to play here. I think privacy regulation is important in areas like AI regulation will be important. And so I think, you know, those will be part of the answers as well. The Facebook fallout that Instagram can be toxic to teens, for example, has this raised more or new concerns for you about the impact of technology, tech addiction, algorithms, YouTube even on our children and their development and their mental health. I mean, you're a parent and you also have a lot of power over how this plays out. You know, I mean, like you, you know, bringing kids up in this modern digital world is something I think all parents are anxious about rightfully so. I think, you know, it's part of why a few years ago when in YouTube, you know, we were exposed to a set of concerns. You know, we invested it became the number one priority to work harder. The reason YouTube invested so much in developing YouTube kids as a safe destination for young children, so on. The technology is going to play a big role in helping give children the next wave of opportunity as well. So the answer is to develop it responsibly. We have changed our balance in these areas and saying we think about content responsibility first and then the pace of development or new features in areas like YouTube. And so that's how we approach it for a while. Facebook and Microsoft are all in on the metaverse. What do you think about the metaverse? What's Google's metaverse strategy? It's always been obvious to me that computing over time will adapt to people and people adapting to computers. You know, you won't always interact with computing in a black rectangle in front of you. So just like you speak to people you see and interact. Computers will become more immersive. They'll be there when you need it to be so always been excited about the future of. So you're going to be immersive computing ambient computing AR and we are in that count as the metaverse is that what that is. You know metaverse is I think it means different things to different people. The way I think about it is evolving computing in an immersive way with augmented reality as part of that there'll be.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2336,2022-10-13 02:37:07
14111," I think it means different things to different people. The way I think about it is evolving computing in an immersive way with augmented reality. As part of that, there will be many experiences, some of which will be immersive, interactive virtual worlds, which is the metaverse concept. But I think this doesn't belong to any company. This is the evolution of internet and the web, the internet, all of it will continue to evolve. Google was famous for its campuses, where you could go and never leave. You had everything you ever wanted. Now, you've said they can be flexible, they can work from home, they can work at the office, they can be hybrid, they can work remotely permanently, perhaps. Are you committed to really letting them do this forever? And if so, how does that change the future of work and society? Look, we have really embraced the fact that the future is going to be flexible. At Google, we've always tried to give agency to our employees. But we do realize the importance of bringing people together, the creativity, community, and collaboration that comes with it. So the balance we are striking is this notion of 3.2. But we are giving the strength of our companies, we have more locations than most of the companies. So we're giving people a choice to move anywhere in the world. Four weeks they can work from anywhere. We're going to accommodate 20% of our workforce to be remote over time. So we're going to embrace that flexibility. Forever. Forever. Forever. Yeah. And we're committed to it. Through it to all, it forces us to design better products. And since people use Google Workspace to run their companies, I think gives us a chance to innovate and bring all that out. You know, I think there is so much value in giving people more flexibility between their personal and professional lives. And I think it will lead to people being happier. And I think companies can be successful in that model. And so we are trying to get the best of both worlds, but embrace the flexibility and see where we go. How confident are you that when you look back, you'll be able to say Google did enough to help save the world? We are putting so much energy and resources into it. You grew up in India. You lived through droughts. Water was scarce. How has that experience shaped your feelings about the urgency of stopping climate change? You know, I grew up in Chennai, India, and a big part of my childhood was, you know, really pretty severe water scarcity. You know, we would get water trucked in for the streets and stand in lines and carry a few buckets of water home. There was no running water for many years. And, you know, but fast forward.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2337,2022-10-13 02:41:19
14112," were trapped in for the streets and stand in lines and carry a few buckets of water home. There was no running water for many years. And, you know, but fast forward a few years ago, you know, Chennai had one in a hundred year flood, you know, which was a very extreme event, kind of drove home. That combined with a few years ago, waking up to the orange skies here in the Bay Area, seeing the look of concern on my children's faces and having to explain it, you know, all kind of drove home in a deeply personal way for me. So I think it's the most defining issue we all face and, you know, definitely something very motivated on working towards. I remember waking up to those orange skies too and having to have that same conversation with my kids. Do you think the commitments at COP26 went far enough? You know, encouraged by many things, you know, we have to tip our hat to the people who are working super hard. The issues and the trade-offs are genuinely difficult, you know, you have to keep the economies growing, you know, it really matters. And, but at the same time, it's a pretty severe urgent issue. So I'm encouraged by the progress. I think it builds on the Paris agreement. So I can see the forward progress. There is the deep anxiety that it all may not be enough. But, you know, we have to be optimistic and keep pushing. Google has set some aggressive targets to run entirely on clean energy to be the first tech giant to do so 24 hours a day. How confident are you that when you look back on this time, let's say a decade from now, you'll be able to say Google did enough to help save the world? We are putting so much energy and resources into it. It's always been kind of a founding value for us. We've been carbon neutral since 2007. We've been matching our energy consumption with renewable energy over the past few years. So this, you know, we are now pushing its moonshot to be 24, 7 carbon free. That means every search you do, every email you send that we can do it carbon free. We were at 61 percent in 2019. The number is now 67 percent. We have set our goals to be 100 percent by 2030 and to do it globally, that means we have to solve new things which we haven't done before. Wind and solar alone won't be enough. We just started geothermal in Nevada. We will be investing in newer technologies, including carbon capture, etc. over time. So that's what excites me. We are a technology company at heart. So, part of there are many answers to this problem. Some of it is that we are going to have to innovate our way out of it. And, you know, we want to push as hard as possible in doing that. Our Bloomberg New Economy Forum is happening this year in Singapore and the Asia Pacific region is one of the fastest growing internet economies on the planet. Where do you see the most room, the most opportunity for Google to grow there? You know, it's such a fitting time frame, you know, glad you're focused on the region. It's the most vibrant region we see. It's our 20th year since we opened our office in Tokyo. It was the first office outside the Bay Area. You have two and a half billion people on the internet. There are many areas in which they are they are leapfrogging trends which are here and embracing the future digital payments is a great example. So, many of our products originated from APAC, Google Maps, Google Pay, a lot of our journey to bring computing to more people is playing out in Asia as well. I am excited about also the work we are doing through cloud because the companies that are rapidly transforming themselves digitally. So, a chance to provide that is something very exciting for us. So, super dynamic region that I feel like we are learning as Google being in the region. And so, I think it will transform. The first 10 years I would have said we took products here and brought it to APAC. Over the past few years, we are beginning to build things there. And some of our future global products will be APAC first and rest of the world later. You can't talk about APAC without talking about China and your facing stiff competition from Chinese tech giants there and beyond. What should US policymakers know about competing with China?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2338,2022-10-13 02:45:46
14113," China and your facing stiff competition from Chinese tech giants there and beyond. What should US policymakers know about competing with China? There's a lot of conversations about US and China, the competition is fierce. Many of the cadet areas like AI and quantum computing where we are investing a lot. The Chinese companies are neck to neck. What I think about, you know, was encouraged by the news coming out of Glasgow, about the US-China agreement on climate. To me, while we talk about all the areas where we are competing, some of the biggest areas which are common challenges for all of humanity. The pandemic was one, AI and AI safety over time will be a shared one, obviously sustainability is another area like that. So I think these are all areas in which the countries can come together. And so I think that's a way by which we think about as, you know, when we compete on the internet and there may be different visions of how the internet plays out. So I see opportunities both sides. What are the chances that Google search will ever come back to China? Or that Google Cloud would ever come to China? You know, today we don't provide most of our signed-in services in China. I don't see that changing. But, you know, there are ways, as I said, in areas like AI or sustainability. I think there'll be opportunities for us to work together. Through Cloud, we will support multinational companies which have presents everywhere. And so maybe there are opportunities to work that way as well. AI is advancing at an astonishing rate. And it is hard to understand sometimes what this really means. In concrete terms, how will our lives look different? Let's say 10 years from now as a result of AI. You know, done correctly, you know, in many ways it's going to be helpful to you. You'll take it for granted. The same way today, for example, in India, over one-third of the queries on many phones come through voice. But it's something people take for granted. You can do it. So over time, you'll expect to speak and be able to understand any language in the world. And, you know, those are all ways it's going to make it better. You may go to a doctor's office and go through a scan. And the system may be prioritizing for the radiologist so that they don't miss some important things, maybe giving them a second opinion. You know, so these are all ways in which it will seamlessly start playing a role. And I think we'll see that if it's a fact. You mentioned if done correctly. And there are concerns. There are fears that AI will replicate the worst of society, even under Google's own roof, from your own researchers. What scares you most about AI? What keeps you up at night? It's the most profound thing we are working on as humanity. And any time you're developing technology, there is a dual site to it. I think the journey of humanity is harnessing the benefits while minimizing the downsides. The good thing with AI is it's both going to take time. I think I've seen more focus on the downsides early on than most of the technology we've developed. So in some ways, I'm encouraged by how much concern there is. And you're right, even within Google, people think about it deeply. We publish a lot of research. There are, I think it's more important that there are outside academic institution, governments, nonprofits looking at this issue as well. So I think it'll be an issue which will have a lot of attention, which gives me a lot of comfort as well. You said you'd pick up some new hobbies in the pandemic. What did you start?

What have you learned as CEO since the walkout? For me, it was a moment. I think it changed the company for the better. We've always been committed. It gave us an insight on what more we could do. We undertook deep commitments. And the biggest overall and diversity and inclusion, I think if you're committed and you actually put in the effort behind it, you can make a difference. Now we have stated clear goals. We are on track to meet those goals. But it forced us to think about new answers. So for example, tech companies used to talk about the pipeline problem. But we are now going to places where the talent is. We are working much harder. So going to Atlanta, going to DC, going to Chicago, going to New York. That's improving our diversity and representation at all levels. The war for talent is even more competitive now in this new world. What are you offering? Elon Musk has said, big tech is a place where talent goes to die. How do you respond to that? I look at the fact that we are looking to hire 30,000 people next year. I look at the impact we have on many people coming and working in the latest cutting-edge things. And many people come in. People leave Google. We are proud of people who have left Google. I think there are over 2,000 companies that have been started by whom we call as Googlers. I'm equally proud of that. I think we are one part of a big system. I think I'm proud of the role we play in bringing in people and the impact they have over time in the outside world. That's most of the heavy stuff out of the way. We're going to do some rapid fire just to get to know you a little bit better. You said you'd pick up some new hobbies in the pandemic. What did you start? You know, cooking pizza, just learning to cook, which I was never good at. I've gotten a little bit better. Cricket or soccer slash football? Wow. Stuff. Both. Please don't make a quiz. Okay. Squigame or Ted Lasso? I watched both. The Ted Lasso is much more calm. I'd rather take Ted Lasso over-scoot games any day. I know you're a voracious reader. So what's the last good book that you read? You know, I've been on a podcast bench. So a lot more podcasts than books nowadays. Okay. Favorite videos you watch on YouTube with your kids? A lot of music videos. Music videos. This whole notion where creators are watching other things and commenting on it. It's a trend which my kids are really into.

14116," Music Jeff Bezos shocked the world when he stepped down a CEO of Amazon. Less shocking was his choice for successor. Annie Jassy was not only one of his longest tenured lieutenants, but the architect of Amazon's multi-billion dollar cloud business, Amazon Web Services, a moonshot that helped transform Amazon into not just e-commerce, but enterprise juggernaut. Jassy then needed to find his own successor, tapping a former colleague who helped grow AWS in its earliest days, but had since left to run Seattle software giant Tableau. His job to continue the reinvention of AWS and in turn, Amazon. Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, new AWS CEO, Adam Salipski. You worked for AWS for 11 years and then went on to become CEO of Tableau Software in 2016. Can you get a call from Amazon to come back and run AWS as CEO? Tell me about that call. Well, I was having a one-on-one at my prior company and my Apple news alerts went off like everybody else's did. And it's at Jeff Bezos is taking on a new role and Andy Jassy is taking on the CEO role of Amazon. And of course, Andy and I worked shoulder to shoulder about 20 feet apart for 11 years. So of course, I reached out and congratulated him and we started talking. And the conversation turned to some of the possibilities. And next thing I know a little while later, here I am back at Amazon, absolutely delighted and honored to be the CEO of AWS and helping to shepherd this amazing business for our customers. In that process, did you talk to Jeff as well? I had some communication, but it was, you know, principally with Andy who of course was a new AWS business best and of course was taking on the CEO role. But yeah, there was contact as you might expect with a small handful of other people. So what did Andy tell you he wanted in the next chapter for AWS? Andy reminded me, nothing I needed reminding, but that it has really still day one for AWS and for our customers. It is still so early in this business. And we shouldn't think that just because the business has grown rapidly or just because we're currently the leader in the cloud, that it's anything close to mature. And so he really reminded me that we have to stay hungry, innovate as quickly as we ever have done in the past. You're about half a year into the job. What changed while you were gone that surprised you? Well, I think that so many more customers have really adopted the cloud and really decided that they're going all in. So I mean, it was a pretty decent sized business when I left, but it's really grown and the customer base is really expanded. And so now we have very deep relationships at the CEO level, the CIO level across every country, every industry, every use case. And we're regularly interacting with the most senior people at our client organizations. So you were working at real networks in the early 2000s and I understand you were offered a job at AWS without even really knowing what it was. I guess AWS was in stealth mode. Well, it was very secret. So it was hard that the company didn't want to talk too much about it, but of course, we had to talk a certain amount about it. So the call I got went something like.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2342,2022-10-13 03:06:19
14117," Very secret. It was hard that the company didn't want to talk too much about it, but of course, we had to talk a certain amount about it. So the call I got went something like, we have this initiative to turn the guts of Amazon inside out and expose it to other people. And it sounded intriguing, although I confess I didn't fully understand what that was all about. So I came in and started talking to Andy and a few of the other senior leaders and eventually to Jeff. I would have to say that even by the time I took the job, I thought I mostly understand what they're talking about. And it sounds like a good idea and I'm in. But I also was like, well, we'll just have to see how it goes and Amazon is a big place. And so I think we got a lot of intent to succeed here. That's the thing that impressed me was Amazon really had the desire and the intent and the belief that this could be a really good business. AWS comes out of stealth mode and is the first to market with a cloud infrastructure service in 2006. How important was that first start? And do you think AWS still has an advantage today because of that? I think the time to market advantage that we had, which was probably honestly five to seven years, had start before other companies really started to take this seriously, was in a norm. Just one of the biggest things that happened to us in the early years. Because at the beginning, a lot of people didn't get it. I would get asked a lot in 2006. So what does this have to do with selling books? And I even had a slide with kind of a pilot books on it and a question mark next to it. And the answer was it has nothing to do with selling books. But the technology which enables us to sell books, being global, being at a massive scale, being secure, being low cost, being a highly performant. All that technology has everything to do with offering these types of services externally. Now AWS isn't a scrappy startup anymore. And you do have big rivals, even though AWS is still the leader. Microsoft and Google are big rivals. How do you make sure that being big doesn't slow you down? It's a great question. Because we are currently the leader. And depending on which third party you look at, we're probably a little bit more than twice as big as number two. And it's really important to continue to act as if we're insurgents and to be insurgents and not to start to act like incumbents. And I like to talk about actually managing the business. We want our senior leaders to be managing product and managing customers. And I think as you get bigger and you put more and more layers into your company, it's all too frequent that you start managing math. You start managing ratios and percentages and growth. And I think it's a real disease if you stray away from really focusing on a deep way on the product you're building and a deep way on what your customers are telling you. And so we try and organize both with our org structure as well as just with our culture and what we choose to focus on. And really making sure that everybody is thinking about one or both of those two things, product and customers. And if you keep even the most senior leaders engaged at that level, then all of a sudden you maintain the urgency and you keep acting like an insurgent. We got to feel that urgency every day. So keep acting like an insurgent. That's the motto. Absolutely. And structure yourself and build a culture that allows you to. It's one thing to say it. But it's easy to say it. But it's much harder to put in place enabling mechanisms that enable you to do so. And we focus a lot of effort on those mechanisms. Now do you think the cloud keeps getting bigger? And that AWS and Microsoft and Google just get bigger pieces of an ever-expanding pie? Or at some point, does it become a zero-sum game? And that fight for market share becomes more brutal and more bloody? Well, I mean, this is a very large market segment. I mean, if you look at global IT spend, it's in the trillions of dollars I've seen estimates like three trillion dollars. It doesn't really matter how many trillions it is. It's very, very large. And we've always believed that this was too good a market segment opportunity for the really to only be one winner. And sure enough, you've seen robust competition emerge and we all compete vigorously. But it is, the segment is just growing so rapidly that I think really for us, we believe that the winning business strategy for a long time to come and I would maintain forever is to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2343,2022-10-13 03:10:46
14118," A rapidly that I think really for us, we believe that the winning business strategy for a long time to come and I would maintain forever is to focus not on the competitors but to focus maniacally on customers and wake up every day understanding exactly what it is that they need us to build next and then work backwards from there, back internally to how can we build those things. And if we do the best job at building the most quickly, the things that are most important for our customers, then I'm really not worried about what the competitors will do. You worked 10 feet away from Andy Jassy in the early days. Tell us something about the Amazon CEO that no one knows but you. You're going to get me in trouble aren't you? Or course. You worked 10 feet away from Andy Jassy in the early days. Tell us something about the Amazon CEO that no one knows but you. You're going to get me in trouble aren't you? We as you know I grew up in Seattle and Andy coming from New York has this fascination I don't understand with New York sports teams. So I've had to endure that for a lot of years. New Yorkers. So what are you going to do? Although he's I think come to adopt some of the Seattle teams, particularly the new hockey team, the Kraken here. As he should. As he should exactly. So how do you expect Andy will be different from Jeff or how has Andy already been different from Jeff? Well I think we're all different as leaders. I think it's all important that we it's important that we all bring our own stamp to it and operate within ourselves. I don't think I would be a very good Andy. I don't want to presume but I would assume that Andy wouldn't be a great Jeff because Jeff's Jeff Andy's Andy and I'm me. So I think that Andy was certainly bringing a great depth of experience from AWS which is one important part of the business and. So having operated that business for so long and I expect that will also give him an opportunity although he was involved in other parts of Amazon certainly for a number of years. We'll be able to bring a fresh perspective to the whole company just as I hope to bring to AWS and I think that fresh perspective is often helpful. I think just the mere act of change is useful for the business, for customers, for employees and just to shake things up a little bit. So I think just a fresh perspective. How will you be different from Andy? Well, I think that the world around us is changing so much that we're going to have to be different. It doesn't matter what we did yesterday and right after I joined we actually added two new leadership principles.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2344,2022-10-13 03:15:07
14119," at or what we did yesterday and right after I joined we actually added two new leadership principles which is very exciting. One's around striving to be Earth's best employer and the second around focusing on the fact that success and scale bring broad responsibility. And those are things about which I personally am very passionate and so I really personally look forward to digging in and helping the company to figure out what are those things that we have to figure out where can we innovate to be Earth's best employer and then also to figure out externally what can we do to really be great citizens of our local communities, to be great citizens of our national communities and to be great citizens of the global community. And I care a lot about those things as a lot of other people do here but I plan to put a good amount of energy and time and focus and hopefully help Amazon innovate in all of those areas. And closely do you work with Andy Day to Day? Does he regularly weigh in on AWS decisions or not? Well he's got a pretty broad scope of things to worry about now so he's got a pretty intense day job I believe. So he's really focused across the company as you would expect him to be. But that being said obviously AWS remains an important part of Amazon and so we touch base regularly be it in person or via email just on the most important things going on in the business. So Jeff ever weigh in on AWS decisions? Yes, I mean really from the beginning Jeff was involved at the very, very beginning at some of the most fundamental decisions. How do you price EC2? What do you name S3? What does the detail page look like? Obviously over time we the business grew and but this Jeff was always available when we needed him and I certainly anticipate that will be the same going forward. So is he still available now? And what do you understand that Jeff's priorities are? Sure. Well let Jeff speak to his own priorities but certainly Jeff has been available when for example we've been doing our annual planning cycle as many companies have and it's been great to have Jeff weigh in on really where we're heading for the next year and beyond and to just make sure it's easy to get focused on the details of the business and it's great to have multiple people who can help you pick your eyes up a little bit. Now you joined AWS in the middle of a pandemic. We came back to AWS in the middle of a pandemic that's hopefully moving into the rear view mirror. Moderna is one of AWS's biggest customers. If it weren't for the cloud, if it weren't for AWS, would we have had a vaccine as quickly as we did? I've got to tell you I'm I use but it's been an absolute privilege for us to work with Moderna because what they're doing obviously is literally life saving and they've been so innovative and so creative. So Moderna took a drug development process to get to the vaccine candidate. That process would typically have taken them 20 months and doing that on AWS in conjunction with all the innovation on their side reduced that 20 months to 42 days 42 days to get the vaccine candidate the MRNA vaccine candidate for COVID-19. And that was really running on running multiple parts of Moderna on AWS. So if you look at the drug design part, they had their drug design studio running on AWS all the way to manufacturing with the new digitized manufacturing that they call their digital manufacturing platform. So it's really end to end and the ability to use massive amounts of resources and to pick the exact type of service and capability for each part of the job and to really bring the full set of resources to bear. In addition to not having to focus on the IT and the infrastructure and the technology and rather letting Moderna focus on the all important job of drug discovery. So working in partnership it was just magnificent to see what they accomplished. Since you joined AWS a number of longtime AWS leaders have moved on to Microsoft, to strive to tablo. Does that concern you? Well actually retention has been very good. If you mentioned the senior leaders, if you look at the VP plus ranks, VP and above ranks at Amazon, the average tenure is over a decade, over 10 years. So that's actually very, very strong retention. And later this little screen photo is based on an older online organization畫 block. We're pretty sure we've made way in with.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2345,2022-10-13 03:19:27
14120," the VPN above ranks at Amazon, the average tenure is over a decade, over 10 years. So that's actually very, very strong retention. So of course, you're always going to have some level of people coming and people going. And at the end of the day, that's actually healthy for the business. You want new perspectives to come in. Of course, in the right proportion. Amazon has opened an investigation after 550 employees supported a petition, claiming a culture of discrimination, harassment, bullying, and bias. What's the status of this? Well, we are incredibly focused. And I personally believe it's incredibly important to really have a very diverse, you know, inclusive and equitable environment. And we're going to make sure that whatever it takes that we've got that. So we believe that we're really doing a lot of things to deliver on that. And we've got a lot of innovative efforts around bringing in a diverse workforce, which we have to have both because we're going to serve our customers best, their diverse. We have to match that diversity. And also, I just believe it's our responsibility. And it's the right thing to do. Any time there is any possibility that things are not something is not gone the way we wanted to, we're going to investigate it thoroughly. That's what we're doing in this case. And we'll make sure that we're operating in a way that's consistent with our values. And that's always the only goal. If you could rewind to the early 2000s, the earliest days of AWS. Is there anything you would have done differently to build an inclusive culture to start with a more inclusive culture. To make sure that it didn't become a, you know, a boys club. Well, I don't think that's what we have. I think that we do have a really fun, exciting innovation led and inclusive culture. And that being said, these are hard problems. I think we've done a lot, but we are nowhere close to where we need to be. We're going to be restless and dissatisfied with our progress on DE and I just as we are with every other part of our business. Mark Zuckerberg is making a big bet on the metaverse. How big do you think it's going to be? It's such an interesting sense. The metaverse is real. I'm going to be honest with you. I'm going to be honest with you. I'm going to be honest with you. I'm going to be honest with you. I'm going to be honest with you. I'm going to be honest with you. AWS has the biggest trove of sensitive corporate data in the world. There are nation states around the world that want that information. Hackers and criminals want that information. We are very clear to start with that. Our first job is security. We often say security is job zero. It was on the first page of our operating plan pretty much every year.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2346,2022-10-13 03:23:26
14121," Our first job is security. We often say security is job zero. It was on the first page of our operating plan pretty much every year that I can remember. But what about when governments request that information? So, subpoena that information. Sure. Well, we are very clear that our customers data is their data. So the data belongs to our customers. And not everybody operates that way. We are not going to look at customers data. We are not going to compete against our customers using their data. Their data is their data. And furthermore, we have all sorts of architectural best practices that our customers should be and are using for any sensitive data. And so a lot of that really relies around encryption. And so we build a lot of different encryption capabilities so that any sensitive data, which could leak for any reason, be it to a government, be it to a hacker, be it to anyone else, any form of security breach, that it's encrypted and useless to anybody else. Given the broad array of encryption solutions that we provide, it's actually very doable and powerful for our customers to safeguard their data that way. Mark Zuckerberg is making a big bet on the metaverse. Is AWS going to have a role in the metaverse? I think AWS already has a big role in the metaverse. So I think the cloud enables the metaverse. So if you think about all of the compute capacity, all of the storage, all of the machine learning, which is required to create, compelling and delightful end user experiences in the metaverse, a lot of that is already today running on AWS. So if you take Epic Games, for example, so Epic Runs Fortnite, massively popular game, 350 million users worldwide, and Epic runs almost everything on AWS from the back end. Servers to the analytics and everything in between. So I think that's a great example of the metaverse at work and all that's happening today on AWS. And we anticipate that's only gonna grow really rapidly in the future. How big do you think it's gonna be? Such an interesting sentence, the metaverse is real. And yet it's virtual at the same time. I think that if we continue to do what we've always done, which is to provide a technology platform that allows organizations to transform, then these gaming and entertainment and social media and other companies will be able to do what they do best, which is to focus on innovating on behalf of their end users. And I think that the metaverse in many other areas will be rich with inventions. So this next conversation will happen in the spheres in the metaverse, that's where we'll next meet. That could be, I'll meet you in the metaverse. All right, see you there. Now I know that climate change, and stopping climate change, and your data center footprint is a big passion of yours. How fast will Amazon's data centers get to carbon neutral? Amazon is already the largest purchaser of renewable energy in the world. And we intend to be 100% renewable energy by the year 2025. We originally said 2030. We actually accelerated that by five years to 2025. And that's part of our broad or climate pledge that Amazon created, and to which we've now gotten 200 other organizations to sign on to. And the climate pledge is to be a net zero carbon by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Accord target. So we know how to do some of that. Other part are going to require invention, but we really look forward to it. And I think it's one of the most important things we can do for our generation. Amazon counts some of the biggest oil and gas producers as its customers. Isn't that a contradiction? Should you be kicking them off your platforms? Those customers are trying to get to sustainable business models which rely on new energy sources. And so many of those customers are figuring out how do they get to wind, how do they get to solar, how do they get into batteries, all new business models relying on renewable energy. And I think rather than abandoning them and having them maybe dig in more on fossil fuels, if we can enable them to move faster, to be more innovative, and to be more agile in figuring out new business models, new tactical solutions.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2347,2022-10-13 03:28:03
14122," on fossil fuels. If we can enable them to move faster, to be more innovative, and to be more agile in figuring out new business models, new technical solutions, experimenting, failing fast, and moving on to the next idea, then the whole world will get to the renewable energy solutions that we need. At this year's ReInvent Conference, it'll be the first time that Andy Chassi is not giving the keynote. You will be, give us a preview. What can we expect to hear? We're going to have a lot of really exciting announcements. So I think across our service portfolio, you'll see that. We have a lot of exciting partner announcements. The partner ecosystem still remains to this day so important to what AWS is doing, and we have some great announcements lined up for that. And then I think people are going to want to see that we're making it easier and easier for them to consume the cloud and to work with AWS. And so we're going to continue to, in addition to building more powerful basic capabilities, we're going to continue to make it easier and easier in a variety of ways to interact with AWS.

14123," We rewind to talk about where YouTube has been and fast forward to where it's going next, with one of the longest-tenured employees in women at Google, the CEO of YouTube, Susan Wajitski. It's been five years since we last talked on camera, and we have a new president. We are weathering a pandemic. The most watched video on YouTube is... Baby Shark? Baby Shark. So, a lot's changed since 2016. How do you feel about YouTube 2021 versus 2016? I feel good about it. It's definitely been a while, and technology things move so quickly, so a lot of things have changed since 2016. And overall, I've been really pleased that we've continued to grow and grow our ecosystem of creators. We've invested a lot in responsibility. And that's been a really big focus for us, and with weather through a pandemic and a lot of hard challenges, but overall, I'm feeling really good. You've been at Google for 20 plus years going all the way back to Larry and Sergey in the garage. You've been the CEO of YouTube for seven plus years. How has your job changed in that time? Since I joined being the CEO of YouTube, I would say one of the biggest things that has changed, certainly, has just been maybe the recognition of the importance of digital video. So, when I first joined, actually a lot of people would say, oh, like, why did you join? I was running ads beforehand, and that's been the main way Google generates revenue. And so, a lot of people said, like, why did you leave that and go to YouTube? But I always believed in digital video, and I believe that now we see that the world also believes we've seen a lot of adoption of digital video and the benefits that that can have. You've championed this diversification strategy at YouTube since you started. What's working and what's not working? Well, our main way of generating revenue is from advertising. But we also have really grown our subscription revenue, and that has been really, really, important from many different reasons. So, that has enabled our users to have an experience where they can have music, YouTube music, and premium. We just announced the 50 million subscribers that we were really excited about. But we also see other ways that our creators generate revenue. So our creators, for example, generate revenue with channel subscriptions. They may sell merchandise. We also have things like digital goods, so like, super chat, super thanks. And so, we've basically diversified the number of ways that our ecosystem is generating revenue. The original tagline for YouTube was broadcast yourself, and that concept has exploded. You have ordinary people in the spotlight. When they grow up, they want to be an influencer. They want to be a YouTube star or a YouTube creator. What do you see as the future of the creator economy? I see a lot of possibility with the creator economy, and because I see that many people have a lot of interest and they have a lot to offer. And beforehand, they went up and able to have shared that with the world. And so there are so many people depending upon what their talent or their interest is, whether it's a sport or cooking or gaming or hairstyles that people have come out and really been able to share that and create a lot of jobs. So we actually see, like, our, we actually saw a 35% increase in the number of creators that are generating six-figure income out of YouTube. And in the last year, and so that's just an example of how the creator economy is continuing to grow. For years, YouTube was the only company that actually paid creators, but now a lot of companies are paying creators. Facebook, Instagram, Snap, TikTok. How do you see that competition playing out? Who wins? Well, it is a competitive landscape. In general, competition is good. It makes everyone work harder and that's good. When we look at creators and we say, they're going to come to us if we do the best job. And creators come to us looking basically for fame and fortune. Like, how can I, I have a skill or I have a talent, something I want to share with the world. And YouTube can help that be known, can help them provide that fame, but also we can generate that fame and more so to them in their care.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2349,2022-10-13 03:36:49
14124," of like how can I have a skill or I have a talent, something I want to share with the world, and YouTube can help that be known, can help them provide that fame, but also we can generate revenue for them. And so as long as we're doing a good job of that, creators are gonna come to us if we start to fail, then they're gonna leave us and they're gonna go to another platform. And so we just need to work really hard to make sure that we deliver that for our creators. A year ago during the Black Lives Matter protest, YouTube made big commitments to Black creators, in particular. What's been the progress there? And how do you see YouTube, the potential for YouTube to be used as a tool for social justice? Well, so we've made an announcement that we were gonna do a $100 million Black Voices Fund. And so we're continuing to develop content there. But one of the other thing, and I think there's been a lot of great content that's come out and we'll certainly see more. But because YouTube doesn't have any gatekeepers, like you can just post and become a creator, we have seen a lot of people of different backgrounds and underrepresented backgrounds become creators and have audiences. We never really measured it beforehand because we didn't have a way. And so one of the things that we've done is with enabled creators to now tell us what backgrounds they affiliate with so we can have a better understanding of how they're doing on our platform. Let's talk about YouTube shorts. It seems to be a top priority. We all know that TikTok is on the rise. Some important are YouTube shorts to the platform, to the company. So YouTube shorts, it's very important. We see that creators and users wanna watch all types of content, long form, short form. It turns out that the first video that was actually ever uploaded to YouTube, me and the zoo was an 18 second video. So it was a short form video. And we have lots of short form videos and we've had it way before TikTok did. But what we have really been leaning into more is just enabling those to be found. And then a lot of the creation tools. And so bringing a lot more mobile creation is really important for us going forward. Did you notice that viewing time was being lost to TikTok? Did you see that trend? And do you see TikTok as a sort of existential threat? I mean, we definitely see many competitors in this space. What we're just focused on are our own metrics. Like do we see our users engaging? Where's our opportunity? We're always looking around and seeing what our competitors are doing. And if they're doing something that we think would be good for our users and our creators, we're also gonna look at how we can improve our own economy, creator economy, and what's good for our users. I think a lot of people, we talk about vaccine hesitancy and they blame social media. They say YouTube's not doing enough. One of the big things for us is to continue to work with public health experts to get their messages across. Today's your big day, are you excited? Mama is tired. They speed up work. You have to feed your kids.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2350,2022-10-13 03:42:14
14125," Today's your big day. Are you excited? Mama is tired. They speed up hard. You have to feed your creativity. So this tree house, you guys ready for the movie? See what we can do. Hey, I'm going to show you. At this point, YouTube has become a hub for discovery, for information, for, you know, it satisfies our curiosity, right? That comes with a lot of inspiration, but also with misinformation. When it comes to vaccines, vaccine hesitancy, videos that cause a public health risk, where do you want to see YouTube do better? We've taken responsibility very seriously. It's been one of my top priorities. So first of all, we want to make sure that if there's information that violates our policies, we came up with 10 different policies around COVID. Then if that's a violation of policies, then that's something that will remove. We removed over a million videos associated with COVID, but we also want to make sure that we're raising up information that we think would be, that come from trusted and authoritative sources. And we've really been able to do that. I think a lot of people, you know, we talk about vaccine hesitancy and they blame social media. They say YouTube's not doing enough, you know, how do you respond to that? Yeah, I mean, I think, first of all, we're always learning. I just, just to be fair, like, we're always thinking about how can we do better? We're looking at the feedback and working with public health experts across the board. And, you know, I think one of the big things for us is to continue to work with public health experts to understand, you know, what are the ways that we can partner with them to get their messages across. And I really believe that that is something that's really changed is the evolution of bringing creators, musicians, experts talking about public health. We never would have seen that before in the pandemic. How much do you internalize the criticism of YouTube's content? Do you take it personally? And how does that influence the decisions that you make as CEO? I want to be doing the right thing. And I care about that. I care about the legacy that we leave. I care about the world that we leave to our children. I care about how media is consumed by the next generation and by everyone today. And so I really have put a lot of time and effort to make sure that we are acting responsibly. And there's always a balance between the free speech and the right, but being responsible and taking down content that we think could lead to some kind of real-world harm. And so, I mean, sure, I think whenever you're in a position like that, there's going to be a lot of criticism. But our goal is just to continue to talk to experts and evolve. And how do you make decisions in those tough moments where it's a tough call? Like, how much of it is making a decision or leading by consensus and how much does it come down to you? The goal is that when we have tough decisions, they're not, we're not, they are like improvising in some way. Like, we've made a concrete set of decisions beforehand and then we're looking and saying, is this something that meets our standards? Is it a violation or not a violation? And if it seems like there's some set of issues with the content that we have on the platform, we're going to go back to experts and then reevaluate is it should we be making changes to our policies? YouTube helped keep a generation of children connected, educated, entertained, distracted, through the pandemic. What have you learned from that experience and what do you see as the potential future of YouTube as a tool for learning, as a tool in schools? When I meet people and they find out I'm the CEO of YouTube, almost always, they tell me about something they learned on YouTube or someone that there's something they're family member learned. So I see that as being a very significant part of YouTube. And during the pandemic, we certainly saw that a lot more education went online and we had all the homeschooling, we had people who had to also just learn a lot of skills that they hadn't learned beforehand. But probably the biggest thing that we also learned was just, and that I really saw was the need for us to continue to work with educational institutions and the need for us to be able to integrate with some of the learning tools that the kids are all using because they are using YouTube. And there's a lot more that we can do to really help educators have you to be a key part of the curriculum. My kids are on YouTube a lot and sometimes more than I want them to be and sometimes it's super productive and they're learning something cool and sometimes",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2351,2022-10-13 03:45:29
14126," Have you to be a key part of the curriculum? My kids are on YouTube a lot and sometimes more than I want them to be and sometimes it's super productive and they're learning something cool and sometimes it's not productive at all. How are you innovating to make the time kids spend on YouTube more valuable and of course safe? It's very important to me as a parent to make sure that we're giving parents options about how what they want their kids to see and that's one of the reasons that pretty much as soon as I got to YouTube we started working on YouTube kids which is a separate app which is important for kids in terms of how we can control the quality and we can give parents a lot more control about what kind of content is appropriate for them and their family and you know there are many other things like we actually just came out with a supervised experience for tweens because tweens was one of the age groups that was actually hardest they usually don't want to be on the kids app but they're not 13 to be on the on the main app and so the supervised experience is something that we recently came out with. The Wall Street Journal has been doing some in-depth reporting on Facebook. The report is that Facebook knew that Instagram was toxic for teen girls and didn't do anything about it. Does YouTube look at the impact it has on teen users? The influence it might have on on someone's body image or self-esteem? First of all I think it's a very important topic and we do have a panel of experts that we work with to be able to help us understand what are the different ways that our product could be used or what are how do we face some of these challenging issues to make sure that we're getting the best advice. And we certainly do see for a lot of really tough issues that YouTube can be a really valuable resource. So body positivity, mental health, we see a lot of creators actually talk about mental health and that for a lot of kids it's really like destigmatizes and enables people to talk about what's happening and what's going on with them. The potential long-term impacts of YouTube on teens and on children whether it is toxic or whether it's addictive. Is that something that you wonder about? Is that something that you struggle with not just as a CEO but as a mom? We certainly want to make sure that we are doing what we can to be responsible with kids and in every way possible. And that's one of the reasons that we actually have worked hard to give parents as many options as possible for them to decide what is important for them and their family. Whether that's like limiting screen time, like limiting what is the content they actually have access to. I mean even letting parents just say these are like the 10 videos. My kid can only see these 10 videos. And so that is really important for us to give the tools back to parents for them to decide what is best for them and their family. Are you concerned about looming regulation? There may be regulation that is well intended but actually then has a really negative impact.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2352,2022-10-13 03:49:33
14127," I would like to begin by addressing the heinous attack on the United States Capitol. Like all Americans, I am outraged by the violence, lawlessness, and mayhem. How much did President Trump test YouTube and how much did it test you as a leader? Election integrity is something that we see incredibly, is incredibly important. I'm of leaned into in every way we possibly can. We treat all public figures and all public leaders the same as we treat any individual. And so meaning that everybody is held to the same standards. And so we definitely held President Trump as we would hold all other presidents and all other elected officials to the same standards that we hold our creators and anyone else on YouTube. But was that difficult for you as the CEO of the company? I mean, that's kind of, that's like a big responsibility. I mean, yeah, it is difficult, but it is very important and we also are global. So we're dealing with leaders from all over the world. And there were a number of leaders that are and there continue to be a number of leaders that post or that there's content that may be a violation of our policies. But we do hold a consistent standard across everything that we do. YouTube was the last platform to ban Trump and you have said his channel will be reinstated when an elevated risk of violence has subsided. How and when specifically will you make that decision? Well, we'll make that decision based on a number of different factors, whether that is like events in the news, signals were seeing from the government. And we'll certainly continue to evaluate that based on a large number of signals that we see. And will he ultimately be reinstated? I mean, we've stated that we will reinstate him when we believe that there is no risk to public safety or no public danger. We'll just remove the voting app for the Russian opposition leader, Alexi Navalny. The Russian government seems to be stepping up requests to take down content. You've talked in the past about your family history, your grandparents living behind the iron curtain being concerned about censorship back then. And Russia is a huge YouTube audience. How concerned are you about Russian government overreach? One of the things that is important to us at YouTube is the fact that we do enable so many voices and that we do enable people to express themselves and really celebrate the freedom of speech. And we certainly, that's a core value of ours. And when we work with governments, there are many things that we have to take in consideration, like whether it's like local laws or what's happening on the ground. And so there's always going to be multiple considerations that we're going to have to take into consideration. Navalny said that YouTube deleted a video, one of his videos. Was that at the request of the Russian government? We certainly get requests from governments. And we look and consider why are we getting the request? What's actually happening on the ground? And based on a whole bunch of different factors, we make a decision. Because we don't always, those are not always requests that make sense for us to honor, but in certain cases, we will honor them in that country. The five administration seems to be targeting big tech. We've seen Mark Zuckerberg. We've seen Jack Dorsey now testify before Congress multiple times. And I've heard it said that YouTube is getting a pass. Do you think you should be up there testifying? Well, I think we do get a lot of scrutiny. I feel like there's a lot of scrutiny. And because YouTube is part of Google, Sundar has testified a number of different times and answered many different questions on YouTube. So I do believe there's a certain amount of scrutiny. And if I were ever asked to testify, it certainly would go and testify as well. You're one of the most senior women at Google. If not the most senior woman at Google, Google has faced a lot of scrutiny for how it treats women.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2353,2022-10-13 03:54:04
14128," I certainly would go and testify as well. You're one of the most senior women at Google. If not the most senior woman at Google, Google has faced a lot of scrutiny for how it treats women in recent years. How much progress do you think Google has made in hiring and promoting women across the company? And how much progress do you think still needs to be made? I see a really big effort across technology as a whole to be able to be more inclusive. And I think that is really positive. I've been a big supporter of it. It's the very beginning. And I mean, I think at Google there are many efforts and there's a lot of work that has been done. And I'm sure there's a lot more for us to continue to do. And if you just look at the stats, you can see they're not enough women. We need more women in technology. And I think we have made a lot of progress. But it's still hard. It's harder to be a woman in technology. It's harder to be a minority of any kind. And so I think there's still a lot of work for us to do. When we last spoke five years ago, I asked you about being a mom. You have five kids. And you said something that really stuck with me. You said being a mom makes me a better leader. I prioritize better. I see something growing fast. And I run towards that. If something's growing closely, I'm like, I don't have time for that. How has that management strategy played out for you? I think it's played out really well. Thank you, Sven. I mean, prioritization is everything when you look at it because we have a lot of opportunity. There's a lot of moving pieces, very dynamic environment. So if you can prioritize and say, these are the most important things to do, then you're going to get there faster. Lauren, started having a left. How long do you plan to keep running YouTube? How long do you plan to stay at Google? As long as I have a mission that I believe in, and things that I'm excited about getting done. So I have a lot of ways that I see that YouTube can continue to grow. I have a lot of products and ideas and things that aren't yet released and things that aren't yet doing. And I'm excited about getting those done. So I think if there comes a time where I no longer have a list of projects where I feel like I don't have that much more to add, then it'll probably be time to do something else. Would you throw your hat into the ring to be Alphabet's next CEO, or if the board asked you, would you step up and do that? Well, I think Sender's doing a great job. Very, very. Please, I think he's doing, I mean, it's a very challenging job. There's a lot of different constituents and a lot of product, a lot of different issues. And I mean, I'll just say I'll always do whatever would be wherever I could be most helpful to the company. Do you still talk much to Larry and Sergey? I do still see them socially, though, not workwise. Do you ever talk about work? I mean, sometimes we be casually, but our business is very complex right now. And there's a lot of things that are happening. And so it's hard for, I mean, people may have different opinions, but to really engage it's a long conversation. What do you want your legacy to be? I am proud of the way that we've been able to enable people to have a channel, to have an audience. Like, I just met with a number of three creators. And YouTube really was able to let them shine and create audiences in a business and employ people that otherwise never would have happened. And so that's certainly one continuing to grow that. I'd say second, it's been really important to me, too, to see a lot more women in technology. That has been just a personal goal of mine is to be a role model and try to support women. And I feel very fortunate to be have gotten to where I have. And I know it was due to like many different factors. And I want to support the next generation of women and see technology as like an open place where anyone can come and be successful. And then probably lastly continue to grow what we're doing with education. Susan, would you please do your YouTube? Thank you. Thank you so much for having me. McKeadow and Amy Lobster are our global towers of life, including resources from all of us. That's up to you, and I feel very grateful to you, and in the new world, we have shown what education is good for. We have seen big events, and it is like what they're supposed to be,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2354,2022-10-13 03:58:34

14130," This meeting show officials committed to restrictive policy, but several stressed the importance of calibrating hikes to mitigate risks. The BLE snaps up 4.6 billion pounds worth of guilt. After the 30-year yield saw above 5% quasi-quart tang, says it will be the central bank's responsibility if there's renewed volatility after the Bond buying program ends on Friday. Saudi Arabia rejects criticism of last week's Opic Plus decision to cut oil production quotas, saying the move was based solely on noble objectives to avoid market volatility. Meanwhile sources say some Biden administration officials are growing concern about the plan to cap the price of oil purchased from Russia made back far. We have the latest details, which has gone 8 a.m. across the Emirates or Mumbai bad. That's a relief. But I'll tell you what is also very much at the centre of global risk. It is the road to hell that is paved with good intentions. They guilt market, of course. This is how the Bank of England reacted yesterday. Snifled up every single bond that was offered and they took yields from 5% to 4.8%. This is a bank of England not just with intent, but with execution in terms of restraining volatility and restraining yield spikes. And of course, Sokgyn talked about a helter scouter of UK policy and sloppy comes from the Bank of England have done nothing to counter the unorthodox economics of this administration. But of course, quasi-quart tang on the way into the Bank of England, into the IMF. He threw the Bank of England under the bus because he basically said if there's more volatility in the guilt market next week is down to the Bank of England. Sometimes you have to look at yourself at Chancellor. Let's have a look at the oil market. 6% this week almost in terms of a drop does this vindicate the EOPEC plus move to reduce 2% of the world's production. Well, there are a number of forces at play here that, of course, the IMF are warning about more tumultic common, the global economy. Front spreads are tightening, by the way, we've gone in from two bucks to 160. And PIMCO warn that we are underestimating the hit from EU sanctions on Russia's supply. But with that in mind, the official politics lines are hard and heavy. US officials fear that the oil cap that they're putting on the table could fail after the OPEC plus cuts and Russia politically. It acted on noble objectives and rejects the US criticism of the cut. Now, those are your markets. Oil and the guilt markets drive the narrative in terms of global market sentiment and the Fed. Language has also given a little bit of help to this equity story. We're buying some by an 8% this morning. That's several talked about the calibration of rate hikes. Let's get back to Jill. She's in Singapore. Jill's good to see you from my old spot. Matt, I'm glad you're back. Look, we're not seeing the bounce here. We are down for a fifth session and a bit of caution ahead of, of course, the US CPI print and following that six session of losses on Wall Street. We're just getting some news here. I mean, we were speaking about a month ago about Singapore trying to lure export workers Hong Kong. It seems could be doing the same. We're hearing that John Lee's policy address could actually show some eyeing property tax cuts. Visa changes to lure talent and make it easier to hire export workers. So, as we start to see both these economies open up the lure for talent very much on. Let's have a look at what we're seeing in development stocks, though, in the Hong Kong and China session, because of again, this debt trouble, deepening after the CIFI bond default and what sort of policy support are we going to see at the party congress for this beleaguered property sector. Elsewhere, we're watching movement in the chips, too, particularly ahead of TSMC's earnings later today. Let's have a look at the yen as well. We have been on intervention watch again after we saw that fresh 24-year low yesterday. And Governor Corrota once again, really indicating that they are going to maintain their monetary easing to support the economy. So, the yen knocking on that door of the 147 level, we're very much watching to see whether or not there will be another intervention, but at the same time, the Bank of Japan continue to keep easing according to Governor Corrota, Manus. Yeah, well, we can see verbal intervention does not stop.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2356,2022-10-13 04:06:57
14131," but at the same time the Bank of Japan continue to keep easing according to Governor Corota, Manus. Yeah, well we can see verbal intervention does not stop the trajectory of the Yen. Thank you very much. Jealous we'll see you through the show, Jealous. Let's say in Singapore. So the minute are in of the Fed's last meeting and they show firm commitment to bringing down inflation even as the need to start calibrating the pace of rate height is on the table. I global economic, some policy editor, Kathleen Haley's joins us from Washington. Kathleen, good to see you. So what does this mean in terms of the November meeting? Calibration, recalibration. I love that word. Yes, doesn't it? It evokes all kinds of wonderful images and you kind of see these Federal Reserve officials having these tools, you know, like they're looking at a map as they navigated, giant ship or something. So they've got to they're going to start calibrating. Maybe we thought they already had, but it's a different calibration. Difficult, I should say, calibration. 300 basis points in rate height since March. Can't you expect that maybe it's going to have some impact? Now they started out. I mean, clearly one of the biggest theme here is we're firmly committed to bringing inflation down to 2%. But there are several participants. I think many is more, but several is very high that there's these global economic and financial uncertainties and maybe they've got to be calibrating the pace of further policy tightening. And then go where there's going to keep going so we can reduce the risk of some big bad effects on the economic outlook. Well, you'll be, we don't really know, obviously some noted, but not everybody. And they on the other hand, they said they're going to maintain their restrictive balance. Okay. A lot of people think that the bulk of this, this FOMC minutes, some 15 or 16 pages, says maybe even a 75 basis point hike in the in the coming meeting and then maybe maybe not quite so big afterwards. We don't know. Lil Brainer, of course, is the Fed Speaker who in the last or Fed should actually make a board complete title. She's the vice chair. She's the second most important person. Gave a speech about being a bit more cautious, looking at the data. Neil Cushgari, though, put a very different spin on it when he said, not ready to pivot. Let's listen. He's the president of the Minneapolis Fed, by the way. For me, the bar for such a change is very high because we have not yet seen much evidence that the underlying inflation, the services inflation, the wage inflation, the labor market, that that is yet softening. And so I think we're quite a ways away from anything like that. And might I add, that's exactly what Liberty Master pretty much told us in terms of the message just 24 hours ago, right here on Bloomberg television. She's president of Cleveland Fed. There's more room to go even to get to restrictive and to the extent that is the prevailing view, they are going to do more, but you'll be interesting to see. You know, excuse me, Mani, just how much we start getting a little more of a nuance here at the more these rate hikes pile up. Kathleen, it comes down to you. If you're just a desperate dove like I am and you're watching your entire equity life, washed down a gutter, then you latch on to calibrate. They need to calibrate anything. Now, let's talk about a hot, a hot frisky print from the CPI, just how much of a hot CPI print is already priced into the market. What do you reckon? I think it's sort of like if you are trying to lose weight, man, it's what you don't have to do. And you get on the scale and maybe you lose a couple of pounds, right? And it's still on the diet, but you don't kind of see the weight coming off. For it's coming off so slowly, you're getting very discouraged. Maybe you have to change the diet, right? I love that. I just thought of that metaphor. But year over year, here's the problem. 8.3 down to 8.1. A little bit of progress, but they want to get to 2 percent and they're far from that. The core, I think this is actually the bigger problem because it has risen a bit. That's the number that takes out food and energy, so it shows the broader price pressures, that kind of thing, maybe getting entrenched. The monthly numbers, about the same for the headline number, but the core is getting a little bit smaller on the month, but still much higher than it used to be. And one more point I will make, you have to get many lower monthly numbers to bring the year over year numbers down. So there's a ways to go, maybe we'll get some pleasant surprises, maybe we'll get some unpleasant surprises, but none of that is likely to change the feds trajectory just yet. And here's the big, big picture from the little bit terminal. The big numbers, the CPI, that's the big one.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2357,2022-10-13 04:11:31
14132," plus surprises, but none of that is likely to change the feds trajectory just yet. And here's the big, big picture from the little bit terminal. The big numbers, the CPI, that's the big one. And maybe the bigger one is the feds gauge, the PCE to flater. And then you got producer prices. Look, they've come down a bit, but they're not coming down much more and they're not coming down fast enough. And that's again the message. And that's why the message from the FMC minutes is still more hikes to come. Yes, there's some discussion there about looking at the impact, not only in the US, but around the world. But this is the bottom line. Kathleen, we could wax lyrical on the diets. Four weeks on the road, a lot of croissants, a lot of honey, a lot of a clava. I can tell you, I can tell you we're going to pay for it. But of course, that's a bit like inflation, expansion, contraction. Capping, as always, great to have you. Thanks for staying with us in Washington. She's on tour as well. Kathleen Hayes in Washington are economics correspondent. We'll also say that some of the Biden administration officials are growing a little bit more concerned about the plan that's in place for them in terms of the price cap, which is to be set by the allies versus the OPEC plus cuts that have come into force. Let's discuss that with our reporter, Steven Sotinsky. He joins me, nice to Steven. This is just the latest political pushback from the US side. They're concerned that the two issues are battling against one another, the price cap that they're about to affect versus the cup that has come into effect by OPEC plus. Is that justified? You know, man, I think when you look at how to control the oil market, it's a lot like losing weight. And you have to remember that if the diet doesn't work, as said previously, you have to change your strategy. So that's what the Biden administration folks inside of the administration are worried about because on the one side, they do want to have the cap. They want to have oil flowing from Russia and they don't want a lot of money flowing to Moscow. But at the same time, they don't want to add more volatility into the market with the OPEC plus surprise decision to cut last week. There are now fears that their original plan of setting that cap could add more volatility into the market or even worse, if they set a cap, Russia will just cut exports altogether to all those countries, which takes more supply off the table, which creates a worse deficit, which increases oil prices and increases gasoline prices. And that's bad for the Biden administration, especially right before a very key midterm election. Yeah, I mean, this is where the politics come, you know, the foreign minister on CNN yesterday, even anistatement from the foreign ministry last night talking about the honorable intentions from the society side in regards to rising the market. And of course, it was noble objectives and a total rejection of these statements that are not based on fact, you know, we're in a new war of words between the two sides. Stephen, thank you very much. Stephen Stochinsky, setting the scene there from Singapore in the oil markets with down 86% in four trading sessions. Volatility is abundant in the UK at bond market. And it was on full display. Yes, I showed you 30 paper. Soaring above 5% traders sold holdings after the Bank of England confirmed it won't extend the deadline for its bond buying program past the end of this week. Then the Bank of England snapped up more than 4.5 billion points worth of giltsets get to Paul Dobson in Singapore. I mean, this is where we're in a vortex, Paul, isn't it? You've got the pension funds flogging everything under the sun to meet their margin calls. And yet we see the Bank of England stepping in and backstopping. They bought everything. I mean, that worries me more. Well, I don't know if you need to worry, though, Manus. You know, the Bank of England is kind of holding the door open at the moment, right? For the pension funds to get through the door before, you know, it needs to slam it and contain whatever, nothing is behind there. So it's giving them that exit strategy, that opportunity to manage their exposure and to come up with the cash that they need to meet these margin calls and to write the steady the ship for a longer term process as well. You know, I think the babies come under a lot of criticism for saying, you know, we're only going to keep the program going for another couple of days to get on with it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2358,2022-10-13 04:15:48
14133," for a longer term process as well. You know, I think the babies come under a lot of criticism for saying, you know, we're only going to keep the program going for another couple of days to get on with it, but, you know, why not? I mean, give them an ultimatum and be firm. I mean, these guys should have been running their books better. They should have seen this coming. They should have been, you know, on the lookout for it as well. You know, nobody is criticizing the pension funds for the way they've been run yet, but I think that that is going to come down the line. And the regulator for that matter, you know, they kind of a bit asleep at the wheel as well, right? Listen, I'm not here to arbitrate who's asleep at the wheel or who's doing the right or the wrong thing. All I will say to you, which is factual, which is you throw dine a gauntlet to an FX market, a bond market or an equity market like that, Paul, and you know this, and they will have you, and they'll have you in size, which is what they did yesterday. No, I want to get to the nuances of what Cosy Quattang said. He was door stepped on the way into the IMF, and he just threw the bank of England out of the bus. He said, if there's any more bond vol next week, it's dine to the bank of England. I mean, what do you make of Cosy Quattang's statement? Never mind mine. Well, and again, you know, kind of, this comes down to poor old, poor old Bailey. Suddenly under a lot of pressure and a malignor, and perhaps unfairly so. I mean, yes, it is the Bank of England's responsibility to ensure that the market's operates smoothly. It's the government's responsibility to come up with sensible funding plans that they can show, you know, kind of work. They can do the maths and work out how the budget balances and stuff like that. And that's the piece of information. The market is really missing here, you know, kind of, and which would give that confidence back into those holders of guilt and perhaps reduce volatility, maybe bring down the yields over the longer term as well. So, you know, kind of, there's a lot of, a lot of, you know, kind of mud-froying, as you will. Some naïve, of course. Some of the new UK administration about the force that the bond market can throw at you, you know, and we're seeing, like, it's very bad timing to be doing it. When we've already seen 20% losses across fixed income this year already. Absolutely. And I leave you with this thought, poor, from Namorat, not from me, which is nobody in the world needed the OBE or numbers to make a decision about how to invest in UK assets. Just a thought from Namorat, not from me. Paul, thank you very much. Paul Dobson there in Singapore. That's Jordan Rochester. Great interview with Tom the other day. Oh, my God, great. Let's get to the first word headlines from around the world. Smollens with me in Doha, Simone. Good morning, Mattis. The USA Governor, Harukika Corota, has pledged to maintain monetary easing. He spoke at the annual meeting of the Institute of International Finance in Washington, where he defended V.O.J. policy saying Japan's inflation is different from the US and Europe. We continue our monetary easing in order to achieve the 2% inflation target or price-reservate target in a stable and sustainable moment. The economy is still recovering from the pandemic, so we have to continue to support the economy to recover. A Connecticut jury has ordered Info Wars founder Alex Jones to pay nearly a billion dollars in damages over his repeated lies that the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre was a hoax. He's been ordered to pay families and an FBI agent who were affected by his claims about the 2012 shooting, which killed two dozen young children and teachers. The trial was the second to hold Jones financially accountable for his lies about the massacre. Bloomberg has learned that American suppliers are starting to pull back staff from top Chinese chipmaker Yangtzee Memory. Sources say firms including applied materials, KLA and LAM research are doing so in the wake of new US regulations. The suppliers often send workers to help with manufacturing. Yangtzee Memory has also been placed on a US unverified list, restricting its ability to buy American technology.

But up next, investors, laser-focused on the upcoming inflation print out of the US will have more on the potential outcomes with Northern Trust, I just talking about next on Bloomberg. I'm going to have to go back to the next one. Recently, cryptocurrencies have been very popular. If a client came to you and said, look, I'd like some cryptocurrencies in my portfolio, what would you say? We've actually been really deep into crypto, deep into learning about blockchain and all of the new businesses. I would characterize this as crypto learners. We have made a series of toe-hold investments on behalf of our clients, both in some of the currency baskets as well as with some venture firms that are investing primarily in the crypto area. I think it has the potential to be completely game-changing. But it is still such the wild west. And so it's so uncertain. But it has the potential to completely upend everything. So really a reminder, isn't it, just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see some pressure on the U.N. and we did see some pressure on the futures. With Guy Johnson and London and Alex Steele in New York, real-time numbers, real-time analysis, weekdays. We've never seen this kind of volatility up and down. All of us here be in and be ups and downs, interday, and something that just never, ever experienced. But I think volatility should be your friend. It should key right opportunities where stocks are being misprice. Research isn't being done well. We're pitching ourselves a little bit that, you know, we're yielding our today globally.

14135," A packet of Northern trust. Vita, good day to you, sir. So they're pinching themselves globally at Apollo. It's one of the best times to invest in credit in two decades. That's a big statement. I know that you have a bias to credit. Are you pinching yourself? And if so, where are you pinching yourself? Because I'm showing the credit spreads on US, high yield, and IG. There are nowhere near where they were in the Lehman crisis or in the COVID crisis. Do you pinch yourself here and buy? Well, we are buyers of credit at this point, but it's a different structure, I think, from the argument that Apollo is making. So their argument is as a credit investor that the environment broke from a base level as well as a spread level is relatively attractive to what they've seen over the last 20 years. For us, in a multi-asset framework, the situation is a little bit different. So we're buying credit because we don't want to get back into equity yet. So we're buying it as a low risk, risk asset. And that's been working well for us. And we do think there is value. We do think that what's priced in terms of the future default rate is relatively high. But for us, that drop against the equity market is really important as well. Okay, so it's interesting. You're buying credit because you just not tempted in by equities. And to that extent, Bank of America, Brian Moynihan, talking about a shallow recession. It was quite a glib comment at the end. It just sort of tailed off at the end of a conversation on Bloomberg. He's talking about a shallow recession. Jamie Dimons talking about recession in the next six to nine months. Is it 22% drop in S&P 500 already pricing a shallow recession? Or is the risk of a much bigger and extended drop? Well, what I would say is that I think that 20, 22% drop does indeed price in probably a shallow recession and, of course, a much higher yield environment. And that does mean that from here, knowing what's happening to global growth, risks from a growth perspective are clearly to the downside. So this is not yet an environment where the equity market is pricing in the global recession that we might be heading to if central banks keep tightening the way they have been tightening. So I would say that the current environment roughly prices in what has happened in markets and how much growth has already slowed down. But probably it doesn't price in some of the downside risks to growth that are still out there. Well, let's just deal with that then. Tens trade at 3.92% in treasuries. Carada in the past couple of hours talks about rates at four and a half to five percent. But the fed, the bar for the Fed to pivot is very, very high. And double varying is very high according to Neil Cushkari. So therefore, the natural corollary to that. The bar is high to pivot. High high do they take it? Is it four and a half, five percent in your view? Let's just set that rates table and then continue. Yeah, that's a good place to start. So we are indeed thinking that the Fed will take it up to roughly four and a half percent. We don't think they'll go all the way to five. And that's because the feedback loops are starting to become more visible. And they're starting to talk about those feedback loops through the emerging market channel, through the storm dollar environment, of course, through global growth as well. However, as you can also tell, and as Neil Cushkari highlighted, they're very backward looking, very very focused on lagging indicators on inflation in terms of what they want to see turn around. So they're looking at housing, they're looking at labor markets, they're looking at inflation itself, all three of which will take time to turn around. And if they're going to be focused on that party equation as opposed to the war forward looking part, such as PMI's credit growth and such, then of course, we have to assume that the Fed is going to stay relatively hawkish for the time being that pivot is coming, but it's probably coming after the next two meetings and not before. Yeah, I think it's probably just more desperate doves really that are seeking the pivot. Look, the guilt market, actually, I'm just going to give the team the chant number for this, which is 3 0 2 6. So let me do that, they will get the broken and emotional guilt market and it is broken, isn't it? I mean, to go from 5% to 4.8% in the space of one trading session shows not just the intent, but arrival from the Bank of England. What are people saying to you when you speak to them at home in London and beyond?

14136," the Bank of England. What are people saying to you when you speak to them at home in London and beyond? This is the explosion in rates because of the chaos in the 30-year government bond market in the UK. The Bank of England bought everything yesterday. Do you think the market will push them again? Yes, I think so. This is clearly not over. The volatility in the UK market is breathtaking. The UK government, if anything, is not fraternizing and is making things worse by passing the buck to the Bank of England and then the Bank of England and its communication strategy is anything but clear in terms of how far they want to take this intervention and how long they want to keep it up. That combination looks very toxic to me and that means that volatility is likely to stay elevated until we get a much firmer commitment from both the UK government in terms of its fiscal outlook and from the Bank of England in terms of the length and the size of its intervention before this market comes down. This is not over after Friday. This is still very much a real issue and we just have to be very cognizant of the fact that there's a left-tail risk here on financial stability that supersedes to UK alone. It's really a European, if not a global problem. Indeed, and that's what I was hearing in Turkey at the capital markets form. It's not a systemic risk from the UK. It's a multitude, a battleground of risks and that is where systemic risk builds. Great as always to have you with us about just a month, two investment strategists for EMIA and APAC at Northern Trust asset management. Quick snapshot of US equity futures were up in 8th of 1% are you clutching at straws that might be a pivot?

It's a normal ideas. Street prepares for the latest read on inflation. Pick fat, pick all fish nurse. We're getting carried away. The market's been right. Our rate hike starting to pay off. How long is it going to take to sue progress on inflation? Fed just has a long way to go. Instant reaction on Bloomberg surveillance. Inflation is still stick to US economy. It's still on track. And what it means for the Fed? The data will tell us. I think we're quite always away from the poll. This is a Fed that will play the prudent thing to do is to ease off a little bit and just have a look around. Inflation, in focus. Tomorrow on Bloomberg. This is Bloomberg Daybreak Middle East.

14137," Last week's OPAC Plus decision to cut oil production quotas, saying the move was based solely on noble objectives to avoid market vol. Meanwhile sources say some of the Biden administration officials are growing concern that their plan to cap the price of oil purchased from Russia may backfire. We have the details. Let's get back to Marcus, Judith Sally Stanley, by Jules, we're going to get TSMC in a little while so the chips are going to be in hot focus. How's your board split? My board is still in the red matters and I think that has got a lot of to do with ahead of the US CBR report as well. So a bit of caution, but yeah, let's get to the TSMC story because you did have Taiwan urging calm here saying that the impact of the Biden chip rules really trying to downplay it and of course we'll be waiting to see TSMC's results after it fell the most on record earlier in the week and certainly still seeing the tie-ax off by about one and a half percent. More broadly, we've got Asian stocks down for a fifth day after a sixth session of losses on Wall Street. But still at these April 2020 lows and a lot of weakness coming through in the developer stocks in Hong Kong and China too and we'll be waiting to see whether or not there's going to be more policy support for the property sector at the party congress. But we did have Siffy defaulting on one of its bonds so that has certainly seen a lot of weakness flow through into that space manners. And look, we're ever vigilant on YAN. Lots of notes in my inbox going, you know, verbal intervention has not stymied the trajectory of the YAN. So where are we on intervention watch? What city saying to you? Well, city were speaking to Heidi and Sherry earlier at an event in Sydney and like quite a bit call coming through from a Humbertapa beer. We of course, we know very well on Bloomberg television saying that you could actually see 160 to the dollar tested here. We know we are very much watching the intervention level where we saw it last since September 22 at that fresh 24 year low already as we near towards 147 to the dollar. But Muhammad Bup ever be saying look essentially unless the Fed doesn't pivot on interest rates or quantitative tightening, then you could see the YAN had a lot lower against the dollar. Let's have a look at some of the other calls as well. They're looking at the potential of the euro to move around 90 cents on the dollar and even reach potential record lows if the Fed reduces its balance sheet results in the US currency which could appreciate by about 3%. And when it comes to the S&P 500 which I just mentioned is lower for a sixth session, of course, a lot of calls now as to where it goes there. They see an 80 to 90% probability that the S&P 500 index goes below 3200 by the year. And 40 to 50% chance though, Matt has below 3,000 at 2,900. I'm going back and holidays, Jule. I can't deal with any more bad news in terms of how long I'm going to have to work for. Jules, thank you very much. We'll see you in daybreak here. Yeah, exactly. Daybreak Europe. Juley and Sully alongside me in Singapore. Well, COP27 in the Egyptian city of Sham al-Shaykh is a little more than three weeks away. And we're seeing companies, officials and investors start to set the expectations for the significance of this year's COP. Smoke folksman is with me from Doha, Simone. Look, what is the sense of how big this COP will be and what we might get? I think there are two things here, Manus. First off, we expect much less fanfare than we saw around COP26 in Glasgow. Secondly, it's going to be a lot harder for delegations there to really make true progress on some of these initiatives because they're turning from promises to implementation. In fact, Bloomberg, a new energy finance, gives the likelihood of success. What they call success, just 43%. They evaluated nine different objectives that delegations will have as they go into this meeting and gave them ratings of one out of ten or one to ten. The highest rating we really saw, probability wise, was six out of ten and the goal is around 20-30 emissions likely to be very challenging.

14138," around 2030 emissions likely to be very challenging. We're also going to see a lot less in the way of global executives, particularly from the finance community, going to the event. We understand that Blackwarks Larry Fink will not be in attendance, spoke to people for cities, CEO, as well as standard charters, both say they will not go either. So fewer global leaders, however, or fewer business leaders, perhaps, however, we will see US President Joe Biden going, so that could surely drive some headlines. Yeah, I mean, you know, the who's who, that's attending that, and then I think what's going to be much more interesting, Simone, who's who attending FII, anybody on the list, anybody not on the list from the Americans? What does it say? Presidents come and go, oil remains forever. Let's talk about the EU, the executive arm there, putting forward a new package of sanctions. Now, this is on Iran. So what is the significance of this? Because you and I have spent a lot of time talking about the JCPOA, the return to the JCPOA, the optimism of it, the JCPOA. Does this affect that trajectory? Well, certainly all of this is having an impact on the likelihood of JCPOA, and we've only gotten more cynical about this as we go on. These sanctions specifically seem to target, we understand, from diplomats, 15 Iranian people and entities that the EU considers associated with some of the crackdown on these protests, individual sanctions against people, come to be thought of as a bit more important at this point, just given the massive amounts of US sanctions in particular that are on the country, whereas individual sanctions restrict the movement and behavior of specific people. So those thought to have a little bit more of an effect. But foreign governments have really been struggling to figure out ways to try and support Iranian protesters at this point, because they don't necessarily want those protesters to be painted along with the objectives of their governments, the democratic objectives of their governments, but they do want to support them. And so that's why we've seen a lot of interest in supporting availability of internet, Wendy Sherman in the United States, the Deputy Secretary of State, going out and talking in a virtual conference yesterday with lots of tech companies. Generally, however, we're seeing the crackdown intensify reports of gunfire in several cities around the country, including Isfahan as human rights groups, warn that more and more people are being killed in the response to these protests. I just set the table for me. I've mentioned the pushback from Saudi Arabia in terms of the criticism of the, as Royal Highness wouldn't talk about politics with me in any depth in the interview. They wouldn't do it in the news conference either. But this is the beginning of the foreign ministry pushing back, not the oil ministry, interesting, interesting nuance. That is an interesting nuance, Manus. And certainly maybe that's a response to the very political response that we've seen from the likes of the United States, which is coming not just from President Biden, but also from Congress. And really, Saudi Arabia painting this as a noble objectives to try and stabilize the oil market despite the criticisms and the pushback that they've gotten from the US and other oil consumers. What's interesting to me as well is that they didn't necessarily paint this as a sort of economic priority for Saudi Arabia. Remember, oil break-events are at around $80 of barrel in terms of the fiscal policy. And there's really a desire to separate this from backing Russia versus stabilizing the oil market. I wonder if they'll maybe begin making that economic argument that we need oil at this sort of price level. And maybe it's a selfish reason, but it's one that certainly may be more understandable to people around the world. Yeah, but it's certainly not drawing the frackers back in any monster size. Is it in the United States of America? Simone, thank you very much. Simone, Foxman, the Qatar Financial Center in Doha. So let's extend that conversation on oil ed ballers with me, senior director, for market economics at Emirates, MBD. We'll start with oil. We'll start with the hallowed grind. And it's down 6% this week. The IMF are warning about major economic downturn. Back of America says it'll be a shallow recession. Talk me through.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2364,2022-10-13 04:41:45
14139," Grind, it's dying 6% this week. The IMF are warning about major economic dying turn. Back of America says it'll be a shallow recession. Talk me through why we've given back 6% this week so far. Let's start that. Yeah, I mean, the news flow has been pretty consistently negative since the start of the trading week. If you look at, we opened up on Monday with a pretty low-z report out from China on their services PMI. Still showing the impact of the COVID-0 policy. And then the kind of commentary that we're going to get out from China is that that is going to be sticking in place, basically in perpetuity. And then we've had the news out from the IMF. These very stark warnings about economic growth next year. None of which is great for oil demand growth going forward. So it does sort of balance off the supply constraints that were highlighted in the week prior with the 2 million barrel day cut pledged by OPEC+. When I look at the time spreads, we're going to put it in the GTV library, which is, you know, front month to six months. You know, a lot has been made of tightening up a little bit over the past couple of days. But if I look at the trajectory on the spreads, it's still an incredibly tight market. And this, in some ways, validates the US criticism, political criticism. You tightened, you know, you cut production or be it a paper cut into an incredibly tight market. You know, this is stoking oil prices. So is it all political from the Biden administration? Is it all that? No, I don't think so. I think once you look beyond spot oil price, as you say there, with the time spread, there are very wide back rotation. I mean, if we look even at the much near term spreads, we've had back rotation in the front month spreads of over a dollar at some points in the year, which is incredibly tight for this market. Also, physical market indicators are also put into a very tight oil market. So we have... Can I just qualify as well, Hannah, again, said to me last week, and in the press conference about broken markets. You know, broken markets, liquid markets. Do you concur with that? Are energy markets in the futures? Are they really broken? I don't know if there are any more broken than a lot of the other financial markets that we're looking at right now, but they're just enduring quite a lot of volatility. And I think there is a distinction between what we're seeing in the spot price and a lot of the other physical market indicators, which are all pointing to extremely tight oil market right now. And one that can get substantially tighter as we go into 2023. So in terms of production levels, but also importantly, in terms of inventories. And to remember, we have had this enormous drain in strategic reserves in the United States. And there was talked about doing more to offset the cuts that have been announced by OPEC Plus to release more of these stockpiles into the market. Hey, that's great if you want to deflate the oil price, but you have to have a confident plan that you can rebuild them. And we're not in any kind of comfort that those inventories can be really built at any time in 2023. You see, you spoke and there by the grace we delivered the SP or... Now, there's a number of threats that came out from Jake Sullivan's email on the night that we were in the press conference. One of them was additional SPR releases, but when you look at that chart, I mean, that draw-dine is pretty stupendous. They're using... The argument is this. I think Greg and I were talking about this this morning. Using the SPR for political, rather than real crisis moments, and that draw-dine in the SPR can't be weaponized materially further in size. Well, I don't know how much more they'd be confident to drain it down anymore. I mean, this is essentially your rainy day oil fund, basically, that you want to keep this when things get really hairy. If we had intense upside volatility in the oil market, which we've already seen this year, that oil prices could go back up, say above $120, $130 a barrel, is there that much juice left in the SPR? Not just in the United States, but elsewhere to be able to accommodate that. And it's really critical that this thing needs to be refilled. And if you don't have the confidence that your producers domestically in the United States are increasing investment fast enough to be able to refill those stockpiles, I think it's a very tricky policy to continue to drain it down. Well, it gets more expensive to refill it at a hundred bucks. Add, doesn't it, which is where a lot of people are saying we're going? Should we get a price of oil out of you before I talk about PMIs? Certainly, yeah, we do think the oil price is going higher. We expect a Q4 average in the Brent market at $100 a barrel. And then going into next year, we expect to see prices escalating over 2023. So starting relatively soft at that kind of $100 mark, and then getting up to sort of the 115 by the end of the year. So about 105 on average for 2023. Okay, those are the calls and that's on time.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2365,2022-10-13 04:46:14
14140," starting relatively soft at that kind of $100 mark and then getting up to sort of the one 15 by the end of the year. So about one oh five on average for 2023. Okay, those are the cause and that's on tightness rather than perhaps on the demand side. You are an economist by trade. So maybe we should maybe we should bring maybe we should judge the effect of that the director of market economics. So let's talk about the PMIs. I mean, I've been away for four weeks. It's as if this this city just got full in 24 hours of PMI 56.2. They all just nudged a little bit lower from where they were previously. How on fire is the economy here? How sustainable is it? Yeah, we are down very very slightly in the most of the GCC PMIs, but we're talking about three year high. So the context of the decline is relatively minimal. As you say that we are in a very strong position here. Growth is doing quite well. Really helping the the non-o sector performing very strongly both in the UAE nationally as the Dubai in particular and in Saudi as well. So all in all things look pretty good for 2022. Yes, there are these big headwinds of global growth expected to slow going into 2023 and for an economy that is very trade oriented, very open like the UAE, like Dubai, there could be some negative feedback as a result of that. That being said, we have you know projections for budget balances here in the region of sort of five to six percent of surpluses. Yes. So there's ample firepower for governments to step in and help to support the market or help to support the economy perhaps in a non direct manner but still to help sort of juice growth going into 2023. And of course, societies were prudent in terms of what they were doing with the excesses go rather than putting them out in fiscal spend straight away. And we could spend all morning talking about the rest of the markets but thank you very much for your calls. $100 oil in the near time up to $150. It is done in 2023. Ed Bell, senior director of market economics. That ember is MBS. My guest on the markets here on Daybreak Middle East.

14141, 2015 that this company had wanted to IPO since then and now that you know we've proven that there is appetite. This is when our sources are saying that they're going to take advantage of the moment hiring React Capital and him a capital for the IPO. Okay so they're ready to take the market on as it were. Any other updates on regional IPOs? I mean we've had three I think so far out of our perspective 10. Should I salivate for another IPO? I mean I'm waiting as much as you. You can call us and tell us the next one that's on the blog. We're very excited but I mean in Dubai we're still waiting. We did have Bridgiel and I would have you which sort and it's first day of trading. After scaling back the IPO and pricing at the lower end of the range you could tell that perhaps there was room for upside there you know they had scaled the back on many fronts but we also we have a man coming into the IPO game. We have a real estate investment fun listing an Arman and the country did say that they're trying to list 35 companies if I'm not mistaken. Again very much so like what we're seeing in the U.E. in Saudi Arabia as they try to deepen their capital markets and upgrade into an emerging market. And where are we on the earnings season because we're just about to go into that in Europe. We get the big banks towards the end of the week and we're going to have our own banks reporting season here very shortly but what's top of the agenda for you right now? Right so we were just talking about Arman even though Q&B did start off their earnings season for us earlier this week and Arman we had national bank of Arman and bank Nizwa. Both of them they reported profits climbing from a year ago. It's another sign that you know the resilience in the banks in the region is lasting again with our dollar peg with central banks having to follow the Fed or at least to some extent follow the Fed or reserve rate hikes. It's trickling through to the banks and also we had cut a fuel reporting while a rise in earnings and they cited that partly to cost savings so companies are managing through the headwinds. Farah thank you so much Farah Al-Barrahi there with very latest on the IPO slate and the earnings front for the Middle East. Part of what I love about business is you get to build things from nothing. I don't have any investors all this is all money in this is making this building. It's pretty much full service shadow banking with nobody in charge. We are spending almost a trillion pounds of public spending we were spending 700 billion back in 2010. What we will make sure is that over the medium term the debt is falling but we will do that not by cutting public spending but by making sure we spend public money well.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2367,2022-10-13 04:54:22
14142," The debt is falling, but we will do that not by cutting public spending, but by making sure we spend public money well. The UK Prime Minister Liz Truss reiterating the pledge not to cut public spending, and that's as pressure minds on her and her chance, her quasi-quarting, to explain how the government will pay for the massive package of tax cuts, Leon Garen's is in London HQ for us. So this is a big gamble because many are saying they're going to have to find 50, 60 billion points worth of cuts over the medium term. Leon, good morning. Good morning to you, Manitza. You're absolutely right. Remember, we got that economic forecast from the IFS, a very well-known think tanker. Very credible. And they said earlier this week that the government is going to have to find 60 million pounds to make up for the shortfall when it comes to these tax cuts. Now they said that that could include public spending, cutting. However, we've just seen there in that clip that the Prime Minister Liz Truss has completely denied this in Prime Minister's question, saying we're going to spend more wisely. However, we still know 100% sure what that exactly means, Manitza. And things are really heating up here as the Prime Minister yesterday in PMQ's was challenged by the Labour leader. And of course that's Sir Kea Starmer. And he told the comments, it was time for Liz Truss to stop ducking responsibility and to reverse Quarteng's kamikaze mini budget. And I must say one thing, the government's aim to grow and get prosperity into the UK is very, very credible. But we still don't know how that's going to happen. Look, aspiration and delivery are two very, very different things, aren't they? I mean, the markets simply don't believe this economic plan. They don't believe there's a credibility factor with either of these two people. And that's represented in the currency reaction and the bond market reaction. Now, when it comes to the bond market, they came in and monster sized yesterday, the Bank of England, of course. But Quarteng, as he walked into the IMF meetings, literally through Andrew Bailey under a bus, that's not what you call syncopated monetary and fiscal policy, is it? No, you're absolutely right. He did throw Andrew Bailey under the bus. But Manus, he's in such a difficult position. He's blocked in Quarteng at the moment, because obviously he heard from Liz Truss yesterday who said we don't want these tax cuts, you know, the cuts, sorry, on public spending. So where does Quarteng go? And when he was asked, you know, what happens at this further turmoil in the market once the B.O.E. ends its bond buying programme? Well, he said it's a problem for the governor of the Bank of England. So is this Quarteng using the B.O.E. as a scapegoat that Bloomberg's very own Philip Aldrich has suggested that this is exactly what's happening at the moment? And we've seen all this market turmoil, Manus, and the reality is it's because the mini budget was announced without any forecast. And we get this fiscal forecast and statement from Quarteng at the end of the month, which is still two weeks ago. And we've still got two weeks of possible market volatility. So now as Quarteng handing that over to the Bank of England and says future volatility in the next two weeks will be their responsibility not mine. Exactly, and I think that, you know, there's a pretty interesting piece on the Bloomberg, and this is what King Charles III had to say when he greeted Liz Truss, dear old dear. And I think that released it. Anyway, back again. It sums up the mood, doesn't it, Manus, in a lot of ways here when King Charles just muttered those words, didn't he? Even though Liz Truss is definitely standing firm and saying I'm going to stick to these tax cuts that I've outlined, the reality is many of her own party want her to roll back on them. OK, let's see. You know, the debate is going to be, can she hold the back benches behind her, Leanne? Thank you very much. We'll see Leanne go through the rest of the morning quick snapshot of this for you as Danny Berger settles in to London HQ. We'll take you through the rest of the markets.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2368,2022-10-13 04:58:56

We'll see Leon go through the rest of the morning quick snapshot of risk for you as Danny Bogas Sattles end to London HQ will take you through the rest of the markets. Equities are up is value investing dead. This is the question we need to put to our guests at 6 a.m. So as you look back on your career what would you say is the best investment advice you've ever received? Probably the best investment advice that I never received. But that I've lived my whole life around is like I do many times you know what makes a great investor. A great investment firm is comprised of people who are optimists and pessimists and realists. Because in the intersection of the debates that go across that wide range of personalities is where you find truth. It's part of the reason I'm so focused on freedom of expression. I see it my own four walls the robust and fulsome debates around how we commit our capital what defines a good idea what businesses to build or pursue. That's what drives the success at Citadel. And I've been very fortunate in life to have always had a group of friends who really push me who make me better. And here I get to work with three and a half thousand colleagues who in their ways make me better each and every day and collectively as a team we've had the opportunity to have an incredible impact on the financial landscape around the world. Everything you need to get set for the start of U.S. trading Bloomberg the open with Jonathan Terrell. Filling down in the numbers and preparing you as only Bloomberg can weekdays on Bloomberg. This is Bloomberg daybreak here up. I'm Danny Burger in London with Manus Cranny back in Dubai. And these are the stories that set your agenda. The first drone under a bus you can't answer quote unquote. Thanks says the B.O.E. will be to blame if markets tank after the bomb buying program ends. All eyes on the CPI Asian stocks and treasuries decline before today's critical U.S. inflation print fed minutes show the commitment to restrictive rate hikes. Plus as OPEC plus trims it's demand idelog U.S. officials fear the Russian oil price cap plan may fail. This as Vladimir Putin warns all global energy infrastructure is at risk. Danny one theme is for sure when you are looking at grace one and black swan event.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2369,2022-10-13 05:03:01
14144," The energy infrastructure is at risk. Danny, one theme is for sure, when you are looking at Grace Warn and Black Swan events, it's not gonna be like 2008, a one-off event. It's gonna be multiple attacks, and the guilt market is the personification of grind zero, of less left-tail risk and Grace Warn events rising. Exactly, the risk is spread throughout, perhaps an opaque financial system. Yes, guilt's exemplified, and man is on a day like today, where we look at fire sales coming from pensions, ahead of a CPI, why put risk on your book? I feel like we are seeing a little bit of that. Yes, stocks are down in Europe, let me show you it. We are seeing consolidation everywhere else, really safe for European equities and FTSE 100 futures as well. So those are down half a percent for Europe. FTSE 100, okay, this is underperforming, it rather is outperforming, but underperforms yesterday, what got hit? It was asset managers in the UK, again, these spheres of fire sales and property developers as well, with mortgage rates shooting ever higher, interesting to see that tension. So continues to decline, consolidation in S&P 500, as I say, ahead of those CPI's, man, as I know, I sent you this email just moments ago for the VIX curve looking really, really primed for volatility. It is a very steep backwardation, expectations for volatility today around that report, our rife, and we're looking at HS Tech. Jules is gonna talk to us about this in a little bit, so I won't go into too much detail, but again, chip stocks, those under pressure, man, as we get TSMC earnings later. Yeah, don't ever say, I don't ever read your emails. Just go and have a look at your print. You can see the little tick, you can see the little tick decided. I got the message, she chasin me this morning, I don't read enough of her emails, okay? You can call my email. I see you and raise you, I read the emails, I do. I read everybody's emails. Have a look at the oil market, because somebody needs to read the email from America and the one back from Saudi Arabia, we'll talk more about that later. We're done a third of 1% this morning, our 8th of 1% I should say on WTI. You have given back 96% this week. You've got OPEC trimming the oil demand. That in some ways, it's validates the Saudi OPEC plus cut, and then you have this salvo of rhetoric between the US, lambassing the cut in oil, what I could do to the price cap, and then you have the Saudis talking, responding to the US narrative, saying they acted in good faith. It was with noble objectives that they delivered the oil price cut. Dolly Yen, a flat at the moment, more intervention on the way, cable steady, I would say relative to Quartine throwing the Bank of England under the bus, who said financial policy or fiscal policy and monetary policy was in sync. Nobody, okay, let's talk guilt. Where do you want to start with this? Because for me, I think when the Bank of England comes in and snorkels up every single offer that was out there in the market, and they bought everything was that to deliver stability, or was that another sign of panic to come? Well, it's clear that pensions haven't taken the BoE up on their offer, but yesterday they swoop in and buy a record amount over $4 billion, but, man, I mean, this chart is crazy. Yesterday, we reached 5% on the 30-year yield again, only for it to fall after the BoE started to buy, but this is around trip, the panic is clearly still in this market. Look, it obviously is there are 20 babes on the back of the Bank of England's backstop says to you, perhaps liquidity is draining away. One thing I took away from the Turkey capital markets form, it's not one exogenous shock like Lehman, but it is a multiple of shocks that will deliver, perhaps the most brutal restraint of F-Conn. Let's get to the reporters around the world. They're standing by. How do we tackle the UK markets and politics? We've got both Lizzie Birdon on the political side, Garfield Reynolds, in response to the volatility in the guilt market. Jules brings us up to speed as average idiot, Sali, be respectful. She has the global chip story. She's always respectful, man. And we, of course, have Stephen Stupcinski, who's on hand with the latest on oil. But let's start with that UK story. Chancellor Quasicourteng says the Bank of England will be responsible if markets quake after its bond-bying program ends on Friday. Speaking on the sidelines of the IMF's annual meeting, Quarteng told Sky News that any turmoil after the bank withdrawal support is, quote, a matter for the governor. Well, let's bring in Bloomberg's Lizzie Birdon, because this is a matter for Lizzie as well. I mean, Lizzie, look, independence felt like it's been under threat. And it's been shift into a higher gear.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2370,2022-10-13 05:07:56
14145," Let's bring in Bloomberg's Lizzie burden, because this is a matter for Lizzie as well. I mean, Lizzie, look, independence felt like it's been under threat, and it's been shift into a higher gear with courtings shifting the blame to the BOE. What does this mean? With them both playing a game of chicken, it seems. Yeah, and the Prime Minister and the Bank of England Governor are under massive pressure to make big U-turns right now. So yesterday in Prime Minister's questions, Liz Truss, was saying that she's not going to make any spending cuts even though the Institute for Physical Studies says she needs to find £60 billion to balance the books to restore market credibility. So she looks like she's inevitably going to have to U-turn on her tax cuts. Meanwhile, Andrew Bailey looks like he's going to have to U-turn on all that tough talk, where he said that he's going to definitely end this emergency bond buying programme tomorrow, no matter what happens. Now, his argument is that, if he continues with the programme, he's going to have both his foot on the gas and the brake at exactly the same time. The Chief Economist Hugh Pillers said the BOE needs to focus on fighting inflation. But really, as you say, UK pension funds are dependent on this lifeline now and courtings adding to the pressure on the Bank of England to continue its support. So today investors are really going to be holding their breath to see who's going to blink first, the Bank of England or the government. OK, Lizzie, let's see how that battle goes. One thing is for sure, you're looking at the risks coming out with their view on what's going to happen in the property market next year. So that is what higher rates really means in reality for the UK economy. Lizzie, thank you very much. Lizzie, burden on the UK political debacle. So let's just say some of the Biden administration officials are growing concerned about their plan to cap the price of world, purchase from Russia, and that it may backfired. That's after the OPEC plus Alliance's surprise production cut last week. Let's get more with our energy reporter. It is Steven Sucinski. So Steven, here we are. The battle lines are drawn. The Saudis came out with their Nobel Intentions line, the Biden administration of basic amount and said, look, by your actions, you're wrecking the price cap. Where do we stand? The market's dying 6% this week. I mean, I think what we're looking at the market this week is something a little bit different. I think everyone's really focusing on this recession fear, the hawkish Fed and the chance that we'll have an increase of interest rates. And that puts the context of the OPEC plus cut in a different window, because when you look at it, OPEC plus and Saudi Arabia to their emission is saying that we're looking at the economic situation, we're looking at lower demand because of a possible recession. And that's why we're cutting back. The Biden administration says this is more politically driven. They're picking Russia over the United States. And last week, we did have that big jump in oil prices. Now we're kind of falling a little bit as folks focus on the recession fears. But this squabble between the US and Saudi Arabia is making some folks within the Biden administration worried. If they do put a price cap on Russian oil, they're worried that maybe Russia will retaliate and say, hey, we don't even want to export that oil. What does that US Saudi Arabia really should mean after that as well? There are a lot of different aspects to look at. But one thing to remember is that the US will go for it with the price cap. While there are those fears, they have confirmed that there is wide support within the Biden administration. Europe wants to do it too. Now we just have to hold on and see what happens to the market if there's going to be more volatility or more potential cuts to exports from Russia. Yeah, of course, the backdrop for the Biden administration is midterms as well, certainly complicating the picture. Stephen, thank you as always. Bloomberg's Energy Reporters, Stephen Stepchinsky. Let's get back to that chip story, because chip stocks in Asia remain under pressure ahead of TSMC reporting today. Let's get to Juliette Sally in Singapore. Jules, more red. More red indeed, Danny, just seeing the global ramification of this story too, you also had applied materials. Slash its fourth quarter guidance in a number of companies, including applied materials, boiling their workers. Excuse me, from those chip factories in Yangtze, in China, but very much weighing through into a negative, never negative session for these chip players.

14146," and for these chip players, the regional benchmark index down for a fifth day. We do have a bit of CPI caution to play into there too, but still these April 2020 lows. And of course, a lot of the impact coming through in the TAYACS and also the Hanksink Tech Index, which remains at its lowest level since inception. Let's look at the board and have a look at TSMC because we did actually have Taiwan's economic minister try to bring some calm here in a Bloomberg TV interview from Washington saying, look, investors are getting panicked and they don't really understand the very complicated Biden rules that are going to potentially be implemented here. And they should believe in TSMC's resilience, as you say, this company to report earnings in about 20 minutes and really watch the T-live blog for this for some more insight. But of course, we're still watching very much the impact of the dollar too. TSMC had a 31.8% exchange rate appreciated or 29.7. They had in their guidance, I should say. And instead, you've seen the dollar appreciate almost 32% against the Taiwan dollar. So that's going to play into their earnings, too, man, but still very bullish on their stock. 37 buyers, three holds zero sales when you look at the A&R function on the Bloomberg. Man, it's. That's what you call resilient A& or Jews. Thank you very much, Juliette Sully on Taiwan's semiconductor. We'll break those numbers when they come through across the tape in just under 20 minutes. So all eyes are back on the bond market again. You've got UK turmoil, reverberating throughout the markets on a global basis. The latest moves follow the bank of England, snapping up 4.6 billion points worth of guilt, yes, Sully. And that's after the 30-year-yield sword above 5%. Let's bring in our chief rates correspondent for Asia. It is Garfield Reynolds. So the bank of England acted. They restrained the break in the guilt market. What happens tomorrow when they close up shop on Thread Needle Street as buyers? Well, does the Burranger's D'Crossio Madison some of the answer to that? It was what level of turmoil we get might depend on what happens with both CPI itself and then the way the US Treasury's market reacts to CPI. What if anything we get out of the Fed with regards to that and how much that plays into increased or decreased Fed hawkishness? There is the possibility that we actually get a fairly quiet finish to the week in the guilt market if the US CPI can set the right sort of stage. After all, Bayley's comments on Wednesday, Tuesday, did seem to sit lead to a lot of selling overnight in the guilt market and the BOE came in and did a lot of buying and ultimately things settled down. So they've kind of perhaps got the market used to the idea that yes, they really will step away and so therefore if you've got any doubts about the ability to sell your guilt maybe now is the time to do it. The big concern after it finishes might well be in other markets here because... Garfield, I want to dive in because you mentioned CPI. What are we expecting from that report hours from now? Well, the expectation down year is that headline CPI will slow down to about 8.1%. But that core CPI is going to speed up and a lot of ways that latter number is going to be the real focus because whatever goes on with the headline even if it picks up unexpectedly if we get a core CPI that accelerates some people are forecasting would actually go to a new high so that would really you know, quash any hopes that the Fed is going to regards inflation as potentially peaking and that therefore it can look at some of those calibrations they were flagging and think that they could calibrate to a slightly less harsh and less hawkish pace of tightening. Okay, Garfield, thank you very much. It's our Chief Reitz correspondent for Asia Garfield Reynolds. Let's take a look at some of the key things we're going to be watching out for today. This afternoon as we've been saying it's that all important US inflation data as Garfield was saying we are expecting the pace of consumer price rises to slow to 8.1% in the year to September that's down from 8.3% and then at the same time it's also US.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2372,2022-10-13 05:16:14
14147," expecting the pace of consumer price rises to slow to 8.1% in the year two September. That's down from 8.3%. And then at the same time, it's also US weekly jobless claims. We'll look for whether there are any clues of some cracks in the labor market, Manus. Well, then in the afternoon, we've got the ECB's Yucca Nagel. And of course, that will be a confluence of data from the states and language from the ECB. But coming up on the show, we're going to discuss the US economic data with all the capital well. How to fix dimcom global portfolios at masrec capital. How hot is CPI print is he expecting? This is Bloomberg. China's military power has been growing at an incredible speed over the last 20 years. A strong country must have a strong military as only then can it guarantee the security of the nation. In terms of sphere of influence, we absolutely know that China wants to be dominant in Asia. So there is a target to get to that point, to be a military that is appear to the greatest militaries in the world by 2035. The competition for influence is a global one. And through a multi-decade trajectory fueled by planning, money, and pragmatism, China is building a military that allows it to shape the 21st century just as the US shaped the 20th. We've never seen this kind of volatility up and down. You know, all of us here, you know, the ups and downs in today is something that just never ever experienced. But I think you know, volatility should be your friend. It should key right opportunities where stocks are being this price. Research isn't being done well. A friend of volatility there, Ariel Managements Chairman and Co-CEO and CIO, John Rogers, Jr. Manus. Yeah, and he kept the dream of value investing alive. But let's shift to the bond markets. They are live. They're frisky. All of the cattle well as the head of fixed income and global portfolios at Mashrad Cabell. Hope you don't have any guilt on that portfolio book of yours. Obviously being the buy based investors. No direct UK bond exposure, no. Good. That's the health warning out of the way for your compliance will be happy. Won't be happy with me. Right. We've got explosive volatility with John Rogers. It's everywhere. It's pervasive. How are you reacting at the moment? What are you doing? Well, I don't think it's time to buy the dip. I know he's a famous value investor. But I think you need to see data troughing or bottoming first. You know, you need to see negative NFPs. You need to see PMI's below 50. You need to unemployment rising, not falling. The opposite's happening right now. So I don't think it's quite time to buy the by the ditches yet. Over. Could I could I say that as a general statement for this market that we're in that the threshold at which it becomes attractive to buy has been raised? Yeah, I mean, I think so because I mean, even take that calibration comment that came out last night that everyone's latching on to that the.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2373,2022-10-13 05:20:29
14148," Even take that calibration comment that came out last night that everyone's latching onto that the Fed made. I don't think that means that the Fed pivots anytime soon. And Power made a similar comment in summer saying that 75 basis points rate hikes are not the norm. But they sure have felt like the norm the last few months. So I just, you know, there's more weakness in the stock markets to come. I don't believe it goes down 40-50% like I think you were reporting earlier on in your show. But it certainly looks like it gets weaker from here. Well, it was Jamie Diamond who suggested that it might be another, another significant letter. Lower. It's interesting. Let's go back to that. Not me. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not going on the hook for that call. I don't make calls anymore. I just sit and get people like you to make calls. Cush Curry made it clear that the bar for the Fed to pivot was much higher. But he talked about the speed and velocity of rates. Oh, we did two, three or four percent in one shot. That would break the market. I mean, this market couldn't cope with anything like that. I don't even think this market could cope with anything bigger than 75 basis points. Could it? No, I don't, no. I think 1% it probably could for the US and Turkey. But we're not going to pick up a 1%. Yeah, because we're so, we're so used to these 75 basic point rate hikes now that I think 1%. You know, wouldn't they just take it in their show? Wouldn't, wouldn't we just think, you know, maybe the Fed are getting closer to the terminal rate quicker? You know, rather than it's having to like take the pain of 75, 50, 25, whatever it might be, just get to the end and let us get on with, with, with, with hopefully a better market. Danny, jump in. I like his swag. Yeah, Oliver. I like it too. So let me challenge it, Oliver, because that's what we're here to do. Okay. Can we not use the UK as an example to say there are these more opaque pockets of leverage that exist outside of the banking system. And the Fed might face the same problem where something breaks in the bond market runs away from it. Yeah, they might do, but I think that that point will come probably in December or the turn of the year. I think 75 basis points is a done deal from November and a similar size hike in December as well. But, but if you think back to these, these jumbo size rate hikes that we've all been talking about, there's a lag defect for them. So they started in spring, summer. They're probably going to hit home in a real economy in Q4. So I think hopefully the numbers that I said at the beginning of your show that were pretty strong. Hopefully they start falling off a cliff. I say hopefully because I'm a bond manager, not a stock investor. And then the first call was on stocks to be far, gone. But I kind of trash stocks a little bit. Or I said they're going to be weak. So I think that, yeah, I think that that come the end of the year that the data could be weak enough for the, for the Fed to pivot, which would be good for bonds and eventually good for stocks as well. So we're in the bond, I mean, in the bond market, you've got a hollow salivating at credit. Your job is to deliver a yield. They've delivered yield to maturity in a zero rate world for 20 years. Are you, to kind of phrase, salivating and credit? Or what part of the, what part of the yield market are you most active in at the moment in terms of a belief? Yeah. It's a similar theme that we talked about in previous shows. That's investment grade, really. And I know maybe I sound like a broken record. And investment grades actually hasn't worked out for investors here today. In fact, a lot of investment grade bonds have performed worse than high yield. But, you know, if you do, if you talked about the market breaking, when the market eventually breaks, the most over-leverage companies, the playbook is the over-ledged companies are the ones that, you know, get hurt the most. And those will be high yield. So we'd rather be in investment grade names than your high yield corporates right now. Minerid was talking about recently that some of the cracks in the credit market are apparent when you look at the lack of banks issuing leverage debt. Do you, does that screen crisis for this credit market? I think it, again, it would be a crisis for high yield because some of the investment grade issuers don't need to issue debt. And if I take this part of the world for sovereign bonds, they're flush with cash in this part of the world, cash, I'd be a dabby, et cetera. So they don't need to issue bonds, so they're okay. But if you're a corporate and you're rolling over debt, it's pretty difficult for you to do that now, because you're probably having to issue debt with double digits. So I think that could be challenging, yes. We're showing high yield and investment grade bonds, and we picked a couple of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2374,2022-10-13 05:25:26
14149," You have to do that now because you are probably having to issue double digits. So I think that could be challenging, yes. We are showing high yield and investment grade bonds and we have pipped a couple of peaks. One is Covid, I am going back retrospectively. So that is the first sort of retrospective, that is Covid. Then we go back to 2000, we go back to sort of, you know, the debt crisis of Europe explosive up to 2000 basis points over and you go back to Lehman. It is interesting, isn't it? I were just hovering around those Lehman moments, one line that I want your response on. So we are at around 533 for high yield and we are at 165 for IG. Are we anywhere close to a pivotal moment on liquidity, risk and var as we were in 2008? I think we are getting there, I don't think we will see quite the market calamity that we saw in 2008 because it has been quite an orderly drawdown as the year has progressed whereas I think something like Covid and even the GFC, even the market in the GFC I am old enough to remember, it was a week for pretty much the whole of our weight but then you remember too, it was a big, big sharp drawdown. You are still not mold. You don't look as old as that is for sure, man. But there was that sharp drawdown in September, October time when the whole Lehman brothers Fiasco happened. So I think it is more of a progressive drawdown to continue like further weakness rather than some stop market calamity. Oliver, we will leave it there. Yes, I do remember how liquidity goes like that, literally overnight from the entire equity market. That is when you deconstruct an equity book and a bond book. All right, thank you very much. Some good calls, Oliver Kettlewell put it in context, the markets, head of fixed income and global portfolios at Mashwreck, Camp Little Danny. All right, man, let us talk about what we have coming up later today. We are going to be hearing from some top policy makers, including IMF, managing director Cristolina Georgieva, world bank president, David Malpass and Irish finance minister Pascal Donohoe and European commissioner for the economy, Paulo Genteloni. Don't miss those. This is Bloomberg. How much I could push have you seen from the Qashira government in terms of green funding? I think we need more than just announcements. We need real money backing, very innovative startups and innovative companies in this space. What do you make of Qashira's new capitalism? I think he is framework is reflective of the challenges that Japan society is facing, namely that growth has been present, but growth has not been, of course, evenly distributed. Frankly speaking, it is hard to register the income if you do not have much income to begin with. If the government and private sector can work together and collaborate to drive more innovative growth startups, that can really drive the income growth that the Qashira government needs to redistribute. Welcome back, I'm Simone Foxman and Doha with your first word news. The head of the IMF, Cristalina George J.Va, says Ukraine will need at least $3 billion a month next year to finance its wartime economy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2375,2022-10-13 05:29:07
14150," The head of the IMF, Kristalina Georgieva, says Ukraine will need at least $3 billion a month next year to finance its wartime economy, which means allies will have to give more support. Russia's President Vladimir Putin says any energy infrastructure in the world is at risk after the explosions in the Nord Stream gas pipelines. Speaking at a Moscow energy forum, he blamed the damage on the U.S., Ukraine, and Poland, calling them beneficiaries of the blasts. The U.S. is considering a total ban on Russian aluminum in response to the military escalation in Ukraine. Bloomberg's learned that the Biden administration is weighing a number of options, including an outright ban on a large increase in tariffs, Russia's second only to China as a producer of aluminum. And this is Bloomberg. If a client came to you and said, look, I'd like some crypto currencies in my portfolio, what would you say? We've actually been really deep into crypto, deep into learning about blockchain, and all of the new businesses. I would characterize this as crypto learners. We have made a series of toe-hold investments on behalf of our clients, both in some of the currency baskets, as well as with some venture firms that are investing primarily in the crypto area. I think it has the potential to be completely game-changing, but it is still such the Wild West. And so it's so uncertain. But it has the potential to completely upend everything. This is Bloomberg Daybreak Europe. I'm Manus Crenie and Dubai with Danny Berger in London on the stories that set your agenda. Throne under a bus, UK Chancellor Kwaizikorteng says the bill we will be to blame if markets tank after its bond-fying program ends. All eyes on CPI, Asian stocks and treasuries decline before today's crucial US inflation print, Fed Minute Show commitment to reserve rate hikes. Plus, as OPEC trims, it's demand outlook, US officials fear their Russian oil price cap plan may fail. This, as Vladimir Putin warns, all global energy infrastructure is at risk. Manus, I do want to dive into these markets, but I hear we got a little bit of breaking news when it comes to TSMC. We have indeed, and of course, the entire global chip market has been battered and brews were more headwinds coming from the Biden administration. But third quarter net income from TSMC, 280.9 billion is the number for them. And that is actually a pretty significant beat. 264.66 is what we have expected on a net income basis, again, a very comfortably beating what they had. Of course, it's going to be interesting to see what they say about EUV in terms of the numbers there and the supply.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2376,2022-10-13 05:33:52
14151," the market. And that's what they're looking at what they had. Of course, it's going to be interesting to see what they say about EUV in terms of the numbers there. And the supply chain side, of course, there have been this urgency for calm in terms of the chip market. It's certainly been interesting to see what they've been looking at. But to your point, guys, really want to see some of these lines on supply chains, not seeing them yet will keep you up to date as they come in. In the meantime, we can come back to this. Shall I get to what these futures are doing? We are looking at some weakness when it comes to Europe. They are, thank you, that's very kind of good. But I think that's a good idea. There's those are one tenth of a percent. But why would you take risk right now? It's a CPI day. This market primed for volatility considering with the VIX curve. Very, very inverted. And finally, Hong Kong tech man is perhaps starting to gain a little bit here or at least reduce some of their losses. We're done more than 2 percent. And the numbers are pretty reasonable be. They'll play into sentiment as we go through into the European chip sector opening. Crossy assets, all is done 6 percent for the week. You've got a battle line drawn between the societies and the Americans in terms of the war of words over. We acted with noble intent from the societies versus the Biden administration. Ready yourself for more reaction. Or comes back, you can't even call it a coordinated intervention. As Quartan throws Bailey under the bus sterling, do you set yourself up for another attack in another debacle in UK assets? As the Bank of England in theory closes up shop on bomb buying tomorrow to save the guilt market and treasuries trade at 3.91 percent. The bar for a fed policy pivot is very high. Neil Cush Carrey's words. Danny. And as I don't remember the last time we've had a boring day about the U.K. story with the Chancellor Quartan saying that the B.O.E. will be responsible if markets quake after its bomb buying program ends tomorrow. Meanwhile, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said that the government may need to find 60 billion pounds to shore up confidence. Now over the week, economists and bankers have given their take on what is happening within the B.O.E. and what is next for this U.K. economy. We've announced that we will be out by the end of this week. You've got three days left now. You've got to get this done. The Bank of England can talk tough but fundamentally they're just going to have to extend this. They are trying to hold things together as best they can. The confusion I think comes between the financial side of the Bank of England and the monetary side of the Bank of England which are now trying to do different things. Monetary and fiscal policy being at crossroads with cross purposes with each other. That's a very dangerous cocktail for bomb markets. It's been trying to maintain the same price stability and at the same time address financial stability issues with this other instrument. This is not yet looking to me like a very steep and deep recession. I don't think we're at risk of a financial crisis. I worry that this is not enough and I think they're going to have to come up with their version of whatever it takes. By this time next year, the Bank of England will probably be causing interest rates. For more, let's bring in Bloomberg's Lizzie Burton. Lizzie, Liz trusts in since she won't cut spending and she won't you turn. How can we come up with this? Mark, ministers behind the scenes don't think so. Even if privately they're talking to her holding firm. In Prime Minister's question yesterday, she said she's not going to cut spending. As you say, the Institute for Fiscal Studies says she needs to find £60 billion worth of savings if she wants to balance the books and restore market credibility. Even that would be tough given much of the low-hanging fruit was already picked when George Osborne was a chancellor under the austerity years. But so it leaves the other option being to do a U-turn on the tax cuts. As I say, this is what the Treasury Select Committee Chairman Mel Stride sees a rowing back down the line. Eurasia Group has made it its base case that you get a full fiscal reversal at this point.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2377,2022-10-13 05:38:29
14152," So let committee chairman Mel Stride sees a rowing back down the line. Eurasia group, it's made it is base case that you get a full fiscal reversal at this point. Something really has got to give, don't it? Yeah, and the more I'm making the point, they made a delay. Some of the tax cuts for up to a year and perhaps give some breathing space. But when it comes to bus throwing, our throwing people under the bus, you saw Trostor to Quattang last week. He's done it to Bailey overnight. If there's a bomb eruption next week in Britain, it's down to the governor. Is he boxing the governor into extend and not pretend? Well, Bailey's in a difficult position anyway. Because if they think about it in the leadership campaign, Liz Trost was saying that the Bank of England didn't do enough to fight inflation, then they reversed on that and said that the BOE's independence was sacrosanct. Now, the Bank of England isn't really able to fight inflation because it's having to dance to fiscal policies tune. So, an unenviable position for Bailey, water is options. Well, he could continue with this gamble, his tough talk, saying that the program's going to end tomorrow. And just hope that markets get in line in time. He could fold and continue with the programmers, Cal and Pickering from Baronberg, expected, you heard, just there. He could leave Quattang to the mercy of the markets and see what happens. Or potentially there's a creative solution where the debt management office, which is part of the treasury, starts by raising short dated money to ease some of the pressure on longer term debt. But we'll have to see whether they choose that kind of option. Lizzie, thank you very much. Lizzie, burden on the UK politics at the moment. I guess this morning is Mitish Parik. It co-haired of discretionary macro fund, fixed income side for Sean Feld, advisors, his firm, manages $15 billion in third party assets. What does he make of the gelt market? Good to see you. Hi, Manus, nice to be back. Good to have you back on the show. So let's talk about this gelt market. It's broken by all accord. But I want context from you in terms of how illiquid is it, how broken is it, and does Mr Bailey have to extend and not pretend to shut up shop tomorrow to stabilize this market? Good morning. Good morning. Yeah, absolutely. I think the interesting thing about the gelt market is not so much a solvency question right now for these LDI strategies. It's much more around liquidity as you touched upon. So remember, as gilt yields do increase, ultimately, the present value of those liabilities starts to decrease in terms of it improves the balance sheet position for most of these pension funds. So ultimately, as we see it right now, there is a clear dichotomy between the fiscal side of the situation with the UK government and the Bank of England trying to maintain financial stability. So we've obviously seen a huge move in 30-year gilt yields above 5%. A lot of this is liquidity driven. If you try to trade in the options market, it's pretty much nonexistent. You struggle to get any sort of meaningful position on. So it's a lack of liquidity as we see deleveraging more broadly from these LDI related strategies that's causing this movement and the lack of credibility from the government to allow the market to stabilize. Matech, which is the greater danger for the BOE right now? Preferring to be that lender of last resort staying in this market for the pensions or, on the other hand, nixing that and really focusing on the short-term interest rates? Yeah, look, it's a very, very difficult situation from the Bank of England to be in. On the one hand, you've obviously got exceptionally high inflation. The decision-makers panel, which was published a week or so ago, showed that three-year inflation expectations are now 4.8% from 4.2%. So there's significant pressure on the Bank of England to ultimately get in line where market pricing is. 5.6%, 5.7% terminal rates by the middle of next year, versus where we sit today. So if you look at the front end of Sonia, the November meeting is now pricing 112 basis points of rate hikes. I struggle to see them getting to 112. We only just had a 50 basis point hike three weeks ago. So for me, the debate's between 75 and 100. More broadly speaking, though, they have a decision to make. I mean, I thought it was pretty bold of Bayley to come out and state that ultimately they had to get. The LDI strategies had to kind of unwind by the end of this week.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2378,2022-10-13 05:42:36
14153," All it was pretty bold or Bayley to come out and kind of state that ultimately they had to get the LDI strategies had to kind of unwind by the end of this week. When the reality is, you know, the size of this market, you know, 1.5 trillion of assets, it's going to be difficult to do that in like a two, three day period. So your role is discretionary. Don't expect you to dance with us all the way, but from a general sentiment point of view, are you, how are you positioning for forward inflation through the swaps? Are you short off sterling? Will there be another attack on sterling? Or will there be another lampoon enough guilt? Where does the tide smack the most? And how are you preparing for that? Yeah, look, I think the sharp ratio of a lot of these trades has diminished quite significantly. I mean, the modal distribution coming into the start of this year was the central banks in the US to be three or four hikes. Yeah. You know, we've had a huge, huge move across global curves now. So, you know, in terms of positioning, I think it's much more difficult to be very, very short, you know, the front end of these rates, curbs, given how much is now priced. But ultimately, we still think fundamentally for the dollar, you can see much more strength. We think we're in that kind of wrecking ball stage where as financial conditions continue to tighten, that dollar leg could be meaningfully high from here still. We're seeing significant intervention from Asian central banks, you know, be it the Japanese, the Koreans, the RBI in India to maintain stability in their currencies. We're just not sure how sustainable this is. You know, if you look at custody foreign custody holdings at the Fed, they have collapsed over the last few weeks. 50 billion of sales over the last couple of weeks. We'll get the latest numbers today. You know, that compares to March 2020 where we saw a $57 billion outflow in treasuries in a one week period, the greatest ever. So, we're back to these types of very, very stretched levels. Just very quickly on, you know, more broadly, the back end of the curve. We still think there's a lot of disconnect that's happening where further deleveraging could occur. So, you know, the move that we've seen in duration, global duration has been so significant. You know, 10-year boom, boom deals were at 70 basis points at the start of August. And now at 235, 10-year treasuries and in fact 10-year real yields have gone from 1%, sorry, from zero ultimately in August to 1.6%. The pace of these moves in financial conditions tightening is very destabilizing our customers. The reason for it to be in front of me, is that it's done. Yeah, I was saying, I was saying, Mitesh, this is fascinating to me because we're in this world right now where we have central banks really geared up to be dealing with the banking system, but the stresses we're seeing here in the UK, for example, with the pensions, it's outside of the banking system. What does that risk look like in the US? Is there something outside in these corners of the financial ecosystem that you fear will break? Look, I think it's a good question and it's a broader debate that we're having internally as well. Look, my main, if I look across like funding markets, you know, one month basis, you know, all these things, even credit markets, they're reasonably well anchored. We're not seeing significant stresses currently. This may change, but right now that suggests to us that something might break. I think more broadly, though, the pace of deleveraging that we're starting to see, and to my earlier point, around duration, and how yield curves, and how more broadly, you know, the correlation between equities and bonds has broken down. If you look at the last 10 days or so, it's the first time since 1997 where we've ultimately seen bonds and equities moving the same direction, be it lower or higher. And that was the Asian financial crisis. So, you know, to answer your question, we're not seeing anything specifically in kind of funding markets or credit markets to suggest that, you know, the end is night, but liquidity is absolutely problematic right now. You know, we're struggling in rates markets more broadly to be able to, you know, transact as a result. Okay, wrecking balls, but we're not, we're not quite at the Asian financial crisis, just yet, mid-tish stay with us, mid-tish, parique, is I guess this morning from Sean Feld, plenty more ahead on this edition of Daybreak Europe.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2379,2022-10-13 05:46:56
14154," Still needed. to all these consultants doing? Well David, I think that we actually defy the label consultant because sometimes consultant seems to imply that we only give advice. And when you look at what Accenture does, we're really different than the traditional version of a consultant. We're really about relevance and results. And that's what is driving our business. What about a consulting project? In my example, on the CEO, I have a problem. I call you up. I say, solve my problem or give me a solution. We don't operate as big companies permanently in crisis mode. And so when you think about how long does it solve things, a lot of it starts with the company being willing to set aggressive goals. And so what we are trying to do now is work with our clients to work differently and to work faster. 7 For me, the bar for such a change is very high because we have not yet seen much evidence that the underlying inflation, the services inflation, the wage inflation, the labor market, that that is yet softening. And so I think we're quite a ways away from anything like that. Many in that was Fed President Neil Cash Carrey there who is not a voting member of course this year. Now his comments came after the September Fed minutes were released and his traders look ahead to the CPI print later today. Still with Manusami as Mattish Parik, co-head of Discrushing and macro-anfix income at Schoenfield Strategic Advisors. Mattesh, okay, so we got FOMC minutes yesterday. We hear from the likes of Lainel, Brainard saying perhaps there's a case for not pivoting but pausing. Mattesh is the Fed going to continue to be in such a rush and why be in such a rush? Yeah, thanks, Annie. I think ultimately if you just look at core CPI, we're on a tundle. We haven't seen the likes of those levels of CPI for a long, long time. If you think about the components of core CPI, most notably wages and OER, occupied rent, those things remain exceptionally sticky. So today's number is very significant just on the basis of the fact that the last print in core was 0.6, just a much bigger number than expected. And the likelihood is today the market expectations are 0.4, but we've consistently seen the last year as that no forecaster on Wall Street has consistently been able to call where this CPI tops out. So I still think for the Fed, there's a big unknown in trying to really pivot at this point without seeing aggregate demand soften and the labour market starting to soften. So I think talk of a pivot is a little bit premature. The market has 75 pretty much nailed on for this November meeting with almost 60 base support and price for December and then 25 are so price for January. Now my most likely base case is that we get to the end of the year. We'll see what the inflation data is doing, but just by a quirk of the calendar, there's only four more CPI prints after today's result. And that means that the Fed really need to see three of those decreased to give them comfort that much they can pause in. So I think the jury is still out as to whether they can pivot, but it is notable that the vice chair, Lail Brainard is starting to comment a couple of times now on that two-way risk factor. Then translate that into the dollar. You mentioned the dollar was perhaps one of your preferences in the last conversation. My question to you would be was that with that rate trajectory that you have is the dollar fully priced for the rate trajectory, but another alpha is perhaps global left-tail risk.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2380,2022-10-13 05:51:11
14155," in the last conversation. My question to you would be was that with that rate trajectory that you have is the dollar-fully priced for the rate's trajectory. But another alpha is perhaps global left-tail risk, which are mounting. Is that what drives your dollar higher? And if so, where do you want to be long dollar against most? Yeah, it's a good question. So I think on the dollar front we've had a big move, but the reality is the US is the least-ertichert. If you look at the other alternatives out there, you know, Euro, there's a lot of reasons not to be long the Euro right now. You know, we don't have to go into all of them, but you know, it's very clear the market's been very focused. The same can apply for the pound, the same applies for the Chinese Remimbi, the same applies for most of Asia. So the reality is they just are a lack of alternatives. And as the Fed consistently embark on tightening financial conditions, that does mean by definition the dollar does need to get stronger as part of that process. Where I think the weaknesses are right now is in Asia. You know, we're seeing that continuous intervention from not just the Chinese, but the Japanese from India, Korea, et cetera. I think that is where the risk is that ultimately something's good to give. Matej, if I can just squeeze in an existential question here. We've seen time and time again this year assets that should be risk-free are acting pretty risky, whether it be the long end of the bond curve, whether it be various currencies. Has your playbook changed? Does modern portfolio theory after this year need to be thrown out the window? Yeah, look, if you look at performance of the traditional 60-40 portfolio, it's the second worst on record behind 2008. So I think that tells you exactly how difficult the modern playbook has been for this year in particular. And you know, just going back, we've had almost 13 years post-of-financial crisis where liquidity has been abundant and central banks have essentially suppressed volatility and expanded balance sheets. Now we're in the reverse of that where liquidity has been withdrawn. It's happening at a much more rapid pace. There's consistent leverages and cross-links across the market, that some of which we're not aware of right now, that ultimately are going to feel strained with a lag effect as you see rates normalized from zero, you know, deeply negative real rates to ultimately positive real rates. So, you know, I think that liquidity question is top of mind for most hedge funds. And I think more broadly, the longer this goes on for, you know, the more at risk we are of something, you know, systemically breaking. Well, there is your desert personification in terms of liquidity risk across the Bloomberg terminal. Mittesh, good sport. Thanks for coming in. I'm glad to know we're not exactly at a breaking point of the late 90s yet. That is, I guess this morning, Mittani and I, Mittesh Parikko, head of discretionary macro and fixed income at Chomfield Strategic Advisors. Danny, a little bit more breaking news on the electronics run on Samsung. What have you got? Yeah, this is sort of from the Wall Street Journal, Manusette. Samsung is going to be getting a one-year exemption from the US chip curbs on China. Of course, the US restricting what can be sent to China. It's something that's been wrecking this tech market. So, again, Wall Street Journal reporting, Samsung getting a one-year exemption. All right, coming up on the program with Manusanie, it's back to reality for Italy's new leader as Georgia and Maloney struggles to form a new government. We're going to break down the biggest obstacles, chief aces. This is Bloomberg. China's military power has been growing at an incredible speed of over the last 20 years. A strong country must have a strong military, as only then can it guarantee the security of the nation. In terms of sphere of influence, we absolutely know that China wants to be dominant in Asia. So, there is a target to get to that point to be a military...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2381,2022-10-13 05:55:25
14156," In terms of sphere of influence, we absolutely know that China wants to be dominant in Asia. So there is a target to get to that point, to be a military that is appear to the greatest militaries in the world by 2035. The competition for influence is a global one. And through a multi-decade trajectory fueled by planning, money, and pragmatism, China is building a military that allows it to shape the 21st century just as the US shaped 20th. I will now move on to the next question. Italy's new parliament will convene for the first time since Georgia Malone's election win later today. Malone won a clear majority during September's election, setting herself up to become the country's first female prime minister at the head of the most right-wing government since World War II. But the brothers of Italy leader is in a race against time to put together a coalition government and find a new finance minister. For more, let's turn to Bloomberg's Rome bureau chief Alessandro Spassiale. So Alessandro, what are some of the biggest challenges that Malone is up against? Well, the number one challenge in former government that is for its finding its suitable finance minister is in the fragile economic situation. There is probably a recession coming to Europe, the energy crisis, and of course Italy is very, very high debt. And the ECB board member, Fabio Tani, said no, thank you, but no, to Georgia Malone's offer. Now she is struggling to find a high level internationally respected figure to head Italy's economy. One option is that she might turn to a student politician with a lot of experience in the UK. Today, Italian budget, John Carlo Togetti for the league, but of course it's not worth markets where it's making the first place. We're going to have to leave it there. We just got a few of those classic signed connection issues to Rome with our bureau chief Alessandro Spassiale. We will come back to that in a moment. The stage is set, Danny, isn't it? I mean, a bombed battle bruise. I knew I'd get a triple. And you I'd get a triple in before the end of the show. How's your conversation with Mittes? Racking ball. A racking ball has just been through across the board and across the risks, hasn't it? Yeah. And I think it's interesting to look at this lens as Mittesh does of what's happening in the UK, potential setup for other things like this to happen in the globe. That the longer this goes on, he says the more things will break. Man, I got a triple for you. For the BOE, it's liquidity risk, credibility risk, and independence risk. How's that for a triplet? You go. You see, that's what happens when you hang out on this show for too long. Yeah, and I'm turning into one of these people that sort of comes up with dreadful iterations. Should we take that screen down? Why don't we see us? More of us, less than 30-year-old, I say. Danny, it's going to be interesting to see what the Bank of England are forced to do today in terms of going, mine, mine, mine. Yeah, I want to see what the auction looks like. We'll be a big one, we'll pensions, take them up, we'll still be embedded in this system. All right, more to come.

14157," four The 700th anniversary of Dante Allegari's death has triggered the work of many institutions and offered a very rich schedule of events. Today in Santa Crochet, we present one of these projects that suffered a difficult start because COVID-19 has stopped the project that was shared by the opera de Santa Crochet by the Franciscan community from Florence Municipality and the fun for religious building of the internal minister. Today, Felice Lemosani's project is finally enjoyable. In the Pazi Chapel, the marvelous architecture by Felipe Brunolessi, the most important images from the divine comedy created by the French illustrator Gustaf Dore. Through these images, we can live the violent emotions of hell, the weight of purgatory and the sublime joy of paradise. The digital humanities are a cultural occasion to exploit. Summing up, it's about merging humanistic disciplines with new technologies. I find this to be an innovating and modern tool to update culture. Cultural heritage becomes something to hand over to the new generations and not to be put aside, so it's about using technology, pixels, and binary code with the human and humanizing content. This is a market that, over the past few weeks has made it clear, it wants to go higher. It got a little spooked by the idea that geocalitore content is arising. Good morning. Welcome to Bloomberg Market's Europe. I'm Anna Edwards, live in London. The cash trade is just less than an hour away, here are your top headlines. Blame game. UK Chancellor Quasi Quarting says the Bank of England will be responsible if markets tank after its bond buying program ends. All eyes on CPI, Asian stocks and Treasury's decline before today's critical US inflation print. Fed Minutes show a commitment to restrictive rate hikes. Plus, as OPEC trims its demand outlook, US officials fear their Russian oil price cap plan may fail, Putin warns all global energy infrastructure is at risk. Welcome to the program, everybody. We're just under an hour away from the start of equity trading here, cash equity trading of course here in Europe. So let's have a look at where the future's picture positions us. Yesterday we saw modest losses for European markets, modest losses over the US, although it was the sixth consecutive day of losses on the S&P. And so we look to follow that up with modest and and above losses here for Europe. So we're expecting Euro stocks 50 futures down by around half a percent at the start of the trading days, seems to be a lot to be nervous about. US futures had been showing something of a gain, only a very slight one just a half an hour ago also, but now look to be flat to negative, but not really moving much. And of course, the CPI number is going to be the key piece of information that the market gets to deal with, gets to learn about. And then factory in a little bit later on today, will we get any sense of a peak, what will the rents information tell us? We've also had minutes. Let's have a look at what the GMM is showing us. So you can see where modestly risk off when it comes to the GMM picture more than modestly if you look at the South Korean market down by 1.4%. But the minutes were demonstrating a commitment to restrictive rates territory. There were some voices, some voices talking about needing to calibrate the pace of policy increases or interest rates.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2383,2022-10-13 06:04:01
14158," I mean, it's were demonstrating a commitment to restrictive rates territory. There were some voices, some voices talking about needed to calibrate the pace of policy increases or interest rate increases, suggesting a slowing in the future, but that was something the market sort of processed very quickly and got over and focused instead on the commitment to restrictive rates territory. So as a result, pretty risk off right now. We see that the dollar is that said, the dollar is fairly flat. Other currencies, some of them losing a little bit of ground, the yen for example, went through a fresh 24 year high, raising the prospect of intervention, a lot of conversations around whether we might see some intervention. So we'll get back to the big data point of the day, which is CPI a little bit later. Let's focus in on what's going on in the UK, though, because Chancellor Quasicuarting says the Bank of England would be responsible for any market volatility after it's bond buying program ends. And that end is due tomorrow, of course, speaking on the sidelines of the IMF's annual meeting, the Chancellor told Sky News that any turmoil is, quote, a matter for the governor. Four more on this. Let's bring in Bloomberg's Lizzie burden. Good morning. Good to see you, Lizzie. So it seems that the Chancellor and the governor, well, there's a bit of a standoff brewing, isn't there when it comes to Friday or is it the weekend or Monday, but this is going to get tense perhaps. Yeah, so you've got both the Prime Minister and the Bank of England governor under massive pressure to you turn on the one hand in terms of fiscal policy. Liz Truss said yesterday at Prime Minister's questions that she's not going to cut spending, which makes it look inevitable that she's going to have to reverse some of her tax cuts. Meanwhile, Andrew Bailey also under massive pressure to you turn. He had all this tough talk earlier in the week saying that the emergency bond buying program has to end tomorrow. But then, quite, and of course, baiting him to continue it. Bailey's argument really is that at the moment he's got his foot on the accelerator and the break. It looks like he's beholden to fiscal policy. The chief economist Hugh Pill backed him up and said that really the Bank of England needs to focus on fighting inflation right now. But UK pension funds really dependent on this lifeline to stay afloat. Investors today are going to be watching to see who blinks first. Will it be the government? Will it be the governor? I think the King's greeting to Liz Truss at that weekly meeting. Somebody up well. Deer O'Dear. Yeah, absolutely. I'm sure that's going to get a lot of play this week for sure domestically. Yes, yesterday we saw the Bank of England buying 4.4 billion pounds worth of guilt at the Wednesday tender. That was the biggest intervention that they've made so far. So a lot of focus on whether they go up to that 10 billion limit today. Thank you very much. We'll get more on the market angle on this later. Lizzy burdened with us on what's going on between the Bank of England and the Treasury that push and that pull. Let's get a global market perspective on what is happening here in the UK and the risks surrounding it for global assets. Omasharif joins us inflation insights founder and president. Of course we're going to talk to you about US inflation. That's going to be a focus of our conversation. So we're going to have to think about the risks posed by what's happening here in the UK and I'm sure this has found its way into your thinking in some sense. What for you is at stake here? You know, ultimately it is what sort of contagion really comes out of the UK. I think ultimately that's the fallout that I'm thinking about and I think others here in the US at least are thinking about is, you know, what does this mean for central banks here in the US? If there is a serious risk of contagion out of the UK into US markets. Does that mean the Fed perhaps pivots a lot sooner than what we're expecting the Fed to do. So I think that's really the risk and that this tends to be generally the risk regardless of where it's happening is the fallout and the contagion into other markets. I think that's really what we've tried to take on board and think about beyond just what the Fed is doing in terms of the current policy is what's going what will the central bank potentially pivot because what's happening in the UK markets. Right. Okay. So yes, do we get some sort of risk that is brought to the fall by this that then causes other central banks to pivot or to look as if they are. So in fact, it's having on other asset classes and thinking about how, for example, pension funds in the UK, yes, they're selling guilt to try and get enough cash to pay those margin calls, but they're also selling other assets and some of our colleagues quote certain trading deaths talking about US corporate credit being sold European CLOs. Are you concerned that other assets get taken down to. I mean, look, I think you have to be concerned because that is always the risk and look, I think three, four weeks ago, nobody was talking about UK pension funds. And so the idea that maybe it could be the CLO market in the US or corporate credit in the US is certainly something to do.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2384,2022-10-13 06:08:35
14159," I think three, four weeks ago, nobody was talking about UK pension funds. And so the idea that maybe it could be the CLM work in the US or corporate credit in the US is certainly something to think about right now. I think, and you've heard a number of beneficiaries talk about this in the last week or so, is that right now they don't really see that sort of concession in the US market. So while there is some downtrend in certain areas, it's not to the point where the Fed is really concerned. They still think maybe liquidity is a bit tighter than they would like, but so far, beefing markets in the US are behaving appropriately right now. And it doesn't feel like the Fed is anywhere near the type of pivot that we required if there was some serious fallout in US markets from what's happening abroad. Given your specialism in inflation, Omar, wonder if you could give us your thoughts on what fiscal authorities globally need to watch out for when it comes to the market's view on inflation right now. Because many investors are really concerned about inflation whether that's in the US or globally. And for many people, that's what worried them about the fiscal package coming out of the UK. Now the government says they don't see it as inflationary. We've talked a lot of economists who do see it as inflationary. Clearly we're dealing with a market that is very nervous around anything that looks like it might add to the inflation impulse. Yeah, but ultimately this is a debate we've been having, honestly, at least in the US since early 2020, late 2020, you know, we had a lot of stimulus out of the scene from us spending our checks. There's a lot of debate about to what stand out really fueled inflation in the US. And that's still being hotly debated today. Steps that have been taken the interim, for example, the recent debt cancellation for student debt, you know, some economists think that's pouring more fuel onto the fire. And that's really ultimately where the concern is, are we adding to the inflationary pressure through things like student debt cancellation, through tax cuts and so on. And that's where the concern is. Because ultimately the more inflation you get from fiscal policy, the more central bank is going to be required to race race, the higher the risk then becomes of a recession or something in the markets breaking it as we've seen so far. And that's really what the concern is, are we pouring too much fuel onto fire when it comes to things like tax cuts and other fiscal policy? That's where I think the purpose is. Okay, excellent. Omar, thank you very much for giving us the sort of global perspective on this for now. Omar Sharif, inflation insights founder and president staying with us and very kindly joining us late in the day, as it is, from California. We'll get to his thoughts on US inflation because that is going to be the key data point of the week. We'll do that shortly. In the meantime, let's get a blue boat first working as art's a Alice Hacking joins us with a briefing, Alice. Morning, Anna. The head of the IMF says Ukraine will need at least $3 billion a month next year to finance its wartime economy, which means allies will have to give more support. After meeting in Washington, Kristalina Georgieva also warned developments in the war could push financing needs even higher. Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, says any energy infrastructure in the world is at risk after the explosions on the Nord Stream gas pipelines. Speaking at a Moscow energy forum, he blamed the damage on the US, Ukraine and Poland, calling them beneficiaries of the blasts. Various reports have suggested the sudden leaks were an act of sabotage. The US is considering a total ban on Russian aluminium in response to the military escalation in Ukraine. Bloomberg's land that the Biden administration is weighing a number of options, including an outright ban or a large increase in tariffs. Russia is second only to China as a producer of aluminium, which is crucial to most heavy industries. American conspiracy theorist Alex Jones has been ordered to pay almost a billion dollars in damages after repeatedly claiming the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting was a hoax. The Connecticut trial was the second to hold Jones financially accountable for his lies about the massacre. Global news 20 browser day on air and on Bloomberg quick take, powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 100 and 20 countries. This is Bloomberg, Anna. Thanks very much, Alice Akkin, here in London with your first web news update. Coming up, it's back to reality for Italy's new leader as George Maloney struggles to form a new government. We will break down the biggest obstacle she faces a little bit later this half hour. Up next, we look ahead to today's key data, US CPI and we get the thoughts of Omar Shahi from inflation insights. If you have any questions, please do. Send them to us ID plus TV Go. That is the function to use on your Bloomberg. This is the back.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2385,2022-10-13 06:12:54
14160," If you have any questions, please do send them to us ID plus TV Go. That is the function to use on your group bag. This is Big Bag. How much a good push have you seen from the Keshira government in terms of green funding? I think he is very reflective of the challenges that Japan society is facing, namely that growth has been present but growth has not been evenly distributed. Frankly speaking, it is hard to just be income if you do not have a income to begin with. If the government and private sector can work together and collaborate to drive more innovative growth startups, that can really drive the income growth that the Keshira government needs to redistribute. If we do not see signs that inflation is moving down, my view continues to be that sizeable increases in the target range for the federal funds rate should remain on the table. However, if inflation starts to decline, I believe a slower pace of rate increases would be appropriate. For me, the bar for such a change is very high because we have not yet seen much evidence that the underlying inflation, the services inflation, the wage inflation, the labour market, that is yet softening. I think we are quite a ways away from anything like that. By our side says Neil Keshikari, that was Michelle Bowman and Neil Keshikari there on the Fed's rate path and inflation goals. The comments came during the period we were hearing about the September Fed minutes, whilst they were released, as traders look ahead to the CPI print later today. Let's talk about all of that with the Omash Reef. Inflation Insights founder and president, who is still with us, Omash. Thank you for staying with us. And thank you once again for being with us from California, which seems fairly anti-social to have got you here at that time. Let me ask you about what you expect then from the inflation number. The bottom line I think for you is around core and whether it prints something more like 0.3 or 0.4. Exactly. The bloomerian is looking for about 0.4. I am just a very borderline 0.3.4. I think the risks are much more tilted to the downside. So I think a 0.3 core is much more likely. My feeling is that the risk for the first time in a quite a while are much more to the downside. Any number of large components in the CPI that includes things like use cars, apparel with all the discounting that is happening, even new vehicles potentially. So this is the first time in quite a while where I am sort of a view that the risks are much more tilted to the downside to the upside. And I believe that this is going to be the first in a string of much lower core CPI prints around let's say 0.2 to 0.3%, which versus the 0.5, 0.6% of readings we have seen over the course of the last year. And I think this is what the Fed has been waiting to see for the last year.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2386,2022-10-13 06:16:47
14161," 0.2 to 0.3%, which, you know, versus the 0.5, 0.6% readings, we have seen over the course of the last year. And I think this is what the Fed has been waiting to see for the last year. I think this is going to be the first any number of prints that sort of gets to where they would like to see the core. OK. And if we got something more like 0.3, you say that that would be not a head fate. That would be something a bit more substantial. And would suggest maybe a direction change perhaps there, or at least something quite material. Tell me more about rents, though. Why do you think that that might be one of the components that helps bring inflation down? Yes. So rents, I mean, to be fair, in my forecast for tomorrow and even the next several months, rents moderate just a little bit, but they're not really coming out too substantially. So we've seen rents print around 0.7 every month. You know, we're looking at rent worth right now around 6 and 3.4 years every year. I actually think by the end of the year, we could get to something as close to 7.5, 7.3 quarters. But the underlying pace we know is very likely to slow starting around Q1 probably next year, because rents in the CPI lag, what is actually happening with new leases in the market. And we know that that data in a private sector has slowed down appreciably. And it doesn't really matter what you look at. Or logic, say a little private list, rent growth has moderated since around the spring of this year. In the CPI, I just do know the way it's calculated. That shows up with about a one-year lag. So we know that that is about to come down. It's really everything else that I'm sort of more focused on, because that seems like, you know, that is about to peak around the turn of the year Q1. And then we should get rents slowing. It's, can we get a slowdown in other elements of the core? So other core goods, you know, other core services. And I think for me, at least that's what the focus is, because rents almost seems like, I don't want to say it's foregone completion, but it seems very likely they will turn sometime early next year to the downside. OK, so you're looking for a sequential slowdown in the rent story. Let's put this in the context of the Fed, then Omar and what, the market response to this might be, what the Fed response to this might be. I mean, what are you going to be in the context of the minutes we got yesterday, where they showed that they were still very keen on fighting inflation, obviously, very committed to that. But there were some voices that said they need to maybe just calibrate the pace of increases based on the risks. How did you take that on board? Yes, I think the issue is that, let's say we get a point three number tomorrow for the Core CPI. The problem is we got a similar number in March that was followed by a point six, that similar number in July that was followed by a point six in August. So I don't think the Fed has a luxury of looking at this trend and saying, you know what, we can step back to 50 based points, or we can sort of moderate our end point that we're trying to get to, because they've seen these prints before, followed by very strong rebounds of inflation. So that's one part of it. So, you know, and again, this is the last number in terms of the Core CPI they'll get, they'll get a Core PCE, but that's sort of, that's very much baked in the cake once we get the CPI regarding that the API and they know what that will look like essentially tomorrow. So this is really all they get before the November meeting. And I just don't think it's enough. You've seen how artificial say we need to see a series of much softer core prints. You know, one is not going to do it for them. The other element of this that I think is very important is, it's not just about the point number slowing down to, let's say point three, it's about the breadth of the disinflation, you can't just have a slower number that is, you know, the result of one or two components of core inflation slowing down moderately. It has to be a much broader disinflation amongst a lot of components. And, you know, right now that's why they're looking at the median and trimming and we've got to see those come off as well. Okay, so Treasury markets were pouring over all the detail of this Omar as you've broken it down, the different components, what breadth we get to any move lower in core inflation will of course be key for Treasury is just like other asset classes. Janet Yellen was expressing some concern that we've heard from other places recently, which is around Treasury liquidity. Is it adequate? Is that going to be something that quote unquote breaks before Central Bank to get a get a hold of inflation? Is that something that's worrying you? Look, I'll be quite honest. I'm not a Treasury market strategist, so I don't have a lot to offer on that particular question. Again, I would sort of just go back to what, you know, at least that officials have expressed, which is they're watching it very closely, you've heard Governor Rainer talk about this, you heard President Meeser talk about this just the other day. So they're watching it closely, but their feeling is that it's not at a point, is I'm really close to a point where they're overly concerned about liquidity measures. And I think way up.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2387,2022-10-13 06:21:55
14162," just the other day. So they're watching it closely, but their feeling is that it's not at a point, it's not even really close to a point where they're overly concerned about liquidity measures. And I think what you're hearing is something a little bit different out of let's say market participants versus what federal officials are seeing and what folks in the New York Fed are seeing, we actually do watch the markets. So, you know, unfortunately for me, I don't watch it as closely, but at least in terms of what the Fed is looking at, that's not something they're overly concerned about just yet. Yes, indeed. The rest of the semester, certainly giving us that sort of sense in recent days, Omar and then from the Fed minutes, also very much stressing that the risks of not tagging inflation are greater than the risks of doing so. Oh, my show, thank you very much for joining us, really good to get your inflation thoughts from, inflation insights, of course, founder and president of that organization. Now, coming up on the programme, Italy's incoming Prime Minister works to assemble her cabinet. As the country's economic outlook darkens, we've got the latest from Rome next. This is the end. Wall Street prepares for the latest read on inflation. Take fat, peak hole, kishness, we're getting carried away. The market's been right. Our rate hike starting to pay off. How long is it going to take to see progress on inflation? Fed just has a long way to go. Instant reaction on Bloomberg surveillance. Inflation is still stick. The US economy is still on track. And what it means for the Fed. The data will tell us. I think we're quite always away from the poll. This is a Fed that will play the prudent thing to do is to ease off a little bit and just have a look around. Inflation, in focus. Today on Bloomberg. Thank you. Hi, Alessandro. It's Anna in London. Check your economy. I can tell you fine. Can you hear me? Oh, yes. That sounds great. Excellent. Recently, cryptocurrencies have been very popular. If a client came to you and said, look, I'd like some cryptocurrencies in my portfolio. What would you say? We've actually been really deep into crypto, deep into learning about blockchain, and all of the new businesses. I would characterize this as crypto learners. We have made a series of toehold investments. I'll be have our clients. Both in some of the currency baskets, as well as with some venture firms that are investing primarily in the crypto area. I think it has the potential to be completely game-changing. But it is still such the wild west. And so it's so uncertain. But it has the potential to completely upend everything. So really a reminder, isn't it, just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see pressure on the U.A. and we did see some pressure on the future. That is now being reversed. Welcome back to Bloomberg markets. Europe, we still have 40 or so minutes to go into the start of cash equity trading. And the future's picture is kind of negative for Europe. US futures now back to being almost entirely flat as we wait for US CPI data a little bit later on. That will be the key print of the day, of course. Let's focus on Italian politics. Georgia Malone's euphoria at winning the recent election is now running into reality as the far right leader struggles to put together a coalition. It comes as the IMF warns that the country faces recession in the coming quarters. For more, let's turn to Bloomberg's Roan Biori Chief at Santero Speciali, who joins us now. And Santero, nice to speak to you. So what are some of the big challenges that Malone is facing then as she tries to put together this government? Well, the main challenge that Malone faces right now is funding the right person to steer Italy's economy, the right person to be finance minister, the ECB board member, Pat.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2388,2022-10-13 06:25:48
14163," Well, the main challenge that Melanie faces right now is funding the right person to steer Italy's economy, the right person to be finance minister. The ECB board member, Pabu Paveta, Italy's A-B board member, has turned down the opposite. Thanks, but no thanks. Now she's looking for an international recognized figure to steer the economy, the high depth, the energy crisis, the possible recession. One option appears to be Giancarlo Giorgeti, a league member, a politician, high-staying in Italy, but not so well known internationally. We'll see if it clinches the job and if markets are satisfied. And if they do go for Giorgeti, Giorgeti has been a minister in drug, he's government. So international, you say that maybe not so well known internationally, but sketch out their, sketch out his experience. Yes, Giorgeti is a graduate of Bacconi University, Italy's top financial university, but the end has been in drug, he's government, he's from the league, the part of Matel Salveni, the party was being called enough for touch cuts and for more depth to finance a bit, like what Lidstras has been doing in the UK. But Giorgeti is not fully aligned with Salveni. So in this sense, he would be a safer pair of hands. What is missing here is that probably markets, what Meloni had been promising, hinting, was an international recognized figure think about Pannetta again, an ECB board member, or someone again coming from the Hyde respective bank of Italy. We'll see if part is fine in agreement in the next few days. The parliament meets for the first time today. Yes, and you mentioned the UK story. I wonder, Alessandra, how much that is sort of doing the rounds in Rome as a caution retail, I suppose, about financial credibility, how easy it can be to lose in some senses. And with that in mind, how are markets reacting to these attempts to form a government? Indeed, so far there has been a sort of apparent quiet in Italian markets. Though it has been a road in a bit, the spread between Italian and German bonds has been steadily but slowly going up. This is a thing to the restriction. Of course, there are many external factors. It's not all about the government formation. And so far in the past few weeks, there has been no panic. Meloni has been very careful in messaging that she's going to be responsible physically, that she's not going to pick up with fights with you just for the fun of it. But of course, it's going to be a right to end government. It's going to be a nationalist government. And Italy's economy is highly indebted and international situation is not easy. So it's not going to be a very difficult task for anyone, especially for someone with almost no government experience as Meloni is. And Alessandra, just briefly, how weak is the economy as we head into what is assumed to be a difficult winter for many countries? Italy's economy has a lot of problems as usually but it has been doing better than expected in the past few months. Industrial production was even up in the last data that came out, which was a surprise. The IMF predicts at 0.2 construction in 2023, but Italy is at risk. It's going to be slow growth. We'll see what turns out to be right. Alessandra, thank you so much. Thanks for your time. Alessandra, especially, Alie, joining us there from Rome with the latest on the Italian political story. We'll get back to the UK politics shortly. Moving up Chancellor Quentin says the responsibility for any market turmoil after B.O.E. bond buying ends is a matter for the governor.

I don't know if I'm asking to choose amongst their children, but you know, some of the most recognizable buildings by you, of course, the Millennium Bridge, London City Hall, the Reichstag, and the Great Court British Museum. What was your favorite project to do? The Reichstag does stand out because, first of all, it's an energy manifesto. So it transforms something that was dependent on fossil fuels. It uses all the technology to produce something which is essentially carbon neutral and is a public building, that's a statement. It's a symbol of a city, a symbol of a nation, it incorporates works of art. It's recycling an existing building which, as I mentioned earlier, is the ultimate in sustainability if you can give a new life to a building. It also creates public space at the roof level. It is the most visited parliament in the well-soaked puts. The public above the politicians who are answerable to them. And that, of course, was made possible by the politicians.

All eyes on CPI, Asian stocks and treasuries decline before today's critical U.S. inflation print. Fed Minutes show a commitment to restrictive rate hikes. Plus, as OPEC trims, its demand outlook, U.S. officials fear their Russian oil price cap plan may fail. Putin warned all global energy infrastructure is at risk. Welcome back to the program. So half an hour until the start of trading. And the future picture looks a bit negative, actually. So FTSE, DAX and CAC features all down right now. Looking to continue the negativity, we've seen six days of selling on the S&P 500. This is not just a European phenomenon, of course, it has very much U.S. expression as well. A lot of focus on the UK will get to the politics of that shortly. But in terms of the data prints, we will be stateside with our focus later with the CPI print due out. Will we get any sense of a peak? Will we see those rental prices playing ball and coming down a tool or at least moderating the pace of advance? Let us get a business flash now and get to Bloomberg's Alice Atkins. Good morning, Alice. Hi, Anna. The US has ordered its U.S. staff to stop servicing customers in China after the Biden administration announced tighter restrictions. The Dutch chip manufacturing equipment maker told its employees in America about the rule changes in an email. A SML has held back from selling some of its most advanced technology to China as it tries to strike a balance between the two nations. The US is considering a total ban on Russian aluminium in response to the military escalation in Ukraine. Bloomberg has learned that the Biden administration is weighing a number of options, including an outright ban or a large increase in tariffs. Russia is second only to China as a producer of aluminium, which is crucial to most heavy industries. And bike dancers offering to buyback shares from its employees for $155 a piece.

14165," $155 a piece. It's the firm's second buyback program for staff this year as it ramps up plans to boost morale after its IPO stalled. The move comes after the company announced a $3 billion buyback program for investors last month giving the start up a $300 billion valuation. That's your Bloomberg business flash Anna. Alice, thanks very much, Alice Atkins in London. Now the UK is in crisis mode following the government's package of unfunded tax cuts and ensuing markets turmoil which forced the Bank of England to intervene. However, doubling down Prime Minister Liz Truss insists she won't cut spending or make any further euterns on her tax cuts. Joining us now, Bloomberg's Lizzie Burden, so we're all non-the-wise, as to how the sums add up and that's why we're still nervous and waiting for all the detail. So how can Liz Truss then, Lizzie? How can she calm markets if she feels it's within her, if she feels she needs to? Well, she said that she won't reduce spending and that would have been hard anyway because George Osborne's chancellor under austerity picked all the low-hanging fruit which really leaves her having to eutern on her tax cuts if she wants to balance the books and restore credibility and markets. The Institute for Physical Studies says she needs to find £60 billion but of course this would be really difficult politically. It will make her look like an even lame aduck but it's what her MPs are seeing happening. We had the Chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, Mel Stride saying that he reckons she's going to have to row back on some of these tax cuts and Eurasia Group says that it's now their base case that you see a full reversal of this fiscal plan. Okay, that's really interesting then. A full reversal rather than some voices just talking about maybe delaying some of the plans that they've talked about rather than bringing things in more imminently. So we'll see what comes to pass. Lizzie, quite a quiet thing then perhaps putting Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England in a bit of a corner. How is this going to play out? I mean, I was reading a story earlier, a Bloomberg story about whether you know, does Bailey fold, does quattling fold? There's certainly a standoff brewing over the weekend. Yeah, really difficult position for Andrew Bailey, quattling effectively saying the balls in your court but he's got two balls to deal with Andrew Bailey. He's got to deal with fighting inflation and making the pensions sector stable again. And effectively there's a mutually exclusive goals when you're using quantitative easing for one and you're trying to do the exact opposite on the other hand. So Bailey's credibility is on the line as well. He could continue with this gamble. He said that the program's going to end tomorrow. He could just hope that the market's deal with it. He could fold as you say and actually sacrifice some credibility, continue the program. Or perhaps there is a creative solution here for the debt management office which is part of the treasury and deal with some shorter dated money to make ease the longer dated debt. But this hasn't been put forward yet. We'll have to see tomorrow. Yeah, I think HSBC talking about that aren't they issuing short end if the DMO were to issue at the short end guilt market rather than at the long end where so much of the funding stress has been. We will talk about that next. Thank you very much Lizzie. Lizzie Burton with us to talk us through the latest tensions between the Bank of England and the treasury. Let us stick with that scene. Be a wee Governor Andrew Bailey is then under pressure to reverse course on his promise to end emergency guilt purchases this Friday and prevent further market meltdown. Economists and bankers have been giving us their take on what is happening within the Bank of England and what is next for the UK's economy. We've announced that we will be out by the end of this week. You've got three days left now, you've got to get this done. The Bank of England can talk tough but fundamentally they're just going to have to extend this. They are trying to hold things together as best they can. The confusion I think comes between the financial side of the Bank of England and the monetary side of the Bank of England which are now trying to do different things. Monetary and fiscal policy being at crossroads with at cross purposes with each other. That's a very dangerous cocktail for for bond markets. It's been trying to maintain price stability and at the same time address financial stability issues with this other instrument. This is not yet looking to me like a very steep and deep recession. I don't think we're at risk of a financial crisis. I worry that this is not enough and I think they're going to have to come up with their version of whatever it takes. By this time next year the Bank of England will probably be causing interest rates.

14166," of whatever it takes. By this time next year, the Bank of England will probably be causing interest rates. Joining us now with analysis of how the markets are receiving this news flow, Market Lives Ven Ram is with us this morning. Ven, very nice to speak to you. So every day we get these details from the Bank of England around this guilt buying programme. What can we know, how much they have bought essentially during each tender? How are you looking at that data? Because we saw the biggest amount bought by the B.O.E yesterday. They could have bought more, though, based on the limits they set themselves. So that we've still got two more days today and tomorrow. How should we interpret that data when we get it? Morning, Ann. So I think that yesterday, as you mentioned, they bought the highest amount in a while. So I think that if they continue doing that today and tomorrow, and it seems very likely that those amounts will be larger than usual, larger than usual going into the ending of the programme, I think that will relieve some of the markets, but come the big point is what happens, come Monday, because that's when the programme ends. And then the B.O.E's backdrop won't be there. And is the market or are the positions in the area among the Islet managers cleaned out enough for the markets to allow for the markets to function on their own without too much of turmoil and to malt. And that's the big question. The B.O.E seems to be thinking that the markets can function on their own, but it's a gamble. It is a gamble. I suppose on the upside, or if you're taking a more positive view, then, you could point to the fact we got two days left. They could buy up to 20 billion pounds worth of guilt over those two days, perhaps. So you could see pension funds and maybe they've been resistant to sort of crystallise those transactions up to this point. So we could see them doing that over the next couple of days. And then the Bank of England says, look, there is another scheme in place until November the 11th, where you can post other collateral with the B.O.E in exchange for cash. So is there any sense that that infrastructure could do enough? Well, they extended the repo operations, which is already going to go on beyond October 14th. And that's going to go definitely into November 3rd. So that that liquidity backstop is available to the markets. But is that going to be sufficient? The key to answering that question is, a lot of these asset managers have leveraged swap exposure. And those swaps exposure is not something that the B.O.E can help it. And it is not clear at this point how much of swap exposure is left to be extinguished, so to speak. And on that will determine the reaction that we see in the markets. And unfortunately, there is no precise way of knowing how much that is just yet. Yes, I suppose if we could get a sense of just how much there still is to unwind and how much, as you say, leverage exposure there is, that could be useful. Let me ask you then about this idea, even major at HSBC, saying one thing that could happen, that could reduce the tension at the long end of the Gilt curve, is if the DMO changes its issuance profile, and says that we are going to issue more short term debt as opposed to issuing the long term gilts. And then that might reduce the amount of supply, at least, at the long end. Is that something that could have a materially enough impact? I suppose it goes back to your last response, though. It's too difficult to say. Well, I think at the market, it will definitely help the curve steepening that we have been seeing, because as we rebalance the supply and demand position, in any case, the front end is where we haven't seen much stress, apart from what the markets are expecting and fracturing in, we are how much the bank of England will have to raise rates. And there is a lot of price in, and there is more to be priced in, because the markets are pricing in a terminal rate of 5570, almost, for the BUE. So there is a lot more that the front end can absorb. And therefore, marginally, I do think that that measure is bound to help the markets. Then, thank you very much. Very nice to speak to you. Good to get your insights. Bloomberg Market Lives, then Ram, joining us with the latest on the UK, as we continue to watch how we build up to the deadline and how that goes over Friday the weekend and in some months. Now, coming up on the programme, Hedgefon Manager, Burs Weinstein, sees a number of market worries to linger for quarters, maybe even years to come. Here more from in next. This is Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2392,2022-10-13 06:43:15
14167," From manager Beres Weinstein, it sees a number of market worries to linger for quarters, maybe even years to come. Here more from him next, this is Blaineberg. Why is everybody want to be a consultant? And what are all these consultants doing? Well David, I think that we actually defy the label consultant, because sometimes consultants seem to imply that we only give advice. And when you look at what Accenture does, we're really different than the traditional version of a consultant. We're really about relevance and results, and that's what is driving our business. What about a consulting project? In my example, I'm the CEO, I have a problem, I call you up, I say, solve my problem or give me a solution. We don't operate as big companies permanently in crisis mode. And so when you think about, like, how long does it solve things? A lot of it starts with the company being willing to set aggressive goals. And so what we are trying to do now is work with our clients to work differently and to work faster. Everything you need to get set for the start of U.S. trading, Blaineberg, the open with Jonathan Terrell, filling down in the numbers and preparing you as only Blaineberg can. Weekdays on Blaineberg. Why do the biggest names in business choose Blaineberg? I had to do the great questions. It's a great question. Great question. And pest question I get all night. Blaineberg, top experts, great questions. It's pretty amazing, by the way. Obviously not to discount that there's lots of risks in the world. We've never seen this kind of volatility up and down. And all of us here, the ups and downs, interday. There's a hunger. There's a risk appetite. We're pinching ourselves a little bit that, you know, where yields are today, you know, globally. Equity is in credit and more bottoms up way. It's a journey we've been on. And you can expect us to keep mining that direction. I think we're all looking around saying, wow, right now we can get, you know, what was six and a half percent on the triple C index a year ago is now the yield on the investment grade index. We're doing more trading because there's more opportunity caused by this volatility. So fairly contented voices there. Some of them at least guess speaking at the Blaineberg Invest Conference in New York on the opportunities in the current market and the level of volatility that we're seeing. Some of a capital management founder, Boa's Weinstein, says the uncertainty that's currently gripping markets could endure for a long period. The hedge fund manager spoke to Blaineberg in an exclusive interview at the Blaineberg Invest event. I'm used to and we're all used to sell-offs that are fairly quick that we know even oh eight was five or six months from Lehman to the lows of March 09 where at the end of it, you can kind of wonder is there an all clear sign we have the Fed behind us quantitative using. Now we don't really know who the savior is because at the end of all of this we're still going to have quantitative tightening and shrinking the balance sheet. And so whereas a lot of sell-offs were just a prelude to a to a bull market one or six months later, you know this has the feeling to me like we're going to be worried about some number of these things or new things for potentially quarters and maybe even years to come. So no capitulation yet, no flush which gives us that all clear signal. How much of that is based on truly not knowing what the Fed's going to do or is it we don't know which potential problem is real and which is fake news. Well these things are.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2393,2022-10-13 06:47:23
14168," and which is fake news. These things are so hard to predict. I even want to be cautious about, you know, opining too much because it's just such a confusing market. And there hasn't been a single thing to say, okay, this is why the market, why 20% is not enough. It should be 40. Let's take inflation. If you look at, it's forward inflation, it's expected to come down a lot. So you could look at tomorrow's CPI print if it comes in a 10th or below or high and get excited about it. But the market is still telling you inflation is not going to be the problem that it is one year from now. Now, if a few months from now, that conviction is shaken, then we're going to have a real strong sell-off. If somehow Russia, having forbid, becomes more asymmetric, we're going to have a real problem. And so we just don't know. We're in a fog and we should not rely on the lessons that people learned maybe incorrectly for this environment that were good between 2008 and 2022, which was the Fed is your put. Don't fight the Fed. And dips should all be bought. And being sure it is fighting the Fed, this really does not feel like that environment, in particular, because of where the central banks are versus them. The startup capital management fans are bow as whicing with some wise words about maybe needing to go back to pre-2008 for some guidance in these months. Let's think about the US inflation data that is due today. It's said to show that core inflation has returned to a four-decade high, underscoring the broad and elevated price pressures confronting the Federal Reserve. Our market said it's a Valerie Tysel is here to discuss why today might all be about the stickiest components of inflation. And that is rental prices. Good morning to you, Valerie. What do we need to watch for? Good morning, Anna. I want to talk a little bit about the core CPI and specifically the rental component. Now, why are we focused on core CPI? Well, the recent Fed speak has reiterated over and over again that they are not going to stop until they are sure that core CPI has turned a quarter and is heading lower. Now, rent, the rent contribution to core CPI is nearly 40%. That's huge. And the thing about the rent component is it's the stickiest of them all, meaning we have yet to see a top yet. And we know once it does, it's probably going to hang out there for four quarters. Now, to add on to this debate, the other worrying thing about this is the validity of the data. I have a graphic here to show you next. There's been questions whether the official metric of rental inflation that the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses, whether it's overstating or understating rental prices. We know that we have private, other private metrics that estimate rental inflation. I have that here in orange. This is the core logic estimate of rental price inflation, which is the base of which they measure is specifically new rents. Now, the one that the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses is a mix of continual rents and new. But it's clear that we've seen a tick down in new rentals. The question is, how sticky is this new rental inflation going to be? And the BLS was so concerned about this debate over the validity of its data that it released a working paper on this to show that they can back out these private measures from the official statistics. And if that's true, we could see another four quarters of strong rental prints before any any corner is turned. Now, the FOMC member Williams quoted recently that inflation is like an onion. The first layer is commodities. Then it goes into goods. And at the center of the onion is core services. So let's hope this rental inflation print today doesn't make anyone cry. Okay, nice. We like the onion messed up for. And all its lay. As Valerie, thank you very much. Valerie Taitel with the latest on inflation. We'll all be watching then for that. For the core print, of course. But within that, the various components, including rental. Let's get a blue-backed first-world news update. Alice Hattens is here with the details, Alice. Hi, Anna. Russian President Vladimir Putin says any energy infrastructure in the world is at risk after the explosions on the Nord Stream gas pipelines. Speaking of the Moscow energy forum, he blamed the damage on the US, Ukraine and Poland, calling them beneficiaries of the blasts.

14169," The damage on the US, Ukraine and Poland, calling them beneficiaries of the blasts. Various reports have supported the sudden leaks for an act of sabotage. The head of the IMS says Ukraine will need at least $3 billion a month next year to finance its wartime economy, which means allies will have to give more support. At a meeting in Washington, Kristalina Georgieva also warned developments in the war could push financing these even higher. The US is considering a total ban on Russian aluminium in response to the military escalation in Ukraine. Bloomberg has learned that the Biden administration is weighing a number of options, including an outright ban or a large increase in tariffs. Russia is second only to China as a producer of aluminium, which is crucial to most heavy industries. Hong Kong is said to be considering easing property taxes and visa restrictions as authorities seek to curb the pandemic brain drain of recent years. Bloomberg has learned that chief executive John Lee could include the measures in his maiden policy address later this month. Hong Kong's strict pandemic measures have seen it lose ground to Singapore as an international financial hub. Bloomberg will use 20-philes a day on air and on a quick take by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. This is Bloomberg. Coming up on the programme will get a look at your stocks to watch, including chip makers. China's military power has been growing at an incredible speed over the last 20 years. A strong country must have a strong military, as only then can it guarantee the security of the nation. In terms of sphere of influence, we absolutely know that China wants to be dominant in Asia, so there is a target to get to that point to be a military that is appear to the greatest militaries in the world by 2035. The competition for influence is a global one, and through a multi-decade trajectory fueled by planning, money, and pragmatism, China is building a military that allows it to shape the 21st century just as the US shaped the 20th. Welcome back to Bloomberg, Markies Europe. Six or so minutes until the start of cash-eck what he is trading and the future's picture looks negative, not hugely so, but a little bit, and US futures though look pretty flat right now. Let's find some inspiration in the stock specifics, shall we? Let's get to our stocks to watch segment with Danny Berger, who is with us this morning. I said stock specific, sector specific to start with, and then we'll get into the stocks. Let's talk about chip makers. This one's pretty complicated, I must say. Overall, the sentiment's been pretty negative for chip makers, but starting with the most recent.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2395,2022-10-13 06:55:53
14170," you can set to specific we're getting to the stokes yeah, let's do that chip this one's pretty compl overall the sentiment's pretty negative for chip with the most recent thing we got TSMC a little over an hour ago even that was a little bit mixed. We had record margins that was really strong but at the same time they're slashing capex so mixed message there. We also heard from applied materials in the U.S. yesterday that was more and we had a sml according to the U.S. and the U.S. and it was a little bit more than we were able to obtain by Bloomberg. They are telling their U.S. employees not to ship out to China. This all having to do with the Biden administrations curb. So a lot of cross currents here. Okay, a lot of cross currents there. We'll watch out for what happens. What about easy jet getting to one of the stocks very much in focus today. Then we've had an update from them. Yeah, difficult summer. So they're full fiscal year booking a loss that was expected 170 million pounds to 190 million pounds. So we're going to be going to be able to get back to the U.S. And we're going to be able to get back to the U.S. here. Those that they've increased capacity by about 30, 30% which equates to about 200 million seats compared to this time last year. So that's improving. They also said that they're very confident their business model can sustain themselves through this time of economic turmoil. Okay, and then capital in focus for the Italian banking sector. Yeah, Monte de Pasque, specifically they're doing a new capital raise. This was expected, but they're really fmenting that saying that they're going to go ahead and they're going to be able to get back to the U.S. Of course, of course, as a dilute of effects, we typically see shares decline. This all in the service of restructuring the company and getting the funds to do so. Okay, Danny. Thanks very much for the briefing. Danny Berger with the stocks to watch this morning coming up. Of course, the market open futures. As I've been saying, I've been pointing a little bit weaker. The U.S. futures have recovered a little bit of their earlier losses look fairly flat right now. We're the slight upward bias, but not much. We are waiting, of course, for the CPI print. Will we get any sense that things have peaked? Will we get any change of course when it comes to our assumptions around core inflation? That really seems to be in focus. We spoke to inflation insights earlier on they were saying watch for whether we get 0.3 or 0.4. That will actually matter quite a lot. This is better. In the beginning, we're trying to get a sense of what we're doing. We're trying to get a sense of what we're doing. How much are we going to push everything from the Kishirah government in terms of grain funding? The Kishir administration has committed to doubling the amount of investments in so-called green technologies. I think we need more than just pronouncements. than just pronouncements. We need real money backing, very innovative startups and innovative companies in this space. What do you make of Kishita's new capitalism? Well, I think he is framework is reflective of the challenges that Japan society is facing, namely that growth has been present, but growth has not been of course evenly distributed. But frankly speaking, it's hard to redistribute income if you don't have much income to begin with, if the government and private sector can work together and collaborate to drive more innovative growth startups that can really drive the income growth that the Kishita government needs to redistribute.

Welcome to the European market open everyone a minute to go until they start a cash equity trading in front of the market in London with Tom McKenzie. Here are your top stories. Blame game UK Chancellor Quasicua tongue says the BOE will be responsible if markets tank after its bond buying program ends. All eyes on CPI, Asian stocks and treasuries decline before today's critical US inflation print Fed minutes show a commitment to restrictive rate hikes. Plus as OPEC trims its demand outlook, US officials fear their Russian oil price cap plan may fail Putin warns all global energy infrastructure is at risk. So Tom let's look at the futures for the moment to pressure on the FTSE 100 futures down to 10 to 8 percent. The DAX futures are also down to 4 to 10 to 8 percent. If you look at currencies there's fluctuating of course a lot of caution the markets all about CPI data especially after you know we had minutes and they kind of confused Wall Street there was a missile initially surging and then down on Fed expectations. Yep committing to further rate hikes but also saying that maybe there is coming a point at some point in the future where you have to recalibrate or at least calibrate those rate hikes and as you say that did give some support to those markets but at the end of the day you had six straight days now of losses at stateside here in Europe a similar picture as well and again as France was saying futures pointing lower current the FTSE are opening down to 10 of a percent so Bailey being thrown arguably under the bus by the Chancellor of the Exchequer of course the Spank of England stepped in in a big way yesterday in the guilt markets buying up the most since that program started on September the 28th over four billion pounds worth of bonds and guilt purchase by the B.O.E. questions of course continuing as to whether or not they really can close out this program on Friday. Over in Spain the AIBX is down by four tenths of a percent the CACC on was off by 24 points. Let's look at the cross assets again on the losses that we saw yesterday stateside futures pointing currently unchanged on the S&P futures still of course that weight and sea approach to some extent it could be a make or break moment for these markets as you look ahead to that all important CPI print the top line the expectations from our survey is 8.1% down from 8.3%. The pound currently at 110 down three tenths of a percent further pressure on sterling the US two years currently 431 that's a move higher by almost three basis points and Brent at ninety two dollars a barrel largely untranged again as the headlines said the Biden administration is concerned about that plan for a cap price cap on Russian oil. We're going to have a quick look at guilt as well given the importance of what happened yesterday what's continued to happen really since that mini budget in the government continuing to insist that is global events rather than their mini budget that is affecting what is happening in the guilt markets despite all the evidence to the contrary here with the 30 year 483 not a lot of change there the 10 year at 444 again not much movement but you are seeing a bit of a bid for the front end the 5 year 447 that's lower by eight basis points and the two year just currently holding at 4%. There's been a lot of volatility of course in this guilt market so we will continue to check in across the hour on guilt's fancy. Yeah we're also looking into some of the sectors that are on the move now out of the 19 groups that make up the stock 600 only to our game only one is gaining we only have energy getting some 3 tenths of 8% everything else is in the red we also get that I.A. report on oil consumption and oil demand across the world that's in one hour from now technology done 1.3% the biggest loser with real estate and utilities a close second. Okay let's get back to what is happening.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2397,2022-10-13 07:04:47
14172," with the real estate and utilities a close second. OK, let's get back to what is happening here in the UK. Chancellor Quiett, Quiett, says the Bank of England would be responsible for any market volatility after its bond buying programme ends tomorrow. Meanwhile, the Institute for Physical Studies has said the government may need to find 60 billion pounds to shore up confidence over the week economists and bankers have given their take on what is happening within the B.O.E. and what is next for the UK's economy. We've announced that we will be out by the end of this week. You've got three days left now, you've got to get this done. The Bank of England can talk tough, but fundamentally they're just going to have to extend this. They are trying to hold things together as best they can. The confusion, I think, comes between the financial side of the Bank of England and the monetary side of the Bank of England, which are now trying to do different things. Monetary and fiscal policy being at crossroads, with cross purposes with each other. That's a very dangerous cocktail for bond markets. It's been trying to maintain price stability and at the same time address financial stability issues with this other instrument. This is not yet looking to me like a very steep and deep recession. I don't think we're at risk of a financial crisis. I worry that this is not enough, and I think they're going to have to come up with their version of whatever it takes. By this time next year, the Bank of England will probably be causing interest rates. To dive deeper into this, Lizzie, I'm getting quite a lot of emails actually from viewers saying they feel like the game is really dangerous now. Here in the UK, especially the blame game between the Bank of England. And of course, Treasury. We've also had the Business Secretary Jacob Rees mark taking a swipe at the fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, saying that, quote, it's recorded forecasting accurately, hasn't been enormously good. So it comes back to the former B.O.E. Governor Mark Carney's warning that this government is undermining the credibility of the UK's economic institutions. Quasi Quartan is saying that it's going to be Bayley's fault if the market turmoil continues, if he sticks to his promise that the emergency bond buying programme will end tomorrow. But really, it means that Bayley's got to either sacrifice his credibility to continue the programme, or he won't be able to fight inflation. You know, these two programmes mean that he's got his foot on the brake and on the accelerator at the same time, and he looks beholden to fiscal policy. And you have to ask, how much would Bayley sacrificing his credibility on financial stability affect his ability to convince markets that his monetary policy is going to have a good effect? Yeah, credibility in question for both B.O.E. and the government at this point. Then let's bring you in then to kind of unpack the mechanics of what's happening within the financial system here in the UK, saying globally as a result of this standoff in the route that we're seeing, at least the volatility that we're seeing across the guilt markets. You've got everything from the pension fund crisis, of course, to CLOs and questions about cell offs there, and more broadly shadow banking concerns. Where do you focus in terms of the next stress points, the next areas of the financial system that could be under pressure, that could crack? Morning, Tom. On an immediate basis, what I'm mostly looking at is the long-dated guilt segment, particularly the 30-year, which is more liquid, and that segment is going to tell us how this is going to play out once the B.O.E. is backstop ends. If we see 30-year reels surging to anywhere near 525-550 levels, and it's not just the level that matters, it's the pace of which the E.E. is rise. If we see a big move like what we saw before the B.O.E. came into the market, I.E. say, 100 basis points in three in the matter of three-four days, it's like the B.O.E. has to step in. They do not have a choice at that point, and the B.O.E. is best hope is that it won't happen. And then comes the question of what happens to the broader markets, what happens to the pound and other risk assets. But then, first of all, can anything happen right now in the world of UK policymaking? And is there a chance because of how many actually a bond they bought yesterday that the Bank of England will get it done in time by this Friday? It's the best hope that the asset managers will have squared up their positions, but the annual leverage and won't need it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2398,2022-10-13 07:09:18
14173," It's the best hope that asset managers will have squared up their positions, will have that annual leverage and won't need extensive collateral. But that is the best hope. There are two ways this can play out of the Monday. The best hope is for the BUE to think that the markets calm down. They've done enough of the backstrap and the markets go back to somewhat something that resembles normal functioning. The second scenario is the more like marriage one where the markets are in tumult all over again and the bank of England is forced to step in one way or the other whether it is through this backstrap that we have seen or through something else that is called differently but essentially does the same thing. Well, maybe what leads to that first scenario is a U-turn on these fiscal policies and these tax cuts by the Liz Trusts government. So I'll put that to you, Lizzy. What are the odds of that? What are you hearing from your sources and Westminster and on the question of the bank of England governor? What are his options at this point? Well, on the fiscal side, Liz Trusts said openly at Prime Minister's questions yesterday she's not going to cut spending. So privately, her MPs are saying that it looks inevitable that she's going to have to reverse some of the other tax cuts. Openly, the Treasury Select Committee Chairman Mel Stride said that she'll have to do some rowing back. And in terms of Andrew Bailey's options, he could, as Ben says, stick with the gamble, hope that the market turmoil calms down. He could fold and continue the programme, which as I say will risk his credibility. He could stop quantitative tightening or pause it, which means that he can't fight inflation. Or perhaps there is a creative solution to be had in tandem with the debt management office, which is part of the Treasury, where they raised short dated money to ease pressure on longer term debt. Now, that's not really been announced yet, but that's what we could potentially hear about tomorrow. Ultimately, the irony is that the bank of England was so criticised for not doing its job to fight inflation. And then Liz Trusts said that the BOE's independence is sacrosanct. And now her policies mean that, as I say, it's beholden to fiscal policy and it can't fight inflation because it's having to fight this fire. Which means there's all this uncertainty. There's the clock ticks down, too, of course, those fiscal plans being outlined by the chancellor at the end of the month, and then, of course, the OBR, and then, of course, the bank of England decision on the November 3rd. So much to work through. Good luck with the markets, until then. Absolutely. Holding onto your hats across these markets, not a little movement currently across Guiltz, but we'll keep in to check in on the Guiltz markets, of course, for you. And the pound currently at 1.10, that's off by 3.10, of 8%. Lizzie Burton and Ben Ram. Thank you very much indeed. Now, Miles Bradshaw, head of Global Aggregate Bonds at JP Morgan Asset Management, joins us for his reaction to all of this. Miles, do you see the BOE good morning? Do you see the BOE having to continue its intervention beyond tomorrow? Good morning. The short answer is, I think, yeah, probably. I think the more complicated question is to separate out the short-term pressures of market volatility from the longer-term dynamics. And the big picture is that because of the tax cuts, the UK now needs to issue a lot more debt. And therefore, the yields on debt need to be higher to attract a new buyer. But we're all very focused on the accelerator, which is the volatility has created a leveraging pressure amongst LDI accounts, and that's created risks about financial stability, and that's brought the Bank of England to the market. Now, I struggle to see how the Bank of England stepping back in a couple of days' time is not going to put more pressure. It's going to remove a key buyer. It's not going to put more pressure on the market, and we're not going to see the great volatility that will in turn require another policy response from the Bank. It may, doesn't have to take exactly the same form, but it seems likely they will have to do something to help stabilize the market until you get some confirmation about the extent of the fiscal U-turn from the government. But, Miles, there are two issues, right? One is, I guess, a credibility of both institutions as there's a clear blame going on between the Bank of England and Treasury. First, how dangerous is this game? Does it actually push away the credibility for all UK institutions? And how long does it take to get investors back? And the second, I think, is Tom, saying, on a more technical, what happens next?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2399,2022-10-13 07:13:45
14174," And the second I think is, you know, as Tom was saying, on a more technical, what happens next? Yeah, I think it is a very dangerous game. I mean, these are both the fiscal and the monetary agent that are actually almost having a public spat about who's responsible for volatility in the largest market in the UK debt market, which is the guilt market. It doesn't give investors confidence about how it's going to be resolved. And it appears that each one is trying to put pressure on the other one to actually pull a rabbit out of the hat and to enact some kind of euthan. So I think it is a dangerous game. I think the genie has sort of come out of the bottle of it. We saw with the Institute of Fiscal Studies that the savings that they need to make the UK government is in the order of 60 billion. The tax cuts are 45 billion. So what's happened is higher interest rates, slower economic growth has created a fiscal hole in itself. So somehow the government now has got itself in a position that a simple euthan isn't enough to put themselves back to where they started. And that reflects issues about credibility of economic management. So it is more complicated. And then the last thing is about, tactically, how does the Bank of England manage this process? And I would say they haven't really been doing a good job. You know, yesterday we saw the largest purchase we've had in their program to date. It's happened just a few days before they said the program's going to end. Yesterday we had, news the program was going to end and there was a story that it wouldn't end. So we don't even know what the objective of the Bank of England is in terms of what are they trying to achieve. Is it trying to reduce volatility? In which case they should be outlining more clearly what they consider volatility and what they consider acceptable volatility? Is it about fighting liquidity in the repo market? And that's what their repo facility they announced earlier this week was about. There is a lack of clarity and that then means that the market struggles to understand what the policy objective is and there's less signal. Yeah, there's less of a signal. Miles, thank you so much Miles Bradshaw, the head of global aggregate bonds at Jake Morgan asset management stays with us. Now, up next we also look ahead to today's key data, US, CPI, that's what the market will move on the back of. Had a bit of a blip yesterday after the minutes from the Fed. This is Bloomberg.

We have made a series of to hold investments. I'll be have our clients, both in some of the currency baskets as well as with some venture firms that are investing primarily in the crypto area.

14175," We're very clear risk and we were talking to Mars about these in the break, Christine. One of them, of course, being the strength of the US dollar. I just wonder how you are thinking about the greenback in light of the minutes that we got from the feds. And some comments that led to a little bit of optimism, at least immediately on the back of the publication, around the way that maybe there's going to be some calibration, maybe December is the month we look at where you start to see a bit of an adjustment. Yeah, the minutes were very interesting, Tom, because I think it contained the new ones that we didn't necessarily have over the summer. And that is a recognition of the global risks that a fed policy poses. And the fed, of course, insists that they are setting policy for the US economy and the US economy alone. But of course, they can't be blind to the fact that it is the most important center bank in the world. And it will have reverberations, whatever it is that they do across the global economy. Now over the summer, of course, the fed were suspiciously silent about the strength of the US dollar, because this is not just a story for now. This has been a story for all of this year. And even companies in the US were complaining, had started complaining in the summer about the strength of the US dollar. We didn't really hear from either the fed or the US treasury then. But I think now into the autumn, and we're starting to see kind of the global economy really deteriorating a step further, the fed starting to recognize those risks. And potentially something with the calibration comes a little bit of a ceiling for the US dollar as a result. At the same time, Christine, is this like a warning shot for other countries? I mean, we've been asking that question for last three weeks, and it feels like now there's the ripple effect right of UK into elsewhere. Absolutely, Francine. I mean, we've been seeing, right, in real time, just how much to sell off in gills to sell off in a pound has reverberated across global markets. Certainly something that other economies are watching, one as an example of how not to do fiscal monetary policy, but also too, as an example of how a sudden and rapid or sudden and large decline in bond markets really can just spread those risks around. I mean, in the UK, what we're seeing now is kind of a spreading of the sell off from the bond market into other assets. As these pension funds still struggle to kind of come up with a cash for their collateral calls, and that's something I think that the world is watching very nervously because there is a lot of potential for a ripple effect in the systemic shock here. Okay, Mars, let's see if we can end this on something of a positive or optimistic note. Where are you finding value in these bond markets at this point, Mars? Well, I think the optimistic note is the thing about bonds is that as prices go down, yields go up, and that means valuations become more attractive. So that I think is the silver lining is that we're getting the value as a private investor who's investing for economic reasons. You're looking at better value in bond markets, and that makes things attractive. I think right here, right now, in terms of the global bond market, to me, it's the Chinese bond market that represents the best value because the economic outlook in China is very different than it is in the US and Europe. And in terms of the European bond allocations, we have been underweb duration for most of this year. We're reducing the size of those positions because value is coming in. Real yields are approaching at the very front end levels of 2007 in the US. And the Fed rate hike path is beginning to slow. That's our expectation, and it will be restrictive. So I think that's the silver lining. Higher yields is actually creating value for investors. Okay. Thank you very much. Indeed, Mars branched your head of global aggregate bonds at JP Morgan asset management. There's potentially some opportunities there, local rates in China amid everything that's going on across these bond markets. Of course, Christine Aquino as well, walking us through some of the key market themes. Coming up, the blame game, that's having ripple effects, of course. As we mentioned across the global bond markets, we're going to stick with a stand-off then between the Bank of England and the UK government.

14176," Heartreatening of Noise Heart-蒸 Bloods internal起rop So Why does everybody want to be a consultant? And what are all these consultants doing? Well, David, I think that we actually defy the label consultant because sometimes consultants seems to imply that we only give advice. And when you look at what Accenture does, we're really different than the traditional version of a consultant. We're really about relevance and results. And that's what is driving our business. What about a consulting project? In my example, on the CEO, I have a problem. I call you up. I say, solve my problem or give me a solution. We don't operate as big companies permanently in crisis mode. And so when you think about how long does it solve things, a lot of it starts with, you know, the company being willing to set aggressive goals. And so what we are trying to do now is work with our clients to work differently and to work faster. You've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. They have. I've been in and seen it. Lots of Bloomberg.

ASMR has ordered its US staff to stop servicing customers in China after the Biden administration announced tighter restrictions. The Dutch chip manufacturing equipment maker told its employees in America about the rule changes in an email. ASMR has held back from selling some of its most advanced technology to China as it tries to strike a balance between the two nations. The US is considering a total ban on Russian aluminium in response to the military escalation in Ukraine. Bloomberg's land at the Biden administration is weighing a number of options including an outright ban or a large increase in tariffs. Russia is second only to China as a producer of aluminium, which is crucial to most heavy industries. That's your Bloomberg business flash, Tom Francine.

14177," Natur knot Apple has identified its next big business bringing advertisements to more parts of your iPhone. Today, Apple pushes ads in three places, the App Store, Apple News, and the Stocks App. In the news and Stocks apps, Apple shows display advertisements. That means that third-party companies like Cartier-Lewships or Mortgage Lenders can showcase their advertisements just like they can on a website. On the App Store, the situation is different. There, Apple has search ads. This allows developers to, by their way, disjowing a pie on search results. For instance, an App Store developer can bid for the term car racing or basketball so their apps will surface above competing apps in the list of results. Apple's push into ads is a little ironic, given that its ATT or app tracking transparency privacy feature limits the ability for meta, snack, and even smaller developers to generate as much revenue as possible for advertising. That's because the feature allows users to choose if they want their data collected and tracked across third-party apps and websites. Still, Apple's hoping to expand its own ads business and is planning to add search ads to its Maps app. Other areas where ads could eventually appear are in Apple Books and Apple podcasts, along maybe one day with an ad supported tier of Apple TV Plus to compete with new offerings from Netflix and other streaming video providers.

Blame game, UK Chancellor Quasi Quartanks says the BLE will be responsible if markets tank after its bond-bind program ends.

Plus, as OPEC trims its demand outlook, US officials fear their Russian oil price cap plan may fail, Putin warns all global energy infrastructure is at risk. If you look at markets, they want to know what's happening with US CPI after that Minutes were a little bit confusing.

14178, Of a percent the Daxle and Germany just cleaning on to some very slim gains here in the UK the first of 100 down by 28 points off by 4 tenths of a percent of course as the word of war of words at least between the BOE and the chancellor continues the last time I checked the guilt markets there was a little bit move on the towards the back end of yields lower but of course it's been incredibly volatile with that stepping by the BOE yesterday towards the end of the day of £4.4 billion of purchases the biggest intervention since that program was starting of course the questions remain as to whether or not they can really pull out come Friday in terms of the sectors that are green this morning early study minutes and Thursdays and traveling leisure at the top of the list is getting 9 tenths percent and autos as well also in positive territory up 7 tenths 8 tenths of percent most of the sectors though in the red a bit of a holding position again ahead of that all important inflation data let's return then to our top story the standoff yes between the Bank of England and the UK chancellor at Bloomberg's Tom Metcalfe is here Tom what are you expecting today then from the markets it hasn't been a whole load of movement in the guilt so far but we know just how volatile these sessions can be yeah exactly it's a bit calmer today which I'm quite thankful for actually and I think standoff is probably the right word and I'll actually sort of construe it as a three-way standoff you've got obviously the government of the treasury on one side the Bank of England but then also the markets you know which obviously played the biggest role in deciding what happened so you know I think a lot of the attention is probably going to be towards how big this auction is later this afternoon yesterday had a decent size about four five billion pounds and maybe if they really go close to that ten billion pound limit that will continue to calm the markets but obviously as this big cliff edge coming at the end of Friday so you know this is in no way ended so Tom how does this pension crisis actually tap into these wider fears about shadow banking yeah we were looking at this because you know obviously this guilt crisis is is capturing the headlines but what what is also doing is is showing that hey there is this huge problem that regulators have been sort of worried about for years and this is really kind of sharpening those fears about it so this is you know the system which isn't regulated banks which most people feel are going to be well sort of capitalized to handle anything but it's more the situations you don't expect precisely like this LDI strategy which is going to cause the problems and you know those are mounting up across the board so you know whatever happens with the pensions crisis I think there's going to be a lot more sort of shoes to drop yeah the ripple effects I know Tom you and the team have been charting this whether it's the potential sell-off in collateralized loan obligations the global implications of all this so what what are you watching for next yeah I guess looking for the so you know the early warning signs right and you know a couple of areas obviously housing it's such a you know beating the room but I'd also actually say car loans as well as what is one area we're just kind of keeping an eye on and seeing if they'll sort of flag up early signs of distress that and you're dead right it's not just about the UK this is a global story it's just happening to sort of take shape in the UK for now Tom thank you so much Tom at Caps there in charge of all things financial at Bloomberg now our next guest says trading on the guilt market will continue to be bumpy the UK is not an exception when it comes to liquidity risk now alliance chief economist Ludwig Schubran joins us Ludwig thank you so much for joining us I know that this could be a global concern but this feels like it was sparked by something very very UK centric which was this mini budget and now the blame game between the Bank of England Treasury is not helping do you think it is that's peculiar to the UK the impression everybody is doing a mini budget as we speak you know my own country you know the country where we're Germany we're announcing billions and billions to do whatever it takes again against the energy crisis without it been trying to target the support because we think that throwing money at the problem is going to help right so I would say that I'm a bit more worried about something of collateral winter of a collateral squeeze winter so these liquidity risks are everywhere you know the IMF and the well-back annual meetings I would be very worried about some emerging markets we're also looking at some specific you know asset classes so I think the UK is a bit of a textbook of what not to do but unfortunately I think a lot of central banks for example are watching as the BOE does you know one communication error after another to not try to do them but they can have similar issues you know how do you continue to hike when recession is already there how do you make sure that you don't create financial stability risk when the dollar,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2404,2022-10-13 07:38:01
14179," to do that. But they're going to have similar issues. How do you continue to hike when recession is already there? How do you make sure that you don't create financial stability risk when the dollar, liquidity is drying up like never before? This is unfortunately the problems that most policymakers are facing in more countries than the UK. So Ludovic, we brace for more volatility than in the Eurozone, presumably. I mean, how much of this kind of risk is priced into the markets at this point? I don't know. I can tell you that the 30 year Greek bond is more interesting than the 30 year UK bond. That tells you a little bit about the base that we've been having for quite some time on Brexit or Brexit. So I think the real issue here is I think no liquidity risk is ever priced. And what has happened, for example, to the guilt market, the melt down is exactly a case in point. So the big question is, where should we be more worried? I'm worried, for example, in the emerging market, Eastern European markets, some African markets, Latin American market, and in the Eurozone, I'm more worried about corporates. I think this recession, this manufacturing and trade recession is a triaging one. Governments are trying to do a form of whatever it takes. But can it really help companies that will have very little energy that have a very high labor bill and that are very indebted in the transport in the retail sectors. I'm more worried about the corporate sector. But again, the sovereign bond market is also something to watch if the ECB makes mistakes. But they're watching very carefully what the bank of India is doing just to not do, not communicate the way they did. That's for sure. Is there a danger that actually we go back to the kind of crisis that we had in 2008? I know there's a lot of concerns here in the UK about shadow banking. I know that every time there's a sharp rise in interest rates, we're definitely getting at the moment, especially after that 10 years of low interest rates, you have to look at the people that are leveraged where the leverage is comfortable at 1%, but not at 6%. This is interesting, because I think everybody is focusing on regulated institutions. But as you know, we have a lot of non-banks, we have a lot of by-now pay-later institutions. In Aliens, we have a company called Aliens Trade that has this working capital financing, type of insurance. To be fair, we are also worried about another type of liquidity, which is liquidity to the firm. When you look at the cost of inflation so far, it's been eroding a third of the cash and balance sheet of households. Most of the households have actually started to increase debt again. So debt on a bid is extremely high. It's actually at record level in most European countries. This is not only related directly to the banking sector, but it's also related to the way they manage their working capital, their treasury, and more generally, the type of B2B lending practices that they've had. Of course, we concerned about this, because we don't have a full picture of this type of leverage. What are you seeing in terms of corporate defaults? We know that balance sheets have been healthy, or are healthy because a lot of these corporates have been loading up on cheap debt over recent years. But that stress is now there. Are you seeing a tick up in defaults? Yes. To be fair, we see at least an increase of... So it depends what you talk about defaults. But in the real economy, for example, bankruptcies, we see already bankruptcies increase. It started in Spain, in Europe, and then in the UK very clearly. And now it's reaching Italy and then France and Germany. So in 23, we think there is a real normalization of the number of bankruptcies. And so this is because a lot of the grace periods on some of the payments, for example, for social security in France that were granted to companies, is coming to an end. So there is still a lot of measures, and the German government just announced a bazooka measure to corporates. But to start an example, that help when your auto books are already plummeted because you have a demand-driven recession. And basically, you still have very expensive costs of supplies and cost of functioning. So I think we're going to see a normalization of default. And then on the market, I think I'm concerned about fallen angels and concerned about all of these corporate that were close to high yield. And to turn these still benefit from relatively benign spreads when everything in the summer in Bonn market is going to shambles. So I'm a bit concerned yet that at one point, there is a reality check on the real status.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2405,2022-10-13 07:42:17
14180," that everything in the summer in bond market is going to shambles. So I'm a bit concerned, yeah, that one point there is a reality check on the real status financial positioning of these companies. But the good news is that most of them, I would say, have stronger balance sheet because they still have some cash, but some of them are extremely worried, yes. But how much are you looking at markets now? I know you're an economist and one of the very best out there. But if there's a seizing of funding, how quickly does it transform into the real economy or into a crisis? You just mentioned before this segment, Transeme that the Fed is going to have to pause. I think it's going to be the same in the ECB. And I think what we see in the back of England with this form of Q, which is not Q, we know, but which is a form of intervention. We're going to see a lot of central banks being extremely worried about financial stability. So they may have actually slightly higher short term rates, but they're going to have maybe to do some form of intervention on the balance sheet on the longer term of the curve or maybe on some last classes like corporate. So we are entering a world, if it's war, war includes debt monetization, war includes some form of yield control. So I think central banks are going to be put to the test here in how they contain inflation pressures and anchor inflation expectations, why they enter financial stability and that includes through balance sheet moves. So you call it QE, you don't call it QE, it's a form of balance sheet intervention because the drying up is so fast. Always fantastic, always excellent. Ludovic, a superman, Aliens chief economist on the bankruptcy and default risks and the pressure on the central banks. Thank you. Coming up, we look ahead to today's key data.

A strong country must have a strong military, as only then can it guarantee the security of the nation.

The competition for influence is a global one, and through a multi-decade trajectory fueled by planning, money, and pragmatism, China is building a military that allows it to shape the 21st century just as the US shaped the 20th.

Yes because at the Bloomberg Invest Conference in New York on opportunities in the current market volatility checking in your market. So it's briefly European stocks the benchmark down three tenths of percent the future stateside pointing up by two tenths on the S&P E-Mini's plan. Now Tom Sabah capital management founder of Oswajne Stein says the uncertainty that's currently gripping markets could endure for a long period. Now the hedge fund manager spoke to Bloomberg's very here where it's holds an exclusive entry. I'm used to and we're all used to sell-offs that are fairly quick that we know even oh eight was five or six months from Lehman to the lows of March 09 where at the end of it you can kind of wonder is there an all clear sign we have the Fed behind us quantitative using now we don't really know who the savior is because at the end of all of this we're still going to have quantitative tightening and shrinking the balance sheet and so whereas a lot of sell-offs we're just a prelude to a to a bull market one or six months later you know this has the feeling to me like we're going to be worried about some number of these things or new things for potentially quarters and maybe even years to come. So no capitulation yet no flush which gives us that all clear signal how much of that is based on truly not knowing what the Fed's going to do or is it we don't know which potential problem is real and which is fake news. I thought these things are so hard to predict I even want to be cautious about you know opining too much because it's just such a confusing market and there hasn't been a single thing to say okay this is why the market why 20% is not enough it should be 40 let's take inflation if if you look at it it's forward inflation it's expected to come down a lot so you could look at tomorrow's CPI print if it comes in a 10th or below or high and get excited about it but the market is still telling you inflation is not going to be the problem that it is one year from now now if a few months from now that conviction is shaken then we're gonna have a real strong sell-off if somehow Russia haven't forbid becomes more asymmetric we're gonna have a real problem and so we just don't know we're in a fog and we should not rely on the lessons that people learned maybe incorrectly for this environment that we're good between 08 and 20 and 2022 which was the Fed is your put don't fight the Fed and dips should all be bought and being sure it is fighting the Fed you know this this really does not feel like that environment in particular because of where the central banks are versus then that will sub a capital management found out Boas Weinstein and let's get the blue bug first what news now with Alice Atkins Alice hi Tom the head of the IMF says Ukraine will need at least $3 billion a month next year to finance its wartime economy which means allies will have to give more support at the meeting in Washington crystalline a Georgieva also warned developments in the war could push financing needs even higher Russia's president Vladimir Putin says any energy infrastructure in the world is at risk after the explosions on the Nord Stream gas pipelines speaking at a Moscow energy forum he blamed the damage on the US Ukraine and Poland claim calling them beneficiaries of the blasts various reports have suggested the sudden leaks were an act of sabotage American conspiracy theorists Alex Jones has been ordered to pay almost a billion dollars in damages after repeatedly claiming the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting was a hoax the Connecticut trial was the second to hold Jones finance,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2407,2022-10-13 07:51:27

The Connecticut trial was the second to hold Jones financially accountable for his lies about the massacre. Global News 20 Brows a Day, on air and on Bloomberg Quick Take par by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. This is Bloomberg, Tom Francine. Thank you very much indeed. Coming up, trouble ahead for tech, the world's most valuable chip company. Slashes, it's 2022 capital spending target. We'll get the details. This is Bloomberg. I'm here at the Delhi Airport and behind me you can see 5 jets, 737 max aircraft. I'm here at the Delhi Airport and behind me you can see 5 jets, 737 max aircraft. The Pfizer Chairman, earlier today, that going is going to compensate 5 jets in form of cash and aircraft. There's a big celebration happening at the Goliere Airport. As you can see, they've literally rolled down the red carpet for Pfizer Chairman, they're saying there are balloons, there are flowers. This is a big deal for 5 jets because it is the only Indian operator of Boeing 77 max planes currently. Welcome back to the Open 52 minutes into your European trading day, it's down 410th of a percent market score waiting for that CPI print out of the US in terms of determining how aggressively this Fed has to go on inflation. I'm just briefly checking in on GILTS as well given the tumult in these markets and the end, at least a proposed end of the bond by the B.O.E. tomorrow, currently yields down at the long end, just between two basis points on the 10 year, lower by six basis points on the 30 year, but just slightly higher by two basis points at the front end on the 2-year current trading at 4.03. On all these market questions and themes, let's bring in Blue Bausy and Patrick Barnett. So, Jan, J.P., the B.O.E. in the Fed continue to dominate market sentiment, which for you is the most important factor in the session today? say for today it's definitely the CPI prints that we are looking for it's so highly anticipated and people are keen to see like what inflation path is.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2408,2022-10-13 07:55:45
14183," today. Well, I would say for today, it's definitely the CPI prints that we are looking for. It's so highly anticipated and then people are keen to see like where the inflation path is going. But of course, the BUE is also creating a mess here and is adding another layer of uncertainty into the market, which we really don't need at this point. And I find it very telling that Mr. Weinstein, a man with like decades of experience in the market early on the program said that this market is so hard to read with all the uncertainties going on and that's very telling when someone with that experience tells you that. Yeah, many people saying there's so many concerns coming from all sides that it could really end up being the perfect storm. JP chip makers continue to tumble. The industry appears to be bracing for a potential recession. Yes, and another storm we have there and that's also quite telling, giving the chips are part of our everyday lives these days and it tells you where the economy is probably heading and that that also tells you the big gap or the big step that the central banks have to have to do now. We all believe that they still will save that they when push comes to shove, but they need to make this thing happen to cool down the economy to middle that inflation come down, but at the same time not to kill the engine completely. And it's still very unclear to me if this pull off will work. Yet, the SMC cutting their plan expenditures by about $10 billion just as an indicator then of their concerns about demand growth, particularly for areas like smartphones. Swinging it back to the B.O.E.J.P. before we let you go, not a lot of validity at least at this point, 54 minutes into the trading session for GILTS. Do you expect these yields to be kept and this volatility to ease as we look ahead to the end of play tomorrow? Well, that's strongly depends on the wording that we are seeing next right now. I mean, it seems to be a bit of a talk of what between the political leadership and the monetary policy leadership so to speak. And the question is like who blinks first? It makes no sense to me to do this at this point in time. There are so much issues going around in the world so that the last thing we need is another blow up here. So I really hope that usually it's the central bank who is the wiser end that they do the right thing and help to calm down that market. JP, thank you so much. JP, a Barnett, they're undifferentiated with some of the markets. Now, some of our stories that are doing extremely well in the Bloomberg terminal, UK companies now facing some of the loan requests from their pension funds. Now, this is a story from our pension expert, Lucia Giftepolo, saying that they're now facing calls to provide some of the liquidity or some of the emergency loans to their employee pensions schemes. And again, this is where liquidity comes into play. We know we have a backstop from the Bank of England through some of the refinancing facilities, but tomorrow is really crunching? Yeah, that's quite a development, isn't it? When the corporate's been told to lend money to their own pension plans to tie them over, as we of course know that pension funds are readjusting and trying to get their house in order again, buy that deadline and the clock is ticking. If the BOE isn't eager to stick with this, of course, questions remain as to whether or not they will have to fold ultimately and continue that support. And other top stories, of course, include what is happening with CPI. And that expectation, just to remind viewers, 8.1% is the estimate then for the month of September after 8.3%. And we have a great, there's a great blog on the M-live around how the markets could do it adjust to either a 10 basis point, 20 basis point move, either side of that, just the expectations around the uncertainty when it comes to inflation, particularly the question of core and rents as well. Currently, your market's down to 3%, 10% US markets holding onto very slim gains at this point, Francine, 2%, 10% for the S&P eminies. That's it for the European market open surveillance. Early edition is up next. We also have a great interview with the Moderna Chairman. So we'll talk about vaccine, some of the bifalent vaccines and what they mean for the future.

The Kishiro Administration has committed to doubling the amount of investments in so-called green technologies. I think we need more than just pronouncements. We need real money backing, very innovative startups and innovative companies in this space. What do you make of Kishiro's new capitalism? Well, I think he is framework is reflective of the challenges that Japan society is facing, namely that growth has been present, but growth has not been, of course, evenly distributed. But frankly speaking, it's hard to redistribute income if you don't have much income to begin with, that the government and private sector can work together and collaborate to drive more innovative growth startups that can really drive the income growth that the Kishiro government needs to redistribute. All street prepares for the latest read on inflation. Take fat, pay co-ocashness, be getting carried away. The market's been right. Our rate hikes starting to pay off. How long is it going to take to sue progress on inflation? That just has a long way to go. Inflation reaction on Bloomberg surveillance. Equation is still stick. The US economy is still on track. And what it means for the Fed. The data will tell us. I think we're quite always away from the poll. This is a Fed that will blame the prudent thing to do is to ease off a little bit and just have a look around. Inflation, in focus. Tomorrow on Bloomberg. Everything you need to get set for the start of US trading. Bloomberg, the Oakland with Jonathan Farrell. Drilling down in the numbers and preparing you as only Bloomberg can. We'll see you on the weekdays on Bloomberg. This is a market that over the past few weeks has made it clear. It wants to go higher. It got a little spooked by the idea that zeal for little potential rises. This is Bloomberg surveillance, early edition with Francine Markwell. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Bloomberg surveillance, early edition of Frontsy and Blackway here in London. Here's what's coming up on today's program. Wow, blame game. UK Chancellor, quasi-quart tanks says the B.O.E. will be responsible if markets tank after its bond buying program ends. All eyes on CPI stocks fluctuate for today's critical US inflation print. Fed minutes show a commitment to restrictive rate hikes. Plus, as OPEC trims its demand outlook, US officials fear that the Russian oil price cap plan may fail. Putin warns are all global energy infrastructure is at risk. Now let's check in on the markets. We're also getting the I.A. report crossing now on the Bloomberg terminal. So we'll get back to you as soon as it breaks. European stocks bid under pressure down 4 tens of 8%. The focus firmly on what we're seeing with US CPI a little bit later. So you're seeing a lot of equities actually extending some of the decline caution prevailing before that highly anticipated US inflation talk. So the focus also on the UK 30-year yield. We're now hearing pension funds on what they can do to try and get facility. The main concern, of course, is liquidity out there. Corporates may be asking, or you know, regulators may be asking corporates to put money into their pension funds to make sure that they're okay. The blame game between Treasury and of course Bank of England absolutely not helping. And then finally we look at £1.10.85. The focus firmly, though, on oil. The UPEC plus of cutting the risk to the oil price spike in world recession. This is a warning from the I.A. So we'll have a full round on what happens to the I. I think we have a European map. But if you nice also to look at the price of oil maybe not a one month chart. So the FTSE gaining or actually down some 5.10 of 8% as similar.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2410,2022-10-13 08:04:27
14185," We have a European map, but it'd be nice also to look at the price of oil maybe in a one month chart. So the FTSE gaining or actually down some 5-10 of 8% similar loss for the CAC 40. So that's a picture across the board for the IAA. We'll have plenty more, of course, on what we heard from them IAA warning that OPEC plus cuts risk oil price spike and they risk a world recession. So the chancellor, Quasi Quartank, says the Bank of England would be responsible for any market volatility after its bond buying program ends tomorrow. Now, speaking on the sidelines of the IMF's annual meeting, the chancellor told Sky News that any turmoil is, quote, a matter for the governor. Will economists and bankers give us their take on what is going on? We've announced that we'll be out by the end of this week. You've got three days left now. You've got to get this done. The Bank of England can talk tough, but fundamentally they're just going to have to extend this. They're going to hold things together as best they can. The confusion, I think, comes between the financial side of the Bank of England and the monetary side of the Bank of England, which are now trying to do different things. Monetary and fiscal policy being at crossroads, with cross purposes with each other. That's a very dangerous cocktail for bond markets. It's been trying to maintain price stability and at the same time address financial stability issues with this other instrument. This is not yet looking to me like a very steep and deep recession. I don't think we're at risk of a financial crisis. I worry that this is not enough and I think they're going to have to come up with their version of whatever it takes. By this time next year, the Bank of England will probably be cutting interest rates. Well, for more on this, let's bring Bloomberg's at Lizzie Burden. It seems that the chancellor and the governor are playing a game of chicken. What happens next? Well, you've got the pressure on the government to you turn on their tax cuts. Because, of course, in Prime Minister's questions yesterday, Liz Truss said she's not going to cut spending. So if she wants to balance the books and restore any credibility in markets, she's going to have to change something. Newspapers reporting that corporation tax could be the next reversal. And then on the Bank of England side, again, Andrew Bailey under massive pressure to you turn, he came out, Gunn's blazing this week saying that the emergency bond buying program is going to end tomorrow. And now, quasi-quarting saying if the market turmoil continues, it's going to be on Bailey. If Bailey has to continue the program, then it's going to risk his credibility. And it would mean that he isn't able to fully fight inflation. And the chief economist Hugh Pills said this week that that needs to be the BOE's priority. So you have to ask how much of a U-turn from the Bank of England? If there is a U-turn, how much of an effect of a spillover effect there would be in terms of monetary policy because markets have to believe what the governor says. What options does Bailey have now? Well, he could continue with the gamble and the program on Monday and hope that the market turmoil ends. He could fold. He could continue the program. But as I say, as that has risks for credibility, he could stop or delay quantitative tightening. But again, that means he can't fight inflation. Or perhaps there's a creative solution to be heard. This is what strategists at HSBC are saying, where the debt management office, which is part of the treasurer, works as part of the treasury, buys shorter dated money to ease up space at the long end. Really, that hasn't yet been formally being put on the table. But what it shows is all through the summer the Bank of England was criticised for not doing enough to fight inflation. Then the government seemed to row back on that and said that independence was sacrosanct. As it stands, the Bank of England can't be fighting inflation effectively. Nor is it looking as if it's independent from fiscal policy. Bailey in a very difficult place. Certainly, Lizzie. Thank you so much, Lucy Bruden. They're outside of the Bank of England on Threadneedle Street. Now, the deterioration of global economy and higher prices sparked by an OPEC-plus plan to cut supply, will slow world oil demand. And according to the monthly report from the International Energy Agency. Now, it comes as sources say that some Biden administration officials are growing concerns that their plan to cap the price of oil purchased from Russia may actually backfire after the OPEC-plus alliances' surprise production cuts lost.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2411,2022-10-13 08:08:22
14186," concerns that their plan to cap the price of oil purchased from Russia may actually backfire after the OPEC-plus alliances surprise production cuts lost week. Now we're joined now by Toral Bosoni, of course, head of the IA's oil market division. Toral, thank you so much for joining us. First of all, it's a pretty stark warning when it comes to what we saw over the last months. And I know you're worried about a global recession. Where would you see it first? We're already seeing the economy faltering here in Europe, in the US. All the major institutions continue to downgrade their outlook for the economy on a monthly basis. So what's a warning, what we're trying to say with this report, the higher prices feeding into inflation, forcing governments to cut interest rates. We're saying that the macroeconomic environment might deteriorate further. So Toral, talk to me a little bit about what we see next. I know, you know, if we look at the production cuts caused by OPEC or put in place by OPEC, that might cause a recession. Are you actually calling OPEC-plus to reverse course? We're not calling on OPEC to, we're not setting their policy obviously. This is for the OPEC to decide, but we're saying is that by cutting supplies, cutting supplies through the market, it's preventing a rebuilding of inventories. They're still critically low. So we think that by reducing supply at this time, the lower inventories, OECD inventories are still some 240 million barrels below the five-year average. And they would have been even much lower than that had and not been for IEA member country stock releases. So we think that if we were allowed to let the inventories we build, it would be, it would be helped to reduce the volatility and deflate the inflationary pressures. So Toral, were exactly does the IA stand on releasing these strategic stockpiles? So as I said now, from March to September, IA member countries have released more than 200 million barrels of government stocks. Those stock releases are still ongoing. And in October, November, there is more oil that will be released from strategic reserves of member countries. Going forward, of course, the IA member countries still have emergency seversures that they can use in case the market titans too sharply, but we're still completing the stock releases that were agreed in March and April of this year. Talk to me a little bit about China. So we know that, or a current year report, it's heading for its first annual demand drop since 1990. How big a deal is this? It's a very big deal. China has been driving oil demand growth for the past decade. And this year we're seeing Chinese old demand declining by about 600,000 barrels a day in August. Chinese demand was 1.3 million barrels a day below last year's level, which is obviously a big deal. Now we're seeing that the government is still fighting to control the spread of COVID. New restrictions are put in place, which has led us to reduce our expectations for Chinese old demand for the rest of this year. And into 2023, as we see this policy impacting demand going forward. How worried are you? If we take a step back, how worried are you about the next six months, the volatility and everything that could ensue if there's not a reversal? Of course, as we say, it comes at the bad time for energy markets where in the middle of an energy crisis, it's not just oil markets, but gas market and electricity markets. We are just weeks away or months away from the embargo, even embargo on Russian oil that comes into effect for Crudal in December and products in February. And how that would play out, how Russian oil production will respond and exports will be allocated. It could have a significant tightening of the market, but yet to see how that will play out. EU countries have reduced their purchases of Russian oil, but they still import more than 2 million barrels a day, 2.5 million, that they would have to replace by other.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2412,2022-10-13 08:12:32
14187," Reduced their purchases of Russian oil, but they still import more than 2 million barrels today, 2.5 rounds, that they would have to replace by other sources. So this is still something that is in progress, and we will have to see how that works out. So there could indeed be a tightening of the market as we move forward. Dr. Oleg Larkin, Director of the United States, as we look at possible blackouts in Europe, as we try to understand really day in day out, I really, the situation with Russia, should you be looking for in terms of science, maybe of easing of the energy sector? Is there really no chance of that? So we're seeing with Russia, of course there has been a big reallocation of trade from from the, into Europe, the US, Western country to the east. Now in September, we saw actually Russia shipping more oil to the east than they were to Europe and the West for the first time. But we think that this reallocation will be complicated also as the EU ban on maritime services comes into effect by the end of the year. So this is where we still have to see how the trade falls, will we allocate and what the real impact will be on Russian supply and on global energy markets. Dr. Oleg Larkin, Director of the United States, there was also this, frankly, strange story that Putin saying that all infrastructure is at risk after the Nord Stream hate. Is this a veiled threat to the whole world? How do you interpret this? It's obviously a big concern. I mean, we're seeing the Nord Stream pipeline infrastructure. We're seeing activity in the Nord Sea. Obviously, oil producers and gas producers are worried. Infrastructure security is part of the bigger security threats that we see in energy markets today and it's something that we're watching very closely. TORROR, thank you so much. TORROR was only there head of the IA's oil market division joining us this morning on the back of this very important report. Now coming up, Chancellor Quartan says the responsibility for any market turmoil after BOE bond buying ends is a matter for the governor. For more on the UK next, this is Bloomberg. I'm going to be doing this. Basically, cryptocurrencies have been very popular. If a client came to you and said, look, I'd like some cryptocurrencies in my portfolio. What would you say? We've actually been really deep into crypto, deep into learning about blockchain and all of the new businesses. I would characterize this as crypto learners. We have made a series of to hold investments on behalf of our clients, both in some of the currency baskets as well as with some venture firms that are investing primarily in the crypto area. I think it has the potential to be completely game changing, but it is still such the wild west and so it's so uncertain. There's, it has the potential to completely upend everything. Part of what I love about business is you get to build things from nothing. I don't have any investors. All this is all money in. This is me just building it.

14188," with nobody in charge. Economics, finance, politics, this is Bloomberg's Reveillance Early Edition, I'm bouncing like Goi, here in London. Now the U.K.'s in crisis mode, the chancellor Quasi Quartang says the Bank of England would be responsible for any market volatility after its bond buying program ends tomorrow. Speaking on the sidelines of the IMF's annual meeting, the chancellor told Sky News that any turmoil is, quote, a matter for the governor. Now for more, what's more, the Prime Minister leaves truss insist that she will not cut spending or make any further U-turns on her tax cuts. Now, we're joined by William DeVilder, his chief economist, Uzzi, and the U.S. and what that means for the Fed is, but there is also a spillover effect of what we are seeing in the U.K. to the rest of the world bonds. Absolutely, Francine. The world is really watching the U.K. in terms of how it is handling this latest crisis and it is not doing great in terms of that global impression. I mean just earlier this week, the IMF Chief Economist singled out the U.K. as a country that's showing other global economies, how not to handle a fiscal monetary policy, kerfuffle as it were. And you know, this latest line from quasi-quarting really is not calming markets necessarily. I mean investors really want to have faith in their institutions, want to know that they have their backing if things go awry. But this latest line from quasi-quarting, especially ahead of that Buie pulling back from the market tomorrow, deadline, is not calming nerves at the moment. So, well, and what's your take on all of this? I don't know whether this is a very dangerous game that really goes to the credibility of the U.K. and whether this will take months to play out to regain that market credibility. Well, credibility loss, it takes a long time to gain it back. That is what will be all the way through. I think what will take away is from the developments in the U.K. First of all, I was impressed and surprised by the extent of the global spillovers that the jumping gild heels were pulling along to such a degree yield solitip in a new area, but including treasury yields. The second point is that clearly from a policy perspective, we need to have a proper coordination between fiscal policy and policy and macroprudential. So, the macroprudential means that we need to have a picture of where is the leverage in the system. And then fiscal, of course, well, if you try to slow down the economy, we want to re-use should not inject more money by expansionary fiscal policy. So, that is I think where we really have an issue. And the third point, and that is also an element of concern for the longer run, is that pension funds play a key role in financing the economy. But that goes beyond the U.K. it is really the global economy. So, if you have disruption happening there because of the LDI and all the like, we still fail to come to grips with what could be the lower term consequences for financing-surveillance assets. Well, talk to me a little bit. So, where does the credibility issue actually come from? Is it what the government is trying to post? Or is the fact that it does seem like it's a fight between two arms, which work together, well, it's better when they work together, which is, you know, the governor and, of course, Treasury. Well, I think we should be more open about the necessity to have a better coordination. We have already seen that during QE back then it would have been better to have a fiscal expansion supporting the zero-interest rate policy or even negative-interest rate policy. But it grows in both ways when you have a contraction of more of your policy than fiscal should also pay more attention. You do do that. You end up having a problem in particular when you have no visibility at all whether the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2414,2022-10-13 08:21:43
14189, You do a do that you end up having a problem in particular when you have no visibility at all whether the longer term death sustainability aspects are taken into account in the fiscal policy stance that is being adopted. In addition you have the problem that if you have a current account deficit the rest of the world is looking at this with increasingly I would say suspicion hands are not going to fix that VFC. So I think the coordination yes but also was that enough discussion ahead of these announcements I have dealt on that. What's your take on you know when you look at some of the pension funds and some of the questions that we have there on how they can also fund themselves corporates maybe asking the pension funds to fill the gap until we understand the liquidity measures. Is this a template for the rest of the world? Is it just you know chaos and messy for the UK Christine? Well Francine I think yeah again the world is watching in terms of how the UK is handling this and it's very interesting I think at this particular juncture there are definitely a lot of questions being asked about overall pension reform is it time to finally look at the L. E. I. strategy and really scrutinize it for all the risks that were apparently hidden all this time and didn't really come to lie until we saw this acute stress in the bond market and so you know I think there's definitely talk of more regulation going forward how can pension funds really diversify the the types of assets that they hold in at this moment so that they can have that broader base for collateral options should we see the situation again the problem with those sorts of ideas is that it is in the longer term a good thing probably but in the shorter term you can imagine something like that pension funds kind of changing the composition of their holdings would probably cause more russians in the bond market great thank you both for joining us William DeVilder there are chief economists at BMP Parabine Christina keynote from our markets team joining us now coming up should we be concerned about COVID cases creeping higher as we head into winter we discuss all of that with the co-founder of moderner Noobah Affeyan that's coming up shortly and this is Blutberg why is everybody want to be a consultant and what are all these consultants doing well David I think that we actually defy the label consultant because sometimes consultant seems to imply that we only give advice and when you look at what Accenture does we're really different than the traditional version of a consultant we're really about relevance and results and that's what is driving our business about a consulting project in my example on the CEO I have a problem I call you up I say solve my problem or give me a solution we don't operate as big companies permanently in crisis mode and so when you think about like how long does it solve things a lot of it starts with you know the company being willing to set aggressive goals and so what we are trying to do now is work with our clients to work differently and to work faster the difference between misstopper to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2415,2022-10-13 08:25:29

And we did see some pressure on the futures that is now being reversed. Street prepares for the latest read on inflation. Pete Fad, Pete Kohl, Kishnest, we're getting carried away. The market's been right. Our rate hike starting to pay off. How long is it going to take to see progress on inflation? Fed just has a long way to go. Instant reaction on Bloomberg surveillance. inflation is still stick to US economy is still on track. And what it means for the Fed? Data will tell it. I think we're quite always away from the point. This is a Fed that would blame the prudent thing to do is to ease off a little bit and just have a look around. Inflation, in focus today on Bloomberg.

Plus, the IA warns that OPEC production cuts could fuel inflation and tip the world into a recession. Well, good morning, everyone. Welcome to Bloomberg surveillance early edition. I'm from Seenlack, why here in London. Now, COVID vaccine maker Moderna rose most in two months yesterday after Merck extended a partnership to try and develop a cancer vaccine. The vaccine is currently in mid stage testing, has a treatment for high risk melanoma skin cancer. Now, like many of the COVID vaccine makers, it's been a tough year for Moderna. Before yesterday's announcements, it had lost more than half of its market value this year. But if you look at it on the longer term, it still helps. So we're now joined by Newbert Afian co-founder and chairman Moderna, and chief executive and founder of flagship pioneering. Newbert always great to speak to you. We want to talk about the share price, but I really want to understand your world in terms of trends. First of all, you're here and we heard from the World Health Organization that there's a resurgence that that's having, especially in Europe, when it comes to COVID. How should we deal with COVID now? I think we have to stay vigilant as we've been over the last two years, and I think we have to use the technologies that have been developed to protect us, which in this case is the new family of myvalent vaccines. These vaccines are both protective against the new strains, as well as the original strain, because we don't exactly know where the virus is headed, as it mutates to fight our immune system, and our immune system has to essentially mutate through technology to fight the virus. And that fight is going on. I know that some would love to believe that the pandemic is over, but as the saying goes, at least, we may be done with the pandemic, but the pandemic doesn't seem to be done with us. And so we just have to stay vigilant. So when you look at some of the byvalents, which I'm glad you've pronounced it, so I always get it wrong, when can you actually provide some of the efficacy data of how it works? We have the byvalent vaccine that is being provided in Europe and in the UK is actually one for which we have human data, and we've provided it, and it's against one of the Omicron and strains. A different strain byvalent that has been introduced in the US is being basically tested in the market right now, because it's already available. So we are measuring vaccine efficacy and we'll have additional data forthcoming. The reality is that no matter where we've looked in these inhumans, as well as in animal trials, we've seen the kind of efficacy that one needs to be able to be protected. So I think data will come along, but definitely in field use, certainly in the strain that's here, we have human data showing efficacy already. If you look at the US, one...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2417,2022-10-13 08:35:05
14192," I think data will come along, but definitely in field use, certainly in the strain that's in the version that's here, we have human data showing efficacy already. If you look at the US, why was there a very slow rollout of the boosters? I think there was a slow regulatory final approval in that they wanted a particular strain in the actual vaccines, so that delayed us a little bit. And then I think the uptake is a function of education, promotion, and people are getting mixed signals. I mean, it was bad enough that people were spreading misinformation, not getting confused about whether they really needed it. And I think what you're seeing in the last few days is an intensified message that people are dying as a result of not being protected. There's no question we're having 300, 400 deaths a day in the US. That is not an acceptable level to coexist with. And so I think we have to do a much better job. But there are more people, and actually certainly in the summer, a lot of people had COVID, badly or not so badly. And so I think they're protected for a long time. It's difficult. Like if somebody came up to you and said, look, do I need a fourth booster? Does it depend on the age? I don't know whether it's misinformation or the vaccine fatigue out there. I mean, I don't know. I mean, look, I don't want to seem kind of tough-minded about this, but I don't know what vaccine fatigue means. Any more than I know what cancer fatigue means or I know what hypertension fatigue means. It's your health. And at the end of the day, frankly, even beyond your wealth or your happiness, your health is the thing that needs protection, active, proactive protection. And that's what a vaccine does. So the notion that we should allow ourselves to get tired of protecting our health is something that I think one does by taking unnecessary risk. You could also cross the street during ongoing traffic and say, you know what I'm tired of waiting for these cars. And so I just think there's a correspondence that we're missing. Somehow we're putting vaccines in a different category. And they're not. They're just a way to protect your own health, your own decision. But overall, the data suggests that it is much better to be protected than not. But is that because people still get sick? So where does this, you know, the, I don't know if you call it a schism, but if people don't want to get the third, fourth booster, is it because they think they'll get sick anyway and they were expecting the vaccine to do something else? I think that it's important for people to understand that our immune system is what is the medicine here. The vaccine simply directs the immune system to do what it can do. The immune system, first of all, protects us against infection. And then once infected, it becomes therapeutic in that it actually goes after the virus and eliminates it. The therapeutic side of this, there's no evidence of that waning and our bodies are very good at fighting back once it gets in. The vaccine helps you be put off or reduce the chance of getting infected. It does not eliminate it. So with a vaccine, you're going to have a lower chance of getting infected. And in any event, you're going to have a prime response once you get infected. And out of vaccine, you have a much higher rate of getting infected. And once you're infected, your immune system is going to be relatively slow to respond. I think that's the kind of contrast. And between those two, the first option seems to be more protective overall. So are people willing to get, you know, boosters more here in Europe and certainly in the UK than in the United States? It seems that the level of trust between the people and their healthcare providers, particularly with essential NHS here and elsewhere, is much higher in Europe than it is in the US. I think in the US, we have kind of a confused state right now. There's, depending on your zip code, depending on your education level, depending on your political party, which is remarkable affiliation people are and are not choosing to get vaccinated. It's, look, this is a bit of an opportunity for the virus to find laboratories in which it can mutate, namely people who are not well protected. And so the fight is dragging on somewhat because people are making these choices, which is further allowing the virus to mutate. The virus has more mutants available now in people's bodies than it did previously because it's proliferating. Not just because sometimes we think mutating means you go from A to B. There's A to 50,000 letters now out there. I mean, it's just proliferating and our immune system is going to have a harder and harder time if there's ample places for it to keep mutating. The more we vaccinate, does it change those mutations or no? The more we vaccinate, the more our immune system goes after one aspect of the virus, then other places become vulnerabilities. So the virus is trying to escape wherever there's pressure. But in some places where there isn't kind of enough pressure, the virus can replicate before it has to be finding the immune system. So it's a, look, it's, it's fysed from two years ago.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2418,2022-10-13 08:38:54
14193," enough pressure, the virus can replicate before it has to be fighting the immune system. So it's a, look, it's, if I said from two years ago, this is a battle between a life form that is praying on our social behavior and contact and our immune system, which is designed to fight back, but is struggling because the virus is really mutating very quickly. Newport, yesterday, so there was, you know, really encouraging news about cancer vaccines. Broadly, what's your approach to those and how they'll change? In fact, cancer vaccines are a program that we've been working on for five, six years, and cancer takes quite a long time. But interestingly and coincidentally, that we had worked on cancer vaccines is why we could respond so quickly to go after the virus, the COVID. And the reason is that a cancer vaccine is doing a similar thing, which is telling your immune system to fight a certain number of new sequences in your body, namely a cancer sequence, instead of a virus. So that program has been ongoing for a while and it's been, it's been gradually, gradually collecting data. What we announced yesterday is that in throughout partnership with Merck, which obviously is a very large from a sort of company and very accomplished both in cancer and in vaccines, that they chose to expand and enlarge their collaboration on this program. And so it's very exciting to see that. But this would be what an incremental benefit of being vaccinated on top of the old school therapeutic to fight cancer. Right. So let me clarify that in the case of cancer, we're talking about a therapeutic vaccine. Yeah. Remember I said in COVID, there's a preventative and a therapeutic version. Well, in this case, you're using the therapeutic because you already have the cancer. And so the way that works is that you're showing all the different sequence variants to the immune system that your cancer represents and the immune system is much better armed to go after it. So that's, it's, it's, it's using vaccination as a therapeutic, not as a preventative. All right, Nubar. Thank you so much. We'll continue that conversation and talk a lot more, a lot more about some of these cancer vaccines. We need to look at banks actually, Bloomberg story or just crossing Bloomberg terminal is Monte Paschi, the world's oldest bank halted limit down after falling more than 13%. And I think that it's always been quite thin on volumes, but it's falling after setting some of the terms of a capital hike at a discount. I know there was so much speculation over the last two or three years about who would buy the bank if anybody wanted the bank. We also know that there is political pressure from the Italian government for one of the big banks to absorb this, did this not happen? Liquidity and again trading is quite volatile on Monte Paschi limit down 13%. Now more coming up with Nubar Afian, the co-founder and chairman of Moderna, that's coming up shortly and this is Bloomberg. Thank you. How much of a push have he seen from the Kishida government in terms of green funding? The Kishida administration has committed to doubling the amount of investments in so-called green technologies. I think we need more than just pronouncements. We need real money backing, very innovative startups and innovative companies in this space. What do you make of Kishida's new capitalism? Well, I think he is framework is reflective of the challenges that Japan society is facing, namely, that growth has been present but growth has not been, of course, evenly distributed. But frankly speaking, it's hard to register the income if you don't have a income to begin with. If the government and private sector can work together and collaborate to drive more innovative growth startups, that can really drive the income growth that the Kishida government needs to redistribute. You've got to explain this one.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2419,2022-10-13 08:42:56

This is Bloomberg Surveillance Early Edition and Fronts and Likeway here in London. Now let's get straight to your Bloomberg business flash. Here's Leigh Unger and Tylean. Hi, Franceeam. ASML has ordered its US staff to stop servicing customers in China after the Biden administration announced tighter restrictions. The Dutch chip manufacturing equipment maker told its employees in America about the rule changes in an email. ASML has held back from selling some of its most advanced technology to China as it tries to strike a balance between the two nations. Now, the US is considering a total ban on Russian aluminium in response to the military escalation in Ukraine. Bloomberg has learned that the Biden administration is weighing a number of options, including an outright ban or a large increase in tariffs. Russia is the second only to China as a producer of aluminium, which is crucial to most heavy industries. And Hong Kong is said to be considering easing property taxes and visa restrictions as authority seek to curb the pandemic brain drain of recent years. Bloomberg has learned Chief Executive John Lee could include the measures in his first policy address happening later this month. Hong Kong's strict pandemic measures have seen at lose ground to Singapore as an international financial hub. And that's your Bloomberg business flash, Franceeam. Leanne, thank you so much. Now, let's go back to vaccines and Moderna. We're joined by Noobar Afian co-founder and chairman of Moderna and the Chief Executive Officer and founder of flagship pioneering. Noobar, thank you so much for sticking around. We're talking a little bit about vaccines, the uptake of boosters, the also the resurgent of, of course, COVID in the winter months. Talk to me about long COVID. So, what do we know concretely? Because, again, there's pockets here and there of data that the media exemplifies. What do we know about long COVID and the link to vaccines? We are learning about long COVID and everything we're learning is actually quite concerning and that is that there's a persistent effect of getting COVID infection. It's not clear whether mild or strong versions of it are more correlated with it, but clearly in a significant percentage of people, some people say up to 10%, there is a persistent six, 12 month even beyond fairly debilitating effect. And it happens to be in many different organs in the body. It's in the brain, it's in the liver, it's in the heart, and it's manifesting all over. Some people are now beginning to claim that that's because some amount of pockets of virus are persisting. All of that is a consequence of not having an adequate immune response to get rid of virus, which is enhanced by vaccines. So, our sense is that the less people get infected, the less you're going to have long COVID. And in any case, if you contain that infection by a strong kind of an effective immune response, then you're going to try to reduce that risk. But we need to spend a lot of money understanding the disease because now the virus is kind of becoming a double punch, one through infecting you in a second through having a long-term effect. But so, the long COVID, are the numbers going down in long COVID in terms of percentage of when people catch COVID? Because of the vaccines or no? I don't think we know yet. I think the numbers, because we don't have a good way to diagnose it, it's a fairly loose diagnosis because people are suddenly being sick and being debilitated. So, I think that we're going to learn more. Are you talking to China about bringing a vaccine over there? We know some of your rivals have actually partners on the ground. Are you doing the same? We have had discussions with China, and that will continue. We're prepared to support the country's fighting against COVID. Obviously, as a global company, we want to make sure that it's done respecting intellectual property, respecting the kind of distribution arrangements that we have. And we look forward to making that happen whenever it makes sense for them. Which could be... I can't fork...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2420,2022-10-13 08:47:27
14195," respecting the kind of distribution arrangements that we have and we look forward to making that happen whenever it makes sense for them. Which could be... I can't forecast it because I think it's a complicated issue. Obviously every country wants to make their own versions of vaccines and they have internal competition as well as wanting to access external products. So I think these are complex decisions. You have a sizable exposure here to the UK. We've seen a lot of volatility in markets, a lot of questions about the governance plans, you know, liquidity and incorporation tax. What's your take on the UK? Is it investable right now? I think it's investable particularly in the life sciences. I mean we're very excited about the prospects of the partnership between the UK and Moderna and the First Instance which should be a rather transformative presence of a company with significant investments in clinical research here that we've committed as well as manufacturing of vaccines. But beyond that we're seeing several of our other companies within the flagship ecosystem do clinical trials here and what we're finding on the heels of that is a general facility to do this here, a regulatory entity and MHRA that seems to be very, very forward looking and very collaborative. The NHS which is a single provider is a good partner to interact with the scientific community whether it's in the major universities or all over the country. There is a general potential here that we perceive that is quite unique and very timely. Does it mean that you'll put more money in the UK and could you even buy? Buy other companies or certainly buy talent given the market turmoil? We are, you know, a flagship space in Boston, US. I'm here for the second time or last six months largely exploring whether there are opportunities here that might lend themselves to a stronger presence whether it's investment or collaborations or creating companies. All of that is what flagship does, my parent company here and all of that we think there may be opportunities here. So we're very interested in exploring and finding the right way of doing it. Does it matter to you if corporation taxes go up or down in the UK? I mean, if some argue that actually if your chief executive and corporation tax goes up at least it brings a bit of stability other saying well it's just a tax on profits. I, you know, our companies are research companies primarily and so it takes a while for them to get to a place where they're actually thinking about corporate taxes. One of the oddities of biotech companies is that they're primarily invested in making asset value through intellectual property and research. And so I've been less focused on that part of it any more than in the US that doesn't really affect how we behave. More generally in other industries I'm sure that's a major driver but for us we would rather focus on human capital, scientific capital and financial capital and how to unlock it in the UK as it relates to the biotech sector in which it's been very modestly involved so far. So I think there's a lot of growth here. Does inflation impact you? People impact us in many ways but no, not uniquely compared to other industries. The supplies that we use to make our products are relatively kind of minor part of the value that we're creating. A lot of the value is the ultimate impact as opposed to the cost of goods. So yes it matters. Of course the cost of living matter, inflation affecting that makes place you know people less comfortable. And so that affects us but not again specific to the biotech. This is a very unique research science based value creation sector and so people have to think of it in that way versus one of many equivalent sectors. Nubor I think we started the interview also mentioning your share price. Do you look at your share price or are you expecting it? Do you just focus on growing the company or do you worry about the fact that it lost 12 months? It hasn't been performing. I'm sure as well as you wanted it to. I think I've been at this for 35 years as an entrepreneur and an executive and in this case chairman of Moderna and during that time in biotech I've seen share prices at the same time reflect the current reality but once I know I'll reflect the future potential and that defines the difference between one and two or ten X. In other words as people start looking forward they start realizing what the value could be and the price starts reflecting the future as opposed to the present. Right now I think a lot of stock prices not ours and only reflect current concerns with inflation and uncertainty and wars and etc. and all of that is understandable but at some point that settles out and people start saying okay if the remaining companies which ones have high prospects. I think that Moderna and others that are really pioneering in new spaces will be rewarded and shareholders will be rewarded. So at any given time yes I look at it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2421,2022-10-13 08:51:42
14196," Which ones have high prospects? I think that Moderna and others that are really pioneering in new spaces will be rewarded and shareholders will be rewarded. So at any given time, yes, I look at it, but I look at it to contextualize what it is reflecting as opposed to what the actual number is. Newbert, thank you so much for coming to the studio today. Newbert Afei and there are the co-founder and chairman of Moderna and chief executive and founder of Flagship Pineering. Now we'll continue, of course, to keep you up to date. Also with Market News, today's key data, USCPI and how it could impact the Fed's next movement... We have a client who has come to you and said, look, I would like some crypto currencies in my portfolio. What would you say? We've actually been really deep into crypto, deep into learning about blockchain and all of the new businesses. I would characterize this as crypto learners. We have made a series of to hold investments on behalf of our clients, both in some of the currency baskets as well as with some venture firms that are investing primarily in the crypto area. I think it has the potential to be completely game changing, but it is still such the wild rest and so it's so uncertain. It has the potential to completely up end everything. For a young person who now booking a career, would you recommend a Wall Street career today? There are not many jobs you can have as a young individual, but you're always, always learning. The economics finance politics, this is Bloomberg's surveillance early edition of Fronting stir. very rid halts in an exclusive interview. I'm used to and we're all used to cell offs that are fairly quick. That we know even 08 was five or six months from Leeman to the lows of March 09. Where at the end of it, you can kind of wonder is there an all clear sign. We have the Fed behind us quantitative easing. Now we don't really know who the savior is because at the end of all of this, we're still going to have quantitative tightening and shrinking the balance sheet. And so whereas a lot of cell offs were just a prelude to a to a bull market one or six months later, you know, this has the feeling to me like we're going to be worried about.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2422,2022-10-13 08:56:23
14197," So whereas a lot of selloffs were just a prelude to a bull market one or six months later, you know, this has the feeling to me like we're going to be worried about some number of these things or new things for potentially quarters and maybe even years to come. So no capitulation yet, no flush which gives us that all clear signal. How much of that is based on truly not knowing what the Fed's gonna do or is it, we don't know which potential problem is real and which is fake news. I, these things are so hard to predict. I even want to be cautious about, you know, opining too much because it's just such a confusing market and there hasn't been a single thing to say, okay, this is why the market, why 20% is not enough, it should be 40. Let's take inflation. If you look at, it's forward inflation, it's expected to come down a lot. So you could look at tomorrow's CPI print if it comes in a 10th or below or high and get excited about it, but the market is still telling you inflation is not going to be the problem that it is one year from now. Now, if a few months from now that conviction is shaken, then we're gonna have a real strong sell off. If somehow Russia haven't forbid becomes more asymmetric, we're gonna have a real problem. And so we just don't know, we're in a fog and we should not rely on the lessons that people learned maybe incorrectly for this environment that were good between 08 and 2022, which was the Fed is your put, don't fight the Fed and dips should all be bought and being short is fighting the Fed. This really does not feel like that environment in particular because of where the central banks are versus them. Well that was Sabah Capital Management, Sandra Boaz Weinstein. Now Bloomberg's valence early edition continues in the next hour, my villa and K-lines in New York and Edwards in London and this is Bloomberg.represented at the Vietnam Local Trade Center So as you look back on your career, what would you say is the best investment advice you've ever received? Probably the best investment advice that I never received but that I've lived my whole life around is surround yourself with really good people. I thought about it just today like I do many times, you know, what makes a great investor. A great investment firm is comprised of people who are optimists and pessimists and realists because in the intersection of the debates that go across that wide range of personalities is where you find truth. It's part of the reason I'm so focused on freedom of expression. I see it my own four walls, the robust and fulsome debates around how we commit our capital, what defines a good idea, what businesses to build or pursue. That's what drives the success at Citadel. I've been very fortunate in life to have always had a group of friends who really push me, who make me better.

All Street prepares for the latest read on inflation. Take fat, peak hole, kishnests, we're getting carried away. The market's been right. Our rate hike is starting to pay off. How long is it going to take to see progress on inflation? That just has a long way to go. Instant reaction on Bloomberg surveillance. Inflation is still stick to US economy is still on track. And what it means for the Fed? The data will tell us. I think we're quite always away from the poll. This is a Fed that will blame the prudent thing to do is to ease off a little bit and just have a look around. Inflation, in focus. Tomorrow on Bloomberg. Markets come down in Europe from the financial centers of the world. Bloomberg markets European polls with Guy Johnson in London. Alex Diel in New York. Real time numbers. Real time analysis. Weekdays. Why do the biggest names in business choose Bloomberg? I think they have great questions. It's great question. Great question. And pest question I get all night. Bloomberg. Top experts. Great questions. You're having all these problems in other parts of the world. So the pressure is going to mount on the Fed. Anybody paying attention cannot deny that we now have a set of circumstances that clearly point to a recession. You need to hopefully continue signs that inflation is easing. All the inflation lead indicators are easing, but the headline inflation numbers are not. Things can change very quickly. We saw we've seen that. That's been the typical pattern. Stop trying to pick this bottom. Stop trying to look for that pivot. This is Bloomberg surveillance. Early edition with Anna Edwards, Matt Miller and Kaley Lines. It's 10 a.m. in London. 5 a.m. in New York and 5 p.m. in Hong Kong. Our top stories today. Taming inflation investors await US consumer price figures today that may determine if the Fed will deliver a fourth outsized rate hike. Downing street is playing the blame game. Quante Quante says the Bank of England will have to answer for any market so and tomorrow that might be rough when the central bank ends its bond-bying program tomorrow. And as the IEA warns that OPEC plus cuts made the global economy into recession, US officials fear their Russian oil price cap plan may fail. Welcome to Bloomberg surveillance, early edition. I'm Anna Edwards in London with Matt Miller and Kaley Lines in New York. We've been on gilt watch. It's seen some days and days now. We go to inflation watch stateside today. Yep, that crucial CPI data is due in just about three and a half hours time, Anna. And it's going to be a big one for a lot of different reasons. Of course, you had to trade in Asia before you got those figures, but by and large, it was a down day overall. The MSCI Asia Pacific indexed down by about 1 percent. Hong Kong, a real underperformer Hong Kong stocks actually falling to their lowest level since 2011. And the drag created by tech stocks in particular had a lot to do with that. The Hangsang tech indexed down about 3.4 percent overnight. Of course, a lot of that has to do with weakness in the semiconductor space. It's just warning after warning on demand, plus you have the new Biden administration curves as it relates to Chinese chip companies. And overnight, Taiwan semiconductor said it's cutting its capital expenditure target for the year by 10 percent. So just another warning sign for the sector and TSMC down for a fourth day in a row overnight. Now it's losses over those four days at about 12 percent. Finally, in foreign exchange, just wanted to point out that the dollar is fractionally fractionally weaker against the Japanese D&E, really one of the few exceptions out there today. But at 146.83, we are still at levels on dollar end that we need to watch for fresh intervention from policymakers. Because around this level is when Japan policy makers stepped in last go around to stem the weakness in the Iran. And of course, the yen, excuse me, and remember Matt, last CPI date, the yen moved about 2 percent weaker against the dollar within minutes. So that's going to be a currency pair to watch when that data drops at 8.30 AM. Yeah, absolutely have that up on my dashboard, Kaylee. I'm looking at futures that are a little bit higher today after the drops that we saw on the cash trade yesterday. We got down to 35.77. However, extremely light volume yesterday, today as well. You're going to see very light volume, or at least in futures, until the CPI print comes out, traders are going to want to sit.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2424,2022-10-13 09:05:13
14199," Streamly light volume yesterday today as well. You're going to see very light volume or at least in futures until the CPI print comes out traders are going to want to sit on their hands. The 10-year yield hovering right around where it was yesterday 391.08 right now is the level there. This is poised also obviously to snap in one direction or the other depending on what we see in terms of the CPI number. Now I'm x-trude coming up 59 cents to 87.86. The Saudis coming out and defending themselves against President Biden's criticism saying they have noble ambitions to balance the oil market and right now we're looking at Bitcoin that's office about 8 tens of 1 percent still hovering at that 19,000. I think I am going to sideline Bitcoin in my board for a few weeks until it at least moves out of the 19 to 20,000 dollar range. What are you seeing in Europe? Let's have a look at where we are on the European picture and things looking a little brighter than they did at the start of the trading day. We were pretty negative as we started out but recovering a little bit of poise here. The cat caron the Zestradax both up marginally. There's been a lot of focus on UK assets, UK guilt in particular in recent days. So let's get quickly to that. Of course we are all focused on the US inflation data later on of course. But here's the 30-year yield and it's coming down. The two-year yield coming down. We've got yields coming down across the gilt curve which is obviously a positive for global risk sentiment when we've been watching those yields kind despite what the Bank of England has been doing. And thinking of the Bank of England they seem to be under pressure from various market voices saying well maybe they'll you turn the Bank of England says it won't. The government in the UK under pressure lots and voices even within the Conservative Party saying maybe they'll be a you turn. They keep saying that they won't. We'll see how this plays out tomorrow the weekend Monday. Brent crude, Matt talked about what's going on with oil. We are up by 7 tens of 1 percent. It seems the IEA taking a almost similar view to the White House suggesting that this cut in production we've seen from OPEC plus that is going to be something that risks pushing up oil prices and that could weigh on the economy to the extent of causing a recession in their view. ASM International and Focus this is a part of the chips universe of course and the company under pressure. We heard from a course a player in the United States in this space they were talking about sales being under pressure. We heard from TSMC over in Taiwan they talked about pairing that capex expectations so pressures on the chipset so it seems Matt. All right so we're focused on the inflation data that we're going to get out today. It may keep the Fed on path for a big November right hike. In fact many economists say they're going to do 75 no matter what this print is but what comes next is maybe more important. Fed Governor Michelle Bowman says she continues to favor large increases in interest rates to cool inflation. If we do not see signs that inflation is moving down my view continues to be that sizeable increases in the target range for the federal funds rate should remain on the table. However if inflation starts to decline I believe a slower pace of rate increases would be appropriate. Bloomberg's Danny Berger joins us now to preview today's key data and Danny how do we expect markets to react? Well markets feel very wound up at this moment and surely the data we got yesterday and the PPI figures isn't really that reassuring. We had PPI rise yesterday the first data point of rising after two consecutive months of falling into be clear this wasn't about fuel prices because even core PPI rose by about 0.4%. In terms of our expectations at the moment economists surveyed by Bloomberg see the core at 0.4% it was at 0.6 last month and there's this question of just how much lower does it need to go in order to get any sort of relief rally in order to indicate that perhaps the Fed won't be as hawkish considering we have those FMC minutes where there was some indication of more folks talking about a two way risk but Matt to get back to the first thing you asked me because I should probably answer your question. Yeah markets are really really nervous about this reading the VIX curve that is very inverted with a lot of volatility embedded in the front end of that curve so for today even treasury volatility that is back at the highs of the pandemic set off and of course UK bond volatility that's contributed to this but a day where we're getting CPI and volatility plumbing new highs for the year it certainly feels like a nervous set up in a yeah does feel",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2425,2022-10-13 09:09:09
14200, UK bond volatility that's contributed to this but a day where we're getting CPI and volatility plumbing new highs for the year it certainly feels like a nervous set up in. Yeah it does feel like a never-sense I've been just as you are talking there Danny in terms of thinking about what's going on on the the guilt market I mentioned it when I was talking about guilt the moment to go over UK long bond surging 30 years 30 year yields down 21 basis points of 4.61 percent that was one of the yields we're watching go over five yesterday and in very much in focus as the bank of England has today and tomorrow to do those operations thanks very much to Danny burger let's think about how the UK is progressing here that's what's going on in markets the UK Chancellor quasi-quantising says the bank of England will be responsible if UK markets suffer renewed volatility after his bond buying program ends tomorrow blue bass Lizzie burden joins us now from the bank of England Lizzie it seems the chancellor and the governor the kind of playing a game of chicken a bit of a standoff as to who's going to who's going to give any ground by the weekend yeah I know who's going to blink first if it's Andrew Bailey if he gives in and extends the emergency bond buying program rose back on his tough talk from earlier in the week when he said it was going to end tomorrow we have to ask how much it will undermine his credibility on the monetary policy front will markets believe what he says he's going to do when it comes to fighting inflation and on top of that if the bank of England continues buying bonds it can't go on with quantitative tightening at least for now which would mean that it's prioritising financial stability over inflation fighting and that's exactly what the chief economist Hugh Pills said this week the bank does not want to do so how do we get out of this well fiscally Liz Truss has said she's not going to cut spending which means that she would have to you turn on tax cuts if she wants to balance the books and try to regain some market credibility and on the bank of England side the only hope could be a creative solution from the debt management office which is part of the treasury when it comes to raising short dated money to ease pressure on longer term debt this is a suggestion from such strategists at HSBC but the irony really is the trust government throughout the summer criticised the bank of England for not doing enough to fight inflation then she said that the bank of England's independence was sacrosanct and now the bank of England can't do its job fighting inflation properly because it's having to put out the fire that the fiscal policy started. Alright Bloomberg's Lizzy Burton thank you so much our wonderful markets producer Dan Curtis just pointing out that we have seen a 20 plus basis point move on the 30 year gild in six of the past 15 trading days absolutely remarkable in the bond market let's turn to the commodity market now though the US is proceeding with its plan to cap the price of oil from Russia but some Biden administration officials are growing concern that the plan made backfire after the OPEC plus alliances surprise production cut last week that's according to people familiar with the matter meanwhile Saudi Arabia rejected criticism of the cut saying the move was based solely on its noble objectives to avoid oil market volatility. Eddie Vanderbilt of Bloomberg Market Slive joins us now for more and Eddie in addition to that you have the IEA warning that the cut from OPEC plus could put prices at a level which leads to a global recession what is that level and how likely is it that oil gets there given all of these different forces at play. Wow absolutely you know what I think there's so much at play in the oil market I think you know OPEC has signaled that it's quite comfortable with prices for brains round about a hundred dollars a barrel level and we're a little bit below that at the moment but you know whether the whether the world economy can sustain prices at that level that's quite another another matter and I think what this really has told us though the the the wrangling over the oil market is that supplies are quite tight and I think if we see demand picking up oil could shoot significantly higher because they doesn't seem to be that much spare capacity in OPEC and I think I think the the the the US position is making clear that this is becoming an election issue for Biden so I think I think there's you know the oil market's going to be at the center of conversation in the next few months. Yeah absolutely politically and economically Eddie thank you very much Eddie Van der Veil to Bloomberg markets live elsewhere in commodities we should bring you up to date with what is happening and the US is considering a total ban on Russian aluminum aluminium in response to the military escalation in Ukraine aluminum surge after Bloomberg reported the Biden administration is weighing a number of options including,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2426,2022-10-13 09:13:26
14201," And on Russian aluminum aluminium in response to the military escalation in Ukraine. Illuminum surge after Bloomberg reported the Biden administration is weighing a number of options, including an outright ban or a large increase in tariffs. Russia is second only to China as a producer of the metal, which is crucial to most heavy industries. Yeah, we'll be paying very close attention to that. We are watching, of course, what's going on in Brussels. Where NATO defense chiefs are gathering for a second day of meetings today, they will discuss increased security of critical infrastructure and are expected to offer more air defense capabilities for Ukraine in the face of Ukraine stepped up missile strikes. Bloomberg's Maria today joins us now with the latest. So Maria, what do we know? Yes, Matt. And the message from the NATO Secretary General this morning is that the alliance will stand by Ukraine, quote, for as long as it takes it will increase support for the country and provide the air defense systems. Remember, this was the main ask from the Ukrainians going into this meeting. Of course, the question always when it comes to NATO is who provides who, but also just how quickly can this get to the frontline? The other big issue, which to me at our use equally important for some European countries that part of NATO is what happens to some of the critical infrastructure, so the pipelines, the cables, the underwater systems, the grid that they worry could be compromised in a form of hybrid war going into the winter, will the NATO Secretary General say if it is maliciously compromised, it will trigger a quote united and determined response from the alliance. Now the question, and this is key, is could it trigger Article 5? There's some strategic ambiguity from NATO this morning. All right, Bloomberg's Maria today, reporting from Brussels. Thank you so much. Now let's get back to the equity market and take a look at some stocks moving and pre-market trading here in the U.S. Diana was just running us through what's going on with aluminum prices, and that is having a positive read through to aluminum makers here in the U.S. like Alcoa. The stock was up about 5 percent yesterday on that original news around the Biden administration weighing those moves, and just a little bit more of a gain coming this morning up about 4.10 of 1 percent. Another stock that is gaining is Delta Airlines. This is interesting because it does report this morning. It just hasn't reported yet, and yet ahead of those results, the stock is up 2.6 percent. Maybe traders have a little bit of confidence after the positive pre-report. We got from American Airlines earlier this week, so look out for those figures in just a couple of hours. But two stocks moving to the downside would be U.S. Casino operators that have big revenue waiting toward Macau in particular. There is concern around the COVID-19 strategy in China persisting even after the Party Congress wraps up in a week or so. So you have Las Vegas stands starting to gain a little more traction in the pre-market, but downhard for win resorts down about 2 percent before the bell. Yeah, Kayleigh, maybe we'll get to focus more on China tomorrow as we work our way towards those important meetings taking place in the start this weekend. Coming up on the programme, we'll speak to Charlotte Rylem, go ahead of investments at CCLA Investment Management, get her perspective on what's going on with UK GILT. I feel I've said Whitsaw too many times this week very much overused, but very much appropriate as well as we watch the 30 year yield really dropping today. We'll also talk US CPI with Charlotte and with Steve Blitz, T.S. Lombard Chief US Economist will get his perspective on exactly what to watch for. Plus, down to the wire, the fate of the Democrats agenda comes down to a handful of key US Senate races. Today's big take explores three plausible outcomes. Read more on Bloomberg.com or on the Bloomberg Channel. This is Big Bang. Steve's ability on the course may not be etched into any record books, but following him around, it's clear that it's not for lack of trying.

14202," It's clear that it's not for lack of trying. Geez. We were constantly hustling behind him as he caught up with executives in the portfolio companies and reminisced with former and current players. Here's a day trader himself, self-made day trader. And so he's on the bus after a game in New England and he's day trading on the bus and Bill, Billitechek season and cuts him on the spot. In many ways it's convention, right? So the people that I don't see maybe once a year. And so it's kind of all come together. My firm, our charity, have fundraising efforts and then the friends that are around. My dad and my brother, it's all happens right there as a confluence of all these parts of my life that have found its common center. A lot's happening on Wall Street. I think Che Powell said things that were indefensible. Need to catch up? This is Bloomberg Wall Street week. I'm David Weston. We've got the information and insights. We think that's the next secular shift. From business's most influential and instrumental. It's mocking it at the bullpen. It's a challenging dynamic. It's a level of uncertainty that we haven't had to deal with. Bloomberg Wall Street week live Friday with replays all weekend on Bloomberg Television and Radio. Wall Street prepares for the latest read on inflation. Peek-fad, peek-hole, kish-ness. We're getting carried away. The market's been right. Our rate hike starting to pay off. How long is it going to take to see progress on inflation? The long way to go. Instant reaction on Bloomberg surveillance. Inflation is still stick to US economy. And what it means for the Fed. The data will tell us. I think we're quite always away from the poll. This is a Fed that will play the prudent thing to do is to ease off a little bit and just have a look around. Inflation, in focus. Today on Bloomberg. Welcome back to Bloomberg's surveillance. Early edition on Matt Miller or Kayleigh lines here in New York and Edwards with us out of London. Now, I'm showing a chart. For those of you listening on radio, normally this would be a big move for a year or even multiple years. But it's less than a month. This is UK GILTS. These are the long 30 year GILTS. And we've gone from 360 basically to 500 in less than a month. Today we've gone down another 20 basis points in yield. And each day we're up or down 20 or more basis points. It's pretty insane. Joining us right now is Simon White, Bloomberg macro strategist. Adam London. Simon, what do you make of this incredible volatility? It's not just GILTS. We've seen this in the Treasury market as well. Yeah, liquidity across bond markets is falling through the four. Treasury markets, we'll see those liquid market in the world. It has very low liquidity right now. And the UK situation is more extreme. So the moves you're getting in UK GILTS are big, big moves. They have their own unique problems in the UK. But really, this is something that's more broadly systemic, I think, in the current environment. Simon, good morning. And what had been broadly systemic have been rate rises. Today we see GILTS, the yield on GILTS coming down across the curve. A little bit less tension in the markets for some reason. What are we watching for in the tenders that take place with the Bank of England today and tomorrow? They've done it at any point during this special provision. They're doing it for the pension sector. They did more yesterday than at any time. But they haven't got to the maximum that they can do in a day. What do we watch for here? I think they've laid the gauntlet. This is interesting because it's the first time really in a long time if I had the central bank pushing back against the market. For many, many years, the market's got used to throwing its toys out the pram. And once central banks have bigger facilities and easing and lowering rates and all the rest of it, this is really the first time I can remember where central bank has pushed back. So, you know, if the LDI funds can get what they need to get done by Friday, then we get into next week and there's been no major volatility. And I think that's quite interesting. Whether they can, because I was talking to one of our colleagues.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2428,2022-10-13 09:22:10
14203," The funds can get what they need to get done by Friday. Then, and we get into next week, and there's been no major volatility. And I think that's quite interesting. And it's hard to know, isn't it, whether they can? Because I was talking to one of our colleagues earlier who's saying there's just so much leverage, and nobody really knows how much. Nobody really knows, but in the other hand, you know that some of these, the people are running these funds, must have some idea what they need to do. Yeah, they do, yes. Kaylee. Well, Simon, speaking of central banks and markets being in contention, the Federal Reserve continues to say, don't bet on hikes in 2020, the market keeps betting on cuts. In 2023, how could the CPI data today inform or change that narrative? Yeah, I mean, the rates market is basically running this pivot, if you like, this sort of 2023 version and the curve. And so really the risks are the other way. And so if we do get a higher print today, I think that could create some fireworks. I think 10-year yield could easily go to 4%, and the curve will invert more. But really, the indicators are, that's not going to happen. If you look at all the sort of medium term indicators of inflation, for instance, survey expectations are falling. margins, which have been a huge driver of this inflation that we've got, have also been falling a lot, like things like use car dealers, freight distribution, all these sort of things. So the thing to watch really is the transport component. That's been really taking a lot out of inflation over the last few months, so that should continue to do so. As long as the shelter and food components don't rise too much to mitigate that, but General Tren does, is heading lower for now. OK, that sounds hopeful. Simon, thank you very much. Bumper, Simon White joining us there. And for more market analysis, check out MNIB Go. That is the function to use. If you want to find the market's live blog, there's plenty on there about UK GILTS. There'll be plenty on there about US CPI as well. This has been back. For a young person who now booking a career, would you recommend a Wall Street career today? There are not many jobs you can have as a young individual, but you're always, always learning. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the road today won't be electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building to cross America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels, we want to do that with our buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2429,2022-10-13 09:26:24

This is Bloomberg's surveillance early edition. I'm Kayleigh Lines with Matt Miller in New York and Anna Edwards in London. Now keeping you up to date with news from around the world, here's the first word. In Ukraine, the key region was struck by Iranian mid-drone today as aerated sirens rain out across much of the country for a fourth morning. Air strikes also continue to south. Meanwhile, allies and Brussels for a NATO defense ministers meeting are expected to offer more air defense capabilities for Ukraine in the face of Russia stepped up missile strikes. Meanwhile, the head of the IMF says Ukraine will need at least $3 billion dollars a month next year to finance its wartime economy, which means allies will have to give more support. At a meeting in Washington, Kristalina Gorgeva also warned developments in the war could push financing needs even higher. And American conspiracy theorist Alex Jones has been ordered to pay almost a billion dollars in damages after repeatedly claiming the 2012 Sandy Hook School shooting was a hoax. The Kinect Hit Trial was the second to hold Jones financially accountable for his lies about the massacre. Coming up, we'll get back to the markets ahead of today's crucial CPI data coming in just about three hours. Charlotte Ryan CCLA Investment Management co-head of investments joins us next. This is Bloomberg. The standard way venture firms work is you commit capital, let's say over a five-year investment period, something like that. Yeah, exactly. And then the fund just typically asks maybe 10 years or so. 15, well these days are longer. So often 15, often the tale extends out to 20 years. Okay. These companies take a long time to develop. And somebody that invests in a venture fund today should be trying to get rates of return of 20% what you say or more. You know top-end venture is sort of 3x net of fees. You ideally you're hoping for more than that. You're hoping for 5x or more. You're illiquid the entire time, right? So you hope to get paid for the liquidity. And today, maybe 20 to 40% if things go well is sort of baseline. Let's take another subject. Because that's supposed somebody says, I don't want to invest in Andrews and Horowitz. I want to be Mark Andrews. And how does somebody become a venture capitalist? What are the skill sets for good venture capital? So there's high degree of intelligence, hard work, a lot of luck, address the right part, don't wear a tie. What are the things that make one a good venture capitalist? So the super, the highly successful VCs historically are very idiosyncratic. You know people from very different backgrounds, Mike Morris is a former newspaper reporter, John Dore.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2430,2022-10-13 09:30:49
14205," You said make one a good venture capital. So the super the highly successful VCs historically are very idiosyncratic. You have people from very different backgrounds. Mike Morris is a former newspaper reporter, John Doris of former chip salesman. He's got people with very different indigenous and brighter has more of this kind of blue chip investment background. You have people with very different backgrounds and experiences. And so I think it's it's some set of skills and some set of knowledge. And then there seems to be a taste component to it that's really hard to measure and really hard to predict. Today's the FOs are reshaping the C-suite, positioning companies to meet the next generation of challenges, breaking out of traditional roles. One of the most important things is looking around the corner. Look for Chief Future Officer on Bloomberg. This is Bloomberg's surveillance early edition. Here's what you need to know. Taming inflation, investors await US consumer price figures today that may determine if the Fed will deliver a fourth straight outsized rate hike. Downing Street is playing the blame game. Quasicuarting says the B.O.E. will have to answer for any market turmoil that might erot when the Central Bank ends its bond buying program tomorrow. And as the IEA warns that OPEC plus CART made it the global economy into recession, US officials fear their Russian oil price cap plan may fail. I'm Anna Edwards in London with Matt Miller in Kaley Lines in New York. And of course, Matt, we're all waiting for the CPI print later on today. Any sense that we're peaking, any sense that rent can deliver any relief? Yeah, absolutely. We'll be tuned in. Glue to the screen for that release. Nonetheless, we don't see or maybe because of that, we don't see a lot of action in the markets right now. Futures are up about half a percent, but volumes very low. And volume in the cash market was very low yesterday as well. We came down to $35.77 at the close yesterday and we could see a little bit of a bounce from that. But I think a lot of traders are still expecting $75 basis points. So the number that we get today is going to determine what happens after the November meeting. Nonetheless, you could see big gyrations in stocks, in treasuries. Right now, we're holding pretty steady at $3.90. It's $389.65. Even 9X crude really isn't moving very much. It's only up 20 cents with all the back and forth between the president who has said there will be consequences for Saudi Arabia in terms of the production cut we got from the last OPEC meeting, Saudi Arabia responding, saying they have a noble work to do in terms of keeping the oil market balanced and it wasn't about signing with Russia. And then not much movement in Bitcoin. Of course, there doesn't seem ever to be any movement in Bitcoin at least the last few months. Right now, we're down just 8-10 of 1 percent, but still holding over the $19,000 range. And sorry, Kayleigh, what do you see in terms of the US market? Well, obviously we have CPI in focus today, but we also are going to be getting some earnings this morning, including from Delta Airlines, really the first official report we'll get from the airline sector here in the US. And ahead of those results, the shares are higher by about 2 percent. There may be some positive read through from the fact that the pre-report we got from American earlier this week was fairly strong. Elsewhere in the travel sector, though, not as much luck for Carnival cruise lines. It's down about 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2. And then two other stocks, really a sector worth mentioning this morning. Casino operators that are listed here in the US, but have big businesses in Macau. There is a lot of concern in Macau, not just about a weaker golden week holiday that just wrapped up a few days ago, but also around the COVID-0 policy perhaps persisting even after the party Congress is over. So as result, MGM win resorts each down a little more than 2 percent before the ballot. Kaley, European equity markets, then kind of in a holding patent waiting for the US CPI data. We sense also waiting for the latest developments around the UK guilt story. And let's deal with both of those. So this is where we are in the holding patent, not by just a quarter of 1 percent on European stocks this morning. The 30-year yield then dropping substantially. As we've talked about a number of times already on this program, we seem to see a bit of a standoff between the Treasury and the Bank of England both under pressure to change course. And both of them insist.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2431,2022-10-13 09:35:32
14206," We seem to see a bit of a standoff between the Treasury and the Bank of England both under pressure to change course and both of them insisting that they won't change course as we head towards the end of the bond buying program. That comes tomorrow. We've got today and tomorrow to deal with the bond market to deal with the long ends of the guilt market. That program from the Bank of England comes to an end tomorrow. That's what the BOE says. We're all going to be watching for the detail around how much of the guilt market the Bank of England is buying. They bought more than they have on any day so far in yesterday's session. Are they buying a lot today? Is that part of the reason we're seeing so much movement in the 30 year? Brent crude is up by 3 tenths of 1% the IEA giving us their view saying that they also think that that cut in production from OPEC plus could risk pushing up oil prices and therefore weighing on the global demand story and causing a recession. And as an international this is a global story around chips of course. There's been the tension between China and the United States and then we got an update from a US player of course which was talking about revenue difficulties. We also heard from TSMC. They've pulled back their estimates around capex so all of that Kayleigh adding up to further gloom for the chips sector. The gloom just keeps coming. It seems like a tidal wave of bad news in that sector in particular and frankly it seems like a tidal wave of news always in the UK as well. So let's continue that story discussion joining us is Charlotte Ryan CCLA investment management co head of investments. Charlotte every day it seems there is more volatility. We have seen six out of 15 trading days with a move of 20 plus basis points on the 30 year guild yield. How confident can you feel about investing in any UK asset right now? I think a bit of extreme to write off the entirety of the UK just because we're getting generations in the bond market. I mean clearly there's been some liquidity issues within the guild market. There's the huge moves that we've seen in response to the mini budget of clearly cause some issues within the pension funds and the banking was trying to calm that situation down. I think it's certainly the yields that we're getting to now within the UK certainly 30 year pushing through 5% is getting to a point where actually you think that's probably far enough and certainly the market's pricing in what 6% as a sort of terminal interest rate in UK, which I think is a pretty high level to be pricing in. So for the first time in probably years actually you're probably getting to a point where actually the market is looking a bit more interesting and I should show you a little bit more value. Charlotte I wonder if it's probably a little early to learn lessons from this given that we're still very much it seems in the in the depths of this crisis. But we had a question in from one of our viewers who read from it and it might be useful for international viewers to understand this who was asking about why pension funds are allowed to run leveraged bond positions. I know this is particularly related to define benefit schemes or DB schemes and it's quite it's quite complicated. We've heard from the regulator talking about how pension funds must learn lessons from this cash crunch. We also know for those schemes that higher interest rates can be positive for them longer term. It's in the short term that they have issues. I mean where do we think we turn for insights into why we've got to this position, Charlotte? I think the define benefit schemes which is the ones we're talking about here are basically in runoff that's not something which is a grown part of the pension scheme anymore and clearly what they've been doing is trying to, you know, put in something which in place which is which is hedging their liabilities. And what's upset them is the fact not that the bomb market yields are moving up, but they've moved up so rapidly. And I think it's that volatility and having to cover some of them with that collateral that has caused the issues. So in terms of sort of pension funds going forward, I suppose, you know, it's it's a question of making I think the funding is still there behind the goodest he's still there behind and longer term people are high bond yields. Yes, that means the liabilities are worth less effectively. So is a short term issue and hopefully some of the bank reading can sort out. And I think the big thing is that you're concerned about here, Charlotte, because from an international perspective, some trading desks telling Bloomberg that they've seen pressure on US corporate debt, for example, they've seen pressure on CLOs in Europe. And there've been all kinds of areas that they've seen pressure and rising yields as a result of what's going on here in the UK and the spillovers into those markets. And now I was reading also on the Bloomberg, there's concern around other areas of the shadow banking system in the UK, whether that's private equity or FinTech. Where do we look next for the next shooter drop, I suppose. And I think that is the big question, it isn't just a UK problem because the direction upwards and interest rates is driven US, it's true in Europe as well. And so we've had, you know, an era of.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2432,2022-10-13 09:39:38
14207," rates is driven the US, it's true in Europe as well. And so we've had an era of very cheap money. And so I'm trying to work out who is going to be most vulnerable to that, it's going to be quite hard. I think probably it isn't the banks this time because they've been so well recapitalized after the last crisis. I think if you've got businesses which are holding a lot of leverage, where that leverage needs to be refinanced in the short term, that could be a problem. So I think you need to be sort of slightly careful in which equities you're owning, making sure that they actually have those decent balance sheets. But certainly in the sort of the private markets, we don't have a great deal of visibility of what's been going on there. And so potentially that could be where some of these problems emerge. But it's very difficult from the outside to us, it's all in point where. Yeah, well we wouldn't have known how much leverage these pension funds are holding either if we hadn't had this little nicole here. Charlotte, it's not just about the UK, right? Yesterday, the US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said, and I quote, we are worried about a loss of adequate liquidity in the market, talking about the Treasury market. How insane is that? I know, it's quite surprising actually how illiquid some of these foreign markets are. And I suppose one of the big buyers that we've had in the market for the last few years has been central banks and they're stepping back. So that is that's a concern. So any of you moving to quantitative tightening, we don't really know what the implications of that will be because we've never seen it, we do it before. So I think it's going to be something again adding to that velocity in markets. Is it, you know, higher rates, the higher rates that we're already pretty much guaranteed from the Fed and the higher rates that we're seeing in these markets, are they going to make funding costs so expensive that it impounds, or compounds, I should say, the depth of the recession we're looking at. Yeah, and I think it adds on to that sort of margin pressure that you're likely to see in companies. Yes, they're funding costs are going to be going up. You know, mortgage rates moving through 6% in the US. If you're a corporate, you might have been, you know, borrowing it extremely, cheap levels, particularly the dunk end of the market. Now that's no longer true. You'll be struggling to get that funding. So adding onto that, you know, the energy costs which have moved up, you know, some of the various others sort of cost that've been moving up wages, of course, you know, looking pretty tight still. So I think it's going to be a difficult picture in terms of margins. I'm not sure that's entirely in numbers yet, which is why we're, you know, staying pretty cautious on the equity market overall. Charlotte, thanks very much. Charlotte Ryle and Joining us there from CCLA. Coming up on the program, we will turn full force towards the US CPI print. We'll talk to Steve Blitz, T.S. Longbar Chief of US Economist. He'll give us his perspective on the data to come. This is Gleenebeck. In the past two decades, China has built large infrastructure projects in almost every country in Africa. African governments themselves said we are tired of aid and charity. We want to do trade, we want to be treated like partners. The Chinese came along and said, great, we don't do aid in charity, we want to do business with you. Global gateway will mobilize 300 billion euros till 2027. Now the US and Europe are answering back with their own infrastructure initiatives to counter China, but African experts are skeptical. China has been that guy around the corner with, you know, a bouquet of flowers to Africa, the US, you know, Europe and the UK of time and time again say, be careful of the flowers you see out of the window. They have thorns on them. Bloomberg has enhanced search on the terminal to deliver what you need when you need it. Now.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2433,2022-10-13 09:43:47

So by moving at an aggressive but not an overwhelming pace, it allows us to get the fund right up to signal our commitment to keeping inflation in check and bringing it back down to 2%. But it also gives us some time to see how the economy is unfolding. Neil Cashkari, the president of the Minneapolis Fed speaking yesterday, joining us to talk more about the Fed and inflation the economy is Steve Blitz. He is chief US economist at TS Lombard. Steve, thanks so much for coming into the studio with me and Kayleigh Brighton early. What do you expect first off from the inflation print today? And how important is it in deciding the Fed's moves going forward? Well, the second part is easy to answer than the first. So not very much. The Fed always deals in three month moving averages. So it's going to look at this and if it's a great print, they'll say, okay, this is good news, but we need to see this for another two months before we actually believe this is a trend. And secondly, most people, and then also I think especially when you read through the minutes and you listen to what they're saying, the issue for them isn't inflation per se in terms of solving this problem. The issue is the imbalance in the labor market, right? And that's 3.5% on employment rate 288,000 jobs per month, which you think this is a great thing, but from the Fed's perspective, this is the root of the issue and that you're not really going to get inflation driving down towards 2% until the unemployment rate gets up to 4.5%. So 4.5 is where they want to go in order to control inflation. Those are their two mandates, right? Price, stability and jobs. They have made it pretty clear that they don't mind if they break some things along the way, right? The market previously expected to pivot and even a cut, but now everyone we've talked to has laid out the fact that they're going to raise rates to a relatively high level, 4.5%, 5% and hold there for a long time. Yeah, well, first of all, you can't get from 3.5 to 4.5% on employment, not breaking something, right? You just don't suddenly wake up and just drift to 4.5%. So yeah, something has to occur to get there. They're living on what they think is what I like to go there, 4.5% solution, right? So if they get 4.5%, at 4.5% or higher, the labor market is now working with them in terms of putting downward pressure on inflation. At a 4.5% or so, funds rate, right? They're like in line with that against inflation, with inflation running between 4.5% and now they've got unemployment above inflation, and they now have unemployment working with them. And then they could sit there in that position, right? And now they feel they've got all their stars aligned for inflation to go down, and then they'll follow the funds rate will then follow inflation down, staying like say 25, 50 basis points above the inflation rate. But as my grandmother used to say, man plans, God laughs. Yeah. Well, and sometimes market's laugh too. The BoE also would like to fight inflation, yet because of concerns around financial stability, they're running into some conflict in the UK, and you could make the argument as well that the Fed ultimately is going to have to make a choice between financial stability and the inflation fight. Do you really believe the inflation fight wins when it comes down to it? Yes and no. I think in the near term, the answer is yes, but that's also one of the reasons why you keep getting these sort of hawkish and dovish kind of comments from the Fed. The avenue to weaker growth is the F.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2434,2022-10-13 09:48:05
14209," That's why you keep getting these sort of hawkish and dovish kind of comments from the Fed. They, the avenue to weaker growth is the equity market, but they don't want the equity market to crash. They don't want the bond market to crash. So because then that puts them in the position where the BUE is right now, we're having to save markets so that markets can function with, sorry, not employable, and employ me too low, but more importantly, inflation too high. So that's one of the reasons they're guiding. There's an awful lot of massaging and politics that's going on in a lot of these statements, but when you read through it, they're very clear in terms of what they want to do and where they have to go, but yeah, they do not want to create financial market disruption. See, it's Anna in London, good to see you. So in terms of the unemployment story, I know that today we're waiting for the inflation picture and we don't lose sight of that, but you've made unemployment a key part of the Fed narrative here. You've talked about that. Give us the long view here and your expertise on what is driving the labor market and the tightness, because you pointed out that we're in the middle of some big socio-economic changes post-COVID, and that we need to reflect that. We can't necessarily expect normalization back to how things were. Right. So just that would take, you know, an hour's show. It's a thesis, yeah. But I think to keep it just on the unemployment, the problem at the unemployment market, not the problem with the change in the unemployment market is that the over 55 group, that employment population ratio dropped in which far below where it was in 2019, and those people aren't going back to work. Gen Z is coming into the marketplace now in the labor market, but that's a smaller generation than the millennials. So you've got a lot of people left, which is really baby boomers and the older end of Gen X. They're leaving the market at the big number, less of coming in. And in terms of importing workers, like H1BV, you know, Trump and everyone, they kind of blew that up during his administration. And without making a political argument, good, bad, or indifferent, the fact is it occurred. And it hasn't been unlocked. And it hasn't been unlocked. And it's very difficult. You guys probably know trying to bring an employee from somewhere around the world into working for you guys in New York is extraordinarily difficult now. So you've shifted the supply of labor. So you've got two choices, then. Either you unlock the supply of labor, which is a longer term issue. And that's something like brainer and everybody else is going to argue in terms of that's the ultimate solution to the employment issue. But in the near term, the way you break that is that you have to reduce the demand for labor. Fed thinks it's 4.5%. Summers, blanchards, others, myself, include it. Think it's probably closer to 5.5% where you bring that world back into balance. So talking of how things are different post-COVID, the labor market, yes. But also, what about just inflation? I mean, as a 2% inflation target, no longer appropriate for the world we live in now. Yes. And I think the Fed's going to get there. They can't get there now. They would just totally destroy the credibility. If they said, what was so special about 2% anyway, let's make 3% the target. So they put 2%. By that, I prefer 1% or none. Well, that's you. But I think what they'll say is that 3% is probably the better number. I look, the price to get back to understand how we got to 2%. We spent 20. We had this incredible surge globally of supply of productive capacity, which was greater than the increase in demand because of the low income in China, Russia, Eastern Europe, and all that. And so you had 25 years of zero growth in CPI goods, X-Footen Energy. And now that's flipped on its head. And now that's flipped on its head. And that's changed. And an awful lot because of economic security issues, the looks like a permanent upward shift in the cost of energy in Europe is all these things that bringing a lot of industry back to the US, which exacerbates the labor problem because now you're looking not for waiters and bus boys, you're looking for people who can work and manufacture factories and facilities.

14211," We're going to temper their hikes until they're positive that Core CPI has turned a corner and is headed down. Now what is the main driver of Core CPI at the moment? It's rent. By last month's print, it's now contribute to up to 40% of Core CPI and even headline it contributes over 30%. Now this is a bit worrying because it's yet to peak. And we know that because it's so sticky, as soon as we do hit a peak, we basically draw a straight line out four quarters to see when it might turn a corner. Now there's another reason why this is worrying and I have a graphic to show you here is that there is a debate about the validity of the bureau of labor statistics data. Now people are looking more and more at the private alternative measures of rental inflation, which just focus specifically on new rentals, which has skyrocketed over the BLS statistics. But most importantly, it has shown a peak. Now because the Bureau of Labor Statistics was so concerned about this debate, they released a working paper you can find it on their website, basically backing their methodology, saying, hey, we can back out this new tenant inflation data from our data set, but it comes in a four quarter lag. Meaning we might see another few more higher prints month on month until we start to study out. Now I'll leave you with this Anna Fed Williams last week compared inflation to peeling an onion. The first layer is commodities. The second is, we eventually hit core inflation. OK, excellent. There you go. So the many layers to the onion is the point and a Valerie Tite tell with the nice metaphor. I think we did it justice. We'll get back to that one after we get the inflation print. Perhaps this is bring back. Thanks. What do you say to the cynics that say, look, it's all nice and fine, but a lot of it is greenwashing and you're not a good company, you're just a less toxic company than some of the other oil majors. Well, the first thing to say is that, you know, I'm a big believer and we need to put ourselves in other persons' shoes in life in general and so I understand that point of view and I get that people have that perspective. I don't agree with that, obviously, but I understand where they're coming from. We have an enormous challenge as society which is to provide the world with reliable, affordable and clean energy. That's what society wants, that's what society needs and I believe in my heart that a company like BP is actually one of the few companies in the world who can actually make that happen. We can talk about the things that we're going to grow in over the coming years and I find it hugely exciting and energizing for our organization but that's what the world needs and you simply can't go against the grain of society, you can't defy gravity and that's why we're making the change that we're making.

14212," on the David Rubenstein Show. Here to peer conversations, I uncover the untold stories of the world's most successful leaders. Watch Wednesdays on Bloomberg Television. This is not just a UK issue. This bond route is going global. It's a big warning sign and it's a red flag and we should not just assume just because we're in the United States. We're immune from it. The pressure is going to mount on the Fed. We do think that there's a risk of a financial event that's going to feed into policy decisions. This is the most challenging fundamental backdrop we've had in 40 years. This is Bloomberg's surveillance with Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow and Lisa Arbramowitz. What a 24 hours we've got for you to close out the week. Life from New York City this morning. Good morning, good morning from our audience worldwide. This is Bloomberg's surveillance on TV and radio. Equity futures positive and positive. Half of 1% it is CPI Thursday and that number. A couple of hours away Lisa. Just to sort of set up how significant this could potentially be. The last time we got the CPI print on September 13th. We saw a 4.3% decline in the S&P. The greatest decline going back to June 2020 to give you a sense of how significant of a reset this number could be. Fold in the Federal Reserve minutes of yesterday. Yes. The risk of doing two little outweighs the risk of doing too much. Do you think that decision, that assessment, is coming a little bit closer into balance as we close out this year? There is more descent around the margins. There is this feeling that perhaps they're getting closer to a restrictive stance and they can start to worry about the financial stability concerns. It was interesting that they didn't give a nod. A nod is basically a generous way of saying they've basically touched on the fact that the rest of the world existed in those minutes. And is that the beginning of perhaps a little bit more of a balance with respect to these risks? Did you see the latest news out of the UK? The Chancellor now saying any volatility is going to be a little bit more of a negative thing. Any volatility after tomorrow is basically over to the governor. That's the word to the Chancellor. You basically said it's your fault. If there's a problem, this is your responsibility not ours. And we're going to keep doing what we're going to do now. What about you? It's a matter for the governor. What I find interesting is that he's saying this from Washington, DC. Because they're down for the IMF meetings. All of them, IMF coming out and absolutely eviscerating them. They're saying their budget is terrible. And all central bankers are saying right now it's fiscal policy makers responsibility to really get their world in order. And fiscal policy makers are saying, no, it's you guys. It's a matter for the governor. You guys figure it out. We'll catch up with T.K. and just a moment, Danny Washington, DC. Looking forward to doing that. Equity futures right now. Positive 4.10s of 1% on ESMP 500. As we go into the inflation day number, you have got a six day losing streak on ESMP. Can we break that at the moment we're snapping it for now? You would've unchanged on a 10 year 3.89.65 on 10s and euro. Just about positive, stronger. Euro dollar 97.25. Lies of firmer by 2.10 to 1%. And just to put that in a perspective, if we get a seventh consecutive decline on the ESMP 500, that will be the worst streak going back to February 2020. Wow. That's what Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid pointed out this morning very much in focus with respect to that loss or potential ongoing streak 8.30 AM. We do get that key CPI print for the month of September. I'm really watching core inflation. This is going to be stripping out food, stripping out energy. Can we get a new high, the highest levels that we've seen going back decades? What will that mean for a federal reserve that might be seeing some relief on the headline number with respect to energy, but not when it comes to rents, not when it comes to other basic expenses that people are paying every day. Today, there is an absolute mess in Washington, DC. Tom will go through it. But what isn't happening down there? There's the IIF, the IMF G20 meeting. I am particularly interested in a couple of interviews done at the IIF with JP Morgan CEO and Chairman Jamie Diamond and City Group Chair John Dugan. What kind of sense of systemic risk are they going to really highlight? A sense of not functioning in certain markets, like treasuries, for example, at least on the margins. And at 1 PM, we do get another auction, US is selling $18 billion of 30-year bonds. Yesterday's 10-year auction was not great. And you saw them sold at yields that were the highest John going back to 2009. And still, there was not blockbuster demand. Do you have the same kind of dislocation on the 30-year front? As the central bank...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2438,2022-10-13 10:05:49
14213," are them sold at yields that were the highest John going back to 2009 and still there was not blockbuster demand. Do you have the same kind of dislocation on the 30 year front? As the central bank step away we've got to ask a broader question who's stepping in? Exactly. Where does the buying come from and what price? We're finally returning to price discovery without the distortions of these guys and we're not there yet. This is part of the journey but it's certainly a very volatile one. And it goes to the point that you've made what happens when the risk is in the risk-free asset. How much does that change international markets? It gets very difficult to price ask actual risk assets and that's been the problem of the last several months, arguably the whole year. Tom Kane is down in Washington DC for us right now, TK, it's CPI Thursday. It's CPI Thursday John and 15 plus years are coming to these meetings, the April meetings and these annual October meetings. There's no question today John that CPI United States inflation is front and center for every single attendee of the IIF, the World Bank and the IMF. Today's an important day for us. We'll be speaking with the managing director. She has a full plate of risk and financial instability to discuss. Looking forward to the conversation Tom, we're going to catch up with you in the next hour again. Looking forward to that too. What a lineup down in DC and what a time for these conversations Lisa. It's such a difficult time. The message is really interesting from a lot of policy makers, central bankers who are saying, hey fiscal guys, it's on you and the fiscal guys coming out and saying, no, we're going to punt and how much can this really go on? Somebody has to blink. Who will it be? Joining us now in please to say is Peter Champ, well they had a global macro strategy trading at Mazewoo. Peter, fantastic to catch up with you, sir. If one is a catch up for a number of weeks now, can you do identify? How per side identify? The spillover from what's happening in the UK, out to international markets, perhaps even US credit? Yep, yep, absolutely. I mean, the the invention UK has meant that there has been selling a global risk asset. If it's liquid, it's been sold. And that's the transmission that we've seen. And that's why on Bank of England, by-backed stories, it has a material impact across US risk assets and risk assets in other jurisdictions. What we haven't seen yet is much by way of fear of replication of the issue that we've got with UK LDI in the rising real rates environment. And that taking place in the US or in Europe. So I don't think that those equivalent investors are anywhere near as large as the UK LDI in terms of their proportion of the domestic market. But I think the mechanisms are the same. I think as we go into the rising real rate environment, that generally the pension fund community is going to be selling assets. They they they have an excess of surplus of assets at the moment as real rates go up, go up, their their liabilities go down. And that is going to continue this this move will be in a much more orderly manner in non-stirring markets. Peter, how much is this the tip of the iceberg and how much is this a note of leverage that's been mostly beaten out at a time of incredible turmoil both on the fiscal and monetary policy of the UK? Yeah, it is all about leverage in hindsight. Really, this is something that I suspect the Bank of England has been considering when it's been trying to state its monetary policy because it has always puzzled me as to why their inflation forecast was way below the sort of inflation forecast that I was using internally. And basically, while they're having this dovish slant to their monetary policy, I think let's come to bite them now because they've stored up all of this inflation risk premium, which is eventually meant that the you know, given this fiscal surprise from the government then caused the big blurping guilt that we're all now experts on. And I think that what we had in the UK really is symptomatic of what is happening elsewhere, but it's just in the UK, the cost of liquidity is that bit more greater. So the market is that bit more fragile than dollars and euros. So the move has been really exaggerated. Yes, I don't believe. Well, and yesterday something interesting happened. Initially, there was a huge sell-off in guilt, guilt, guilt, and you saw 30-year-olds climb to new highs of this particular economic cycle. And then suddenly it reversed and it came after some sense that the bank of England.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2439,2022-10-13 10:09:53
14214," And you saw 30-year yields climb to new highs of this particular economic cycle. And then suddenly it reversed. And it came after some sense that the Bank of England was buying with no bids rejected. This feeling that finally they were going to come in basically un-unbarred by any particular parameters in terms of staving off some of the distress. How much is that going to be what they have to do? Basically going against their mandate of removing quantitative easing and go back to it in order to get financial stability over the longer term because as you said they are not all the way done with these LDI issues. I don't think they're there. I don't think that they're a price-intensive buyer. Their operational procedures tell us exactly what the price level that they would buy at. It's yesterday's trade-web closed. And at the moment with the rally that we've had in Guilts today, it should mean that if the market stays where it is then between 2015 and 245 they'll be buying about zero and then the market could well reverse off that. So it's a very, very technical market but I think we're still going to be moving away from this financial intervention towards asset sales from the Bank of England. I think perhaps some more important question is are asset sales of long maturity guilt? So 20-year-plus, are they feasible in the environment where the LDI community is still somewhat fragile? I suspect that they're not and so we may see the quantitative tightening and asset selling program of the Bank of England modifies slightly to reflect that. But I feel really strongly that the only way that these inflation problems that the UK has and basically the twin deficits we're not the US dollar is going to be resolved. Is with much higher real rates? I think real rates need to get up to about two and a half percent. And 10-year UK real rates is in the low one percent at the moment. It's got to be above where the dollar market is. I think just to be clear, I just want to jump in because what you just said is really important. You think QT still starts at the end of this month. Now I understand you think it's recalibrated, perhaps was short-adated, Guilts. But do you also think this guilt market operation ends tomorrow? And if it does, can you tell me what the price actually is going to look like? I guess that's the trillion dollar question between tomorrow and then. Well, I can't see it being worked out without there being more volatility in the market. If this market behavior continues where the Bank of England is there with a known price level that they're willing to buy at, then I suspect these generations are going to be quick today and tomorrow. And we could be quite underwhelmed with how much they buy today. But then come Monday with that support no longer there. I think the market will struggle to find a clearing level. And we could well have real yields going up higher. Now the question is, has the LDI community delevoured and liquidated enough for them to be able to withstand margin calls? Cover ratios have gone up. They now have a surplus of assets. So which is great. I suspect that they could well be rebalance. And what we can now move into is further sell off of guilt. So I think the 10 year nominal yield probably gets to 5% without it causing distress for the LDI community going forward. But it still means that rates have to go up to a much higher regime. Hey Pete, we've got to leave it there. Thank you, Sir. Peter Chantwell of Mazewag. It's very relaxed about something that sounds pretty crazy. Well, it's so- It's so understanding. He's like, there'll be more volatility other people are saying it's going to crash the market. They're going to have to come in with something to say. How many people have you heard say that they think QT actually happens? Exactly. Very few people. People saying that they're going to have to reverse it.

14215," With the first word, I'm Lisa Mateo. The International Energy Agency says OPEC's decision to sharply curtail oil production threatens to push prices to levels that tip the global economy into recession. The head of the IEA oil market division spoke to Bloomberg. We're not calling on OPEC to, we're not setting their policy obviously. This is for the OPEC to decide. But what we're saying is that by cutting supplies, cutting supplies through the market, it's preventing a rebuilding of inventories that are still critically low. Demand is now expected to contract by 340,000 barrels a day in the fourth quarter. The U.S. is considering a total ban on Russian aluminum in response to the military escalation in Ukraine. Bloomberg has learned that the Biden administration is weighing a number of options, including an outright ban or a large increase in tariffs. Prices surge to a record in March after Russia's invasion. Russia is second only to China as a producer of aluminum, which is crucial crucial's most heavy industries.

Apple's delaying its next major iPad software update, iPad OS 16, by about a month from September to October. Apple made the decision for a number of reasons, including a still buggy, stage manager multitasking interface, and in order to link the launch closer to the more similar Mac OS Ventura. Still, it's an unusual move. Since shifting the launches to the fall in 2011, Apple has released its new iPhone and iPad software updates simultaneously each year around September. By staggering the releases, users may find some issues around compatibility with cross-device features like retracting and editing messages in iMessage, the new shared iCloud photo library, and the new feature for transferring FaceTime calls between iPhones and iPads. It will also make it a bit harder for developers to launch apps that run on both the iPad and iPhone that require new APIs and features found across iPad OS 16 and iOS 16. Regardless, it was still of course the right move. Image Manager and iPad OS 16 is still quite buggy, I don't find it particularly intuitive, and it's not compatible with most iPads and many third party apps on the app store. The feature clearly needs some more polish, and complaints from consumers about stage manager will now no longer probably overshadow the earlier launch of the iPhone 14.

So by moving at an aggressive but not an overwhelming pace, it allows us to get the fund right up to signal our commitment to keeping inflation in check and bringing it back down to 2%. But it also gives us some time to see how the economy is unfolding. Fed speak is my favourite. That was no cash carry of the Minneapolis Fed. Lisa, what's the difference between aggressive and overwhelming? What's the difference? What's the difference between financial stability and process recovery? I mean, honestly, all of these things, it's very difficult to do. If someone's aggressive to you, isn't that slightly overwhelming? It depends. I think it's aggressive. The Fed speak drives me nuts. We're doing this aggressively, but it's not overwhelming. I promise you. Well, this is against the difference between when does it become a financial stability problem? And the line is a lot thinner than people had realised when you talk about what the pricing is and what financial stability is, hard to know with a differential there. CPI coming up in two hours and 12 minutes time, coming into that number, the price action shaping up as follows on ESMP 500, 6th day losing streak on ESMP and to Thursday.

Crude 87.40, by a little more than a tenth of 1%. Have you seen the statement from the Saudis? Yes, I've seen it. They are not back in a way at all. Listen to this quote here from the Saudis. I'll read you the full paragraph. The Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia would also like to clarify that based on its belief in the importance of dialogue and exchange of views with its allies and partners outside of OPEC+. And the group, regarding the situation in the oil markets, the Government of the Kingdom clarified through its continuous consultation with the US administration that all economic analyses indicate that postponing the OPEC+. The Saudi decision for a month, according to what has been suggested, would have had negative economic consequences. The Saudis right now are telling us that the US administration requested a one month delay to the decision. Now, the Canada is not lost on anyone. Right. It's the midterms next month. Okay. So on one hand, this is Saudi Arabia either throwing President Biden under the bus or showing that he's politically motivated and that any of his job owning is politically motivated. On the flip side, you also got an IEA and international energy agency reported out this morning, parading with the administration. It says, been saying the OPEC+. In fact, they're cutting production right now risks a price spike. Is this a matter of geopolitical fragmentation with alliances getting on either side or is this an issue of perhaps OPEC+. As you've pointed out, being the plus, the Russia alliance, given the time and the conflict with Ukraine. Well, Kennedy joined us now at Al-Alantern. And we're going to have to go to the Olympics for a year and one of our best. Hey, well, it's not getting any calmer, is it? No, this riff between Washington and ReAD is, it's plain for everyone to see a war of words, a diplomatic spat. However, you want to phrase it. It's pretty extraordinary for them to put out a public statement showing the inside of their diplomatic relationship with Washington. And it suggests a lot of bad feelings on both sides. And what does this mean in terms of what the reality is? I mean, who do you trust well in terms of? Who's the correct actor in response to supply and demand? And who potentially is either politically motivated?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2442,2022-10-13 10:22:59
14217," in terms of what the reality is. I mean, who do you trust well in terms of who's the correct actor in response to supply and demand and who potentially is either politically motivated or acting out of a lack of capacity to produce oil, even if there were an increased demand? Well, I think that both sides can credibly argue their position there. Saudi Arabia is keen to keep prices strong and very worried about the potential impact of monetary policy and the slowdown in the global economy and thinks that the prudent thing to do to ensure stability in the markets is to cut now before your Facebook over supply. On the other hand, Washington will see it differently. Biden has been incredibly focused on gasoline prices and in fact achieved a lot. Prices fell for a number of months. It will be worried about that reversing and it's very concerned and has made clear its concern about the potential of a price spike over the winter as Europe grapples with its energy crunch, putting demand on oil too. And as European sanctions on Russian oil kick in in early December, a big, big change to the way the global oil trade works. Well, amid this political fog and frankly the fog of different idiosyncratic markets for the diesel market, prices still surging on the heels of lack of refinery capacity, there's a question of just what the inventories look like. And I point to the I.E.A. report showing that in developed nations, inventories are 243 million barrels below their five-year average. Can you give us a sense of how significant this is, how vulnerable this makes developed nations heading into a winter where there are a lot of questions about capacity to supply a lot of the developed world. I think a point that the I.E.A. and as a representative of consuming nations, including the U.S. and Europe would make, is that with inventories that much lower, it's an odd decision for OPEC to cut back on production and the I.E.A. is clearly highlighted the risk of inventories falling through the winter and into next year and the vulnerability to the market. Diesel is a particular problem and I think it's something that people need to be very alive to. It is a lack of refining capacity and that's being exacerbated right now in Europe by strikes at French refineries. The market is very sensitive. There was a flaring incident at a big refinery in Holland this morning and that kind of thing gets people jumpy when you're operating a system at maximum capacity, accidents and unexpected incidents matter. Now that tightness exists in the U.S. as well. There's a lot of concern about diesel stocks especially in the Northeastern U.S. where heating oil is used to heat homes and a lot of diesel is going from the U.S. to Europe. So it's a difficult situation and I think we've seen different parts of the energy complex flare up over the last year. Diesel is somewhere where we need to concentrate our attention in the months ahead. Well just a final word on the SPR. This administration has drained the SPR to four decade lows. They've accused OPEC plus of being short-sighted but I just wonder if that accusation could be leveled at this administration as well. Aren't they now more exposed to the whims of OPEC plus next year because of how much they've drained the SPR this year? Yep, it's the problem of fighting an issue with flow with stocks. Your stocks run down very quickly and you can argue that the SPR intervention in some senses has been successful at a time of a thermal in energy markets that has kept gasoline prices low. But of course as you say John, there is a downside and to use a metaphor they will run out of bullets. So they need to hope that next year there is a bit of giving the oil market that maybe OPEC has another look at the market or new supply comes on from elsewhere. But at a time when shell production appears to be slowing it is a difficult perhaps situation ahead. Well Kennedy, thank you Sir, Adeland and incredibly difficult, very complex but the decisions that are being made now arguably make things more fragile next year. Not just for the OPEC plus decision and the oil markets but also for gas in Europe. We keep treating this stuff as one off shark. At the same time the politicians are telling you that it's a huge permanent shift away from Russian energy as a source. So you have to ask yourself how viable are some of these policies coming out of these countries.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2443,2022-10-13 10:27:12
14218," Oh, get at the same time the politicians are telling you that it's a huge permanent shift away from Russian energy as a source. So you have to ask yourself, how viable are some of these policies coming out of these countries? Europe, as a region, and America, as a country? Well, and this is a reason why the IEA pointed to the storage capacity and the fact that it's come down so dramatically, or the storage, the inventories have come down so dramatically around the world. But at what point, and I feel for policymakers in this capacity, because they don't want there to be a complete recession in the face of surging household prices for oil and gas. At the same time, how quickly can they really bring other supplies online? A viable energy policy is consistent with getting reelected. Viable long-term strategies over energy, they're consistent with getting elected on a very short-term calendar. Well, this is the problem, and probably the reason why there hasn't been that kind of investment. And now, can they make the investment with money that is a lot more expensive to borrow?

14219," a young individual. With your always, always learning. MUSIC Today's CFOs are reshaping the C-suite, positioning companies to meet the next generation of challenges, breaking out a traditional role. One of the most important things is looking around the corner. Look for Chief Future Officer, on Bloomberg. Inflation data two hours away in the United States for America, live from New York City this morning, Good Morning is the price action on the S&P. Six days of losses into Thursday, we are positive by half of 1% on the S&P. On the NASDAQ, we're up by two tenths of 1%. We are going to be high-percentive to the inflation print two hours from now in the bond market going into it. Two's, tens and 30, shaping up as follows on a 10-year yield. You're a yield right now, unchanged at 389.85 on a two-year. Just short of 430, just short of the highs of the year at 429.53. Lisa, core. That's the focus. Core month over month for Wall Street. As we often say, the front pages will go with headline year over year CPI. We're looking at Core month over month, and I have to say, the expectations on Wall Street, they're not looking for a major pullback, are they? No, they're looking for actually potentially new highs of the past four decades in terms of core inflation. And because of some of these longer lagging types of indicators like rent. So then, what's the response in markets, right? The last time we got an upside-surprise, markets sold off at the fastest pace going back to June of 2020. Is it the same or is suddenly, it's not necessarily clear what the Fed does with this other than what they've already communicated? You have to imagine if we get a significant downside of the last six months or so. Not just for this market, but for the guilt market too. Believe it or not, the Treasury market, guided by what's happening with the guilt market too at the moment, and I think you will understand why. The yields on guilt to the moment on a 30-year, down by 19 basis points, 463. The volatility in that market, I don't remember it being this volatile. The chancellor had this to say, late yesterday evening in Washington, any fresh thermal and markets would be quite a lot of money. And I think it's a lot of money. But in Washington, any fresh thermal and markets would be, quote, a matter for the governor. They should matter for the governor. I mean, what aligned from the chancellor in a difficult moment for this bond market? That a lot of people, including the IMF, and you can argue that it was perhaps out of their mandate to be able to say this, a lot of people point the fingers at the budget, that this is their issue. This has nothing to do with the Bank of England and their decisions, at least, over the near term. It's everyone's issue now. Martin Will joined the professor of economics at King's College, London, and former Bank of England, the Monetary Policy Committee member. Manifantastic to catch up with you. Let's start broad and let's start here. How difficult is it to preserve financial stability and address inflation simultaneously? Well, historically, of course, it has been possible to address inflation and preserve financial stability. The difficulty we're seeing at the moment is that the Bank of England is having to try and manage the chaos that the government has been creating in the bond market. And what the Bank of England would normally do would be to put up the bank rate to manage inflation. And of course, that doesn't feed directly through to the 30-year rate, but it's at the long end of the market where we've been seeing all these problems. And it's at the long end of the market that the implications are greatest to the pension funds, of course. Martin, do you think that this Bank of England can really start quantitative tightening with the financial stability concerns that we've seen? I must say I do wonder. Certainly, you might say why be buying in a lot of government debt in October to start quantitative tightening slightly later. So we may see a pause on that. It's the NPC meeting, or possibly here earlier, about that. And of course, if that happens, then the argument for raising interest rates a bit more becomes all stronger. Do you think that Governor Bailey has messed up in terms of communication over the past two weeks, given the back and forth of possibly talking with clients or talking with big investment firms in back rooms and saying perhaps we could extend the program, and from then on, there's more government.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2445,2022-10-13 10:36:04
14220," Given the back and forth of, you know, possibly talking with clients or talking with big investment firms in back rooms and saying perhaps we could extend the program, the emergency program coming out with additional emergency measures and then with a shock warning saying you guys have three days left just to remind you get your ducks in order creating a bit of chaos. Do you think that he created an unnecessary degree of confusion and markets? Well, I think he's been trying to manage an extremely difficult situation. Of course, where we will be if the problems do continue next week is unclear. My guess is that the bank of England will have up its sleeve some form of more targeted intervention, but it is very much saying that the pension funds that need cash can raise cash in favourable circumstances at the moment. And my guess is that if they don't then the bank of England might make cash available but on less favorable terms. And we talked a lot about how resilient the system is post GFC. I wonder if we look at this episode of the last couple of weeks and ask ourselves questions about how fragile it might be. And a lot has been said about this administration, this government in the UK, a lot of criticism worldwide. It's all been pouring in. But Martin, what are the lessons we need to learn about how fragile, how resilient the system actually is? Well, I suppose what none of us had expected would be that the system would face the sort of political shock, political economic shock that we've seen from Liz Truss' government. So the assumption had been that the institutions were strong, well they have reasserted themselves, but the damage has been done. So I mean my view is that what we've learned is that if you get a government that pursues say very idiosyncratic policies, then you can have problems. And that's the sort of issue that perhaps no people designing institutions have a thought of trying to protect themselves against. The Bank of England is now in a very, very sticky spot. We're looking at the commentary coming from the governor and I get the sense Martin. I want to review share this view that they seem to be very sensitive about contributing towards perceived fiscal dominance. And Martin, in a way, I wonder whether there's a risk here that they overdue it trying to push back against that and abdicate some of their responsibility when it comes to financial stability. Martin, can you walk me through how you gauge that kind of thing, that dynamic, those dimensions over the last week or so? Well, I think everything is a tightrope, wrote. Obviously at a time when inflation is high, the Bank of England must have been extremely unhappy about introducing measures that know for all the different circumstances, look in their structure very much like quantitative easing because as we know quantitative easing adds quite a lot to demand. It was intended to add to demand and it works. And the Bank of England is certainly extremely nervous that people might think politicians might think that it's going to put a lid on long term interest rates in the long term. And if you do that, it does look very much like fiscal dominance, the function of the Bank of England would then become to provide the credit that the government needed instead of what it is, what's established in law and practice to control inflation. So the Bank of England is extremely nervous about that and with good reason, they want the focus to be on their monetary role controlling inflation and they don't want anyone to think that their job is to get the government out of self-prereated difficulties. So they've got to choose the less cerebral now and I think that's really difficult, Martin, because they're stuck between a rock and a hard place. I'm sure you'd agree with that. If financial stability requires some kind of permanent facility from this Bank of England, are we sitting here and suggesting they may not be willing to provide it because they're too worried about how that might be perceived? Well, in so far as we think of the problems with pension funds, of course, high interest rates actually make life easier for pension funds in the longer term. The problem is liquidity at least as I understand it and to the extent that the problem is liquidity, there are a number of ways in which the Bank of England can provide liquidity. Martin, just final question. The Bank of England decision on November 3rd. As a former policymaker, let's put you around the table again. How would the events of the last month influence?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2446,2022-10-13 10:40:09
14221," Martin, just final question. The Bank of England decision on November 3rd. As a former policymaker, let's put you around the table again. How would the events of the last month influence your decision about how big a rate hike we need? Well, I think one thing that's going to influence decisions is what's actually announced in the fiscal statement on 31st of October. And I think it was very deliberate that that's ahead of the NPC meeting so that the NPC can take that into account. But, no, suppose in those circumstances the Chancellor doesn't offer any coherent way of balancing the budget. Then I would be inclined to a stronger interest rate increase than would otherwise be the case. Because of course an unbalanced budget is adding to demand in the economy. The Bank of England needs to restrict demand in order to bring inflation down. I'm sure you wish you weren't on this NPC. That's for sure. Very lucky. Fortunately, perhaps. Martin Will, thank you. If King's College of London, can you imagine being on this NPC right now? When you were asking really good questions and important questions about facilitating their monetary regime or their fiscal regime of this particular administration, how much consensual banks push back against the past two decades when they facilitated the borrowing benches of administrations around the developed market? But inflation wasn't a problem then, right? That's correct. So at what point can they stand up to the fiscal regime and say, this is your problem? And oh, by the way, if we have a financial stability problem, we're not going to step in because we can't, because inflation is a bigger issue and that is our primary mandate. How what's their sort of correction mechanism with fiscal authorities at a time when the fiscal authorities are saying actually central bankers, it's on you. It always has been to go for it. They have a duty to provide financial stability. If markets aren't functioning, they have a duty to do something about that. And their concerns about perceived fiscal dominance. Surely they would have to be set aside to fulfill their obligation to stabilize market functioning. You can't just abdicate that because you're worried about how decisions elsewhere might be perceived. But it's not necessarily abdicating. There is a question of whether they can. Right? Are they basically burning cash through a feudal enterprise of trying to create financial stability while doing something at the same time of combating inflation? How much is that what we're seeing right now in the United Kingdom where they didn't get the response of people actually selling in bulk and remedying the issue quickly? And now they're stuck between Iraq and a hard place of whether to extend some sort of emergency program indefinitely, even if there's no take up just as a possible cushion and then not be able to quantitative tightening. This goes back to the first question we asked of Martin Will. How do you balance financial stability concerns with addressing inflation? And many people have said it's a challenge. Other people have said it's possible. Others just say it's almost impossible. And how much does it politicize central banks that have only been successful with a significant modicum of independence? And this is really going to be a huge issue also at a time when there is this call from our central bankers, please fiscal policy makers reduce your debt make our job easier. Given the size of their balance sheets, given everything they've done in the last 10 years, the idea that they weren't going to take stick from policy makers, politicians, elected officials was ridiculous. And many people want to give that for the last decade. Have them wait. You will want. You've been warning about that for a long time. Well, this is this look at now. Now the roosters are coming home to rooster. What is it? The chickens something something like that. Then you can rethink the capons, the capons are coming home. What are they called? I'm just okay.

Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building to crowds America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels, we want to do that with our buildings.

The passive doesn't dominate in the same way. Correct. Market can't wait it indices in a world like this one with higher interest rates. Doesn't work in the same way.

We start strong today as we move to the managing director later this morning. Dr. Lipski, thank you so much for joining. It's always a pleasure. You were the only one breathing who actually was at Plaza Accord. Everybody at the media is having a media frenzy. We need another Plaza Accord in that. I don't want to go into a long discussion on this. But how do you respond to people that say we need 1982, 84, 85 again? People forget the role of the Plaza Accord. The market had started taking what was perceived as an overvalued dollar down beginning in February of 1985. The issue at the Plaza was were the major central banks going to try to stop markets from taking it lower. It wasn't to initiate some new movement in markets. And in Plaza they decided no. We're happy with it going lower. Right. Later they tried to say at the Louvre Accord, stop. That's enough. No attention and carried on. Let's go from the set time of Solomon Brothers through all of your work to where we are now. In the common theme, and I go back to your important Hanoi speech when you first joined the IMF, is Accord. And one of the things about Plaza Accord is everybody was on the same page. You would suggest the distinguishing feature right now in this crisis is the discord that you know. Yes, or put better. Everyone's focused on their own problems that they perceive are somewhat different than the others. There's a sense, yes, we have to fight inflation, yes, etc. But the sense of collaboration and effective cooperation is that was present for example that the global financial crisis is notable for its...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2449,2022-10-13 10:53:17
14224," But the sense of collaboration and effective cooperation that was present, for example, at the global financial crisis, is notable for its absence right now. If you remember, it says it's every nation for itself. So here we are. We're taking examples. The chaos in Britain now is noted. Has that surprised you? Yes, of course. But it all goes to show there in the markets there. When you put them under stress, you find faults and weaknesses that haven't been perceived previously. What are the faults and weaknesses in the United States right now? We sort of said, we have the value of the dollar. Yes. It's in the seniorage of the dollar as well. We seem to have an easy road right now. Do you believe it is? Relatively speaking. And of course, in exchange rates, it's always relative to what? The US is self-sufficient in energy. It is a major commodity producer. And basically, it doesn't seem to have the same kinds of demand problems that others do. So it's in relative terms, the problems seem tractable. So it's not so surprising that the dollar's been going on. Keep point now, and this is your wheelhouse. If you look at dollar strength, and the weaknesses in emerging market, is it the same as before? Are there ghosts of the 90s here? Or what is the distinction now of Philippine pace on your 60 Korean one moving up as well in the others? Back then, in the 90s, there was a lot of borrowing by emerging economies in foreign currency, especially the dollar. Hence of a heightened sensitivity to movements in US interest rates. That's still present, and that's still important. But it's in the broader context of the global economic developments that is creating problems for some emerging economies, not all emerging economies, but many of low-income economies that don't produce energy and import commodities and have dollar debt or foreign currency debt are in a bad way. John, Lisa, I want to get out front here with Dr. Lipsky today. On my first question to the managing director, we're going to go Matthew here, which you can do out of the Wesley. The Wesleyan math was killer years ago. To me, it's all about the X-axis and everyone's going so fast. Have you been surprised at the urgency of central banks to get up to a legitimate real interest rate? Are they moving too fast, trying to get too much done too quickly? We'll only know that in hindsight. What's clear is they were slow to get off the dime. And now they have to act in a way to convince markets that they're really serious about maintaining anti-inflationary policies. So they're rushing to get to a place that they think they want to be. They're rushing. What's the damage of rushing? Oh, the damage could be too fast or too far. But we have to realize that a year and plus ago, no one saw the surge in inflation coming. So our understanding of the process of price formation is clearly deficient right now. John Ferros and my ears saying we're out of time because it's inflation day in America. It's inflation for his people. Yeah, but remember, that's a backward looking number and that's all I'm saying forward. I'll let you tell John Ferro that. Thank you so much. And keep waving at people as you walk by here. I think they want you to come back. John Lipski with the Sierra the former first deputy managing director of the IMF is public service to America is noted. John, it is inflation Thursday. It is a backward looking number. Tom Keen, thank you, sir. T. Can the latest talent. DC, wonderful conversation. Should we tell everyone that at the top of the next hour? What you get at 830 Eastern time is a relevant. It's backward looking. It said that's what this Fed responds to now. And that's why it's so important. And that's what markets are going to respond to as well. So that's why it's also so important. How much is it backward looking and how much are the tea leaves of what's to come and the trajectory and the momentum behind certain indications. People looking for example at used cars as a way of getting a sense of how much consumer appetite is declining. And how much does that sort of link into the story that we have been talking about with assets falling? We were just talking about BlackRock. Sure. The assets falling. This idea that people feel less wealthy. And they're going to do less with that. It's the compositional story of CPI that matters to pretty much everyone. Particularly for Ryan. Particularly for Ryan.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2450,2022-10-13 10:57:34
14225," The assets falling, this idea that people feel less wealthy. And they're going to do less with that. It's the compositional story of CPI that matters to pretty much everyone, particularly for iron eggs and for margins too. What part of the inflation story fades and what sticks? And if these companies lose pricing power at the same time, Wayne just remains sticky, then we've got a problem for earnings, right? Margin's going to be difficult, and a lot of people on the equity side are delivering that warning going into this earnings season, and very worried about the guidance that comes with it. The next quarter and for next year too. Live from New York, inflation dates are about 95 minutes away. This is Blimpag. Today, what are the biggest challenges for General Dynamics? And what are the biggest opportunities? So I think in any business, the challenges are solving complex problems that come to you. The problems that come to me and my senior leadership team for resolving tend to be highly complex and neilsome. So your ability to solve those complex problems is an important element. I think of the value that we add to the company. And then I think opportunities, you always want to make sure that you've got a creative enough mind and open enough mind to be able to see around square corners. What am I missing? The why questions are really powerful. Why are we not doing this? Why are we doing this? I ask those questions a lot. And in the answers, you can sometimes tease out some real opportunities, some hidden things. But thinking creatively about opportunities and problems is really important. And what about the industry generally? I think they have big challenges now as the defense budget probably comes down a bit. So I think that we are all responsible and we have an obligation to find the latest and best technologies that we can for our customers and deliver them in the most cost effective manner we can. And I think that that's a challenge and an opportunity for all of the big defense companies. So I think that's why I would like to share more of this. High f 나도 company. Yes? What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? It means they have a Bloomberg. This is not just a UK issue. The Fondreau is going global.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2451,2022-10-13 11:01:51
14226," This is not just a UK issue, this bond route is going global. It's a big warning sign and it's a red flag and we should not just assume just because we're in the United States, we're immune from it. The pressure is going to mount on the Fed. We do think that there's a risk of a financial event that's going to feed into policy decisions. This is the most challenging fundamental backdrop we've had in 40 years. This is Bloomberg surveillance with Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow and Lisa Abramowitz. CPI data 90 minutes away, live from New York City. Good morning, good morning from our audience worldwide this morning. This is Bloomberg surveillance on TV and radio. Here in New York City alongside Lisa, I'm Jonathan Farrow, equally futures negative, a half of 1% or rather positive, a half of 1%. So used to say negative because we've had six straight days of it coming into Thursday. And if we have a seventh, it'll be the longest losing street going back to February of 2020, just give you a sense of how unusual hitting the lowest levels since late 2020 yesterday, yet again. We say this often that the headline number on inflation is for the front page of the newspaper that call month over month is what this market is focused on. Let's start with core. Core is going to probably increase that as the market expectation. If you start to feel it perhaps we've seen peak inflation on the headline number, but not necessarily in the core, what does that do for the Fed? Does that mean that they have to be more aggressive and kind of squelch those voices on the outside, saying, oh, get a little bit worried about what's happening with financial stability. Looking for another 75 after this ultimately, ultimately people are looking for 75. There is a greater number of Wall Street analysts who are pointing to perhaps a 50 after that, but we will have to see what these are. It's the step down bullish if the economy's rolling over with it. So Ben Leidler was saying that that's actually going to be the light at the end of the tunnel. And then Mike Wilson says that that light at the end of the tunnel is freight train coming straight out. If you're very bearish like someone like me, futures, half a one percent, yes, and P500, cross asset price action looks a little something like this in the bond market, shaping up as follows. Your yields coming about a basis point three, 88, 83. You've got those complaints about stop being so bearish. And I'm like, what would you prefer that I was bullish all year and be wrong and be wrong and like just pretend everything's okay? Well, if you'd been bullish maybe everybody else would have made some profits. Not my views either. I'm just literally just bringing the view from say, Morgan Stanley who's saying X and comparing it to the bulls who have been wrong, who are saying why? It's your fault that people lost money today. And yes, it's true. And yes, it's true. And it's true for. It's true for me. And it's true for me. And it's true for me. And I'm flattered that people think I even make a difference. Well, perhaps with the way that we see the CPI numbers come in, we'll give people a bit of a proof maybe. Although I'm actually struggling to understand what the market response could be that would be overwhelmingly positive unless we get an incredible downside surprise. US September CPI report comes out at 8.30 a.m. we are watching core. The expectation is for it to rise to 6.5% from 6.3% year over year. An upside surprise could potentially cause significant pain and a downside surprise. Again, we will question, does this mean that the economy is rolling over very quickly? Is it say positive thing or a negative thing today? Who is not in Washington, DC? A global finance leaders, public and private all there for the IIF, the IMF, AG 20 meeting and much more among the people who I'm watching, JPMorcon CEO and Chair Jamie Diamond and City Group Chair John Dugan, both speaking at 2.3 p.m. respectively at the IIF. How much they give a forward looking indicator? I mean, we are going to have a backward looking indicator of the CPI earnings very much a forward indicator, particularly with respect to how fragile some of the financial issues are becoming. And at 1 p.m., the U.S. is planning to sell $18 billion of 30-year bonds. And as follows, yesterday's auction that was not great of 10-year notes and people really did not step in even though the yields were the highest since 2009. Do we get a similar kind of tepid response to this auction, especially given what we're seeing John over the United Kingdom? Did you just do a bond auction just for Tom? I always do a bond auction just for Tom. I mean, every day I see it and I'm like, yes, I can make him go little nut. We sent him down to Washington. I think we sent pretty much everyone down to DC this week, TK. Walk us through what's coming up this hour. I'm going to walk you through this, John. I thought your Peter Chatwell conversation was absolutely fascinating and you nailed it with him where he tried to game out where the real rate is heading to. It's also the major focus of the managing director of the IMF we'll speak to.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2452,2022-10-13 11:06:24
14227," And you nailed it with him where he tried to game out where the real rate is heading to. That's also the major focus of the managing director of the IMF will speak to Dr. Gorgiave here later. This is an extraordinary meeting, John, by far and away the most tension-filled one since 2008. But as you heard from John Lipski, it goes back further than that. With Gorgiave, John, I thought the chat well, when you stopped chat well in this conversation, John, I thought that was brilliant about, OK, how do you get out to a 2 1 1 half percent real rate? I don't know how you get out a single month from here, Tom. Can you get out a couple of weeks? Tom, tell me how much, how the ability of these policymakers in DC, are they able to look out beyond three months? What does next year look like to them? They are able to look out beyond. No, they don't know what's going to be out there three years, but they're trying as hard to say, we can't be certain, out six months or a year. And that's where you get the theory about the British challenges right now. They just don't need these little crises along the way of bad theory. And then it goes to the letter that Gorgiave wrote to the United Kingdom here a number of days ago. I know you're going to be talking about that, Tom, looking forward to it. TK coming up with the IMF managing director a little bit later. Coming up with the World Bank president as well later this hour, looking forward to that conversation. I've been excited for this one. Keri Kaminsky joined us now, chief research strategist at Alpha Simplex, Katie, you're also a PM. Can you tell me how you've done so far this year? Just under 50%. Positive. Yes. How on earth have you done that? We're bears this year. I'd say you were talking about the bears and the bulls. It has been an extremely trending environment this year. So you've seen very strong asset class trends. So those of us on the systematic space, those that are following momentum. And are able to actually short and adjust our positions have found really interesting opportunities for those that can actually or are willing to take those type of positions. I mean, we've talked about the short bond trade all year. It hadn't worked since 1994. It continues to work. And it's been the biggest theme this month or the last few weeks. So based on where trends are right now, it's getting a little chopier. Is it getting harder to really have a full bearish narrative at time when an ongoing number of investors are starting to get bullish, at least vocally, about long bonds? That's a good point. But look at what we just saw. I mean, we're also seeing volumes down. People are really hesitant. That means I think the market isn't oversold yet. And that we're not going to hit the bottom yet. I think that's why you're seeing people so hesitant this week in the last recent periods. Because we've seen correlations so high cross-asset that the market is focused on one theme, inflation, rising rates, and nothing else. That's really manifesting itself in the way that asset classes are behaving. And you're really seeing this whole market polarized on one number, which seems silly if you look at the big picture. But it really is the central point of where are we going? What's the next step? A lot of people talk about the difficulty in liquidity and liquid conditions right now. How much is your strategy amenable to a significant amount of assets versus being nimble? In other words, decides matter when it comes to earning 49% so far this year. So we trade in the futures markets. And futures markets are some of the most liquid markets out there. And they're a good place to actually realize and take different risk exposures, particularly in the fixed-income markets. Now, trying to short cash bonds is a much more difficult proposition. Because you have to borrow those bonds. There's all sorts of issues with the leverage and credit. Personal credit, whereas futures markets are placed where most people go when they have a view. If they have a view that the bonds should go down further and yields to go up, they go there. And that is sort of a general mechanism of a very functioning market. Katie, a lot of the time people become married to the view they have in a market, particularly when they're rewarded for it over a year like you have. Katie, can you help us understand the process that you'll go through to understand when you need to make a move the other way? Do you have a checklist? How does it work? That's a good point. And this is something we get a lot of questions about as systematic traders. Our main goal is not to have bias. And I think what's been the most fascinating to me this year is how much people...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2453,2022-10-13 11:10:59
14228," This is something we get a lot of questions about as systematic traders. Our main goal is not to have bias. I think what's been the most fascinating to me this year is how much people have long bias to bonds, and how they've never thought about bonds going down. For us, the goal isn't necessarily to decide what should happen. It's supposed to be focusing on what is happening, and what is happening now is very extreme, and you're seeing very strong bearish trends across multiple asset classes. Something that for most people is very uncomfortable based on what they're used to over the last few decades. With really strong positive correlations across asset. Do you see that breaking down, Katie, at the moment? What do you think? We've seen actually a big spike in the last two, three weeks, particularly in currencies and fixed income. You've seen the volatility in those two sectors, spike significantly based on the theme that I just discussed. You're also seeing correlations on the order of 40% over short intervals, something that is sometimes negative. You're really seeing the whole market in a shorter term horizon, focused on one theme. I think, depending on how the numbers go today, you're either going to see that get a little bit dissipated because people realize the fear that they were looking for, or you see it accelerate because it confirms the things that they are willing to be, that they're afraid of. That's why today is a big day in markets for the US. Kenyk Kaminsky, congratulations on the year so far, and let's catch up before the year is out of Alpha Simplex, just for nominal performance from her and the team. Absolutely phenomenal. And she was talking about the correlations, and I was looking at data yesterday that showed that the link between the S&P 500 and the city group economic surprise index is the most negative correlation going back to 2015. Basically, bad news, or good news is the most bad news for markets that it's been going back to 2015. And it just sort of shows exactly what she's talking about. The correlations are getting that much more entrenched as people kind of are more and more buried to their views and look to the data to kind of confirm them. Everyone's worried about everything. I think it was Bob Aswanstein, at our conference here at Bloomberg talking about that just yesterday. Some of it resonated with me because I wonder what we're going to worry about more in the new year. Is it going to be inflation still? Or do we start to focus almost exclusively on growth and growth role in Alpha? That's been a question we've asked through the whole of this summer. Still inflation, inflation, inflation. Does that change adapt just a little bit in the next few months? It's nuanced because if there is also inflation, how does this market respond to stagflation? How does this market respond to a Fed that cannot come back in? Because yes, growth is waning, but inflation is not coming down quickly enough to really justify any type of slowdown by the Federal Reserve. And that's the worst case scenario. The best case scenario is some of the supply chain constraints getting eased up as you've talked about. And that would create a much more benevolent picture. Equity features look like this positive a half of 1% on a S&P 500. Yew to basically unchanged on a 10 year, on a 10 year this morning going pretty much nowhere. Your inflation data, one hour and 19 minutes away from New York. This is Bloomberg. Keeping you up to date with news from around the world with the first word, I'm Lisa Mateo.

Global news 24 hours a day on Aaron on Bloomberg quick take powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. I'm Lisa Mateo, this is Bloomberg. The standard way venture firms work is you commit capital let's say over a five year investment period. And then the fund is typically has maybe 10 years or so. These days are longer so often 15 often the tail extends out to 20 years. And somebody that invests in a venture fund today should be trying to get rates of return of 20% or more. Top and venture is sort of three X net of fees. Ideally you're hoping for more than that. You're hoping for five extra more. You're illiquid the entire time right so you hope to get paid for the liquidity. And today maybe 20 to 40% if things go well is sort of baseline. Let's take another subject. Such a post somebody says I don't want to invest in and reason where it's I want to be mark and reason. How does somebody become a venture capitalist? What are the skill sets for good venture capital city high degree of intelligence, hard work, lot of luck, dress the right part, don't wear a tie. What are the things that make one a good venture capitalist? So the super the highly successful VCs historically are very idiosyncratic. People from very different backgrounds might more as a former newspaper reporter or a John Doerr's of former chip salesman. You've got people with very different indigenous buyer has more of this kind of blue chip investment background. You have people with very different backgrounds and experiences. And so I think it's it's some set of skills and some set of knowledge and then there seems to be a taste component to it that's really hard to measure and really hard to predict. So markets are preparing to close but the day is not over yet. Stock that is now up about 45% a lot of volatility right now.

That was John Lipsky, the former first deputy managing director at the IMF, sitting down with Tom. About an hour or so ago. Your record market shaping up as follows. Going into the CPI print an hour and 12 minutes from now, equally futures up by 7 tenths of 1% on ESMP. The year old's going kind of nowhere on a 10 year. We're down about a basis. 0.3842. Tom Keen, we've got the countdown clock ready. Inflation one hour and 12 minutes away. Everybody here in Washington, John, I'll be looking for that US CPI report. And as Lisa mentions, the core statistic. I'll be looking at Cleveland CPI or the Dallas trimine, some of these custom indicators. But what they all mean and what we'll see at 830 is tension for the global financial system. If you're a geek on this, if you're part of global Wall Street and want to dig deeper, this is the interview of the day. Tobias Adrian had the privilege of a PhD at MIT with Olivier Bunchard and the giant Stephen Ross. He is director of monetary affairs and capital markets at the IMF. Let me cut right to it. You're the most popular guy at these meetings. What are you telling scared politicians? What are you telling scared central bankers? Well, the number one goal for monetary policy is to get inflation back to the target. In the vast majority of countries, inflation is well above target. And that is the primary concern. Well, continue, please. Having said that, financial stability is also at risk. So when we are looking at where we are over time in terms of financial stability, it is very concerning. Over time, what will shift out of these meetings to over time? Will we have a more patient Jerome Powell? Well, that's a good question. I would expect that what is priced in at the moment is what we are very comfortable with. And I do not see a major change as they are relative to what is priced in and relative to what was announced by the policymakers. The thought you heard four days ago was me showing John Farrow in New York, British GILTS out seven standard deviations priced down, yielded up. Yesterday, I believe, John will correct me over 5%. Should we expect more 4, 5, 6, 7 standard deviation moves and fixed income? Well, I think the Bank of England has had these targeted and temporary asset purchases that are scheduled to expire. And those have been successful in terms of bringing GILTS down temporarily and bringing them back up in a more gradual manner. So of course, the overall stance of monetary policy continues to be one of a tightening, as inflation is above 10% in the UK. I want you to go into your iconic green book. John, financial stability or frankly instability, it is absolutely definitive in academics. What's a single chart our audience needs to know about? Figure number two. Figure number two shows the micro-financial downside risk at the moment. And when you look at that chart, it's only in the cute crisis that that downside risk has been more elevated in the past 20 years. What does that mean for your own power? Is he central banker to the world then? Well, I'm very much in favor of the kind of policies that have been announced by the Federal Reserve. And we think this is the right path going forward. But if they move 75 basis points, whatever, it's clearly nonlinear as we move in.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2456,2022-10-13 11:23:34
14231," They moved 75 basis points, whatever. It's clearly nonlinear as we moved in neutrality and restriction. Not to go back to green-spanian measured approach, but are we going to see a more measured, major central bank? Not only us, but England and particularly ECB. Are they going to be more measured? Because they're told to be more measured. My expectation is that they will want to see inflation coming down back to how it's target at that point. It's going to be time to be more measured. It's time now folks to get to bias, Adrian, in trouble. Let's do that. Olivier Blanchard had a courage in these buildings to say we need to consider a 4% run rate on inflation. Adam Posey at the Peterson Institute says, well, maybe not 4%, but 3%. Is the end outcome 10 years or 15 years of now, we reset from 2% out to some form of inflation of 2.4, 2.8 or dare I say, poses 3%. The debate about the high inflation target was at the time when inflation was too low. We were in a deflationary environment, and the argument was to raise the inflation target in order to be further away from deflation. At the moment, we have the opposite problem. We have too high inflation. So changing the inflation target when you're further away from the target that would undermine credibility. So this is not the right time to change the inflation target to a high level. It's not the right time. What would be the catalyst to change the inflation rate? It's if you're back down in a deflationary environment. OK, one final question. I know you've got three bloombergs. The lights dim here in Washington went to bias logs onto as bloomberg. You look at foreign exchange. How do you use foreign exchange? And what are the signals that say, yen 150, euro 0.90, or EM's giving away as well? What does that foreign exchange depreciation versus the dollar signal for year world of instability? Absolutely. So financial conditions are tightening, and they're tightening relatively faster in the United States than in other countries. That is one of the major drivers for these exchange rates. You have 40 meetings this week? I've 40 bilaterals and 10 speaking engagements. The only one that I've ever known was Ed Moore-Bilattson, who was John Ferrell. Tobias Adrian, thank you so much. Director of monetary and capital markets here at the International Monetary Fund. Can you see your me in 40 meetings this day? I don't think so. I don't think so. Not the morning after the long night that you and I have had sometimes, Tom, me prop in to you. Is that all? Yes. Yes, literally. Yeah. Tom, thank you, sir. Over at the IMF, down in Washington, DC, what a tough moment for them. Not the moment to start talking about 3%. The question that Adam Posey is raising about next year is whether you get to next year and then they start talking about it. Well, especially because, I mean, as Adrian Tobias was, Tobias Adrian was speaking, I was reading this Oxford Economics report and listening, don't worry, where he was talking, where they were talking about how the increasing risk of financial stability will cause an early phase out of quantitative tightening. And how much are we going to start to hear about this? Which will necessitate a higher inflation rate for longer because this does really create a problem or a ceiling for how much they can fight inflation. It has been the real-y old question of the week for the last two weeks. Will this Fed still be doing QT in 2023? Can they afford to or will something break? And if something breaks, can they afford to respond by ending quantitative tightening faster than they have laid out? It's just watching paint dry right now, John. Yeah, they hope. They wish, right? Are you not buying that? I don't buy that at all. That's what they wanted to be. Totally boring. The market doesn't see it that way. No, they don't. I know that some people do, but ultimately, on net, market participants don't see it that way at all. OK, and this is the reason why. And Tom, yes, I am talking to you. But this is the reason why I care about the auctions because this is where we're not seeing the margin of buyer come back in. And that does have to do with quantitative tightening around the world if there starts to be some sort of ballast while suddenly, then do you get a ballast for a risk pricing more broadly? Do you think you're converting him? No. I don't know. He's sleeping. There's no way he's interested. Count Riccadana's coming up from BMP Parababar. He's interested. He's very interested. He'll be joining us in about five minutes time with 64 minutes to go until CPI in America. Where's the clock for it? Do we actually have a clock? No, then we have a clock.

14232," One minutes to go until CPI in America. Where's the clock for it? Do we actually have a clock? No, then we have a clock. I feel like this should be the jeopardy soundtrack. Do-do-do. That sounds like elevator music. What is? It's impossible the industries in an arms race that will lead to spending itself into an oversupply. I mean, that has happened before. You know, we've looked at this very carefully and, you know, the digitization of everything. Tell me what aspect of your life, Emily, isn't becoming more digital. Well, I'm trying to prevent that, but yeah, I think it's happening. You know, and COVID has accelerated that. The industry cost $500 billion last year, the semiconductor industry overall, and estimates are a trillion dollars of doubling by the end of the decade at that point. I believe those estimates. It's not that there's not going to be some blitz and turns on the way, and the majority of that is driven by leadership process technology of which only three companies can satisfy that need. We're going to have to do that. Lots happening on Wall Street. I think, Jay Powell said things that were indefensible. Need to catch up. This is Bloomberg Wall Street week. I'm David Weston. We've got the information and insights. We think that's the next secular shift. From business's most influential and instrumental. It's knocking it out the bullfrog. It's a challenging dynamic.

14233," the year. The same week we had the low to the year in the equity market. I think you can add up. 428 is where we are on a two year right now yielded a couple of basis points on a 10 year maturity to 387. 81 on a 30 year down a better basis point to 386. When you look at the 30 year right now it's not the treasury market market. I think you can add up why 428 is where we are on a two year right now yielded a couple of basis points on a 10 year maturity to 387. 81 on a 30 year down a 30 year down in the equity market. I think you can add up how if you are on a 30 year maturity to 387. 81 on a 30 year period right now it's not the treasury market we're interested in it's the guilt market. It's the UK allow me to frame this as a high stakes blink contest between fiscal authorities the government and a government in the bank of England the government is saying we're not ready to do a U-turn on a tax policy. So who blinks first of anyone blinks go into much can this market take, right? I mean, how fragile is it? This is another issue that I don't really have a conclusive answer to. Have you gotten a clear answer to just how far some of these pension plan funds have really unwound their leverage? I don't have a sense of where we are in terms of the financial stability threat if the Bank of England does go through with this and says, we're not supporting you anymore. I've told, I've heard from people that have told me that it's starting to show up in US credit in a more pronounced way, that it perhaps explains what's happened in IG that hasn't happened elsewhere. What you've seen is a disproportionate sell-off in top rated investment-grade corporate bonds relative to high yield, which does not make sense heading into a financial downturn as so many people predict, because typically it would be the more leveraged companies that would suffer more greatly. And yet, if you have UK pensions that are selling top rated credit because they get the most money back for it, liquidate what you can, not what you want to, is that what we're seeing ripple into the US market. We got back to something I said earlier this morning. We can talk a lot about the UK government, whether they've made mistakes or not, and many people think they have. But did you think that 45 billion pounds worth of tax cuts would trigger this kind of reaction, not just in the guilt market, but in global markets, the spillover from that to elsewhere? That surprised me too. And this is the reason why financial stability, not in the United Kingdom, but globally, is now the main concern for so many people. What does it say about the fragility of the state that we're in, if that's all it took to trigger such a massive ripple effect? What's more interesting here, what they did or how the market responded to it? Definitely with them, how the market responded. Right, and you think the bank of him has been shocked by that too? I'd suggest they have been. Which raises questions about quantitative tightening more broadly and what kind of ability central bankers have to keep going despite the rising fragility of many markets. We should write a paper on this. I think so. It would be great. Next break. We can do that in Tom's next interview. Just make notes. She's at the IIF, not the IMF. She's our Wall Street correspondent. She's a little bit early this morning. You and I are going to have some long conversations tomorrow morning with the big banks come out. Give me a read on black rock. What does it mean for the big guys on Wall Street? It's a great question because this is the moment of truth. How could a ten, ten trillion dollar asset manager there in the face of the storm? And the answer is assets have to climb meaningfully this year. They're back below $8 trillion. It's the lowest level since 2020, John. Now when you look at earnings per share, they have beat analyst estimates. However, you're seeing those long-term flows all year under pressure. I think it's important to see where exactly did flows turn negative. You're looking at negative flows in the retail clients and then you're also seeing them in the institutional clients when it comes to index funds. This is at the end of the third quarter. The question is how much has this continued since then? To that pressure that Lisa has been talking about that a lot of institutional clients have felt and therefore have sold more liquid products first. You have Larry Fink in the statement really talking to the idea that there are flows in fixed income that are very, very strong still and that there are flows into alternatives. I looked at the alternatives business. There is still pressure there when it comes to currencies and commodities. And again, this is at the end of the third quarter. So the question remains how much more pain did they feel from there? Shanaulay, this is definitely a bell-weather company considering its scope as an asset manager. Is there any sense that people are rethinking their commitment to index funds in the face of dramatic under-performance, particularly by big tech, which are some of the main components here?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2459,2022-10-13 11:38:03
14234," index funds in the face of dramatic under performance, particularly by big tech, which are some of the main components here. That's a great question because this is an existential question for the big passive funds that have seen such a long bull market. And BlackRock, of course, is the king of this world. So that passive fund question is not only a question about whether what this means for market structure, market liquidity, but there's also a lot of questions about this business model in terms of the most liquid things you have to sell you will sell first. That is stuff that you have in ETFs, for example. But again, the fixed income flows are interesting. Will Larry think be discussing more of a pivotal business shift as the world changes into QT and into a tougher macroeconomic environment, at least in the near term, maybe longer term? He is speaking. Larry think is speaking here at the IIAF today, at five in the five PM hour, I will be listening. He will be addressing that macroeconomic outlook here. Jean-Arre, you and I are going to catch up again in about two hours time, just around the opening hour, looking forward to doing that. Jean-Arre, down in Washington, DC, they built a phenomenal business to surf the wave that dominated the last 10 years. That wave started to break, one and two, to see him in the political crosshairs in the way that he has been. I'm speaking about Larry think is fascinating as well at the moment, especially with ESG environmental social and governance, and you have a number of states withdrawing cash from BlackRock and you have a number of businesses, not wanting to do a business with them. It raises issues about being a sort of stakeholder rather than a shareholder and some of the recent move in corporate America away from the Milton Friedman kind of model and how far they can go with that. Think sounded like a journalist recently. I think he said in the last 24 hours, something like the left annoyed with me, the right annoyed with me. I hope I'm doing something right. Well, we can talk more about this. Nonetheless, it is a political concern at a time when there is this business consideration about the shift and riding a bull market is a good way of putting it. And Calracadonna joins us now. Chief US economist at BMP Paraba. We are within 60 minutes away from CPI in America. Cal, let's just start here, the inflation print. What are you in the team at BMP looking for? Well, I think looking at this morning's report, there's a few things we do know. We know that Rensar, sticky and running hot, we know that core service inflation is also sticky and running hot. So the real question is this issue of supply chain healing and if that starts to materialize in lower core goods inflation. I think there's a compelling case if we look at the cost of shipping a container across a Pacific. It's down about 75 percent from the peak. A ripping dollar up about 16 percent a year on year in the Bloomberg dollar index should be translating into declining import prices. We haven't seen that yet. There's a big inventory liquidation story. So there's a lot of elements to this supply chain healing story that make a compelling case for lower goods inflation going forward. There's not a compelling case that this happens in the month of September. So we'll be kind of watching around the margins for any clues that that's coming. Yesterday's PPI was not particularly encouraging, but this is kind of a key focal point going forward. So how do you communicate this to clients? Because they've been burned by faith-based inflation reads for a long time saying it's a backward looking indicator and it's going to soften going forward. How do you communicate to them if you look at the chip sector, if you look at the retail sector, if you look at certain healing supply chains, you do see this year over year comp that's going to bring down inflation. But maybe this print you can ignore this one too. Well I think whether we're talking about the Fed or private forecasters, there's much less certainty around the dynamics at the moment as a lot of forecasters have been burned over the course of the last year from team transitory onto other more moderate types of forecasters as well. And I think what we have to do is acknowledge what has occurred and the fact that we are starting to come off of the boil. So consumer prices will probably be the last shoot to drop as we see an inflection in some moderation on the inflation numbers. We can see in the PPI we're off of the peaks. Certainly as we look at inflation expectations numbers, whether it's from the New York Fed or the University of Michigan, they are off of the peaks as well. If we look at prices paid in the ISM survey, off the peak. So we can see a lot of upstream signals that…",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2460,2022-10-13 11:40:57

We'll keep another eye on inflation. Fifty minutes away. This is Bloomberg. Keeping you up to date with News from Around the World. With the first word, I'm Lisa Mateo. In Ukraine, the Kiev region was struck by Iranian-made drones this morning as air raid sirens rang out across much of the country for a fourth morning. Air strikes also continued in the South, meanwhile allies and Brussels for a NATO defense ministers meeting are expected to offer more air defense capabilities for Ukraine in face of Russia's stepped up missile strikes. The International Energy Agency says OPEC's decision to sharply curtail oil production threatens to push prices to levels that tip the global economy into recession. The head of the IEA oil market division spoke to Bloomberg. We're not calling on OPEC to – we're not setting their policy, obviously. This is for the OPEC to decide, but what we're saying is that by cutting supplies, cutting supplies through the market, it's preventing a rebuilding of inventories that are still critically low. The man is now expected to contract by 340,000 barrels a day in the fourth quarter. North Korea's state media says leader King Jumun has supervised tests of long-range cruise missiles in recent days. Kim says the missiles are intended for tactical nuclear strikes, while warning Washington that any attempted attack could be met by strikes at American forces in South Korea and Japan. The comments are a fresh sign that North Korea could be preparing for its first nuclear test since September 2017.

14236," For a young person who now booking a career, would you recommend a Wall Street career today? There are not many jobs you can have as a young individual, but you're always, always learning. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the road today won't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building across America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels, we want to do that with our buildings. If we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings, and if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. The number one goal for monetary policy is to get inflation back to the target. In the vast majority of countries, inflation is well above target and that is the primary concern. Everything said that financial stability is also at risk. So when we are looking at sort of like where we are over time in terms of our infrastructure stability, it is very concerning. Tohe Pais Adry in there of the IMF sitting down with Tom Keane just happened to go and break in news here at Bloomberg in the last 10 minutes or so. Let by Kiri Doldson out of London. Here's the lead paragraph for you, according to a person familiar with the conversations. UK officials a number 10 and the Treasury are discussing how they can back down from the Prime Minister's plans for a massive unfunded package of tax cuts. The reaction in the market, pretty simple, sterling stronger yield to lower. Let's take a snapshot of things for your cable off to the races off the back of that headline. The pounder hole lots stronger off the back of this. One ten, the lower the session, one twelve, forty five is where we trade right now. Gilt yield to lower off the back of this as well, Bramow. To have 34 basis points off the low to the session, initially off the back of these news, but still lower and lower aggressively so to four, 47 call it four, 48. All going into tomorrow where the governor of the Bank of England says, it's over. The Gilt Market Operation finishes. And can we say that the trust administration blinked? Is this enough? The idea that they're even considering going back on the plans, as she said, despite some of the hard language that they've heard. The fact that that triggers this kind of response shows how tenuous people feel right now about the budget of the United Kingdom. Let's see if the U-turn materialises one. This is a suggestion that having conversations about it and two. If there is some form of U-turn, what do they back down on? And what don't they back down on? And is that enough to satisfy some of the concerns in this market? Especially because as you pointed out, a $45 billion tax cut. Is that enough to trigger the turmoil that we have seen? Is that justification for the degree of upset or is this something else as well? Well, I've said what's more interesting here. What they announced or have this market responded to it. And I think we can all conclude this is a very fragile market right now. We'll catch up with Guy Johnson at about ten minutes time. Guy described this market as feebrow. He said, this is probably not the best idea when your backdrop is feebrow markets. And I'm sure most people would agree. Gilt Yew to Lower by 34 basis points, TK, big moves in the UK, and a lot to talk about down in DC. And on to 40 minutes from now, the inflation report in the United States, everyone here from the IIF John, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund, is riveted on that 830 statistic. Right now he is the president of the World Bank, of course, David Melpest joins us. I need to clear something up off of a political article. That proposal.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2462,2022-10-13 11:52:53
14237," At 830 statistic. Right now he is the president of the World Bank. Of course, David Melpest joins us. I need to clear something up off of a political article. And this is the uproar about senators and your tenure at the World Bank, where something was said, you're not a scientist. I fell off my chair because you are the physics major from Colorado College. I always clarify right now your position with the World Bank given this turf war, this political war in Washington. So it's very clear that people cause greenhouse gas emissions and that affects climate change. And so that should have been clear in the original remarks and whether you're a scientist or not doesn't matter. And so we've got off track. I think we're back on track because what the World Bank is doing is a massive amount with regard to climate change, both in countries that need adaptation, living with the changes going on. And with the mitigation. So there's this intense focus within the World Bank on these efforts. And what's great about this folks, and this goes back decades and decades, one of the coolest science majors in America was the Colorado College. The way they taught science at CC was so different back when Melpest was there in physics. Let's go to the equation. F equals VOT plus 1F GT squared. There's the gravitational constant in there, not seeing Taleb, the derivative giant, says the G matters right now. What does the new gravity of higher yields in inflation mean for the debt build up to the World Bank in front? It's so within physics, the gravity is always there. Within economics, there was this temporary period where interest rates could be at zero. And there were various explanations of why that was working. Now it's back to where there is a connection between interest rates and inflation. So the central banks are moving up toward some kind of neutral where it's non-inflationary. Fiscal policy is also changing massively. One of the themes of this week for the advanced economies is how do you mesh those two policies, the fiscal and monetary policy, so they don't conflict with each other. So if that means you're tightening on one side, do you want to tighten on another side? What does it mean for the World Bank? And there are billions of people in the world at heel to the Bank of England and to the Fed. This is a really challenging, and I call it a crisis-facing development. People living in developing countries aren't getting capital. In fact, there's a capital outflow. They're seeing their currencies weakened. And a lot of their debt is in dollar terms. So as their currency weakens, the burden of the debt goes up and interest rates are going up. So that's really a trifecta, triple burden going on to the countries, and many of them had built up debt under COVID because that was the cyclical, the counter-cyclical response. So there's been a lot of talk the last couple of days about ways to have a better debt restructuring process for the countries that hit the wall. Somehow seen through currency, from Mundell to Jacob Franklin on, we've studied foreign exchange on this. But the modern equivalent is in the derivative space and in the immediacy of overnight swap lines. This goes back to your Bear Stearns tenure. Do you feel we have a stronger structure now with swap agreements with the rich guys, the Fed, to allow the world bank community to have liquidity in these distorted times? What? So developing countries have a challenge in finding swap lines. Some do with the IMF or with the US Fed. But for the poorer countries, in general, they don't. They may be able to arrange something. But when that happens, that means you're under the gun. So a better way to do it is to find a way to get to actual debt reduction so that you can have light at the end of the tunnel, get out from under the debt. So that applies to the lower income countries. We're up to where there are dozens and dozens that are where the debt is unsustainable. And that means you need to have some solution to go through it. That's under discussion. Challenging times to say to these David Mellpress, thank you so much for joining us on top today. He is, of course, with the world bank. John Farrell. Hey, Tom, send our best to President Mellpress. Great interview. Great conversation as always. I'm looking forward to your chat.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2463,2022-10-13 11:56:48

I tell him, send our best to President Mampas, great interview, great conversation as always, and looking forward to your chat with the IMF Managed and Director in the next hour or so. Lisa, did you ever think that a UK budget could send equity futures to session highs? Up around about 1% on ESMP 500, the prospect of a U-turn, I say the prospect, our latest reporting suggests in the conversation is underway to discuss having that U-turn on certain parts of the budget. Lisa, for all those who have thrown derogatory terms at the UK as being an emerging market, a small country insignificant, they tell you what that insignificant, small emerging market seems to be shaking markets up a lot. In a significant way and throughout a number of different asset classes, I pose this to you, what happens then if you get some sort of yield curve control that is abandoned over in Japan? A more significant market, are you going to the next crisis already? 100%. Well, I'm looking for the next potential node of contagion. Can we deal with this one first? Okay, fine, yes, but yes, this one is amazing, the contagion, it's true. Let's see if they actually back away from big parts of this tax plan first. Point about the fragility of the market, that was the point that I was making, and this crisis is not over. We're on the same page. The reprise in the B&W now, aren't they? Yeah, exactly. Now there are less than 100 basis points for reaching a number. Just like that. Just like that. Let's see if we actually get any news on this. So far, that's the latest reports. Let's see what they actually do. But the price action space for itself, CPI in the next hour. What do you say to the cynics that say, look, it's all nice and fine, but a lot of it is greenwashing, and you're not a good company. You're just a less toxic company than some of the other oil majors. Now the first thing to say is that I'm a big believer in, we need to put ourselves in other persons' shoes in life in general. So I understand that point of view, and I get that people have that perspective. I don't agree with that, obviously, but I understand where they're coming from. We have an enormous challenge as society, which is to provide the world with reliable, affordable and clean energy. That's what society wants, that's what society needs. And I believe in my heart that a company like BP is actually one of the few companies in the world who can actually make that happen. We can talk about the things that we're going to grow over the coming years, and I find it hugely exciting and energizing for our organization. But that's what the world needs, and you simply can't go against the grain of society. You can't defy gravity, and that's why we're making the change that we're making.

One of the most important things is looking around the corner. Look for Chief Future Officer on Bloomberg. So you've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. They have. I've been in a scene. Lots of Bloombergs.

Let's fight the inflation first and then worry about that. I believe that inflation is a little more stickier than what's being forecasted. We still have policy that is not yet tight. The Fed, if they acted earlier, they could have stopped earlier. Instead inflation got out of control. I do think the Fed will start desalering here. Do thing or the inflation lead indicators are falling. This is Bloomberg's surveillance with Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow and Lisa Abramowitz.

This is Bloomberg's surveillance on TV and radio right here in New York City with Lisa Abramowitz, I'm Jonathan Farrow. Ramo future is positive, 1%. Can we blame or can we attribute the gains right now to the United Kingdom and the possibility of some sort of e-turn by the Trust's Administration on unfunded tax cuts? You can blame them or thank them depending on what sign of the market you're on. Sposed. But take your pick, sure. And that really raises some serious issues because as you were saying, it is this one market that is dictating the moves. How fragile are markets right now and how much can that change in a dime? How much do we not necessarily see real volumes with real conviction heading into a CPI print that could dictate the path, at least the near term path for the Federal Reserve? A couple of headlines in the last 30 minutes time. We're reporting here at Bloomberg that the Trust's Administration, the Trust's Government is having a conversation about some form of e-turn. A conversation, it hasn't materialized yet. They're talking about it. What aspects of it will they back away from? The Sun, the newspaper in the United Kingdom this morning, reporting the following that this Trust is considering raising corporation tax next year. So that's one element of the tax cuts they might be back and away from. Let's talk about what they're funding now. It is a no cap, a kind of spending package to try to bring down the costs for individuals or facing heating bills. Well, this goes back to policy, right? I mean, how do they then crimp demand? How do they then create something that doesn't just become a self-fulfilling prophecy? And people dig into the details. Is it still a real sigh of relief? Or are what we're seeing in the United Kingdom just highlighting what we're seeing more broadly with costs of financing rising and a lot of nations having a lot harder time dealing with that? Is Governor Bailey a hero or a villain? Right now? Well, who is he talking to? Precisely. Three days. Get it done. Who is it for? Guy Johnson's got thoughts on that. Guy's going to join us in just a moment. I want to run through the market action for you. On the S&P 500, up by around about 1%, the CPI number drops in about 28 minutes time. The bond market bid. You'll to lower by three basis points on a US 10 year. On a UK 10 year, we are a whole lot lower than that. We'll pick up on that story in a moment. Euro dollar, Euro stronger too. 97.41 on Euro dollar. Stronger by about 4.10s of 1%. Adelund and Guy Johnson joins us right now. Guy, your thoughts on what we're hearing in the last 20 minutes. So we've all been wondering who's going to blink first. I think we now know the answer. I think probably there is an argument to say that Governor Bailey was talking to the government when he said you've got three days to sort this out. You may have been talking to the market as well, but it certainly seems as if that threat has resonated in number 10, number 11, downing streets. The market is moving on rumours at the moment. As you say, we still don't know the details of exactly what is going to be reversed.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2465,2022-10-13 12:05:30

The market is moving on rumours at the moment, as you say, we still don't know the details of exactly what is going to be reversed, which aspects of the unfunded tax policy that we're going to be seeing changed. I think the Sun report is very, very interesting. John, the market has been all over the place this morning. We've seen, we initially saw a big move lower in yields, and you do wonder whether or not that is predicated on the idea that we are seeing the Bank of England's policies and the help it's been provided to having an effect. Or rumours have been swirling about a U-turn. Kitty Donaldson and the team confirming that now, that there is a conversation happening about a U-turn and you've seen the market response of that. This is what the market was primed for. It was waiting for the government to blink, and it looks like we're getting close to the government blinking. How much does the government have to blink because of conservative pushback, a pushback from Liz Truss' own administration to say this is infeasible and could potentially undermine any potential growth in the UK for years to come? I think it's coming from a number of different areas. Clearly within the Conservative Party, there is much annoyance about the way that this has been handled. Horror Authority has been diminished also, almost from the get-go, Lisa. But it's coming from the markets. It's coming from Conservative Party donors. It's coming from a whole host of sources at the moment. And the force of that is now clearly too much for the government to bear. And as a result of which, we are going to have yet another U-turn. I'm not even sure which way we're facing at the moment. I think we'll probably be fine out at the end of the day. I'm not sure market participants are sure either. Guy, thank you. Guy Johnson at Alundin, Gilt Yew-Telower, on a 30-year-by-31 basis points, 449 on a UK 30-year. Lucky, happy to say that joining us around the table is David Kelly, the Chief Global Strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. David, we'll talk about CPI in a moment. Can you tell me what's more surprising to you? What was announced by the UK a couple of weeks ago? Or just how the market is responded to it? Just the idea that we've had this much volatility off the announcement of what, 45 billion sterling of tax cuts? Well, think about it. We have sort of seen a regime change. I mean, for years, we've had a central bank safety blanket, which has really protected markets from anything that might be going on from the political side. And now that has evaporated and so the bond market vigilantes are back, these haven't been British bond market vigilantes. But it's basically the same situation that we saw back in the 1990s, where central banks weren't necessarily going to help the government out. And I think we're seeing that in the UK. To some extent, I think we're seeing that in the United States also. Well, maybe, right? And we're getting more calls that quantitative tightening will be phased out basically a minute after it was introduced because central banks will be have to come in and really back up some of these spending plans. From your vantage point, how much can you trust that versus bet on yields going even higher from here, whether it's the US or the UK? I don't expect yields to go much higher from here because I really think we have turned the corner on inflation. I think there's, you know, we're not talking... Nobody is saying that really inflation is going high. We're simply talking about the slope of the slide in inflation. And I think, you know, whatever number we get today, I believe that CPI inflation might be 8% year over year today, 8.1, by December, it's going to be 7%. It is coming down. And because inflation is going to come down, I believe that will... That means we should be close to a top on yields. Although, even if it's coming down, 7% is not going to be very comforting, neither will 6% and possibly not even 5%. Even if it comes down pretty quickly, if it stays, it starts to decelerate in terms of how quickly it comes down. And if core inflation continues to accelerate even in the month of September. Well, first of all, the historical record is that if you look at inflation, inflation goes up and comes down. It looks like the Eiffel Tower. And whenever we see this in the past, unlike unemployment, it looks like a playground side that sort of goes up and then comes down slowly. But inflation tends to come down quickly. And the only part that's really sticky here is shelter. And that's owners equivalent rent, which nobody pays. So the part that's sticky doesn't matter. And so I really don't think that we... I don't think... I think we're just too obsessed with inflation because we haven't seen this beast in 40 years and we're just all a little too excited about it. And it's just not that threatening and not worth putting the U.S. economy in recession over it. Well, that's what the Fed is doing, isn't it? Through inter-basis points, where the tightening is six months. I think that... I think they're overreacting to it. I don't mind the Fed getting back to normal. I think they all too. But they said they wanted to not add to uncertainty. They're adding to uncertainty. So what they should do is say, look, this is what we're doing and we're trying to get back to normal. But then we're going to stop.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2466,2022-10-13 12:10:08
14241," Well, mine the Fed getting back to normal, I think they ought to, but they said they wanted to not add to uncertainty. They're adding to uncertainty. So what they should do is say, look, this is what we're doing and we're trying to get back to normal, but then we're going to stop because we don't want to kill the economy for inflation battle that we're going to win anyway. You know better than most, they're getting into the debate about what they should and shouldn't do. Ultimately, we can do this for hours. Lisa loves it. It's a sport. I love it too. Play it all the time. What they will and won't do is what matters ultimately to this market. Can you tell me what you think is going to happen here, given what they're set to do for the next six months? I think they are still very self conscious about this. I think they will go 75 and November, they will go 50 in December, probably go 25 in the start of February. But then I think they'll stop. I do think that within the next year we will see a Fed pivot of sorts because at some stage they've got to find themselves an off-ram from this. They want to sound hawkish hawkish hawkish, but they know. A lot of economists are saying what I'm saying, I'm startled by how many economists are seeing this exactly the same thing with inflation is coming down. They don't need to put the economy in recession to kill it. So this sounds like you are getting long or you already are long, some of the longer-dated bonds, particularly in the US. Is it positive for risk assets if they start to decelerate the pace of rate hikes into year end and into the early 2023? Yeah, I think so, but I think the setup is positive for risk assets because frankly, everything's on sale. I mean, we're down 25% on equities from a year ago. And so things are on sale. I think what's going to happen here, we've got a lot of uncertainty right now, but at the end of this, we're going to emerge with a very slow growing economy with low inflation, the Fed is going to have to put in low interest rates because fiscal policy is going to be stimulated. And so you're going to have low growth, low inflation, low interest rates, probably decent profit margins. And that's actually a pretty good environment for financial assets with stocks and bonds. Are you sample at the pre-pandemic playbook? Yes, back to that right-wing. Back to the future. We're going to end up, because of the Fed, overdoing this, we're going to end up back where we were 10 years ago. So this is not some big structural shift. This is just an aberration the last two years or so. Correct. If it was a structural shift, you'd see the unions back. The unions aren't back. 10% of America is unionized. It was over 25% to the 1970s. You'd have different markets, which weren't sort of instantaneous, whether it would have a lot of, you know, wouldn't have internet technology, allowing you buying anything you wanted at any price immediately. So is this going to be another bond-bull market? Well, that's not that. You know, a bit of a bond-bull market. But we're only going down from, you know, if we go from four to two, that's, you know, you can make some money there. But it's not like the great bond market, a bull market from the 1980s. It's just a constructive view on things. Yeah, well, basically. The old playbook, the old regime. And he's not alone, right? I mean, there are a lot of people who think that we're going to go to an even lower terminal rate post-pandemic after this blip, simply because of the amount of hangover and the slower growth that you're going to end up getting, because of some of what we're hearing from the Fed right now. Given how wrong we've been about 20 different things over the last couple of years, I'm doing my best to stay open-minded about the whole thing. I'm not going to be open. Yeah, I have to. No idea. David, thank you, sir. And I'm not saying you should be open-minded, just saying, you know, wasn't personal, David. Well, I mean, but I think that you have to be open-minded, because we go... This side was moved so quickly. So my father is a mathematician, and he used to say to me, you look at all these equations, but you never know the parameters. And you always get the parameters wrong. Yeah. And right now, no one knows what the parameters are, and so you're making assumptions based on whether we're going back to the normal of 10 years ago, or five years ago, or we're going back to the normal of 20 or 30 years ago.

China is defending its controversial and costly COVID-0 policy for the fourth day in a row this time through one of the country's top virus officials. A national health commission expert saying at a briefing today that it's inevitable the curbs the country uses to control transmission have impacted the economy. The comments come just days before President Xi Jinping is expected to secure a president breaking third term in power. Meanwhile in Beijing about two dozen police patrol the busy intersection after photos and videos circulated of a rare protest attacking President Xi Jinping just days before that crucial communist party meeting. At least a half dozen photos and videos on social media showed two unfurled banners across the bridge in northwestern Beijing. They took aim directly at Xi criticizing his restrictive COVID-19 policies of lockdowns and mass testing. Have you reigned in southeast Australia's forcing hundreds to evacuate their homes?

Apple's delaying its next major iPad software update, iPad OS 16 by about a month from September to October. Apple made the decision for a number of reasons, including a still buggy, stage manager multi-tasking interface, and an order to link the launch closer to the more similar Mac OS Ventura. Still, it's an unusual move. Since shifting the launches to the fall in 2011, Apple has released its new iPhone and iPad software updates simultaneously each year around September. By staggering the releases, users may find some issues around compatibility with cross-device features like retracting and editing messages in iMessage, the new shared iCloud photo library, and the new feature for transferring FaceTime calls between iPhones and iPads. It will also make it a bit harder for developers to launch apps that run on both the iPad and iPhone that require new APIs and features found across iPad OS 16 and iOS 16. Regardless, it was still of course the right move. Stage manager on iPad OS 16 is still quite buggy, I don't find it particularly intuitive, and it's not compatible with most iPads and many third party apps on the app store. The feature clearly needs some more polish, and complaints from consumers about stage manager will now no longer probably overshadow the earlier launch of the iPhone 14.

Pushing inflation down below certain level by lowering ways of inflation, putting on pushing unemployment up, is going to become increasingly difficult for the Fed to stick to that policy. Especially when you're having all these problems in other parts of the world. So the pressure is going to mount on the Fed. Andrew Slyman of Morgan Stanley Investment Management. We are 12 minutes away from CPI to America, going into that number, your market, shaping up as follows on ESMP 500 into Thursday, six day losing streak right now. Future's positive 39 points up by 1.1%. You'll to lower by three or four basis points to 385.98. This headline just added Germany, the Bundesbank, for those of you that missed this. German 23 inflation. So inflation next year, likely to be between 7% and 8%. Lisa, that is next year. Not the end of the month, not the end of this year. They are still looking at a 7-handed and 8-handed in Germany next year. And where was it six months ago? I mean, this is the other aspect of this. It was way, way, way down from that. And so how much and how quickly are things developing? They're also downgrading their growth forecasts pretty dramatically because this is this type of stationary fear that so many people had and Germany is in the crosshairs. It's materializing. Let's get the view from Jeremy Stretch, the head of G10 FX strategy at CIBC. Jeremy, in about 11 minutes now, I can't get stand CPI just around a corner. What are you in the team looking for? Well, I think after the PPI release yesterday, I think there is definitely a definitive fear that we could see a slight nudge to the top side, particularly in terms of poor prices. So I think that could be a function which will provide a little bit of residual support for the dollar. And I really maintain that narrative of another 75 beep of policy timing. I'm going to next step. I'm seeing. Jeremy, you noted that this is a big short squeeze on the pound and that you're seeing these whips movements because people are leveraged and getting in and positioned very much in a loosely traded market right now. There isn't conviction in terms of where people are going. How much is that becoming a theme is going to create that much more volatility going forward? Even if these reports are confirmed with details. Yes, that's right. We are seeing a definitive short squeeze over the course of the last couple of hours or so. And that's really a function of incredible degrees of speculation here in the UK that could either be a fiscal U-turn of some form being discussed by the Prime Minister and this trust whilst of course, notably the chance from the Finance Minister is in Washington and meeting with the IMF today. And also at the same time, there's increasing speculation of the Prime Minister's own tenure, which is only 37 days old, could also be under extreme threat. So that is creating the short squeeze. It's creating a significant degree of rebound or rally in the guilt market. But there is a lack of conviction because of course, all of these reports are consistently either denied or often rubbish. So there is a great deal of volatility. And that really makes it very difficult to hold any position with any conviction. Very likely time. I look at these moves in stocks on the FT.100 as well. Barclays this morning, rallying, Lloyd's banking is up by 6.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2469,2022-10-13 12:22:43
14244," And that really makes it very difficult to hold any positions with any conviction, or any letting it down. I look at these moves in stocks on the FTSE 100 as well. Barkley's this morning, rallying, Lloyd's banking is up by 6.3%. Barkley's up by 4.8%. Can you tell me Jeremy, if they are discussing this, and we're reporting that they are discussing a U-turn, what we don't know is whether they deliver on that U-turn. What are the elements of the tax package that would need to be backed away from that would convince you enough to come into this market again and say, let's buy Sterling, the policy setting on either side, monetary fiscal, it's a little bit more durable now, I think we can buy the pound here. Well, the first problem is, of course, that fiscal and monetary policy appeared to be moving in completely opposite directions in the context of that fiscal event. So I think we need to see some degree of reduction in terms of the fiscal expansion, which was implied by those tax cuts. So it may well be the case that that's a reduction in the basic rate of tax could be pushed forward by a year. Now that's not a big revenue range, but I think that will reduce some of the fiscal impulse from next year, and that will ease some of the burden on the Bank of England. Also, interesting, there's some debate about some degree of corporation tax height coming back into the agenda. And of course, that's very difficult when you're trying to drive for growth. So I think that the governments are in a really difficult spot here, but I think if there were to be any reductions in terms of that fiscal expansion, which was really driving growth dynamics, or inflation dynamics, of course, next year making the job of the Bank of England all more difficult, then that could create conditions which would be constructive. And of course, if Prime Minister Truss were potentially going to be removed, or at least taken out of the equation, then I think you could easily see Sterling getting back to maybe 117 and a half handles. So there is plenty of scope for a degree of revampage sterling, but it is very much a function of these rumors or at least some of this speculation proving to have some degree of durability. Again, let's see if there's any follow through whatsoever, though. Jeremy, I think the question I'm trying to ask is that even if they walked it all back, when back to the very beginning, where they started, didn't do any of this stuff, would you see any scarring on Sterling assets? Would we have to have an additional premium baked in? Yes, I think that's undoubtedly true. As we all know that once you lose credibility in any way, shape of form, whether it be markets, whether it be relationships, it takes us out long, long times of rebuild, credibility would be rebuild confidence. So I think the confidence in UK PLC is a major G7 trading nation has been materially undermined by the events of the course of the last two to three weeks. Official institutions have obviously been compromised, whether it be the UK Civil Service, whether the Office for Budget, or Responsibility. So I think it would take some considerable time for UK assets to move back to absolute valuation levels. And I think there will still be a degree of credibility discount being put in place in terms of UK assets over the course of the next few weeks and months, even if all of these fiscal events and the political risks are compromised from what we've seen over the course of the last two to three weeks. Jeremy, it seems like the crisis is now over the United Kingdom. That's a tongue-in-chake if anyone pushes back and says that's absolutely not the case. We can move on to the next crisis. I agree. I agree. I agree. Right. All right. So I'm looking right now at the Yen, and we've been looking at it approach the weakest levels going back to 1998 and hit that yesterday. What vulnerability is there that was really exposed, thrown into relief from what happened in the United Kingdom, if there is some sort of policy shift over in Japan? Well, clearly, we've seen the M.O.F intervening for the first time in obviously, 25 or almost 25 years, but the underlying metric message is that if Japanese monetary policy is still going to be very divergent from the rest of the world, then the power of the release of resistance is probably still dolly and moving higher. And I think that's going to be very much the sort of the ethos that's going to remain in play during the final stage of Corotus tenure because his position will come to a conclusion in his tenure term, will end at the end of Q1. And he still feels confident that it's all necessary for monetary policy stimulus to remain in play because there is a lack of wage growth. And that's the real trucks of the issue for Japan. But I think we're starting to see some of those inflation pressures moving down the pipeline, and that's going to squeeze corporate margins. And that's going to make it even more difficult to see any sustainable wage growth in Japan. So I think it may well be the case that it's going to be the job for the next governor of the Bank of Japan to try and pick up the pieces, all the deal, the ramification, this protracted and prolonged period of easy monetary policy, which inevitably is probably going to see Dolly in squeezing higher until markets are confident.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2470,2022-10-13 12:27:16

What a tough task for whoever takes over Jeremy thank you. Jeremy stretched there of CIBC looking at it from corrodas perspective and I don't think we do that enough. I believe the BOJ seized this as a once in a lifetime opportunity to reset inflation expectations higher. This was the ultimate goal for the last 20-30 years of policy. Here it is, the opening for them to do it. I've sat here and said it looks like they've got their head in the sand whilst the rest of the world is high-can-interest rates. I agree with you to back away from your curve control will be tremendously difficult but from their perspective they don't see these inflation numbers in Japan as a problem. They see it as an opportunity. What happened to you? You're all open minded thinking of all the other sides today. I mean what is it? It's morning. Very zen.

This is William Bergroll Yield. 10 seconds away from inflation data in America going into their equity futures just off session highs. Only a S&P 500 up a little more than 1% with the data in Washington DC. We can cross over to Mike McKay. Well, John, it looks like the score is inflation one fed nothing today as the CPI comes in up 410 of 8% on a month over a month basis, which is higher than it was last month and higher than expected. And the core, which the Fed is following much more closely, comes in up 610s, same as last month and more than anticipated by the markets. This is exactly the same thing that happened last month and we saw a big reaction in the markets. On a year over year basis, the headline CPI drops from 8.3 to 8.2% as base effects come into that. But for the core, it rises to 6.6% from 6.3%. So it is not a good picture here. Those who were thinking that inflation might drop off fairly quickly are going to be disappointed by the numbers here. Why don't you let us know what's happening in the markets and I'll look at where the big movers are. Yeah, let's do that, Mike. As you say, it's off to the races down and down hard on the S&P 500. We're negative by 1.5% on a S&P when you push this through the bond market. Look at the front-end of the yield curve through 440 on a US two year. So that is a new high for the year and a high we have not seen since 2007 up 10 basis points on a session now. The front-end of the curve on 10's up 7 to about 397, breaching 3, 4% a couple of times over the last couple of weeks. But yields up and away again at the front end. Seems to be the theme of here. Theme of things right here. Elisa, the wrong kind of upside surprise and pretty much across the board here. On core month on month, which is what Wall Street was looking at. The front page of the newspaper will go with the headline year over year and let's be honest about it. That is not pretty either. Especially at a time when people are talking about how you are seeing lower energy prices. You are seeing certain retailers start to discount items. It is not feeding through how much the fact that we're not getting a flatter year yield curve materially. So the fact that you are getting higher yields at the long end as well indicates that perhaps people are rethinking some of these inflationary inputs. And how quickly they can roll over John. Inflation coming in Heartmite McKee. Have you got the compositional breakdown yet Mike? Just the detail of things. What got us here? Yeah, it is disappointing, John, when you look at it. Of course gasoline comes in down for the month, down 4.9%. But that wasn't enough to offset some of the big rises shelter, which of course everybody is pointing to as the big culprit for inflation these days is up by eight tenths, which is a tenth more than it has been over the past three months. There was hope that it might start to moderate owners equivalent rent up 1%. And that's the calculation that people do for the government does for shelter. There was one decline in apparel down three tenths. That's the inventory stuff that Lisa is talking about. Use cars were down by 1.1%. We've been waiting for a big drop there, but new cars come in up seven tenths. And then the big thing that probably people were not expecting is gasoline goes down. But other energy goes up electricity up 4 tenths and natural gas up 2.9%. So a lot of inflation contributors from areas that we weren't expecting some had thought that airline fears would go down. They're up eight tenths and motor vehicle insurance, which has been a problem for the Fed all along is up 1.6%. So a lot of underlying inflation that shows no signs of backing off. A couple of months ago, Mike, we were talking peak inflation. And perhaps people were talking about the headline number. Are we getting closer to peak inflation when it comes to the core? Well, you have to think that it's got.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2472,2022-10-13 12:35:50
14247," And perhaps people were talking about the headline number. Are we getting closer to peak inflation when it comes to the core? Well, you have to think that it's going to happen in one of these months because the Fed has been tightening and it should start to have an impact. But as the Fed said with the labor market as tight as it is, companies are still probably adding employees to the extent they are at higher wages. And that means they're passing along to consumers. Jim Bullard of the St. Louis Fed has said basically it's up to the companies. They feel they have pricing power now, so they're using it. They need to realize that they need to back off or it's going to hurt everybody. Mike, this was never about the November meeting. The November meeting was 75 almost now done. It was about whether in the news conference this Fed this chairman could lane the groundwork for a downshift from 75 to 50 to 25. Given the data calendar from now to there, do you think it's going to be very difficult for this chairman to lay the groundwork to do just that? It's going to be very difficult. They want to get to 4.5 percent, 4.5 to 4.3 quarters by March of next year. They may be forced into doing it earlier. The sequencing was supposed to be something along the lines of 75 in November and 50 in December. But now 75 for December has to be on the table. We will get the PCE inflation numbers just ahead of the next Fed meeting on November 2nd, but barring a big drop in that and it does count housing a little differently. I think you can see a hawkish J-Powell in the news conference after there's 75 basis point move. Mike, great work. You're going to stick around and stay close. I know. A shocking number for a lot of you. I guess Lisa, those of you that were looking for some kind of downshift in the inflation story that would lead to some kind of downshift from the Federal Reserve, I'll price up the markets for you and it looks a little something like this. Pretty intuitive. Staff explanatory off the back of this one. Inflation comes in hot and echo these roll over. We're down by 1.8 percent on the S&P off the back of a big move at the front end of the yield curve. Two's up 15 basis points to 4.44. We have taken out the highs of the year on a two year and we're set to take out the lows of the year on the S&P 500 at the opening bow. In the FX market session highs, guess what, Dolly-N? 147.40. Bramow approaching 150 on that currency pair. It pretty much sums it up. Andrew Brenner over at Nathalie and Securities sends out a note saying, will they go 100 basis points? Is that really where we're back to, John, as people talk about? Upside surprise, after upside surprise, two consecutive ones. PPI not as important as CPI, but not indicating that you're seeing that sharp V-shaped decline that we were hearing about from David Kelly. If we touch on the politics briefly in the next hour, I'll catch up with Brian Deese, Director of the National Economic Council. I think this was the last inflation report before the midterms. The next one comes a few days after. This is a tough spot for them. It is especially because you're not necessarily seeing wages keep up. This isn't leaving anyone in a good position and what you're seeing is that the lowest income individuals tend to be hurt the most, especially with things like airplane tickets, like rents, like food, like shelter. Everything is going up and it's making it very difficult for people to feel in a good spot. So headline inflation comes in at 8.2% down from the previous month of 8.3. We were looking for 8.1. That will be your headline in tomorrow's newspaper, No Doubt. On Wall Street, the focus is month over month core. 0.6% in line with the previous month of 0.6%. That is month over month. We were looking for something like 0.4. This is hot. It's an upside surprise and it's sending this market. This equity market, a whole lot lower. South Carpenter, global chief economist, the Morgan Stanley jointist right now. You've had about seven minutes to pour over the details. You'll take on this one, please. Yeah, absolutely. So I have to say I'll crow a little bit and congratulate my team. So our US economics team, Ellen Zettner, the chief Julian Richards, who works for her. We were above consensus on our call for this print. I think the stickiness that you saw in the shelter inflation was one of the key things. Clearly a shock for the markets. The markets are off because of it. But for us, this actually didn't come in very different from where our forecast was. There is persistence, especially in the services side of inflation. The apparel number, I thought was particularly useful though, for a long time, we and others have been talking about inventories. The pull back of the consumer for consumer goods. We're starting to see it the challenge, obviously in this kind.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2473,2022-10-13 12:40:15
14248," We've been talking about the consumer goods we're starting to see at the challenge. Obviously in this context is it's when other bits of inflation is Lisa pointed out or just going up more strongly. Right now we're seeing the swaps market price in a peak policy rate for the rate for the Federal Reserve of 4.85% in March of next year. Seth, is that what's required for the Fed to move fast to continue moving into next year despite some of the concerns about finance and the financial stability? I'm not sure that is what's required. That's a little bit above where our call is for the peak rate but only by a hike or so. I think there's two way risk with that outlook. We have seen the last jobs report was good but still softer than the one before. If we get that downward trend continuing and non-farm perils, if we get down into 100-something range, I don't know that it's going to be obvious to the Fed that they need to keep going all the way. You know, closer to 5%. Seth, I'm struck by what you said. There are certain other areas outside of shelter that were stickier. I'm thinking about airplane tickets, people saying that after a while people wouldn't be willing to pay for something that often is a discretionary expenditure. You could see this with IKEA and Pepsi, all raising prices and still having pretty good sales. Are you concerned that your team and that you have been a bit too sanguine about how quickly inflation could come down on the market? How pervasive even the wage stickiness is right now? Absolutely. If ever, there is a time for people who do economic forecasting to be humble. This is it. It's very, very difficult. The sort of falling off of inflation for core goods has taken so much longer than we expected. I think there's a lot of uncertainty here. The fact that the labor market is in fact cooling. We obviously got the Jolt State account. I think that's a good thing. We've got the Jolt State a couple of weeks ago that the market reacted to. We got non-front payrolls that were solid but still coming down. I really think that part of the economy is going to be key. Can the Fed continue the tightness, get the overall economy to slow down, get job creation to slow down. That I think will be the key to where inflation goes over the medium term. If you're just tuning in live on TV and radio, you missed the fireworks. Of course, CPI and America come again at a 40-year high. Inflation come again hot equities heading south with down 1.8% on the eastern P. You'll jump at the front end of the Yordkirv at 14 basis points to 443 and expectations high going into the Fed's next meeting. Last time they met Seth in the minutes yesterday, they said the cost are taking too little action to bring down inflation, likely outweighs the cost of taking too much action. Seth, do you anticipate when they meet again in November, they'll be thinking the same thing? I think they will be ringing their hands quite a lot. This was obviously an important data point but it was one data point. I think they will be ringing their hands quite a lot. They will be ringing their hands quite a lot. And so we're going to have a discussion about the size of the rate hikes because they don't want to go too far and do too much. So I think they're getting to the point now once we get close to 4% or over 4% I think they really will be weighing both sides of that coin. The strength of the underlying economy is important but inflation here is clearly strong. There was the point about use car prices having come down but new car prices have come down but new car prices have come down but new car prices are staying strong. I think it's exactly those sorts of frictions that are going on in the goods and services market that is presenting such the conundrum. Well there's a lot of friction right now in this bond market. Let me tell you how far can we push this up 16 basis points released on a two year? 45. I'm watching this and now we're at 4.43. I mean it just keeps going up higher as the terminal rate now is looking at 4.85%. It is moving closer to that 5% handle that we heard about from Larry Summers that we heard about from Bill Dudley and people who are looking at the numbers that we heard about from Bill Dudley and people laugh. Can I just say Bill Dudley said that in the summer of 2020? You nailed it. He was talking about maybe summer of 21 rather. He was talking about maybe they'd have to go a whole lot further than people thought they would. Stacked line up in the next hour for you. Mono Mahajana with Jones, Jim Karen Morgan, Stanley Investment Management, Tom Kennedy of JP Morgan and Brian Deese of the National Economic Council of the Director of the View from the White House on a tough, tough day for policy makers Lisa. I'll let you run off and get to it and I cannot wait to hear those interviews in particular with Brian Deese and we're still a South Compton of Morgan Stanley. I would love to get your take Seth on the political element of this, particularly as we heard from our own Michael McKee, that energy prices outside of gasoline were.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2474,2022-10-13 12:45:17
14249," I would love to get your take Seth on the political element of this, particularly as we heard from our own Michael McKee, that energy prices outside of gasoline were rising. We've seen this with diesel, we've seen this with heating gas, with natural gas heading into a winter, where inventories are at historic lows. How much are you concerned about this, triggering a new bout of inflation, even at the headline level that could pose a real problem? I think it really could. And at the headline level, I think there are no two ways about it. There's the winter weather is going to matter a lot. I think this is an issue that our friends across the Atlantic and Europe know even more if they have a very cold weather. Winter is going to be disastrous for them in terms of their supplies of natural gas. But no question, energy prices are susceptible here. And the average consumer doesn't look at core the way the market does. The average consumer looks at the things that they're just spending money on and that they see on a day-on-and-day out basis and food and energy are very high on the list for the average household. And Seth, you were talking about the bifurcated nature of where people are spending money. And I wonder how much this speaks to the uneven fortunes of people with money and people who don't have as much, about how people at the higher ends are able to buy new cars and big ones at that, if what I hear from a lot of executives is correct in the auto industry. While other people can't afford the same kind of groceries that they had in the past, how does this end set? I mean, what is the sort of trajectory for the overall economy versus the pockets of potential pain? It unfortunately tends to be the case with every downturn in a business cycle that the people at the lower end of the income distribution tend to fare worse. And so it ends up exacerbating a bunch of the inequality. If we think about the story that was so popular six months ago and nine months ago about the amount of excess savings in the economy because people weren't spending as much during the worst part of the pandemic and the government transfers were strong, it does look like from the estimates that we've done most of that excess savings has been spent down for people in the lower quintile, maybe the lower 40% tile of the income distribution, not so for the top of the income distribution. So again, that's another place where we are seeing this disparity really showing itself. And helping to perpetuate some of the inflation. Seth, stick with us for just a moment. I want to go back to Michael McKee in Washington, DC. Just to bring you the latest, if you are just tuning in. CPI, the core level reaching the highest levels in 40 years since 1982 at 6.6% year over year higher than expected. Even headline came in higher than expected. I'll be a lower than its recent highs over the past few decades. Michael McKee down in Washington has been parsing through all of the details we talked about. How used cars have actually declined. But new ones have continued to rise in terms of pricing. What are some of the details as you continue to parse through this mic that you think will shape the conversation? Well, I think it's in general the overall number of things that went up when you look at the list of the breakdown of everything in the CPI. Most everything under the apparel category fell, but that's the only one that shows anything like that. Services outside of energy up 6.10, they're up 6.7% for the year. That is not what the Fed wants to see. That's driving the core higher. And the part of the problem is they haven't yet been able to get a cap on expectations by businesses that are raising those prices. We'll see if that starts to come through. And then as you were talking about with Seth, I think the natural gas issue is one that's probably going to come back and bite people as it gets colder, as gas use gets more significant. As we sell more gas overseas, there are already some people on Capitol Hill saying maybe we should cut off gas sales to Europe. And so especially because of Ukraine. And so there's a lot of political stuff that's going to go into this as all the world central bankers and finance ministers gather here at the IMF for their meetings. They'll be talking about the US because the US inflation is so high that Fed has to keep going driving the dollar higher and affecting everybody around the world. Mike, thank you so much. A great work is always stick with us. We will be heading back to you shortly. Seth, from your perspective, right now the markets response is pretty fierce. You're seeing a sell-off accelerate in stocks, in bonds, in stocks you're seeing the S&P down now 2.2% ahead of the open and Nasdaq down almost 3% after already a very difficult year. What point do financial stability?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2475,2022-10-13 12:48:59
14250," being the S&P down now 2.2% ahead of the open. Nasdaq down almost 3% after already a very difficult year. At what point do financial stability concerns start to play into this at a time where inflation is still so obviously a major concern? So I think the sell-off inequities as one example is something that my colleague Mike Wilson has been calling for. The key for the Fed is slowing the economy enough to get rid of these inflation pressures. And so marking down those earnings expectations is going to be a key there. And so that goes into the level of prices. But it's not the level of these asset prices that I think are the financial stability concerns that the federal raised. It's how volatile things are. Is there some part of a market where things are starting to break? Is there, if we see credit spreads widening, well, with the slowing economy, maybe that's what should happen. What they're going to be more concerned about is do they move wider and very, very short order? So something along the lines of what we saw in the UK a week and a half ago where you saw a huge move inside of a single day. So far, we've just seen what seemed like the normal reactions, the reprising as the data come in. I think the Fed's really more worried about volatility or a lack of liquidity. Although we're seeing in the auctions, the Treasury auctions over the past few sessions, we've seen in certain sessions of trading, there has been incredible volatility, particularly the early hours over in Asia, over in Europe. How much are you getting some sort of paths in the back from some of your colleagues over in the trading desk at Morgan Stanley, your colleagues at the Fed where you formally worked, saying, it's starting to get a little bit more dicey. Yeah, no question. I think everyone in markets is talking about exactly that phenomenon. But I think for the Fed, they're strapping themselves in for this. They're expecting some increase in volatility because the world is uncertain. I don't suspect the folks at the Fed yet see evidence that there's something that's not working in markets at the point where they're worried about it. So given that, how much are you ratcheting down your expectations for growth, given that you are seeing the markets sell off, but not necessarily dysfunction, that you're seeing certain types of inflation come down, but not nearly enough to give anyone comfort. Absolutely. So our baseline view for the US next year is very, very weak, only roughly in the half a percent range. So that's a pretty, pretty pitiful amount of growth, I think, another metric to think about that is we're looking at job growth to slow down to the 50,000 or so per month range, which is a far cry from where we are now, and particularly far cry from where we were six months ago in a year ago. So growth has to come down a lot if the Fed is going to contain these inflationary pressures, and that's going to be, in the words of Chair Powell, economic pain. Seth Carpenter, thank you so much for all the time that you've spent with us this morning. Seth Carpenter of Morgan Stanley, down in Washington, DC, with the rest of all the policymakers, and many of the people here at Bloomberg, just to really reiterate what we're looking at right now, the sell-off that is deepening in US markets and the heels of a worse and expected, a hotter than expected, inflationary read. Mike has been pouring through it. There is some talk about with the financial stability issues, Mike, that there will be discussions of perhaps stopping some of the quantitative tightening early from the policymakers that you speak with. How much is that on the table? It doesn't seem to be on the table. At this point, they're not seeing, they say, any signs of real stress in the US economy, nothing like what's been going on in the UK, and they want to give it a few more months, and see what the bump up to $95 billion a month and roll-off is going to do. There are people who suggest that the Fed needs to start looking at this, because not just the Fed, but the government's involved, as the Fed backs off, the Treasury is selling even more debt to pay for everything that we owe, and the markets may not be able to absorb all this. So that's going to be something that will be discussed here at the IMF and World Bank meetings, whether or not the Fed wants to change its views and maybe move up time to slow or taper their QT is still an open question, but right now, the Fed is saying they don't want to do that. Michael McKee, down in Washington, DC, thank you right now, let's get Ira Jersey on the line. He is, of course, our chief US interest rate strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, and right now I'm looking at a peak Fed funds rate in March, at least as priced into futures markets.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2476,2022-10-13 12:53:18
14251," He is, of course, our chief U.S. interest rate strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence. And right now I'm looking at a peak Fed funds rate in March, at least as price to end to futures markets on the terminal, 4.85% by March of 2023 getting closer to the Bloomberg economics base case. What's your sense, Ira, of whether this is basically locking in a very aggressive approach from the Fed because there is not the same signs that people were looking for. They have come too late of any sort of deceleration. Yeah, so I do think that we have to consider that the Federal Reserve is going to go 75 basis points for sure in November, probably 75 in December as well and maybe even 50 in January at the February meeting. So I think that we are pricing for a higher terminal rate at this point. Yeah, I think the two big things and takeaways from the markets and I want to comment on something that Mike McKee just said as well. First is the market is still pricing for interest rate cuts in 2023. I think at some point the market has to price those out. So I think that the market will ultimately do that. But first it has to find where it thinks the final terminal rate is going to be. And once that happens I think that we can see that terminal rate flattened quite a bit. And I think while Brainer probably has it right where once they reach that terminal rate they are going to stay there for nine to twelve months at least. Which is longer than they typically have. The other thing I do want to say is market function is a big deal right now. Certainly you've seen a lot of volatility, bid offers a wider on a lot of fixed income instruments and things like mortgage-backed securities and the treasury market. But one of the ironies is that the Treasury Department is still cutting the amount of issuance that it's treasuries that it's issuing because one of the ironies is as inflation has been very high, wages have gone up a lot and tax receipts have come in way better than anyone ever expected. So we actually have the lowest deficits now that we've had in years in terms of both monthly and annual basis. So one of the ironies of having higher inflation is that we won't have to issue quite as much debt in order to make up for government spending. Which is a little bit ironic. Well, given the rate outlook, certainly it would be very expensive impunitive for the US to be borrowing at this point. I'm looking definitely on the front end. People are starting to price in the likelihood of at least a four and a half percent terminal rate for some sustained period of time from the Federal Reserve. On the long end, I find this interesting. Also selling off with 10-year yields hitting the highest since 2008, decidedly crossing that 4 percent threshold at a time when people are questioning whether we're going back to a low rate regime. This is over the next decade. Let's hear from you and how has that changed, Ira, based on how people are responding to this news that over the long term, this could indicate that it will be harder to get inflation under control, harder to get rates back to where they have been over the past few decades. Well, keep in mind, we are still lower than the past few decades. If you go back to the early 2000s, we had 10-year yields were 5-6 percent. So still in the historical context from the last half century, interest rates are still on the relatively low side. It's just not as low as they had been, obviously, the last 10 or 12 years. I think that the longer end of the yield curve, we will ultimately see interest rates below 3 percent at some point. I don't think we're going back necessarily to a zero handle on front end interest rates, at least any time, probably in the rest of my career. We will probably see the long end rally at some point as we do price in for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. Keep in mind, the higher inflation goes, the higher likelihood we have of a very hard landing. Because the Federal Reserve will have to crimp down on demand by increasing interest rates, continuing its quantitative tightening programs. That just means that we're going to have a harder landing later. That means at some point, I think the long end of the yield curve will be pretty attractive. I do think, actually, in the fourth quarter of this year, we will see the peak in yields, whether it's at 4.25 percent or right where we are at today. It's still obviously a matter of debate. I thought it would be closer to where we are right now. But obviously we have new data, so therefore we have to consider this new data.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2477,2022-10-13 12:57:32
14252," It's still obviously a matter of debate. I thought it would be closer to where we are right now. But obviously we have new data, so therefore we have to consider this new data in our forecast. Ira, thank you so much for being with us. Ira Jersey there of Bloomberg Intelligence, Stowe, us down in Washington, DC, Michael McKee, who's been parsing through all of the data and preparing for some pretty hard conversations, especially. If Ira Jersey is correct in saying this is setting us up for an incredibly hard landing, how is this going to be communicated at one point, have people talked about actually putting a recession as a base case in the Fed forecasts? I think a lot of people I've also been putting a recession as a base case. The only question as Ira brought up is how hard it's going to be. The Fed has started talking about pain in the economy and that you can't get away with just raising rates and nothing happening. And I think you'll hear more of that. The Fed is going to emphasize the length of time they keep the Fed funds rate at its terminal point rather than where that terminal point is. The market's repricing right now, but it's hard to really put a figure on exactly where they need to go, how high they need to go. There estimate has been that it would be about four and a half to four point seven, five percent, some say five percent, but in that range, and does this really change that as much as people might think since the Fed knew this would be a high inflation report and it's going to take time for inflation to come down. So Wall Street will debate this idea of raising the terminal rate, but for the Fed it's going to be more a question of how long they keep the terminal rate up before they start cutting. And I know, Lisa, if you take a look at the WIRP function on the Bloomberg, something very interesting has happened. Ira says you got to start pricing out the idea of a rate cut. But still there just slightly, but now the market is pricing in a rate cut at the rate increase, another rate increase at the end of 2023. So there's some confusion in the markets about what the Fed is going to do at this point. Of course, Fed fund futures lightly traded, but it's an interesting change in the perspective of those who are trying to bet on where the Fed will be a year from now. Like I was reading through the minutes yesterday of the previous FOMC meeting, and it was notable that there was a slight nod to the rest of the world, this question of some turmoil and how that will rebound back on the U.S. economy and cause issues domestically. How much is that gaining traction at a time where I'm seeing the year-o once again fall versus the dollar, $96, $68 strength pervasive in the face of persistent inflation? Well, it's obviously a major topic of conversation around here. The Australian Treasurer says he's going to bring up to J. Powell. Watch what you're doing to the rest of us in the world. But most of the central bankers I've spoken with say they understand that the Fed has a domestic mandate as do they, and they can't do a whole lot about it. They just have to let it go. And so the Fed is going to take this into consideration. One thing they have to take into consideration is how much is global tightening, tightens policy, tightens credit in the United States. So they may not have to do as much as they think if everybody goes up. But at this point, they know they're doing it. They know the rest of the world is tightening, but everybody has to do their own thing. Michael McKee, thank you so much. As always, right now we're seeing the sell-off continue to accelerate into the open. Right now we're looking at the Nasdaq down near 3%. The S&P down about 2% dollar strength yields higher. Bond prices lower the two-year yield hitting 4.5%. On the 10-year solidly, north of 4%, the highest levels going back to 2008 CPI coming in hotter than expected with core levels at the highest going back to 1982 on a day where people are looking to the Fed to understand exactly how this will be dealt with. Coming up, we'll hear from Chris Alina, Giorgiova of the IMF. This is Bloomberg. Absolutely brutal. Inflation up and equities down and down hard. Life from New York City this morning, good morning, good morning. The countdown's to the open. That's right now. Coming you need to get set for the start of U.S. trading.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2478,2022-10-13 13:01:48
14253," This morning, good morning, good morning. The countdown's to the open. That's right now. Everything you need to get set for the start of U.S. training. This is Bloomberg, the open with Jonathan Perra. All right. Live from New York, we begin with the big issue. Inflation coming in heart, a 40-year high on course CPI given the Fed a green light to keep on hiking with the market action. His Kelly line, say, Kaylee. the last year. We have seen a re-reading of the terminal rate expectations now swaps pricing in 4.85% when all of a sudden done this cycle. That means yields are flying specifically at the short end on the two year old. 19 basis points on the day. 448. This is the highest we've seen going back to the summer of 2007. So basically, John, no, we had not peaks on the short end already and at the longer end of the curve, the 10 year up 14 basis points north of 4% at 4.04%. Of course, when you have yields moving higher, those higher borrowing costs weigh heavily on equities, we are seeing S&P futures dropping like a rock after the print now down 2%, it's even worse for Nasdaq 100 futures, which are down now about 3% given those are more richly valued stocks. So you want to still stocks, you want to still bonds after this. The only thing anyone really seems to be buying is the dollar. The Bloomberg dollar index is back up toward record highs. It's essentially destroying everything in G10 right now, borrowing the British pound, which of course is related to UK policy and as a separate issue. But the dollar really gaining strength in the dollar. And John just pour one out for the Japanese yen right now trading at 147.35. These are levels we have not seen since crisis era all the way back in 1998. And that is even above the levels we had already seen. Japan policy makers intervening to stem the weakness in the currency post-CPI today. That is just continuing because the B.O.J is going nowhere and this market is betting that the Fed is going to go even further than it already thought. They don't need shots. They need a bottle. Can you please thank you. Kelly on the latest with the price action might be key down in Washington. Mike, put it all together. You have 30 minutes to reflect your thoughts. It is ugly. There is much more you can say about that. Now the Fed knows it is going to take a long time to start bringing inflation down. But I think they were hoping it wouldn't start going back up again. We have 8.2% headline. 6.6% core on a year over your basis. And it is that core number that is scaring the markets and it is going to make the Fed better. Think twice about how quickly it needs to move. The biggest movers in the CPI this time, gasoline down 4.9% still up by 18.2% for the year. Food at home, up 7.10% for the year. Those are two things that Americans are going to notice. The problem with gasoline is it is going to go back up again. Owners equivalent rent, up 8.10% that is an increase from the last 4 to 6 months. And it is up 6.7% so housing. A major component of the CPI about 1.3% of it. And it is putting a lot of upward pressure on the core. Use cars did drop 1.1% we have been waiting for that. Still up 7.2% on the year. And a parallel down 3.10s. Interesting. You look at the apparel category and just about everything went down in price. There are a lot of sales. Inventories are high at retailers. So we should expect to see continued driving. There were some surprises though. I mentioned gasoline goes down. But natural gas goes up by 2.9%. And it is not even winter yet. This may be because there is a bit of a shortage of gas as we sell a lot overseas. So it could become a political issue. And of course as it gets colder, it will become an issue for voters. Air line fares. Supposed to drop as the summer travel season over. Up by 8.10s and medical care. 1% of the gas is going to be a lot of times. So if you're going to have a lot of gas and medical care. 1% higher. There is some thought that that may drop off. Methodological changes are coming into forward next month. So if that drops, that would be a big help. But the real question is how high does the Fed go? They've never had a tightening cycle where they didn't go over the level of inflation. Right now they're raising rates. But inflation is still going up. So they aren't able to close that gap, John. What a tough spot. Mike McKee, down in DC. Mike, thank you.

Later.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2479,2022-10-13 13:07:08
14254," Thank you. This inflation print hijacking the conversation the debate down in Washington might talk about this becoming political It is right now. It's the last CPI report before the midterms later this hour the view from the White House with Brian Deese the National Economic Council director coming up A little bit later. Let's get to the guests Morgan Stanley Jim Kerron Mona Mahajan of Edward Jones Mona first to you your thoughts on this one Yeah, John look this is presenting a real challenge for not only the Fed but the broader economy here You know inflation was supposed to be moderating. We were looking for two to three maybe four prints lower in fact today We got a print that is moving in the wrong direction Of course what we're seeing is this repricing in markets the Fed Market expectations for the Fed now a hundred basis points on the table for November December looking for another 75 and perhaps after that we start to see a bit of moderation in Fed rate hikes now Keep in mind what we're watching for of course with with such dramatic moves and yields will we face any sort of liquidity issues some of the credit disruptions We saw in UK could they come here to the US sure that's something to keep an eye out on in the weeks ahead of course But I think generally Although this print was very disappointing one thing we are watching are the underlying fundamentals yes Shelter and rent in the CPI or moving higher but when you look at underlying fundamentals in mortgage rates in housing in broader rental markets We're actually seeing the opposite trend there is a lag impact and so over time we do expect those components to moderate as well It seems like it's taking a bit longer than expected. I Jim this is brutal It is brutal. I think that's that's a that's a good way to sum it up I mean look you know we're in a situation here where we thought the Fed had made a one-off adjustment to get to the policy rates up to 4.75 And the markets mainly thought game would be over at that point and now it looks like we're going into extra innings The question now that we all have to ask ourselves is is a 4.75% policy rate is that enough or should it go into the five handle area And and john you and I have discussed this before but I have called this the RIP cycle which is recession inflation and policy risk The more the Fed has difficulty fighting inflation the more they have to hike rates the faster they go The more likely they are to create a recession in 2023 So I agree with Mona. I do think that prices will start to moderate I thought that this would already be happening at this point The issue that we have here is that now we're seeing inflation Move from the good sector and permeate into the services sector at the problem with that is that when inflation starts to broaden And that's the real problem it's starting to broaden It makes it very very difficult to put for the Fed to hike because it gets embedded in inflation expectations Clearly we're seeing demand right now in the economy wages are high No wage inflation is is there and people are able to afford these higher prices But for how long and and that's going to be the question for 2023 So the faster rates go up now the more likely there is to be something breaking in the economy in in 2023 Which is why the yield curve remains somewhat inverted Jim you've got to the heart of it and it's about where this Fed funds peaks The move we're seeing at the front end of this curve right now with two is up 21 basis points to 450 However price and a terminal rate through next year Jim I think the question we've all got to ask is the one you're trying to get out Just how much upside risk is there now to the terminal rate based on where we're priced this morning Well, if if the way the Fed calculates this and they measure this cost of fighting inflation in terms of the unemployment rate So I'm going to work backwards on this I'm going to say that it takes an unemployment rate north of 4.5 percent today We're 3.5 percent unemployment in order for us to start to really tame inflation and wage inflation And as I continue to work backwards on this then I have to say what policy rate is required to get the unemployment rate up into the 4.5 to 5% area And I would argue that it's a policy rate that is somewhere between 5 and 5 and a half percent beyond What the 4.75 percent is today now? I'm not making a forecast on this I'm just doing a calculation on this and I'm suggesting that unless something changes It's going to take more rate hikes from the Fed to bring up the unemployment rate in order to tame wage inflation Which I believe they think is the source of a lot of this inflation Jim stay close alongside Mona big moves in this market Your equity market down by 2 percentage points on the S&P at the front end of the curve up",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2480,2022-10-13 13:10:26
14255," which I believe they think is the source of a lot of this inflation. Jim, stay close. Alongside Mona, big moves in this market. You're equity market down by two percentage points on ESMP. At the front ended a curve up 22 basis points on a two year to about 451. TK down in Washington, Tom, some big moves here on Wall Street. John Ferro, thank you so much. In really interesting conversation, there with Mona and Jim about these market moves. What it means for me is I'm trying to suggest a one hour conversation with the managing director of the International Monetary Fund. Her entourage says that's not going to happen, so let's cut it down to 20 minutes. Managing directors, thank you so much for saying it. I have a plan, Eric Martin, briefed me over a beverage of my choice last night and gave me this beautiful plan of discussion. We're going to rip up the script and we have to because of inflation. When you speak to your PhDs, when you speak to Geeta Gopanath and the rest with your doctorate as well, do you have a character or understanding of this inflation? What is the makeup of this inflation that won't seem to go away? The makeup is one, disruptions from Omicron and they continue in China. Two rashes senseless war against Ukraine that has pushed energy and food prices up. We also are going to see some repositioning of supply chains that would have longer term impact on cost structures. But right now, what we face is demand remains quite strong and supply has trouble meeting it. The most important task we have to secure our economies is to win the fight against inflation. And that means for central banks to show the resolve that is necessary. And why do we need to win this war? Because if we do not have price stability, we undermine prospects for growth. And because we hit incomes of people. But many are moving quickly. The US real year is Jim Carran of Morgan Stanley just mentioned most 10 basis points. The two year year lows, I believe 18 basis points. Do you suggest, with the IMF suggests, central bankers, including Chairman Powell, that they need to slow down the dialogue and the certitude, the rhetoric and extend the timeline out, even at sacrificing a higher inflation to provide for financial stability? What we are suggesting is that the Fed needs to continue to be data driven. They need to look at the economy. They need to look at where the signals are in terms of our reaching price stability or not. And then they need to look at the impact their decisions would have domestically, but also internationally. Let's remember, tight financial conditions also mean strong dollar, also mean capital outflows from emerging marketing developing economies. Of course, the Fed is primarily focused on domestic conditions. The responsibility of the Fed is price stability in the United States. But also the Fed has been quite active to think of ways to support global stability, especially through extending swap lines to a new- You have a set up date on that right now. We talk to the people of the Green Book, the Financial Stability Book. What is the IMF present tone on the quality of the liquidity in the market, given this inflation report this morning? We have seen financial stability risks increasing, but we are still primarily concerned about inflation running out of control. If it maintains so stubborn as it has been so far, then the most significant risk we face is that inflation expectations de-anchor. And when they de-anchor, that means that pressure on wages to go up and fuel inflation from other directions. And then the job of the Fed would become harder and it needs to be-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2481,2022-10-13 13:14:34
14256," on wages to go up would fuel inflation from other directions. And then the job of the Fed would become harder, and it needs to tighten even more. Two more questions very, very quickly here. You met yesterday with certain members of the British government. I believe a gentleman from the Bank of England and a beleaguered chancellor of the Exchequer did you put them out in the proverbial American woodshed? I mean, give us the insight. No one's listening or watching right now. How did that bilat go with the two members of the United Kingdom? It went really well. It was a very constructive meeting. We talked about the narrow path that the world economy has to walk on today. And how important is not to make mistakes out of this path and not to communicate in a way that may be more difficult? What I was very encouraged to see is that the two of them sitting together with the common purpose and the chancellor talking about his intention to accelerate a projection of how he's going to anchor his budget in medium-term fiscal sustainability. And also his commitment for the office for budget responsibility to come up with independent projections. That all tells us what we know that the UK actually has strong institutions. And they do work even if at some point we may see some dismal. When those comments shall be invited to the coronation, Dr. Gheri Ebert, thank you so much. Greatly appreciated. On this day of a surprise inflation in America, John Farrell, Kristalina Gorgheva. It's OK, ugly on this side of things. That's for sure. Tom, thank you. Great work, as always. In some, ugly all around, the words of Muhammad Al-Aryan just moments ago, coming up on this program, the view from the White House. That's next. If we do not see, sign-set inflation is moving down. My view continues to be that sizeable increases in the target range for the federal funds rate should remain on the table. That conversation coming up. Great work, and thank you, Jim. What, you've found, you've learned that Nutri-Genomics and Precision Nutrition is one of those rare scientific fields that overlaps with the Instagram friendly wellness industry. There is a lot of interest in this idea of personalized nutrition and especially how accessible it is to the public. You can go on Google and type personalized nutrition or diet and genes and you will find dozens of different companies that offer this nutrition precision tests. One of those companies is Routine. Some claim that their personalized tests stemming from sciences like Nutri-Genomics make their supplements different. But even with the claims from Routine as well as dozens of other personalized nutrition companies, the science still has a long way to go. What are the biggest names in business?

14257," If we do not see, Science and inflation is moving down. My view continues to be that sizeable increases in the target range for the federal funds rate should remain on the table. However, if inflation starts to decline, I believe a slower pace of rate increases would be appropriate. The Fed getting that green light to keep on hiking, inflation ramping up the press on the Biden administration would just weeks ago until the midterm. So, more, let's get to Josh Winkrow down in DC. Josh, have they got a loan this one? I think they're going to try to squint hard and find whatever they can talk about, maybe that top line, non-core number trending down and saying the Fed still has work to do, but this is bad news, of course, for Joe Biden and for Democrats. It's the last data that we're going to get before those midterm elections. Where Democratic hopes have been kind of rising a little bit, that they would avoid a blood bath that had been coming down the pipe six months or so ago and still have a really close race for the Senate. The House is still looking favorable for Republicans. So this will give Republicans ammunition going into those final weeks of that campaign to say, look, prices are on a control and you need to switch who's in power and Washington due to something about it. On the flip side, they will continue to point to that inflation reduction act. We'll talk about the reducing or the lowering levels in drug pricing from that. Of course, that still takes time to kick in. And I suspect the Social Security bump that was announced this morning is also going to be emphasized by President Biden to remind voters, particularly the elderly voters, that they might get more money coming into them to deal with this. That's the sort of top line, but it is, as we've said, as all the guests have said, this is just a brutal print all around it that makes it brutal for Joe Biden. What are the options on the table for them now? They're in this scrap with Saudi Arabia, the Kingdom over the last week or so on this OPEC plus decision. What's left on the table for them? Not a lot. We don't know what consequences President Biden has been referring to after that OPEC decision. We were looking for more on that. Of course, we continue to watch what, if anything, they will do with the SPR, the ongoing release that they promised in the spring is sort of coming to an end. The question is, do they expand that or keep it going in any way to try to stabilize oil markets in particular? Other than that, there's no hope of any sort of bill or anything, a back kind of thing going through Congress before these minterms are or after. So I think right now they just have to try to stay the course, or they're going to say that they have to stay the course and see where it goes. But as I say, they'll have to try to find a silver lining on this one, and they're going to have to look pretty hard. Josh, thank you, buddy. As always, Josh Winggrove, down in DC, tough to find a silver lining. That job is going to belong to Brian Dees of this administration, the National Economic Council Director. Brian's going to join us in about 20 minutes time. Back with us from some final thoughts, Jim Caron, Mona Mahajan. Mona, thanks for being patient with us. You heard that Gorghava interview, the IMF managing director, should we have renewed concerns, increased concerns about financial stability, and how difficult will it be for this central bank to bring down inflation, address that with higher interest rates, and at the same time, not cause a big big problem in this market? Yeah, I think it's now a higher-tail risk than we had originally expected going into this print. And keep in mind, in the U.S., we haven't yet seen some of the instability we are seeing across the globe. Credit spreads here in the U.S. are relatively contained still. Yes, the inverted yield curve has been persistent, but it hasn't been exacerbated in magnitude over the past few weeks. We have seen relative stability across market and market functioning. So we will be keeping an eye on that one. Keep in mind, as we continue these fed rate hikes higher, perhaps through February, maybe even beyond, the question then becomes, there is a lag impact from those fed rate hikes. We have now probably raised rates close to 400 basis points for the year. In six to 12 months time, that will hit the real economy in a more meaningful way. Does this potential recession then become perhaps not deep, but maybe prolonged? And I think that's where the equity market adjustment may have to still get you reflected. We are, of course, today seeing a larger impact, outside impact, once again, on the higher valuation growth parts of the market, relatively less impact on the value and defensive parts of the market. I think that theme still has some lives in the months ahead as well. So both things to keep an eye out on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2483,2022-10-13 13:23:36
14258," it relatively less impact on the value and defensive parts of the market. I think that theme still has some lights in the months ahead as well. So both things to keep an eye out on, I think for now, the U.S. credit markets are functioning. But with these rapid rate increases, I think that's a tell risk we have to monitor. That's the key word functioning. Jim, for the bulls, we have a price problem. I get it, but the Fed's not going to care about that. Do we have a market functioning problem in fixed income? So right now, I would say it's functioning. The liquidity conditions are certainly stressed. And you're seeing that with some risk premium of assets moving higher. And it also explains some of the gappy moves that we've been getting. But ultimately, when we think this through and we try to bring this forward, it all goes back down to what I think of as if this was a football match, it would be labor versus capital. Labor is at five, capital is at zero. And essentially capital could be considered asset prices as well. And what we have to try to consider here is, if the Fed is very serious about fighting inflation and getting wage inflation down, then there's a very difficult message that needs to go out to the US public, which is that the labor market has to soften in order to get this inflation under control. Now, the more the Fed starts to hide greats and to get to your point, John, in terms of the functioning of the markets, essentially, if the Fed is going to go 75 basis points in November, if they're going to go maybe 75 basis points in December, 50 to 75 in December, and they're going to get up to that 4.75% rate very quickly and maybe go higher. It is a question about a little bit of a pig through the Python. These are a lot of rate hikes that are going through the markets over the past few months and going forward. It's going to take a toll at some point. It's always hard to figure out what's going to break or when that might actually happen, or even if that might actually happen. But the more the Fed does this at an accelerated pace, not only does it risk a recession in the future, but it does risk some type of liquidity breakdown at some point. And that's something that is just going to be an added risk premium that gets put into the markets that's going to weigh on asset prices. Hey, Jim, it's going to catch up. Thanks for being with us this morning. Jim Karen, Mono Mahatchan, coming up the morning calls and later a monster upside surprise on inflation.

For no coastal appoints to India's incredibly competitive education system, if you can survive the pressure it takes to get into one of the Indian institutes of technology, it gives you confidence to handle American universities and later the business world. Meanwhile, the belief in India's ability to produce so many tech wizards is reinforced every year. Indians make up about three-force of the immigrants receiving coveted H1B visas for the US.

Markets feed in the pressure from inflation. Investors now shift in their focus to one thing. Earning season. Corporate earnings. That is the next thing that the market has to focus on. We're seeing some pretty bad earnings already. We're going to look for guidance from CEOs and CFOs. Investors are looking for outlook. Recession talk. A lot of companies have found to provide outlook in any guidance and certainty. We don't know yet how much they're going to come down. How are they going to maintain margins? System margins. Profit margins. Margin pressure. That's going to be the stickest shock, I think, coming out of these earnings. The trouble still lies before us. Is that the next shoe to drop? Joining us now is JP Morgan's Tom Kennedy. Tom, fantastic to catch up with you, buddy. It's been way too long. Let's start with the inflation report. It's 60 minutes old. Your thoughts, sir. Yeah, good morning. This solidify 75 basis points at the November meeting. The Fed is going to have to look at this inflation report and suggest that more tightening is necessary, even if that's a lag defect on the economy. John, I chided with my clients to give them long term perspective about what could happen. I think you have to call it as it is. This is a hot labor print. Sorry, a hot inflation print. The driver here is shelter. When and how is that going to roll over? At this point, when I get to talk to clients in our platform that are big real estate owners, they're starting to get substantial pushback in the commercial side of things and now in the residential side. Their assessment of the Fed Tom in the last decision in the minutes we saw yesterday, this quote, the cost of taking two little action to bring down inflation, likely outweighs the cost of taking too much action. Do you agree with that assessment? I think that assessment is becoming more balanced. The Fed has tightened conditions in a historic fashion, John. We have never seen apps in a recession. Financial conditions tighten the way they have in the last nine months. It just takes time for that to filter through. Another thing in the minutes last night that wasn't really talked about as much is the Fed keeps ratcheting up the conversation about wage spirals. And when you start to look back to the vulca error, those are the things that prompted monetary policy to be so tight then. This inflation point today, report today, we can start to find seats of, is that probability of a wage spiral? I think it's very low, but non-zero. I think it's going down. How did I get there? Core service inflation is not accelerating anymore if you remove shelter. And some of the more wage sensitive sectors are not showing evidence of acceleration. The levels, John, are way too high. We know this. But if you're trying to find a silver lining, which is hard to do in this report, that's the one I would focus on. I think a lot of people were hoping that we'd see more of that and that we'd go into this November Fed meeting and we'd lay the groundwork to have a downshift in rate hikes from 75 to 50, perhaps the 25. Tom, how do you think this changes that news conference for Chairman Pound in early November now? Yeah, the downshift, if there was a probability it would happen in November is off the table. And the next conversation I think for the Fed will be, are we going 75 again in December? The downshift, John, to your point, just keeps getting pushed out. So, in the end, the next conversation is going to be about the end of November. So, we're going to have a kind of general consensus that will happen at one point, right? That's an easy thing to say, the further you get away from or the higher you get from an estimated neutral rate. You brought up a really good point and it's how much work we've already done. The temptation on the morning like this morning, Tom, and you know how wow, you see a number like that, you sort of run away with yourself and you're like, they should go about 100, 125, 150. Let's just wait and pause and think about what we've done already. I think the mortgage rates got a seven handle now in America, Tom. We've seen what's happened to financial conditions. We've seen what's happened to the US dollar. Can you tell me about the way you think about long variable lags in policy?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2486,2022-10-13 13:36:51
14261," Now in America, Tom, we've seen what's happened to financial conditions. We've seen what's happened to the US dollar. Can you tell me about the way you think about long, variable lags in policy? All of that tightening in the pipeline already. When does that start to hit? Yeah. The US economy, John, has different lags to your point. Investors and the Fed will focus on very short, interest rate cycles, like the real estate market. As you mentioned, that market is getting hammered. On affordability is 07 all over again. And mortgage applications is the lowest we've ever seen. So desired effects are happening there. The reason folks will now focus on margins is that's a longer interest rate cycle. And that should be the next shoe that drops. Unfortunately, once you start to really pressure margins, that's when layoff activity starts to follow. I think this progress is just taking a little bit longer than we thought. The resiliency of the economy is there. John, you said this really nicely. What was the last time we saw it, two year treasury rate of 450? Yeah. For a long-term investor, these type of yields are wildly attractive. Because we're already seeing the desired effects of slowing growth. You can't slow growth forever. Eventually, that will mean something for inflation. Well, Tom, let's talk about opportunity then. You look through the curve, two's at to 30's. We can have a chat about duration. Then we can look at to credit risk. Think about maybe IG, perhaps even dabbling in high yield. You can tell me, where do you see the opportunities right now? The screaming opportunity to me is in core, boring, traditionally unsexy fixed income. Things like investment-grade and municipal bonds. John, over the last 20, 25 years, the SB 500 has annualized you about six and a half, seven percent. We can find those current yields in fixed income. Less risk. So I think that's the screaming opportunity here. We are of the mindset that a recession in America is more likely than not next year. And I don't see that fully priced. In the equity market, I don't see it fully priced in extended credit. So finding dislocation opportunities is our next best idea. And then monetizing volatility through structured notes. You can get downside protection and still get double-digit coupons. These are relatively defensive ways to aggregate wealth. So at the moment, I think that a lot of people like you are experiencing two different conversations with clients. One right now is the fog of war with inflation, what the Fed's going to do, where Fed funds peaks. And whether inflation comes down and what should I do like right now, with a timer rising to five minutes and maybe out to six months. Tom, the other conversation I'm hearing more of is whether this period is just an aberration. And we go back to the playbook of pre-pandemic, low rates, low inflation, low growth by tech. You're going to see duration kicking again. You're just going to go back down to say it one hand or maybe two. Tom, if you've given thought about the long-term story, the destination here, is this just an aberration, is this a real raging change, a breakaway, a permanent break from the last ten years? Now, I don't think it's a permanent break, Jonathan. There are, of course, going to be things that are different. And I think we have to, the most obvious one is we have to question how much confidence we can have in two percent inflation. But the longer run drivers of why interest rates have come down don't appear to have changed to me. And they're the ones we talk about all the time, aging demographics, technological advancement, the globalized connection, that deglobalization theme is getting a lot of attention. But any, I'm not sure that happens to America, is most likely to come in automation, and is that a, is that in the tech column, or is that in the deglobalization in the higher inflation conversation? So I do think rates all else equal are wildly high here, and over three, six, 12-month horizons need to come down. So I think that's the opportunity set for a long-term investor. A final question then, and it's a short-term one, I guess, it's about 12 months away. I asked this question to Jim Carenton, I'd love your assessment of it. The upside risk to the terminal rate of the Fed, just how much upside risk is there now? Given how much we've already priced in. I think, I mean, 5 percent after this morning is probably where the market will settle today, of what terminal Fed funds will be. Upside, downside to that is, I think we'll be warranted a true assessment after Q3 earnings. If earnings margins don't contract, I don't think we could easily reset that to $5.50. But if earnings and margins reset in a substantial way, we might have downside risk to that 5 percent number. So I guess a different way to answer your question is, I think we're symmetric on those risks of terminal relative to $4.75.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2487,2022-10-13 13:40:54
14262," Stantial way, we might have downside risk to that 5% number. So I guess a different way to answer your question is I think we're symmetric on those risks at terminal relative to 475 5% which is what's in the price. So Tom, if we've priced that and maybe we've more fully priced the Fed hike in cycle How much have we priced the damage that that will do to earnings? Yeah, I think that's the piece that's missing Jonathan. We haven't We're all focusing on what equity strategists are saying for earnings going forward, but That's just a number on a piece of paper. I think all of us have reset our earnings estimates somewhere to around On the S&P 500 200 210 and now how much pain does the Fed have to inflict is whether we that number should really be for 2023 earnings 180 or is 210 really likely um When we run our scenarios Jonathan Downside risk to equities from here. It should be more limited at 3200 3300 you're pricing in a meaningful recession of full fledged recession. So That's going to be the awkward part. I think for investors at least in my community of If we're not even seeing the recession, but the market has fully priced it. Yeah. How do I match my investing? Know how with my behavioral experience? Hey Tom. What a tough moment. Thomas Kennedy at JP Morgan. Tom happy to share this morning with you I think 60 minutes after another historic print for US inflation. Not a stocks on a move. Acreta is down by 2% black rock is down by about 3.8% Down in Washington. I'm pleased to say it's blue and blue and brown section now I think you and I are going to talk about this one and then we're going to have a busy morning tomorrow morning talking about Wall Street We sure are John. We're going to talk about block rock first because those assets have gone below $8 trillion that is less than what Wall Street was expecting earnings per share came in higher than expected here, but again there are a lot of jitters in the market About what a falling market would mean for a firm like black rock now fixed income flows were still healthy But you did have equities under pressure the retail business under pressure and certain parts of the institutional business Under pressure, but not as much as the retail business now To your point if you fast forward to tomorrow the big asset management arms of the banks are not what we normally zero right in on But it is another source of pressure that they all have to contend with mostly due to falling markets lower fees and their clients under pressure Sean Ali looking forward to the conversation on Wall Street this morning pretty much every bank under the sun before the opening Now Sean Ali Bacic down in Washington will be all over that in the next 12 hours coming up on this program a hot inflation surprise ramping up the pressure on the White House I don't think there will be a recession if it is there'll be a very slight recession that is will move down slightly The National Economic Council Director Bryant Ace joining us next You About 133,000 people time watching big jet TV which is just planes coming into Heathrow landing We should say it looks like I win and it's absolutely spectacular see come on mate.

Now there's another issue that shows a risen, which is called gamification, which is to say people are making a game out of trying to buy stocks. Are you worried about this phenomenon? We live in the 2020s in a new digital age where applications on our phones can use massive amount of data and then predict our behavior. What do we do when the digital algorithms are maximizing for the companies, revenues, rather than our returns? And so we're trying to think that through. It's not just gamification, it's a little bit more than that. It's whether there's a conflict between the app and our investment returns. You've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've been in and seen it. Lots of Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. What does it mean? It means they have a Bloomberg. Live from New York City for our audience worldwide on TV and radio, White House National Economic Council director Brian Deese. Join us right now. Brian, fantastic to catch up with you, sir. Core CPI in America, 40 year high. This is the last inflation report before the midterms. Does the White House take any responsibility for this or whatsoever? Well, look, it's clear that inflation is a challenge. It is a global challenge affecting countries around the world. And I think the first and most important part point to make is that the United States is in a better position than virtually any other country to address this challenge and do what is necessary to bring prices down. Without having to give up all of the economic gains that we have made. That continues to be our focus and that will continue to be our focus until we get this job done. The challenge is getting bigger. The president acknowledged this week the potential for a very slight recession. His words, his assessment. You briefed the president this week, Brian. Have your internal forecast become more or less negative over the last few months? Well, I think it's important to look at this monthly data in context. We are seeing some progress. If you look at annualized headline inflation over the last three months, it was about 2%. That's down from 11% in the prior quarter. Now, a lot of that is the significant reduction in energy prices and gas prices at the pump. Obviously, economists tend to strip those out and look at core, but for typical American families, for workers. The reduction in gas prices by more than a dollar gallon in most places in the country is a meaningful and real sign of progress. At the same time, we are seeing some elements of a transition which we anticipated, but now focus on the work ahead. Shelter inflation represented more than half of core inflation for the last couple of months. Obviously, that's a place where we are going to have to look very carefully because there is a well-known understanding that that data operates with a lag. We are seeing some contemporaneous real-time evidence of sharp deceleration in rental price appreciation, sharp deceleration in home price appreciation. That's going to be an area that we are going to have to stay very focused on here in the days and months. Brian, can you see why people get really frustrated with politicians? 12 months ago, 6 months ago, you would have said strip out gasoline and look at what's happening elsewhere. Now, it's leave gasoline in because gasoline is coming down. Can you see why people are very frustrated with the way the White House has navigated this issue? Look, I take issue with that characterization. Why? Because we always say that we look at the data and the aggregate and there's a reason to look in the fullness of overall inflation and then also to look at elements of the core like I just said. For typical American families, gas and food are big parts of their typical budget and food prices in this report and in prior reports are moving up too fast. That's something that we need to make more progress on. So, we look at all of the data and understand the point about gas prices is just a very...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2489,2022-10-13 13:49:21
14264," are moving up too fast and that's something that we need to make more progress on. So we look at all of the data and understand the point about gas prices is just a very salient one. Your outlet, various others over the course of the spring, spent a lot of time focused on the increasing gas prices and the impact that has on the economy on consumer sentiment. Now that they're coming down, it's important to recognize that that has an impact on the economy as well. Well more recently, they've been going back up as well, you know, it's why you've been very critical of Saudi Arabia over the last week. The president talked about consequences for Saudi Arabia. Brian, what consequences? What are they? Well, I'm not going to get ahead of the president. And as he said, he will make those decisions and and make those announcements when he is prepared to do so. I think our focus right now is on continuing to make that progress. If you look nationally right now, gas prices are still down about a dollar and $10 and $0.20 from their highs this summer. We're seeing some welcome moderation in certain areas of the country, the Midwest and California now. And we still face this historically large gap between the wholesale price that energy companies pay for refined products, gas, diesel otherwise, and the retail price that consumers are paying. So that's a continued area of focus, obviously refinery and refinery capacity is an element of that. But that's one of many areas that we are working with the industry and trying to focus on what we can do from a practical perspective, from a policy perspective, to try to move the ball forward. On OPEC+. The NSE spokesperson John Kirby called the decision short-sighted, a short-sighted decision that benefited Russia. Can you understand why using the SPR as the strategic midterm reserve is a short-sighted decision that only leaves this country even more exposed to the whims of OPEC+. Next year. Now look, I disagree. We said that the OPEC decision was short-sighted precisely because the lack of supply and reliable supply continues to be the dominant challenge globally in energy markets. The lack of supply continues to be the dominant risk. And the use of the strategic petroleum reserve in a historic but calibrated way starting last winter was designed to address that problem. And to help have additional supply on the market during this transition and during a period where we knew Russian supply was coming off and U.S. producers were ramping up. That's why if you talk to most energy market analysts, they will point to the fact that that use of the strategic petroleum reserve as a bridge, as a bridge as U.S. producers brought production back online, was one of the principal reasons that kept oil prices from moving up even more quickly over the course of the summer and into the fall. That's a prudent use of the asset as a transition as U.S. producers ramp up. You say it's a prudent use of the asset. Other people are very worried about this. You've drained the SPR to its lowest level in four decades. The sum accusation that you're using, you're putting the polls before America's energy security. Brian, the Saudis themselves said this morning that the U.S. requested a one-month delay to the OPEC plus output. I wonder why that would be. Brian, can you tell me whether you did ask the Saudis for a one-month delay to that decision? Are they telling the truth? Look, we clearly communicated our views to OPEC members that we thought it was shortsighted for them to take the action that they were contemplating and they announced. With respect to the strategic petroleum reserve, this was a calibrated decision to address the real issues in the market. We talked to U.S. industry last winter. We identified that there was about a million barrel a day gap between what they were producing this winter and what they said that they could get production to buy late this fall. That million barrel gap was what we calibrated to make the decision on the use of the strategic petroleum reserve. And people should feel confident that the strategic petroleum reserve continues to be an asset that we can deploy to address our economic and national security needs. That's always what has dictated the President's decision making on this and that's what will dictate his decision making on this going forward. Brian, you didn't answer the question so I'm going to ask it again. I'm going to share with you and share with our audience the quote from the Saudis this morning. The government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia would like to clarify that based on its belief in the importance of dialogue and exchange of views with its allies and partners outside of OPEC+. Regarding the situation in the oil markets, the government of the Kingdom clarified through its continuous consultation with the U.S. administration that all economic analyses indicate the postponing the OPEC plus decision for a month. According to what it's been suggested, would have had negative economic consequences. Brian, again, it's a really straight question.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2490,2022-10-13 13:53:54
14265," He's indicated the postponing, the OPEC plus decision for a month, according to what it's been suggested, would have had negative economic consequences. Brian, again, it's a really straight question. Did you ask the Saudis to delay that decision for a month? Are they telling the truth or not? Look, I'm not going to get on an area and disclose private conversations that members have already had. But it's not private, it's ready to share it with us. You've got the opportunity to say it's true or not? Is it true or not? What I will say, what I will say, what I will say clearly, is that the communications that we've had with OPEC members and continuing have been based on our assessment of the economic circumstances of supply and demand in global oil markets. We disagree with the assessment in that statement that it was economically the right or necessary or appropriate thing to do to reduce production at a time where the lack of global supply on the market continues to be the predominant challenge in global energy markets. That has been and continues to be the motivation behind all of our engagements in our nation. Again, they're suggesting it's a political one. That your strategy is political. That your reference to the anti-price is what I'm saying to you is that our strategy... I understand what they are suggesting and what I'm saying to you is that our strategy has always been grounded in an assessment of the economics of the situation and what is prudent for the global economy, for US economy and US families. So the way you would have some kind of viable energy policy from here is to make the decision as to whether what we're experiencing right now is a one-off shock or something more permanent, a one-off winter or something more permanent, a permanent shift away from Russian energy. Brian, which one is it? We are in a transition where we face some very immediate challenges, but absolutely, energy markets globally and in the United States are going to go through a transition. We're never going to go back to the pre-pandemic or the pre-poutine invasion paradigm on energy policy. And that's, frankly, why even as we have worked in to address very immediate term issues, including helping the Europeans increase their reserves of natural gas going into this winter to try to address those immediate challenges, we have been focused on long-term prudent energy policy and providing incentives, incentives for US producers of cleaner sources of energy to produce at scale and at speed that they've never done so before and to do so in lower costways here in the United States so that we can be a reliable supplier of clean, low-cost electricity to our industry, to our own consumers and families and to the world. The United States, the Biden administration, have focused on that, we prioritize that and in fact, we have now legislated long-term incentives to drive exactly that kind of investment in the United States. And that's based on an understanding that we are going to continue to be in a historic energy transition not just in the months ahead, but in the years ahead as well. Brian, if this is not a one-off shock, if this is a permanent shift, can we complete the conversation by you telling me how it's a viable strategy, a sustainable approach to drain the SPR to a four-decade low? If it's not about politics, why is that viable? Why is that strategy sustainable? Appreciate the question. It's a mischaracterization of how we use the strategic petroleum reserve. We announced a policy that was explicitly designed as a temporary bridge over the course of months, 180 million barrels, to bridge a temporary situation, while U.S. producers were ramping up supply in the short term. Our long-term challenges around energy are about investing in increasing the supply of clean energy in the United States and globally at massive scale. Those require different policy tools, which is why we've enacted historic, historic incentives, $370 billion in long-term incentives to increase investment in the United States. That's the right long-term policy solution. You can take short-term and temporary measures that are prudent and well-calibrated or long-side long-term measures. That's what we've been doing. Brian Deese, we appreciate your time this morning, sir. We really do. Thank you very much for choosing Bloomberg TV and Bloomberg Radio to have this conversation.

Pepsi's number fever campaign in the Philippines has probably gone down in history as one of the biggest marketing disasters in history mainly because of a human error that led Pepsi to print more winning caps than they planned. The resulting chaos caused riots, civil unrest and even deaths. Reporting this story took over a year and it resulted in me flying to Manila in the Philippines to meet unlucky winners and to find out exactly what happened back then in the 1990s. My name is Jeff Mace. I'm a journalist based in Los Angeles. I wrote this story.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2492,2022-10-13 14:02:04
14267," My name is Jeff Mace. I'm a journalist based in Los Angeles. I wrote the story for Bloomberg Business Week about Pepsi's Number Fever campaign. The Philippines is a really interesting country. It's made up of thousands of islands. And it's also a country that's very heavily influenced by America. American culture is everywhere you look in the Philippines. They're obsessed with Frank Sinatra music, for example. They love all things America and that extends to their love for soft drinks. Pepsi Cola, Coca Cola. In the 1990s, it was everywhere. Pepsi and Coca Cola were embroiled in what is now known as the Cola Wars. It was a fierce battle for market dominance. Number Fever was already a really popular promotion. It had been rolled out in America to great success. And so Pepsi decided to roll it out internationally, particularly in Asia. They thought it was the answer to their problems. They thought it could finally help them beat their biggest competitor. Internet, I want a watch! Look for the winning number in size size for every day off on TV, radio, and newspapers. You could be a millionaire. A million pesos or $68,000 doesn't sound like a lot now. But in 1992, that was a phenomenal amount of money. You've got to remember that in the Philippines at the time, the average monthly income was about $100. So a million pesos was wealth beyond anyone's wildest imaginations. Number Fever caught fire in the Philippines. Kids were saving up their pocket money to buy a bottle of Pepsi. Parents were squirreling away all of the bottle caps in bags. You would walk down the street and people were going through trash trying to find discarded bottle caps. It was a national phenomenon. Pepsi boasted that half the population of the Philippines was playing it. Number Fever boosted Pepsi sales every month from $10 million to $14 million. It had a huge impact on Pepsi's bottom line. Number Fever quickly became number hysteria. Mades were being jailed for stealing their employer's winning bottle caps. There were some murders over winning bottle caps. People were fighting in the streets over these caps. There were signs that there were going to be problems with number Fever very early. Pepsi had rolled out the competition in Chile and a garbled fax had caused some kind of problem with the winning number. They'd announced the wrong one in Chile causing riots. There were signs that there could be big problems ahead if they didn't keep their eye on the ball. So in 1992 Pepsi decided to extend the campaign in the Philippines and they announced that the competition would go on for a few more weeks. One night on the television news they announced the latest winning number. 3, 4, 9. The problem was 3, 4, 9 had already been allocated as a non-winning number in earlier campaigns. So there were literally hundreds of thousands of bottle caps with 3, 4, 9. Just floating around the Philippines. Hundreds of thousands of people all across the Philippines, thousands of islands were finding winning bottle caps. Some people had 10 lucky 3, 4, 9 bottle caps. People were dancing in the streets celebrating. They thought their problems were over. They were millionaires. It's still not certain exactly how many winners there were of lucky 3, 4, 9 bottle caps. But we know that Pepsi printed over 600,000 of them. Pepsi realized very early that there was a problem. Hundreds of people started arriving at their bottling plants with their lucky bottle caps. They realized something was seriously wrong. Pepsi tried to solve the problem by offering a small...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2493,2022-10-13 14:06:32
14268," People started arriving at their bottling plants with their lucky bottle caps. They realised something was seriously wrong. Pepsi tried to solve the problem by offering a small token donation to anyone that brought a lucky bottle cap to their bottling plant. But it wasn't enough. People didn't want just a handful of pesos. People wanted their million pesos prize. Within a year, violent protests and riots outside Pepsi factories would leave dozens injured and five people dead. At one Pepsi factory in the Philippines, a grenade was thrown through the window. It killed three Pepsi employees. Anacita Rosario was a schoolteacher living near Manila in the Philippines. She was one of the tragic victims of this whole thing. She was walking to a nearby store to buy some rice one day when a Molotov cocktail was thrown at a Pepsi truck in a violent protest. It bounced under the truck and exploded. It killed her and an innocent bystander who was just a child and injured many others. When I was in the Philippines, I tracked down Anacita's daughter, Cindy and her husband, Raoul. It was clear to me that they were still very upset by the whole thing. A family had been ripped apart by this competition. Raoul told me that he'd never remarried. He'd told me that he'd gone to meet Pepsi executives after his wife was killed. And he was angry. He said to them, this wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you, if it wasn't for number fever. The biggest revelation from my reporting was rumours that Pepsi was somehow involved in bombing their own trucks. I found a newspaper report with a headline that said Pepsi goons bombed their own trucks. And when I visited the MBI, the police department in the Philippines, they presented with documents and interviews with people who claimed that Pepsi had paid them to cause riots and to cause trouble outside their plants. In order to destabilize the situation and to frame the owners of the coalitions that were fighting them to try and curry favor, I just thought that was so shocking and of course Pepsi denied it. But how bizarre that a company would be accused of bombing their own trucks. The contest had sparked so much anger in the Philippines because it landed at just this really weird time in the Philippines history. It was during a crazy election that was racked with allegations of fraud. The Philippines was in a kind of love-hate relationship with America. They loved obviously the American aid and finances that was pouring into the country, but at the same time they yearned for independence. They wanted to be their own country. Vicente Del Fiero was a local preacher living in Manila and he hated the number fever campaign. Del Fiero thought Pepsi's number fever campaign was just one of the many ways that America was asserting its dominance over a third world country. He hated seeing his fellow countrymen get ripped off in his eyes by this huge multinational American company. He wanted justice. Del Fiero rounded up over 800 winners of 349 bottle caps and he got them all together to sue Pepsi for over 400 million dollars to be divided between those holders of lucky bottle caps. Del Fiero took money from some of the people who could afford it. They paid him 500 pesos to help with legal fees, but for people who couldn't afford the money he would just represent them pro bono. I love it. They're doing it. He's doing it. He's doing it. They're doing it. I'm happy. And for you to be for a month and a half.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2494,2022-10-13 14:10:58
14269," and then pro bono. I learned that he used to build that breaker on that team. And for you two people, I might be the first. So he had mounted that on that damn phone. He didn't do that. He didn't do that. He flew to America and he hired two consumer lawyers here in America to take on Pepsi. He had a meeting at Pepsi's headquarters to try and resolve the problem. But he said he wanted to take it all the way to the highest courts in America. When those cases were heard in America, those courts decided that this was a problem that should be heard in the Philippines, not in America. Back in the Philippines, Delphiero continued his case in the Filipino courts. At one stage, there were arrest warrant handed out for nine Pepsi-Cola executives, which he saw as a big victory. We don't know if those arrest warrant were ever upheld, but it made newspaper headlines across the country. Pepsi did not take kindly to Delphiero's campaign. They tried everything to shut him down. They sued him for libel. My father had to attend three times a month for a brunch, one for a day, and another heating for the brunch, one for dinner, also three times a month. Also, there was a time my father's was hospital. To do heart failure, still he had to attend the two brunch heating of otherwise, for not attending the judge will issue water to the next time father. My father passed away January 13, when they then after staying for almost one year in the hospital, he died of complications with the heart failure. After the death of my father, I was inspired to do the website. Pepsi could be remembered for what they did to the consumer in the Philippines and to my father. When I reached out to Pepsi for comment for this story, they claimed that they didn't have access to anyone who was working at Pepsi that was around in those days. They also said that during COVID-19, they didn't have access to their documents about this. But they were very careful to say that they were sorry for everything that happened. And we do know that Pepsi did try everything to try and make this right. The Pepsi number fever disaster cost the company millions. We know that they paid up to $10 million in those good-will payments. But the financial effect could be much greater. After the disaster, we know that Pepsi sales dipped. They were overtaken by Coca-Cola again. Pepsi's number fever disaster changed the legacy of that soft drink in the Philippines forever. Some people of certain age won't touch it. For many people, Pepsi is a taboo word. A lot of the people that I spoke to were still quite traumatized by their experience. By that experience of winning a million pesos, losing it, and then returning to their normal life in poverty in Manila. You When the news of the farming came out, it was a massive story in Germany. We are following some breaking news coming to us out of Dortmund in Germany.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2495,2022-10-13 14:15:13
14270," In news coming to us out of Dortmund in Germany. It was covered by all the media. There's three roadside explosions triggered at the same time last night as a coach left its hotel in the south of Dortmund. Public figures commented on it. We should not let them affect our life wherever it was. The media echo went far beyond Dortmund. I think it was front page news and everything, a big paper around Europe. Everyone thought of like a terrorist attack and people were scared that throughout the city in Dortmund there was more attacks to be happening. Unbeknownst to investigators just after the bomb went off and the players of the team were shell shocked. The person who had mastered the attack was actually sitting in the hotel, eating steak and sweet potatoes. My name is Thomas Rogers. I'm the journalist who wrote the article The Get Rich Quick Scheme that nearly killed a German soccer team. Dortmund is a mid-sized city in the western part of Germany in a state called North Rhine, Westphalia. And it's a former industrial city that's kind of fallen on hard times in the last few decades. It was severely bombed in the war. So the center of the city is quite stark. Some of the few high points include its soccer team. My name is Aikening. I'm a reporter with Bloomberg News and I'm a great fan of Borussia Dortmund. Dortmund fans are super loyal. On all match days the entire city is in black and yellow. It's like a religion. I think more than most German cities, soccer does play a very large role in the identity of Dortmund. In October of 2000, the BBB became the first team in the Bundesliga to actually go public. Salaries for soccer players in the Bundesliga have gone up very dramatically. With such high prices they thought that by going public they would be able to compete better with big teams like Bayern Munich. Unfortunately that didn't go too well. Dortmund bought too many expensive players, high wages, and the club almost went bust in 2005. The price of their shares, it has sometimes gone up, but mostly gone down since they made that decision. So on April 11, 2017, the team was staying in a hotel on the outskirts of Dortmund. Match days are always special in Dortmund, everyone is looking forward to it. The team always meets in the same hotel ahead of matches. They stayed in this hotel in order to have a kind of neutral space before game so that they could concentrate, be isolated from distractions, things like that. Everyone was pretty optimistic they had a chance to go really far, maybe into the finals. I was in the office and getting ready for match day, was going to meet with a friend, a fellow Dortmund supporter in a pub. As always the fans are very excited about matches. On that day they were heading to play in the quarter final against AS Monaco at Signal Uduna Stadium, which is in the centre of Dortmund. Shortly before 7pm the players of the team boarded their official team bus. When the bus took off the parking lot of the hotel and turned on the street, there were three detonations, three bombs that exploded and hit the bus off Dortmund. Three explosions occurred close to the Borussia Dortmund team bus. The B team bus had just left the hotel. The explosions destroyed two windows in the rear part of the bus. People screamed, people jumped to the ground. The fellow Dortmund fan I was supposed to watch match with, he called me and said, turn on the TV there was an attack of the Dortmund bus and I thought he was like, there was impossible. Some of the players screamed at the driver to keep driving as fast as possible because they were worried that people might storm the bus. German investigators say the explosive devices used in the attack on the Borussia Dortmund bus can...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2496,2022-10-13 14:20:03
14271," They were worried that people might storm the bus. German investigators say the explosive devices used in the attack on the Berusha Gortman bus contained metal pins and the one had pierced a seat headrest. Unbeknownst to the team members, the actual mastermind behind the attack was as they were disembarking the bus, was actually eating steak and sweet potatoes at the hotel. They had just left. Authorities were attempting to verify a letter left at the scene, claiming Jihadists were behind the attack. Because there had been a series of attacks by Islamic terrorists in Germany and Europe, there was a widespread suspicion in the media that this was another Islamic terror attack. Three letters were found at the site of the bombing that took credit for the attack on behalf of Islamic State. There were however reasons to doubt this particular narrative. It would actually be a surprise if ISIS were actually part of this attack. Possibly could be employed by other groups like the Far Right wing to try and shift the blame. The letters had some strange qualities. They were written in a strange German that used big sophisticated words but had basic grammar mistakes as if someone was native German speaker but pretending to be a foreign person. Several investigators have detained one man suspected of links to Islamist terrorism, one of two suspects whose apartments were raided this morning. Shortly after the bombing, a man in Austria named Rudolf who was a big BBB fan, he noticed that something strange was going on on the stock market related to the team's shares. He emailed the lawyers of BBB who then forwarded that email on to investigators. The email stated that someone had bought 60,000 BBB put options, a wager that the value of the shares of the team would fall below a certain amount at a certain date. Why would someone buy that ahead of a match and then three bombs go off? Something is right here. The person to make money off of that had required the stock to go down quite a bit in a fairly short period of time and it wouldn't just be the team losing a match, it would require something much bigger than that. There was another big red flag about this purchase which is the fact that it had actually been made. Number one on the day of the bombing but also from an IP address that had been traced to the actual hotel where the bombing had taken place. When three explosions targeted the bus carrying the Borussia Dortmund for ballers on April 11th, written notes left at the scene claimed the attack was the work of ISIL. The truth, as is now alleged, is remarkable. On April 21st, the police arrested a man in a southern German city called Tubingen. It was on his way to work and his name was Sergei Bina-Gord. He seemed like an unlikely suspect because he had no known connections to the Islamic terror world. He didn't seem like a far-right extremist. He didn't seem like a left-wing extremist either. He seemed to be a completely unremarkable young man. A 28-year-old German Russian man named only as Sergei W stayed in the same hotel as the players on the night before the bombing. He specifically requested an upper room overlooking the bushes where the explosive devices were hidden. The media dissected why he would do that, what was his past. He had been inspired by the 2015 terror attack in Paris. And he noticed that in the aftermath of the attack, the stocks of French companies went down. And he believed that if an attack took place that was directed at a specific company, that the decrease in stock price for that company would be even more dramatic. It never occurred to anyone that someone would do that out of greed. We now know that the suspect bought three different derivatives on the Borzi-Adortman shares. With all these derivatives, he bet on falling shares. The suspect bought the majority of these financial products on the 11th of April, the day of the attack. And if the plot had been complete, successful, and the stock had reached a...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2497,2022-10-13 14:24:09
14272," With these financial products on the 11th of April, the day of the attack. If the plot had been complete and successful and the stock had reached a value of zero, Inner Gold would have made up to 570,000 euros or the equivalent of about $608,000. Ultimately the plan completely backfired. The attacker, Sega, Venegolud didn't make any money, in fact he lost money. In court he would be extremely quiet. He usually kept his hands clasped together. One of the lawyers actually commented that he had never seen a defendant act so calmly. The Inner Gold had served some time in the German military. From that information and from online research he was able to figure out how to assemble remote, detonated bombs that would do what he hoped to do. There were a few days of extremely emotional testimony including the soccer players who described doubting whether or not they could ever play another game again. It brought everything back up and it didn't quite help them to kind of process what was going on. Throughout it all he sat there completely silent. The big mystery that was swirling around the trial was the question of why he may have simply done it because he wanted to impress a woman. Rebecca is a young woman who has a very troubled home life. She ultimately sees her relationship with Venegolud as an opportunity to leave that troubled home. Venegolud is a Russian immigrant to Germany. He speaks with an accent. He has anxiety in large groups of Germans. She begins to resent the fact that he has these fears and feels a little bit trapped. Rebecca attempts to dump him on multiple occasions and he threatens to commit suicide if she leaves him. Venegolud apparently told Rebecca that she would soon be seeing a surprise. After being dumped via text message he apparently began planning for this attack in earnest. Venegolud was charged with 28 counts of attempted murder which carried a maximum sentence in Germany of life in prison. He claimed that he had nothing to do with the attack but as time went on he admitted that he had actually been the person who had built the explosives and had set them on. But he claimed that he didn't want to actually kill anybody. Ultimately, Venegolud didn't receive the harshest possible sentence. He was given 14 years in prison but it's still a considerable amount in jail in Germany. The threats of an asteroid hitting earth is very real. If it's big enough it's also very final. A blinding flash of light streaking across the sky. About 100 tons of space rock falls on earth every day. Most of it is so small it burns up in our atmosphere or lands unnoticed away from major populations. No human in the past thousand years is known to have been killed by a meteorite. According to NASA, no large object is likely to strike the earth any time in the next several hundred years.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2498,2022-10-13 14:28:14
14273," is known to have been killed by a meteorite and according to NASA no large object is likely to strike the earth any time in the next several hundred years. However, one thing is certain, we haven't found them all. There are thousands out there and we don't know where they are. There are a lot of asteroids in our solar system. They number in billions. Scientists all over the world are working toward detecting and deflecting the most catastrophic of natural disaster. The race is on to find as many of these objects as we can. We have the way of calculating whether or not an asteroid is potentially dangerous or not. I mean I think it's something worth investing in. It's our existence as a safe. Amy, let's get this one out of the way. It's probably the question you get asked the most. But how scared should we be? Asteroids and comets are a natural hazard that's out there like a lot of other natural hazards. These are very very infrequent events, these collision events where an object actually impacts the earth. The most important thing that we need to know about asteroids is when the next impact is going to happen and how bad it will be. What we know is that an object that's about say a kilometer across is capable of causing very very wide devastation across the planet, really truly global devastation. The object that wiped out the dinosaurs was somewhere in the neighborhood of 5 to 10 kilometers across, so even bigger than that. At a kilometer it's still going to be very bad and will have global effects. For objects that are capable of causing what I would call sort of regional damage, kind of a large major metropolitan area, a city in its surrounding environment, sort of around 100-ish meters. It depends on the details of the composition and so forth. By the 1980s NASA was cataloging near-earth objects. In 1994, Stargazers watched his comet Schumäke-Levy 9 hit Jupiter. The resulting zone of chaos was estimated to be as large as the Earth, and the event became a turning point in the search for asteroids and comets in our solar system. In 1998, Congress tasked NASA with finding 90% of asteroids and comets 1 kilometer wide or larger. Soon after, Hollywood blockbusters Armageddon and Deep Impact brought attention and fear to the masses. The great news is that the vast majority of more than 90% of all the really large 1 kilometer near-earth objects have been found. The challenge now is working down to these smaller sizes that are still quite capable of causing a lot of damage, but they're just harder to spot because they're fainter. Can you give us a sense of how many are out there in our solar system? We know that there are a lot of asteroids in our solar system. They number in the billions. Most of them, however, are between Mars and Jupiter in what we call the main asteroid belt. This is a region of space where most of the asteroids in the inner part of our solar system live, and they stay there for many billions of years. There is another population, though, that kind of leaks inward and gets into the region somewhat close to the Earth. And we call these near-earth objects. We think that there are millions and millions of near-earth objects that are out there in the total population. As of today, we know of sort of around 20, 25,000, something like that. When we first spot an object, we really know very little about it. We just see something moving across the sky. So all you get is just sort of a handful of snapshots, just enough to be able to tell that this isn't an asteroid that we've already seen before. And then once we can calculate the distance to it, we can now start to make predictions about its true size. Is it large or is it small? So we have a lot of information that we have to get pretty quickly to really understand what's going on. Finding asteroids is just one piece of the puzzle. Planetary scientists are extremely skilled in determining the orbits and speeds of asteroids based on relatively small amounts of data. NASA runs simulations of the trajectories asteroids could take, which is useful, but time consuming.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2499,2022-10-13 14:32:47
14274," that's of these small amounts of data. NASA runs simulations of the trajectories asteroids could take, which is useful, but time consuming. A team of scientists in the Netherlands have found a way that could buy us more time. Our methods is very quick. So you can very quickly get an assessment of whether or not the objects is danger or not. If you look at the classical way of determining the danger of an asteroid, it may take days of computing time on very big machines to determine this hazardousness. The current problem is that there's as too many asteroids out there to spend a huge amount of computational power on all of them. So the neural network allows us to focus on what really could go and pose a hazard to Earth. A neural network is a computing system that mimics the way the human brain operates to find underlying relationships in a set of data. By training the network in this way, you train it in recognizing those objects that are most likely to hit the planet. And once it's trained, you can apply this network to all the unknown asteroids. And then you can make a selection and saying, hey, these are the ones which appear to be having orbits similar to the ones which we know are hitting the planet. It doesn't mean that they do, but it does. It only means that they look very similar to once we know they do. What else did you find? Should we be particularly concerned about anything? One thing that we did find is that our neural network was able to go and identify a handful of asteroids, which weren't considered potentially hazardous, that when we went into the greater than forward in time, they came quite close to Earth. We find a handful which were not detected before or not considered being dangerous before. And we think they are potentially dangerous. It's very hard to simulate kind of going forward in time and asteroid that's going to hit Earth because what the Earth is really small. And what space is really big. And then you have to have very exact parameters to shoot an asteroid that goes and hits exactly there. And then Simon had the ingenious idea of not even trying to do that and just launching the asteroids from Earth's surface and integrating backwards in time. It's very hard to make it hit. So you need a lot of calculations which all end up in nothing. And the idea was then like, well, let's not do that. This is basically what NASA is doing. NASA is taking an asteroid, making multiple copies of them, shooting them all forwards in time, calculating their orbits, and then see what fraction sort of gets close to Earth. They'll even hitting Earth but getting close to Earth. And then they call it a potential impactor. So you calculate the solar system forward in time for let's say a thousand years. And then you launch asteroids from the surface. As if they if you go forward in time would fall on the surface, you calculate them backwards due today. And then you get your orbital parameters of today's asteroid, which you know will land on the planet. And those you can use as known impactors and compare with all the other asteroids in the solar system. Consimulations and AI can those things fill in the gaps where perhaps telescopes and other imaging tools can't. Absolutely. Since the observations get more complex, the physics gets more complex. And if the physics gets more complex, the mathematics becomes more complex. And at some point you can't solve your problems analytically anymore. And then this is where the computer comes in. Now we have this trained neural network. We have a way of calculating in a fraction of a seconds. Whether or not an asteroid is potentially dangerous or not. And therefore deserves more attention or more time to spend on for for redefining our capabilities dangerous. When it comes to hunting asteroids, time is critical. What we can do about a potentially hazardous object depends a great deal on what we know about it. And how much time we have before the encounter. We really like to find them on their decades away. Because the more time you have, the more options you have. And the less energy it takes to move an object aside. It also means we might not have to resort to launching a nuclear warhead as an asteroid. Until recently, pretty much our only choice. That's an option of last resort in my opinion, yes. We have lots of options available you can just simply open them.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2500,2022-10-13 14:37:08
14275," Until recently, pretty much our only choice. That's an option of last reason I did my opinion, yes. We have lots of options available. You can just simply bump into the object and just nudge it out of the way. That's one possibility. And that's kind of in a way the simplest thing to think about, just nudge it off. It's a path a little bit with a massive object, a spacecraft one. So it's kind of like bowling if you have a long time or a long stretch of runway in the lane. Just a very small twist on the bowling ball will make a big change in where it ultimately ends up. Another option would be something where you take a very big, big, massive spacecraft and you park it next to the object and you use the force of gravity as a towing rig. That takes longer though. And you need to be able to send a pretty massive spacecraft. And it obviously depends a lot on how big the asteroid is. Other options start to get more and more complicated. And they range from painting one side of the object of white color and painting the other side dark and letting the pressure of light sort of perturb its orbit. In a departure from the lab and computer simulations, NASA has real plans to rehearse kinetic impact deflection. In 2021, the agency will launch Dart, the double asteroid redirection test mission, which will intercept a 160 meter asteroid in 2022. Better to practice now before we have to deal with an actual threat. In the meantime, discovering asteroids is our best bet. Thousands of scientists and amateur astronomers around the world make up an informal network that surveyed the heavens. But that may not be enough. NASA wants more resources to map our solar system and better technology. We need to ramp up our network of sensors. And also, we need to just continue to strengthen our network of international observers so that we can get follow-up. Because we find these objects when they're distributed all over the late sky. Once we get more observations, we get better data, we can make better predictions. If you look at the big impactors we have had in the last, let's say, 20 years or maybe 30 years, 50 years, most of them we haven't seen coming. So the danger, the real danger, I think comes from the objects we don't know about. And notes from the objects we do know about. This particular natural disaster, like a lot of natural disasters and climate change, is a problem with the global commas. So the thing that we risk collectively is that it sort of then becomes nobody's problem. And nobody takes our worship over it. Asteroids are all over the sky. They just truly cross boundaries and borders with a seconds notice. They're kind of imagining the future. Maybe he wants a small satellite around the Earth that we're always going and looking out for. I mean, I think it's something worth investing in. That's our existence, that stake, right? That's our existence. The pandemic has affected everyone in different ways. Some passed the time by baking. Some chose to binge watch Netflix. Or maybe you started a garden oasis in your backyard. But for millions of others, they wanted to uproot the financial industry. I'm just fucking on up and take 50,000 dollars. Here's your stock that can change your life.

14276," Get on up and take 50,000 dollars. Here's your stock that can change your life. I see a stock going up and I buy it, and I just watch it until it stops going up, and then I sell it. I haven't gained over $3 million. I want some free money. I don't think you can overstate the online communities or social media influence on financial markets. A large group of inexperienced investors who discuss their plans on social media platform Reddit have shaken up the stock market in a big way. The stock that everybody's talking about right now is GameStop. Video game retailing, GameStop is set to continue their head spinning ascent today. The revolutionaries on Reddit are spanking Wall Street's ass. The more these stocks go up, the more the big guys are getting creamed and losing billions of dollars. This is in a wealthy person's game anymore, anyone can play it. I took up a little bit of a new hobby and I'm interested in day trading. As an investor nowadays, you don't have to look a specific way. You don't have to wear specific clothes. You don't have to be doing it from a trading floor on Wall Street in like a high-rise building in downtown Manhattan. The narrative of what's driving the markets is no longer being held in secret offices in New York in Boston of privileged people talking to other privileged people. It's right out in the open. It's on Twitter. It's on Reddit. From brokerage apps to discord channels and subreddits to TikTok influencers, one of the last holdouts in the world of disruption, finance is next in line. Investing should be as you pick with us as shopping online. That's Vlad Tenev, the CEO of Robinhood, the online brokerage app, talking about how he wants his app to disrupt the world of stock trading like Amazon disrupted the world of home shopping. And I think that speaks to exactly the mission that a platform like Robinhood has, which is to democratize investing. Robinhood was started in 2013 by Vlad Tenev and by Jubat, in where else Silicon Valley, as an alternative to the big brokerages, but with one big difference. As they were building the social network around finances for people, they realized that there was a gap in the market. And that free trading could become something that they could bring to the markets. They could disrupt the industry. While no fee trading is industry standard today, it was unheard of when it was first introduced. The online brokerage industry was really innovative when they came on the scene 10, 15 years ago. But they kind of stopped innovating, where you haven't seen those commissions come down beyond five or six or seven dollars. Robinhood, think that by offering zero commission, that they're going to push people onto this platform. And on top of no fee trading, the customer's Robinhood was courting have been long overlooked in the world of finance. So the typical customer of a Charles Schwab, for example, is putting a lot more money in that brokerage account than the typical customer at Robinhood. Even today, with all of its popularity, the median account size is about $240. There's fiddellities in the Schwab, the e-trades of the world. They look down their nose at those kind of accounts. I don't want a thousand dollar account. They're just a headache. I want a hundred thousand dollar account. And this is key here, right? Because the thing about Robinhood, that's different than every other single brokerage platform, is how easy it is to use. The design of the Robinhood app really has in mind a user who might be coming at this absolutely cold. The fonts are very well-sized, the shapes, the colors. All of that is something that the founders of Robinhood paid really close attention to. And by creating an interface that catered to a newer investor, they were able to gather a pretty healthy group of customers. And by 2019, they had about 10 million customers. Those 10 million customers were a huge success story for Robinhood, but no one could have predicted its explosion after the arrival of COVID-19. Remaining doors to the greatest extent.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2502,2022-10-13 14:45:52
14277," Numbers were a huge success story for Robinhood, but no one could have predicted its explosion after the arrival of COVID-19. Remain indoors to the greatest extent and 100% of the non-essential workforce must stay home. What we saw when the pandemic hit was the growth of Robinhood users absolutely turbocharged. And oddly, you saw this surge in interest in stock trading. Then they saw the absolute surge in 2020 in customer growth. And now by many accounts they have more than 20 million customers, which is pretty extraordinary. So the next step for them is to figure out how to monetize those users and how even with their small account sizes to get them to grow with the company and as it releases more products come along with them. Robinhood would become one of the COVID economies' breakout successes. Robinhood traders, as they're called, became the shorthand explanation for the frenzy of often speculative retail investing after the pandemic lockdowns. Kids wake up in the morning, they go on Robinhood. They're, you know, in the shower, they check Robinhood. Kids are learning, how the stock market works at 18 while they're at school, you know, checking their phones and between classes. Because notifications pop up telling them what their stocks are doing that day. With these new tools, millennials and Gen Z are investing in the market in ways their parents could have never even dreamt of. That is sort of key when we talk about the divide between older and younger generations. That is sort of key when we talk about the divide between older and younger generations is that the younger generations exposed to so much more information and tools at their disposal to do what they want in the market. The older generations, you never had the technology or the cost structure that you could play the markets like you can today. So you were stuck with giving your money to a professional investor and paying them a fee to do it. I speak to young kids, they tell me I'm making mistakes, I'm losing money, I'm not a perfect investor, but I'm 18 and by the time I'm 30, which will be, you know, 10 years from now, I'm going to have interacted with the markets for a decade. And so it's a learning experience more so than anything else. And you can look at it and you can say, wow, that's, you know, that's risk taking that's dumb. But, you know, if you could possibly shave 10, 20 years off your working life versus adding five years, I don't think you can fault people for that. But Robinhood is only part of the puzzle. Sure, you can trade on it, but without research information and data, you're just blindly throwing darts at different stocks and hoping to strike it rich. Wall Street forever has always run on what we now call narratives for memes. You know, people telling rumors to each other, it's been around for a hundred years. On Wall Street, information is its own currency. Historically, either you had it or you didn't. And the people who had it had a huge advantage. In the past, those narratives and memes didn't have a network effect. It would be one person telling another person over the phone. In fact, when I broke into this business in the 80s, a lot of people used to complain that they weren't on the call list to get those ideas. Social media changed all of that. It's as far as 2021, that's being done on the internet. And that's being done on Discord and Twitter and StockTwix and Reddit. And the impact is very similar, but orders and orders is meant to too larger. As social media has played a bigger part in our lives, it's also played a bigger and kind of more important role in how people find investing ideas online and online.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2503,2022-10-13 14:50:03
14278," The media has played a bigger partner lives. It's also played a bigger and kind of more important role in how people find investing ideas online and on these platforms. How do those ideas spread on TikTok? Yes, that TikTok. Soon may the women come to bring a sugar and tea and rum. People aren't just going to it for C-Shanty videos. The personal finance hashtag on TikTok has garnered 3.5 billion views from its 1 billion monthly active users. By comparison, videos found under the cooking and health tips hashtag have 2.6 and 2.1 billion views respectively. The trajectory of Robinhood and TikTok were literally on par. What happened in the stack market this week? So the word of the week is expectations. Absolutely essential that you understand the risks of shorting. And Kayla Kilbride and Kyla Scanlon are two of those financial influencer TikTokers, also known as Finn Fluensers. I think people still care about fashion, they care about culture, but it's also like there's this big behemoth thing called the stack market that we really don't know a whole lot about and it's a gateway behind the industry. And so people like want to unpack that. And so my audience is, a lot of them are younger investors who are looking to hone their skills, tech in right up. Kyla and Kayla are two of the more, let's say, professional TikTok influencers. The Tesla Arc Bitcoin Biotech Risk Cluster. I have been trading since high school and it was a really interesting way for me to fill out my decision making frameworks and to think about thinking. And I think that the more that we can have people thinking about finance, the better that we're going to progress as a society, I think it's a huge gap in our educational system. If you're going to buy an option for stock, you think it's going to go up. It's a call. So think about like this. I made the options video where I was like options are just like shopping. Rumor has it that this pal is about to go up in price. So if I come in tomorrow, can I still buy it at the price? And a ton of women just like attacked that video and we're like, you explain things so much better than my boyfriend or my professor or like, I could sit and listen to you all day. And I was like, this is what I was looking for. But TikTok's algorithm does not reward common measured videos about responsible investing. It rewards this. Watch this video for 30 seconds and you'll be rich for the rest of your f***ing life. I try not to say the A word, the ALGO word, because TikTok listens to us. The algorithm does impact how you feel. You do notice which videos do better versus which videos do worse. How do you catch some attention in less than 60 seconds? And how do you make it something that they're like, I need this in my life? Nearly impossible to do that in 60 seconds. But the people who perfect it are the people that you're going to watch and get to seek around. And where people are sticking around, read it. And it's nearly countless subreddits about finance. And by far, the biggest one of those is Wall Street Bets. There's a lot of social media platforms out there. But Reddit is like the social media platform for finance. Places like Wall Street Bets is where it all goes down. Started in January 2012, it wasn't long before Wall Street Bets adopted a 4chan-like etiquette. Leading to their tagline, like 4chan found a Bloomberg terminal. We had all these unexplained stockings and we would be grasping for a wide stock XYZ jump 20% in a day. And you would look at Wall Street Bets and you would see people there talking about buying options in that stock. And it sort of squared the circle, so to speak, and started making sense. And it was at that point that it was like, wow, we have to start paying attention to this. Some people on the platform really spend tons of time. And others were just looking for entertainment and to have a little bit of fun effectively gambling or looking for an outlet trying to make a little bit of money. Then on top of all of that, there were stimulus checks. Now clearly, this money is going to people who need to use that to eat, to live. But there are a lot of people who use this money to invest in the stock market. And it's not just stock tips. People quote unquote, yolo their entire life savings or stimulus checks on a single stock. They post what is called gain and loss porn.

14279," Their entire life savings are stimulus checks on a single stock. They post what is called gain and loss porn, screen grabbing staggering hits and misses on stocks for the entire community to see. I am back to lose everything. And while some of the people on Wall Street bets are novice investors, the community contains multitudes. In one respect, what it did show us among these network groups is they are very sophisticated. They are not a bunch of ignorant people talking to other ignorant people. And this is where the pieces of the puzzle all come together to reach havoc on Wall Street for a solid week in early 2021. It's pretty clear that the combination of more people having retail brokerage accounts and trading apps and more people being stuck at home looking for some kind of entertainment and some kind of community online came together in this very singular way. What came together is GameStop. Let's go back to the beginnings of what happened with GameStop a couple of years ago. On the boards like Reddit and Stocktwist, a lot of people were talking about GameStop as being attractive value. Some of them are even, you know, Wall Street alums who left the industry and now still have access to tools that they can use to improve their financial well-being and make very good decisions. And I think Warring Kitty is a perfect example of that. GameStop is one of the most compelling asymmetric opportunities in the market today. Really, I don't understand how you can disagree with that. At the same time that this crowd was talking it up, the hedge fund institutional crowd didn't like the stock at all. And it had the largest short interest of any stock in the New York Stock Exchange going into late 2020. Short selling is a bet that a stock price will fall and it's a fairly simple concept. An investor borrows a stock and then sells it. The investor is betting on buying the stock back later for a lower price before returning it to the original owner pocketing the price difference. What a short seller would tell you is that they almost act as a policeman in financial markets or they're at least looking for companies that aren't what they say they are. And that can range anywhere from an outright fraud that some short seller is trying to expose to just a company that's not worth as much as investors think it is. The problem is if the stock price rises, the short seller has to come up with the money to buy the stock back. And the more it rises, the more it costs. And that's what's called a short squeeze. And the hedge fund Melvin Capital was on the wrong end of that squeeze. Melvin Capital lost over 50% of its money in the month of January alone just from being caught in the short squeeze of the stock. This is where the disruption comes in. One of the most wild stories you're ever going to see GameStop shares absolutely going nuts. In less than a year, the company's stock has jumped from less than $3 a share to almost $350. Cheers everybody. Rory and Kitty has turned $50,000 or so investment into some $14 million. Whoa. Investors all over social media use the free trading app Robinhood to wreak havoc on Wall Street. They're actually piling on into some of these stocks to really hurt the professional short sellers. And they all used Reddit, Twitter, TikTok, and Discord to tell one another to keep buying and quote, hold the line and not sell GameStop. People are getting cheerleaded for jumping in, buying at the highs, they're saying keep going. And it was working too until Thursday morning, the trading app Robinhood sent out this tweet. In light of current market volatility, we are restricting transactions, including GameStop. People were really angry. Robinhood was supposed to allow the regular people to play the same game. These big boys are playing. But instead, we were all taken for schmucks and they screwed us. Shares of GameStop are jumping again now that retail investors are being allowed to buy shares of the stock. But what we learned is that when people organize online, they have the ability to disrupt the market. And it was a big sign that ivory rolls on the institution aren't as powerful.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2505,2022-10-13 14:58:48
14280," I mean, they have the ability to disrupt the market. And it was a big sign that ivory rolls in the institution, aren't as powerful. It's maybe the institution's left them to be. I don't know if pumping out GameStop was the best use of billions of dollars, but I think that as a signal to society, it was pretty interesting and powerful. The GameStop saga was so impactful that both Vlad Tenev and Roryn Kitty were called into testify before Congress to clarify each of their roles in the saga. One thing that's emerged from the congressional hearings is that they're interested in how retail brokerages make money and whether they're keeping the best interest of their customers in mind. But it's pretty fuzzy as far as what they would actually do as a result. While the friends around GameStop eventually subsided, it didn't take long for retail investors to find other areas to invest their money. Take a look at Bitcoin going bananas over the weekend. Bitcoin forms a brand new all-time high. It was after GameStop started to drop that we saw Bitcoin really go up to over 60,000. How much further does Israeli have to run? It's compelling to say that money shifted from one venue to the other. While correlation doesn't equal causation, there's a chart out there showing an inverse correlation on mean stocks going down and cryptocurrencies going up. There's definitely an aspect where people are making money on stocks and then moving, you know, they're agnostic, they're not hedge funds. They can invest wherever the hell they want. It's a classic sort of momentum trade. They're going to wherever the winners are and they're willing to jump on and, you know, ride it. So whether it's mean stocks like GameStop, mean coins like Dogecoin are entirely new ways to invest in art like NFTs, the new kind of retail investor is making its presence known. Over the next 10, maybe 15 years, you're going to continue to see whether by choice or by force, that baton go from older generations to younger generations. I don't think any single app is going to be the thing that disrupts, I think, people are the disruptors. How people get ideas about what to invest in has become increasingly entwined with social media. And as social media companies govern more and more of our lives, the fact that now they're tied in more intimately to people's wallets is something that we might want to understand better. Usually what disruption I think means is technology comes in whether it's blogs to the newspapers or online, retelling to brick and mortar. They come in and they're in the same business, but they just do it in such a gigantic cost savings that it causes everybody to switch. Well, that's the risk that happens here is that it's so much cheaper to just manage your own money. We're not there yet, but costs and conveniences are moving in that direction. So I'd say Wall Street, you haven't been disrupted yet, but you could be in the coming years and that the final chapter on this story hasn't been ripped. Meet Bloomberg's own David Nicholson. Now his happy place is out in the field on the open road, but like the rest of the world lately, he's been working from home a lot more than he's used to. COVID-19 has prompted a massive urban exodus as professionals of every ilk yearned for more space to live and work. As a result.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2506,2022-10-13 15:03:03
14281," more than he's used to. COVID-19 has prompted a massive urban exodus as professionals of every ilk yearn for more space to live and work. As a result, rural areas have exploded and their poised to experience a resurgence as more and more families pack up and leave the big city to try out life in the berms. But there's one problem with that. Not all internet speeds are created equal. Anyone who might need to upload or download large files for a living may not want to pack up and move to that cabin in the woods just yet. Now David's house isn't a cabin, but it is in the woods. And inexplicably, his internet is workable. My internet is okay. I pay a lot for it. It's around $140 a month. The download speed is great and the upload speed is terrible, which is really bad for my work because I have to upload these massive files. And I'm definitely one of the more lucky ones in this community. Just a few miles down the road, my buddy has awful internet. It's usually under two down and under point two up. So it's often unusable. Some days it's around one and other times it'll drop down to about point two, point three. I just want to be able to have internet at my house without having to go outside the normal ways of acquiring internet. It's really frustrating. We're literally miles, a few miles away from downtown and it just cuts off. This is a problem and the solutions are not there yet because getting high speed internet and rural areas on mass is something our providers may simply not be ready for. If your internet service doesn't have fast download and upload speeds, then you don't have high speed harmony. You have. Americans on average pay about $70 a month for internet at home. But in rural areas, it could cost a lot more for a lot less service. So the pricing for a fixed wireless provider here can be something between $80 and $150 for about 25 megabits per second. However, gigabit service, which is a thousand megabits per second and symmetrical, is running it about $119 a month through $130 a month. That's John Paul. He co-owns Spiral Fiber, an internet service provider here in Nevada County, California. And for the past 10 years, he's been trying to bring an affordable fiber optic network to town. It all started when he applied to be part of the pilot program for Google's fiber service. Across the country, civic boosters have been going to extremes, chanting, singing, and marching, trying to get the search engine giant to look at their town. The internet these days is crucial to be in the world, to be a part of the world, and to be connected to your community. Google ultimately went with Kansas City, Missouri, which left Paul on a mission to get funding to lay out fiber optic networks for gigabit service. Over the next several years, he would attend conferences and pitch venture capitalists and apply for grants to make his vision come to life. One of the biggest roadblocks to building infrastructure for the internet here in the United States are the existing large providers. They have their landstaked out. They would prefer that nobody come in and compete against them. In 2013, we applied for a grant, we went down and met with the commissioners at the California Public Utilities Commission. It was an arduous process to get funded, but we finally did against all odds. We got a $16 million grant and then we went out to seek venture capital. Then in March of 2020, the pandemic hit the world. Everybody got locked down and everybody came home and everybody started using the internet. And I remember seeing on one of the local fixed wireless providers websites, they've said, hey, we know you're all staying home, but please don't use too much video and please don't use too much bandwidth. And I thought that doesn't work. The US connectivity gap is far greater compared to countries that are considered its peers economically. Some developing nations actually have better internet than rural America. Like in Kenya, which has a state-of-the-art fiber optic network fed in from their coastline. The American connectivity gap.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2507,2022-10-13 15:07:25
14282," Some developing nations actually have better internet than rural America, like in Kenya, which has a state-of-the-art fiber-optic network fed in from their coastline. The American connectivity gap does largely affect rural areas that are either outside of service coverage or simply prohibitively expensive. This is Rebecca. She and her family moved to Nevada County just a couple miles down the road from David. They took for granted that high-speed internet would just exist in the area and it's not something they even bothered to check on before buying their house. Turns out all they got was dial-up. We wanted to move where we had a little more space, room for the kids to run around, you know, just be out in the mountains a little bit more. Having come from a bigger city area where Wi-Fi is pretty readily available, we hadn't really considered that in our purchasing of the house, whether that would be an option or not. When school started and now that we are remote learning with our children and we're doing everything from home, we didn't have the option to do that at our house. So every day when school would start, we'd have to pack the kids up and we'd go to my in-law's home. They have a little cabin up in this area that does have Wi-Fi already. Rebecca's situation is the norm in rural America. According to data from the Federal Communications Commission, just 4% of urban Americans lack access to broadband internet. That's compared to almost 40% of people who live in rural areas. While that was the case, there were also racial and socioeconomic divides in terms of who had that access. In addition to that geographic difference, low-income African-American students, Latino students, and first-generation college students were more likely than others to have only one device at home that shared among multiple siblings and or lack access to that actual connection. For most American towns, there's also a lack of competition, forcing internet prices up. And large providers like AT&T and Comcast aren't incentivized to expand service to these rural communities. This is how affinity makes life simple, easy, awesome. So in our area, we have a small imprint of Comcast, but they're not going to go out to the more rural areas. It's just not cost effective for them to do it as a large company. In order to lay fiber cable, you're actually physically digging trenches into the ground. And for internet service providers, they're primarily focused on maximizing their profits. And so the fewer customers you have, you know, in any square mile and the more fiber you have to lay, that's just kind of harder to pencil out from a purely economic standpoint. AT&T released a statement on the matter, expressing the need and desire for government assistance to fund fiber optic expansion to areas deemed unprofitable. Comcast released a similar statement encouraging more public-private collaboration on this effort. Federal agencies do offer grants to help communities build broadband networks, but many have argued that there's not enough flexibility on how to use these funds. The COVID-19 relief package passed by Congress in March and signed by President Donald Trump awarded $43.3 million to 51 projects on the East Coast alone. But it also stipulated that these projects needed to be up and running by December 30th. For contractors who plan projects months and years in advance, it's a scramble to rearrange their schedules to meet that deadline. So what we've been asking the federal government to consider is at least as long as the projects are getting started, knowing the projects are being put into place to expand both remote learning, working from home and the opportunities like that that are truly driven from COVID. We're moving as fast as we can regardless, but hopefully they'll give us some more time. Talking to John Paul, it's clear that he believes broadband is something that can transform a community and should be considered a public good. One of the first communities to come on in the United States with full on gigabit service was Chattanooga, Tennessee. Now they're a bigger city, but they're a city that was economically in a downturn. On the last 15 years, the city of Chattanooga has turned around in an amazing way. It's a nexus for young people to move to. It's a place where technology happens. It's not just about logging on to Zoom, you know, to connect with your colleagues who might be in New York City.

There's just some really basic business functions and mechanics that I think people in big cities really take for granted and that are just going to be a much bigger challenge for small business owners and rural areas. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Historically, the marginalized people, you call them as untouchables or dhaliths, they have been kept away from the center of the knowledge. Once you are born into a caste, it is very difficult for you to grow beyond that. You are stuck in that identity. Education is the best way of liberating them. So that's how I chose to work in education sector. The kind of education that we are giving to the marginalized people is going to change, not just the fate of these communities in Telangana, but it is going to be the source of inspiration, the source of hope for all the marginalized in this country. The greatest flight in India is the system of caste. For generations of Indians, the social code known as the caste system has defined how people earn a living and whom they marry. Although outlawed seven decades ago, caste remain a significant factor in deciding everything, from family ties and cultural traditions to educational and economic opportunities. Dhaliths, people who are on the lowest rung of the caste system, constitute almost one fifth of India's population of 1.3 billion. Not able to afford the high tuition of private schools, many are forced to attend government funded institutions, which in the past have suffered from poor infrastructure, lower education standards and high student to teacher ratios. But Dr. Praveen Kumar is trying to change that. I am currently working as head of Telangana social welfare residential schools. So totally, above 400 schools I manage, these are all residential schools. For the students who are historically marginalized but talented, then poor. My friends also are. Up to 60% are girls and then 40% are boys. Because girls are more marginalized among them marginalized. Their voices are always suppressed. My approach to improve the conditions in the schools has been put your eyes and ears on the ground always. Stock to the parents, stock to the teachers, stock to the students, stay in the schools and then understand their problems, their challenges, both in classrooms and then the corridors and the dorms. Then go to the dining halls and see what kind of food they are eating and then go to their homes and then what kind of food they are eating.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2509,2022-10-13 15:16:06
14284," problems, they challenges both in classrooms and then the corridors and the dorms, then go to the dining halls and see what kind of food they are eating and then go to their homes and then what kind of food they are getting and what kind of challenges the parents have. One of the important changes that I brought in after I took over was to complete the transformation of mother tongue to English medium because English medium as I said English is the language of emancipation and language that connects you to the whole body of knowledge in the world. So, we had to train a lot of teachers. Research of the dictionary also, okay, I am trying to do new meetings. As far as I am concerned, I am not sure what to do. Hey, Ruchin, how are you? I seem to find time here and have a good view. I find it a little. Identity is extremely important. There is a scientific evidence to prove that your sense of identity is extremely crucial to your growth as a successful human being in your life. If you accept an identity which is very humiliating, which reminds you of very painful past, I think that identity will not help you to grow. Not that I am not saying that you should forget your past, I am not saying that but that should not be the bubble in which you must live always. Sweros is an alternative identity. S stands for state, W stands for welfare, Aero, SW and then Aero is Swero. So the idea is your dreams have to be skybound. So that is what we are trying to achieve by changing the identities. Like you know, you say I am a Swero and I aim to be a doctor. I am a Swero. I aim to be a top-notch engineer. I am a Swero. I aim to be a top bureaucrat of this country. I am a Swero. I want to be a very good actor or musician in this world. So these are the positive images that are associated with identity. Just to give an example to you. See in 2012, in our institution we used to produce about 6 doctors per year. But because of our, you know, this self-eliberating ideology of Sweroism, we have this year we have produced about 189 doctors. This is phenomenal for any poorest of the poor people. You know how difficult it is to get into a medical college in this country. So but today because of this ideology, the students have been able to achieve this. Pujita has been a form labourer and a parent's, the angels are agricultural labourers. And then this girl used to sell vegetables but thanks to the residential education institutions, she came to the Gowl-Edo-D campus and then she toiled very hard for one year despite many problems. And today I am so happy to share with you that you know, she has joined one of the prestigious medical colleges in the state of Telangana, Usmani Medical College. And then in future, you know, she hopes to be a gynecologist. So this is the journey our children are hoping for. Similarly, the Mount Everest Expression. Mount Everest Expression, we are very fortunate enough to place the youngest ever female in the history. On the peak of Mount Everest. How did this happen? It's all because of an ideology that helps you to liberate yourself. We have a lot of extra-curricular activities and most of them got institutionalized now. So for example, music. Similarly, the games, we have so many coaching academy, boxing academy, or Brazilian academy. We have a handball academy. So we have, you know, a cabadilla that traditional Indian sport.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2510,2022-10-13 15:20:21
14285," So many coaching academy, boxing academy, Brazilian academy, we have handball academy, so we have Kabadi, the traditional Indian sport. We have Gholf, we have introduced Gholf also, Gholf is generally played by so-called rich people, but today even poorest of the poor people are also being trained in Gholf in our schools. So our intention has been to give all 360 degrees, or type of opportunities to the students, so that we are interested in whatever activity they can go and then do it. Break the barriers, break the fence at least mentally, because the poor people have been programmed to be victims, programmed to be subjugated, programmed to be on the margins, always, programmed to feel inferior, we wanted to change all that. There are certain games which are exclusive to rich people, there are certain languages which are exclusive to middle class and upper middle class in this country, to put it in one word. The sole aim of introducing all these co-curricular activities is to break the stereotypes which are recklessly imposed on these people. The stereotypes Doctor Kumano is all too well. Born a Dalit, his grandparents were labourers and access to the village well was restricted. Doctor Kumano credits his parents' belief in the power of education, with helping him realise his aspirations. He went on to join the Indian Police Service, attended Harvard University, and then began pursuing educational reforms back home. I attribute whatever I am today to my mother primarily. They educated me in the village, although there were no good schools. So then I stayed in social welfare hostel, the hostels which are managed by government for the poorest of the poor kids. I passed with reasonably good grades, then I went to university and then I faced a worst form of discrimination. The university is like, in those days I am talking about, so the bathrooms and toilets were exclusively meant for social cause and social drive. I used to fight discrimination on one hand and then again, try to excel in academics day and day out. That's how I came to education, because I deeply believe that education is the only important weapon that can really place the poorest of the poor people from a very victimhood orbit to prosperous orbit. I think in future, this is going to be a game changer for the marginalizing this country. If you look at a thermal image of a city, and then compare that to a map of vegetation, you'll find that where there's greenery, the temperature is lower. That's because things like asphalt, concrete and shingled roofs absorb more heat from the sun than trees. This is the earth's most beautiful place. The sun is the most beautiful place in the world. The sun is the most beautiful place in the world. This is the urban heat island effect, and it accounts for higher temperatures in cities, often by several degrees compared with their surroundings. It's becoming a huge risk to human health as growing urban populations exacerbate the heating effects of climate change. Heat waves kill more people than any other extreme weather event.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2511,2022-10-13 15:24:47
14286," human health as growing urban populations exacerbate the heating effects of climate change. Heat waves kill more people than any other extreme weather event, more than tornadoes, hurricanes and even floods. That's why urban heat island mitigation strategies are being studied in Singapore by a group of researchers. The government back project called Cooling Singapore is now in the process of combining everything they've learnt to create a digital tool that can help cities all over the world, starting with Singapore. In Singapore, close to the equator, temperatures regularly rise above 32 degrees Celsius or 90 degrees Fahrenheit, and the city structures only make it worse. And that is also the case for Singapore, which is basically a concrete jungle, more urbanised, more developed city. And even in Singapore, what you have is a situation whereby there's a temperature difference of 7 degrees Celsius between the more urbanised and the more rural areas. The government has taken drastic steps to keep temperatures down. This is Gardens by the Bay, an award-winning park, and inside this greenhouse is a pleasant 24 degrees. That's because the dome, along with two dozen nearby towers full of thousands of people, is chilled by what's probably the world's largest underground district cooling system. It uses a large central plant that cools water and then pipes it into banks, residential towers, an exhibition centre, shopping malls and the city's iconic Marina Bay Sands Hotel and Casino Complex. So one of the biggest perks of using this system for the buildings is that they can save 40% in terms of electricity usage, compared to your traditional air conditioners. And with Singapore relying on natural gas for most of its power, this new system means emission savings equivalent to removing 10,000 cars from the city's roads. That has big implications for the rest of the world. If things stay as they are, more than a third of the world's electricity could end up being used to call buildings and vehicles by 2050. As the world gets hotter, gets warmer, there is a greater need for air conditioning and as well as refrigerators for instance. And the more people are buying these household appliances, the more energy usage they use and they release heat more and that then exacerbates climate change. It's a vicious circle and so since 2017, researchers at Cooling Singapore have been identifying design solutions that reduce our need for so much cool air in the first place. One thing many cities have in common and that's the importance of vegetation. That's a very important measure to mitigate the urban heat because of the shading effect of course and deep psychological effects of the vegetation. And also because of the possible evaporative cooling effect of the vegetation. Vegetation can be of course on the ground floor in form of trees and shrubs and you can walk under them. This is the so called canopy layer that the vegetation forms above us. But vegetation can also go up the facades of buildings and it can go to the roof of the buildings. Luckily Singapore has been striving for the garden city feel for quite some time. It was a vision initially introduced by them Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in 1967 to make life more pleasant for people. And today Singapore is one of the world's greenest cities in terms of urban vegetation. Camping Admiralty, a community centre that contains health facilities and social spaces now provides more green space than the plot of land it was originally built on. It's topped by a roof scape of staggered terraces covered in local plants which functions as a community park. And a village green in the centre that contains farm plots for residents to tend to. Park Royal on Pickering was designed as a hotel in a garden.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2512,2022-10-13 15:29:00
14287," And a village green in the centre that contains farm plots for residents to tend to. Park Royal on Pickering was designed as a hotel in a garden that doubled the green growing potential of its site. There's now 15,000 metres of sky gardens, reflecting pools, waterfalls, plantar terraces and green walls. And the government has big plans as well. Singapore actually has a plan to plan 1 million trees and add more green spaces over the next 10 years. It is actually a mix of one thing to reduce the urban hit island effect. But on the other hand, it's also to get the people to be more connected to nature. But it's not enough. The city state has still been warming twice as quickly as the world average over the past six decades. That's why Culin Singapore has developed a catalogue of other potential heat mitigation measures. When you try to mitigate your hit island effect in a city or in any building, in a village as well, the first place to start is by shading off the windows. You have to keep areas clear so that the wind can move through it. Water of a certain depth can act as a very good thermal buffer. If you have to construct heavy buildings such as high rises, at least you can make the surface the facade less heavy. And you can protect it from direct sun penetration. You have to make sure that no combustion engines will be in the city in the middle and the medium to long term range. So ideally the electricity production is outside of the city and you bring just the clean electricity into the city. You cannot at least minimize the use of energy in the city. And you can start to slowly convert the roofs, the facades of the city into production areas for renewable energy. In Singapore unfortunately this is a limited option but in the long run it could produce up to 20-25% of the energy of the electricity needed in Singapore. If all the roofs and the areas in the buildings on the buildings on the facades will be used to do that. With so many different ideas, cooling Singapore is also designing a virtual model of the city to test them out. It's called a digital urban climate twin or duct. That will calculate how each element of the city's design will impact the urban heat island effect. That means we model not only the geometry of the buildings digitally but also we model the transportation, the insulation, the temperature, the radiation coming from the sun, the weather, the local weather, the local climate, the even very, very micro climate of the city. The water, the movement of people in the city, we can invent scenarios, we can design scenarios, test them before we actually build them. And if they test very well and we are sure that they will function then we can start to build them and put them into reality. Singapore will be using this new tool to figure out which actions it should take next. And the model can be applied to any city, whether it needs to keep heat out or keep heat in, which will ultimately save energy, slow climate change and improve our quality of life. So this is something that Singapore will be able to export, maybe even together with its city development systems that it already has. Singapore is one of the very few cities in the world that really combine this scientific approach with a very well established urban redesign and design approach through its agencies and the combination of its agencies. It has achieved a lot in the past. If it keeps following the scientific path and the combination with the other knowledge in the city already, we think that it will be...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2513,2022-10-13 15:33:18

It's very tough, jobs are scarce, it's risky to be outside and around others. It seems like there's very few ways to make extra money during a pandemic. So I guess I'll just hunker down and binge social media until this all blows over. Wait, don't these people make money? How do these people make money? Streamers, YouTubers, Twitch stars, how do they make money? Is it a lot? Is it a lot of work? I know, I gotta ask somebody in the biz and I got just the guy, Austin John plays. This is your full time job now, right? As of November of last year, yes, this was always just kind of like a side thing. Like any money that I made from doing my videos and whatever else, I never touched that because I didn't really think of that as being like real money. And then it started coming in more and more and then it was like I hit my first day that I broke a grand and I was like, this is actually gonna be money. How did the YouTube channel come to be? When the game Pokemon Sun and Moon came out for the 3DS, there was like things that I learned about the game and then I wanted to just share that information with people. And at the time, I didn't have any way to capture screen or anything. So I found like generic footage and I kind of put it all together with so much editing. And that video got six views. And then two days later, I made another one. And that one got 12 views. And then I just started pumping out more and more content and people were like, this guy knows what he's talking about. It really just started building on top of itself. And then it was like, my channel really focuses on tips and tricks. So I play a straight 18 hours and I'll finish the game or get to about the 40 hour mark. And then I'll make my first video. While I'm going through, I have a giant no pad and just scribbles everywhere. And I make these notes of like the things that stumped me. So I know the things that may stump other people. What do you need to think about if you're building your YouTube channel? One, you need to do something that you're passionate about. Not that you like. Not that you think you're going to make money on something you're passionate about. This other thing is something that other people are passionate about. It holds a special place to them. And third is, it needs to be something that people are going to seek out information on. In order to enter into the marketplace, you either need to be better than everyone else. You either need to be faster than everyone else or you need to be more accessible than everyone else. And you can't be more accessible because it's already on the platform granted. If you understand how the algorithm works, which is very similar to Google Analytics, then yeah, you can have a little bit of a head start. But if you're not doing it faster and if you're not doing it better than everyone else, then why should in one watch your channel? So my income as a YouTuber kind of breaks down to three different ways. One, which is the bulk of it, which is ad revenue. Whenever you go and you watch a video and then there's an ad and then you wait five seconds and hit the bottom right corner. And then you...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2514,2022-10-13 15:37:42

Whenever you go and you watch a video and then there's an ad and then you wait five seconds and you hit the bottom right corner and then you go on to the next video or a non-skippable ad or the video starts immediately, you get the little banner ad at the bottom or if you scroll down from the video the first thing that shows there is an ad. Those are the four different types of ads that can appear on every single YouTube video and all of them pay a certain amount. It varies on lots of things like the country of the person who posted the country of the person who watches it the time of year where you are in the quarter if there's anything going on with a reduction in ad revenue like great example COVID-19 companies weren't as spending as much on advertising so because of that CPM went down. CPM stands for a click per thousand and using the Roman numeral for a thousand and that means that for every one thousand views you get a certain amount of money. Now on low ads when I first started off my CPM was 30 cents. So every thousand views I made 30 cents but then once I signed with an MCN and I started making more quality content and more engaging content some of my better videos and certain times of the year I can see CPMs as high as 12 to 14 dollars. And there's a big fluctuation between you know if I post a video when there's no ads being spent like January and February that's a reason a lot of your favorite YouTubers and also TV shows don't post new videos in that time of year because ad rates are down why are they going to make content then instead you're recording and you're bulking up for when ad revenue is higher. The second way that a YouTuber makes income is support, crowdfunding, things like that. When I first started off Patreon was really the only option but then they started rolling out supporters and members for YouTube channels so whenever I have a live stream you can click a button and then you could become a member and then you get a special icons next to your name I believe they're called badges or on any video you can hit the join button and that helps support the channel. And then the third aspect of that would be merch and for me my merch has been somewhat basic in fact I'm wearing one of my t-shirts from last year right now you have to endure the times that your first video gets six views that you posted on Reddit and they say shut up and then an auto mod bans you. You have to go through that because until you go through that and you discover why you're doing it you're not doing it for other people you're doing it for yourself. If you're not loving what you do then it's not worth it. Huh so make a channel about something that I'm passionate about. Oh sweet! I guess I can make the channel about that. Now how do I grow an audience? How do I get popular? It's all about diversification right you have to have a massive Twitter following you have to have a massive Instagram following you have to have a massive YouTube following of course you have to be on Twitch which is the key platform but basically anyway you can get in front of your audience you can engage with your audience and it is going to drive those clicks which ultimately drives the advertiser revenue that you get back from all of these platforms. It's me and Dan playing video games and talking in a funny manner over them. They're not just people who are good at games they're actually people who are good at online engagement online entertainment first and foremost. You have to write to remain stylish anything you wear can and will be used against you in the quarter fashion. The streamer is either very very talented at the game. The best player in the game is generally going to draw a crowd because people like watching people who are very good. On the other hand they're either very very good or funny. It cares mad at whatever it is on that side. Oh no.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2515,2022-10-13 15:42:07
14290," It's mad at whatever it is on that side. Oh no! You know, it becomes more of a show where they talk about other things outside of the gaming world and gaming becomes really just a backdrop and an excuse to engage with other audience. There were those weird like Ronald McDonald, like straight to VHS movies, remember those? I'm personable, I'm chatty, I would kind of, you know, when boring things were happening in the game, I would ramble on about, you know, movies I'd watched or books I'd read, and you know, or conversations I'd had and stuff like that. And so I think being personable was a big part of that. It's not just getting on and playing games, it's getting on and being an entertainer. You are putting on a show. Alright, now let me go ahead and grab the samurai sword that every gym has. Okay, he's dead. To have a larger audience and to have that audience, I think, stay with you, you have to bring something extra, you know. You have to find your niche, you have to find what works and what connects with the audience and what makes them laugh and what makes them keep coming back. Then you got to make it a little more exciting. Alright, throw in a hanging bishop, have everybody in suspense for a moment. I think the real most important thing is to just get used to being on camera. Like in any sort of performance thing is get used to talking on camera. You know, my first few videos were terrible, but because I sat down and did it for six to eight hours a day, I just got used to talking and I got over that uncomfortable hump. If you go into Twitch purely with the expectation that you're going to make money, make a job out of it, have all this growth and it's going to be great, you're probably going to burn out prior to getting to that point. Because there's very little payoff for a long time, right? Like multiple years generally before you really start to see a payoff. And so, you know, those first few times you're streaming, nobody is there. One person shows up every 30 minutes says hi, maybe, and leaves, right? Like it's very discouraging, I think, for a lot of people. And so you have to be there just loving it, you have to love talking to yourself when nobody is around, you have to love just the game that you're playing, all of that stuff. Because it takes a while and I think a majority of people burn out prior to getting to the like, profitable point of it. And there you have it. My very own YouTube, Twitch, Discord, and streaming channels all ready to go live. It's a veritable social media ecosystem just on the verge of thriving. So don't forget to smash like and subscribe and visit my Patreon for perks. Also, go to my merch page. And one last thing, stay cool, my friends. This is live stream shopping, one of the hottest trends in China. Every night, tens of millions of people watch live shows hosted by influencers like via and by the products they recommend. On e-commerce and social apps like Taobao and Do-In, the sister app of TikTok. It's not about only shopping, it's about the experience, it's about having fun. You gotta see 3D, you gotta see...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2516,2022-10-13 15:46:28
14291," Camen, do you come up with me? Not about only shopping. It's about the experience. It's about having fun. You got to see 3D, you got to see in some kind of action. It's almost like a theater act. The internet craze has taken over China. By the end of 2020, the country had almost 400 million livestream shopping users. China's livestream e-commerce market has also grown dramatically. With an estimated value of $161 billion in 2020. It's becoming popular outside China as well. So it's livestreaming the future of shopping. livestreaming is not a new thing. And China is started in 2015 with the rollout of 4G. And it was first used for entertainment and socializing. Many livestreamers perform for their followers or chat it to them. Making money by receiving virtual currency and gifts. In the west, livestreaming is mainly the domain of avid gamers. And China is broken into e-commerce. China actually has a very big e-commerce empire. So it uses these super apps, what we call that. You have payment, you have search-aff information, you have recommendation system, and you have huge amount of goods available on the platform. And as well as a lot of consumers. So with this advantage, they merge these features of livestreaming to make the influencers actually sell goods. Here is a perfect choice. Nice, neutral, beautiful print, nothing overwhelming, and the warmth and comfort of flannel. This is our new product. Traditional TV shop involves a one-way direction, whereby a host introduces a product, demonstrates, so the things and say, call this number or something. But the livestream shopping is live. That in itself is a very, very big difference. It causes different psychology and livestream shopping is a very entertaining way of engaging someone else. When you shop, actually, this livestreaming video will continue. It will minimize into a corner. And you can buy the items and pay all on the same app. After that, the livestreaming screen will just enlarge by itself and the promoter will come back to screen. So it's like very convenient. Taobao, one of China's biggest e-commerce platforms owned by tech giant Alibaba, added a livestreaming function in early 2016. In the following years, other e-commerce and social platforms like JD and Do-ing also integrated this feature. And now, when catching firepower, the Internet has been ans мнngikim m Cafe a lot. So of course with theseari shops, isn't the boot of the uncle status? I get what you just want do. Indeed, it's very convenient. So we kuntor customers don't need to pick up our audience. There are also a lot of crypto stocks, there are real estate stocks or forums or private bond Hardy-roleum publishments. There are a lot to discuss. As a side note, Taobao in the years from March 2021. Latest surveys show that over 60% of livestream users in China were watching shopping shows. And over 65% of them shopped at least once via livestream. In 2020, livestream shopping got a huge boost during the pandemic. With millions of people were in lockdown and many retailers were pushed online. People during the lockdown felt like there's a need for more social interactions. This live platform creates an interesting environment that these people dissents that are actually interacting with you. And then livestream shopping brings in a lot more variety of things that people could buy and satisfy. In the sense of a music control especially during the pandemic. At the heart of this craze are the top influencers who have tens of millions of followers and subproducts worth millions of dollars every night. They often use their stop power to get bargains from retailers which in turn boost their own sales and influence. So if you think about China's livestreaming you have to know the king and queen of the influences. The queen of livestreaming via she is actually having the biggest viewership.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2517,2022-10-13 15:51:23
14292," You have to know the king and queen of the influences. The queen of live streaming, Viya, she is actually having the biggest viewership and the biggest sales volume for a long time on top of her platform. She can sell everything from Gucci sunglasses, lipstick, homes and cars. One time she offered her followers to go on a Tesla ride with her and she even for once, so they rocky launch in her live streaming room for 40 million yuan. The king Vi Li Jiaqi, more widely known as lipstick spreader, he used to be a cosmetic sales before he turned into live streaming commers. And he knows a lot about the cosmetics. So he's the one that will actually put the lipstick on himself when he's on the show. Top live streamers like Viya and Li Jiaqi have become celebrities in China and earn millions of dollars a year. Although not everyone can be as popular, mid-ranking live streamers like Tiffany, still and a good income through sales commissions. The class is made up to 5-6 hours per day. I think wealth dreamers don't necessarily need clothes commercial ones. The mind is not covered. I think you've done something that you've done today. And it's not a matter of the fact that you're not able to understand the difference between the two. I don't know if I'm right or not. If you're not used to it, you're not satisfied. A lot of successful live streamers are generally very good at communication. They're very good at articulating very simply what a product does, what a product doesn't do. In order for them to sell, they need to be trustworthy and appear trustworthy. They need to show in some ways that they're authentic. For VIA and Li Chasi, they are able to articulate that quite a bit through the body language, through what they say. For example, Li Chasi will sometimes say bad things about certain products. To him, there's his honest opinion and sometimes people want to hear that. And so they seem very credible. They seem very trustworthy. Don't forget, they're also very entertaining and very interesting. If you're familiar with Li Chasi, you want a Guinness record for the most lipstick applications to models in a 30 seconds. Congratulations, you're welcome. So if you're able to create a lot of bass, we want to just think things that you do. People who may not want to buy lipsticks, but also streaming just to watch what he does. And then from there, you might get hooked to just an e-bann or a central manager or a Twitter comedy. Live streamers also use cell techniques such as limited time or supply. These sense of scarcity can often encourage viewers to buy. The platform in itself creates and enhances some of these things. But you see it live. Something we call social proof has taken over, meaning that, hey, other people are interested, other people are joining in. Other people want the same product. And they add it in the chat and ask questions. And they say, oh, I want this too. What happens then? It makes the whole product even more scarce. But it's not just influencers. Local farmers, luxury brands, even mutual funds have also started their own live stream shows. Working with very top tier live streamers can be risky. It's not necessary that the benefits will end up with a brand. So we see company executives opening their own shows. And we see like PNG have their own sales room which runs shows every day as well. We also have like local governments in like small towns to sell their own products. So the live stream is definitely transformed the way product owners can think about how to reach their consumers. And it enables a lot of players to actually sell. The live stream shopping is going global. Merchants in sales.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2518,2022-10-13 15:55:19
14293," how to reach their consumers and enables a lot of players to actually sell. Livestream shopping is going global. Merchants in Southeast Asia have embraced this trend. And in the West, Amazon has upgraded its live streaming function adding interactive features like chat rooms. Companies, including Google and Facebook, are also developing and investing in technologies to integrate video and e-commerce. In the past, the company started to understand how the development space and potential are going to be. Next, we will be developing a more and more unique way. It will become a more daily and more complex way to achieve it. If you look at the numbers alone, their numbers alone, the number of people, you know that they can sell and you know that they can generate revenue. Are they able to sustain it over a long period of time? It depends on how you know very they are at changing some of the things that they do. But you can't expect consumers one day turn into virtual shopping for good. There will be the nature of us that crave to go into the store to touch the goods and actually wear it and see how it looks like and walk around that with our friends. And those things wouldn't be replaceable with live streaming. You could imagine that the oceans are actually the largest battery. We store a huge amount of energy in the oceans. The wave of motion can be very deep. It can extend down several hundred meters. It gets to the near shore from about 50 meters. The whole water column is moving backwards and forwards. As we search for ways to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, some are looking to a largely untapped potential source of renewable energy. In theory, waves off the coast of the United States alone could generate over two trillion kilowatt hours of electricity a year, enough to power more than half of the country. Waves intensify and subside not just quickly as the wind and that means that it can produce a smoother power generation curve. One of the potential advantages of wave energy is that it could act as a complementary source of power compared to other renewables on the grid if it were to be scaled up to commercial scale. For decades, engineers have been trying to convert wave energy into electricity but a host of technological and financial challenges have complicated their efforts. In the years from around 2006 to 2015, there were a state of bankruptcies in the sector and this was largely because of a lack of kind of continuous proven projects out at sea with reliable electricity generation. Since then, companies have been trying to develop the technologies that are steady at pace and with a smaller cash burn. But the same questions remain. Can companies develop devices and technologies that actually work? Is wave energy just a novelty or something that can become a major renewable energy source? The sea is a very challenging environment within which to operate a power project so sea water is corrosive and conditions are very rough so this means that power projects.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2519,2022-10-13 15:59:24
14294," The sea is a very challenging environment within which to operate a power project, so sea water is corrosive and conditions are very rough, so this means that power projects don't have a very long lifetime and it increases operating and maintenance costs. Partly because of that many early wave energy projects hit rough waters such as the Pellarmus Wave Energy Converter in Portugal and the Isle Olympic project in Scotland, but that hasn't stopped others from trying. Companies are focused on testing projects out at sea, proving their durability, trying to raise capital and bring down cost. The sector hasn't really converged around one single technology design and companies are kind of undersized about which design works best. Finland-based AW Energy is a veteran in the sector. The first proof of concept of the company's device was made in the 90s after diver Rano Koei-Vasari observed the strong back and forth movement of a hatch cover in a shipwreck in the Baltic Sea. The waves are generated far from the coastline, so the wind blows on the surface of the water, causing the water particles to rotate and that rotation extends deep down below the surface and the waves can be very long, they can be several hundred meters long and as they come into the near shore this rotational energy turns into an elliptical energy and eventually backwards and forwards that you probably noticed if you've been swimming on the sea shore in large waves you're pulled in and out. That's the energy that we're extracting. There's a sweet spot where we deploy, so around 10 to 15 meters of water depth that's where there's still strong wave energy coming in. After years of research, prototyping and testing, the company is deployed Wave Roller, a 350 kilowatt device in the waters of Portugal. Wave Roller has an 18 meter wide and 10 meter high steel panel fixed to the seabed via a floatable foundation. The panel moves back and forth with the waves capturing the energy. It's submerged in the depth of 15 meters, so it's protected from the extreme waves. We generate electricity by capturing the movement with hydraulic circuitry in a machine room underneath the surface. That hydraulic energy we turn to electricity with hydraulic accumulators and hydraulic motors and also our generator. The Wave Roller has survived large waves at sea for over a year and delivered electricity via an underwater cable to the grid in Portugal. Meanwhile the company has won a 2.5 million euro grant to work on an upgraded version of the Wave Roller, aiming to increase the electricity generation capacity to 1 megawatt. The upscale device would have a bigger panel, two power takeoff units and improved software to control the energy production. We have taken into use very prediction algorithm that kind of tells us what kind of waves are coming into our device. That gives us few seconds to prepare for capturing more energy and the difference in that is significant. Our future plans are to deliver technology around the world. So I'm hoping we can be working on delivering technology to projects in Asia and also in American contents as well. Meanwhile Israeli company EcoWave Power is taking a different approach to capturing the power of the ocean. For the company's founder in a braverment developing new sources of renewable energy is a personal mission. I was born in Ukraine in 1996 and two weeks after I was born the Chernobyl nuclear reactor exploded causing the largest in history nuclear disaster. I was one of the babies that got hurt from the negative effect of such explosion. I had a respiratory arrest and a clinical death.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2520,2022-10-13 16:03:37
14295," The company has been operating a 100 kilowatt grid connected device in Gibraltar since 2016, which is enough to power 100 households. Currently, Inran had team working on another 100 kilowatt project at the Porta Jaffa in Tel Aviv. The project will be also the first time in the history of Israel that wave energy will officially connect to the electrical grid. And our goal going forward is to expand it to all suitable breakwaters in the city of Tel Aviv and to supply significant part of the city's electricity needs. Today, engineers and entrepreneurs are still trying to crack wave energy. Globally, only a few hundred kilowatts of wave energy are deployed, compared with gigawatts of offshore wind. But the filters come a long way in recent years, and with the right engineering solutions, this new power source could eventually become competitive with more mature renewables like solar and wind. I would have a lot more confidence in the success of wave energy companies today as opposed to like 20 years ago. But in the next few years or maybe the next couple of decades, it will be more likely to be used in remote locations like islands that are otherwise dependent on expensive diesel power, or out at sea on gas decommissioning rigs or for powering underwater autonomous vehicles. So definitely, wave energy can compete with other renewable energy sources, but I personally believe that this is not a competition. In order to have a 100% renewable energy friendly world, we need all renewable energy sources to work together. So, we need all renewable energy sources to work together. Can you please tell me? I'm not going to... please wait. I've covered a lot of companies, I've covered a lot of Machiavellian companies where people play rough. I don't think I've ever seen anything on the scale that Nissan has. One of the most dramatic elements was Rivendor Pazis home, being raided by court officials in Yokohama. You scared my life, you scared my children, I love these interesting things. So, Rivendor Pazis journey into the darkest recesses of the Japanese corporate world started when he was the general council, the highest corporate lawyer position in the company.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2521,2022-10-13 16:10:37
14296," The darkest recesses of the Japanese corporate world started when he was the general council, the highest corporate lawyer position in the company. In the past few minutes Nissan has revealed that its chairman has been arrested after allegations of serious misconduct. He was tasked with investigating Carlos Gaulle. And he was told conduct an internal investigation and get to the heart of the matter. And then along the way he started to notice serious conflicts of interest. He is one of the few people who knows an extreme amount of detail regarding the alleged crimes by Provost Skone. And he is now ready to tell his own story on the record about some of the events that happened. My name is Rivinda Passey. I am the former Global General Counsel of Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. And you could say yes I had a front row seat in terms of what was going on. When Carlos Gaulle saved Nissan years ago, he was depicted in Japanese comic books as this hero. And now maybe we'll see comic books where he's the villain. In corporate Japan Nissan was quite an unusual company. It was led for two decades by a non-Japanese executive. Well Carlos Gaulle was a hero in the Japanese business world. If you had a global business celebrity in Japan and worldwide, it was definitely Carlos Gaulle. In a country with few foreigners at the top, he stood out. But over the years he saved Nissan from bankruptcy, allied with Renault and Mitsubishi and turned the alliance into one of the most competitive in the world. Yet as the years went on, I think his ambitions changed a little bit. He started thinking about legacy plays. And one of them was to really tighten the alliance between Renault and Japan. And unbeknownst to him, there was a contingent of senior Nissan executives that were really felt threatened by that move. They really thought that they would lose complete control of the car company. And even in the government there was probably a little bit of anxiety about a national champion in the auto industry following under full blown foreign control. Carlos Gaulle was an auto industry leader respected by many in Japan. Now he's in jail. The arrest of Carlos Gaulle came completely out of the blue. This was in November of 2018. He was coming to Japan on Nissan's corporate jet for a regular executive meeting. And he was met on the tarmac by Japanese authorities who whisked him away to jail and charged him with financial misconduct crimes. So what happened was a power struggle ensued inside the company and somewhere along the way it was criminalized. By that I mean that there were allegations leveled at Carlos Gaulle about the way he reported his pay to Japanese authorities, the way he handled money inside the company, that in other contexts might have been a board action, might have been handled internally. A number of executives at Nissan decided to take this difference and take it over to the Tokyo Prosecutor's office. And that unleashed a chain of events that would shake the entire auto industry. So after Carlos Gaulle was arrested Nissan launched an internal investigation into the events that led up to his arrest. So Rob Passe was tasked with investigating Carlos Gaulle and he was told get to the heart of the matter. Find out what Carlos Stone did wrong and bring it to our shareholders. Yeah it's really complicated because you...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2522,2022-10-13 16:14:49
14297," to our shareholders. Yeah, it's really complicated because you had various things coming out of the weeds. 2018 investigation has started and we become aware of matters in terms of conflicts, actions by certain individuals that cause some concern because things might not quite be what they seem. So in our story, we really took a close look at Harinata and his role in Carlos Gones downfall. Harinata is one of the most fascinating figures inside Nissan. He's also a lawyer. He's originally Malaysian. Mr. Hardy. And he had a meteoric rise through the company and became very, very close to Carlos Gone and other top figures. He had a front row seat at all the major strategic deliberations at the company. And when he discovered that Carlos Gone as his final legacy play was going to tighten the relationship between Renault and Nissan, he made a decision to go against Carlos Gone. And he became one of the key figures that decided that Carlos Gone had to go. Harry Nader was somebody who actually recruited me into the company. So I have a longstanding relationship with him or did have a longstanding relationship with him. For many, many years, he was a mentor. I had doubts about the credibility of the process right at the start. Harry Nader had a plea deal with the Tokyo prosecutors. Now, that suggests he was intrinsically involved in some of the wrongdoing or the allegations of wrongdoing. It just didn't smell right, it just doesn't sit right. So there was a basic conflict of interest. In other words, Harry Nader had to deliver results to Japanese prosecutors to avoid his own criminal liability. And he's accusing and leading the investigation of Carlos Gone. Some of the people who had been involved in the original alleged crimes were also looking into the effect. They were not afraid of any of the crimes that were committed to the crime of the crime. And the reason for that is essentially his concern was for the company. If the company's own investigation into itself was compromised, that could lead to a very weak position in various lawsuits that it was dealing with across the world. Had discussions with Harry, discussions about the statutory auditors, about these conflicts, discussions with HR, about some of these conflicts. Because at that point, we reported into him. At the time, everything was quite, as you can imagine, we've got to do this, we've got to do that, we've got to move fast. But when you step back and look at some of these things, you just think, my god, what was going on here? Because me, members of my team, were being placed in immediate danger. Your chairman's been arrested. A representative director's been arrested. They both happened to be foreigners. And then now what we need to do, we're being instructed to do, is certain compliance professionals need to go into properties in Brazil, for example, and retrieve evidence. They've got to do it very carefully, because if they don't do it carefully, they're going to get convicted of criminal activities. And likewise, when a team of lawyers were commissioned to go to Lebanon, I mean one of my immediate concerns was, lawyers from Nissan being sent to go to Lebanon to retrieve evidence. These are just lawyers, they call for lawyers from Nissan.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2523,2022-10-13 16:19:21
14298," Lawyers from Nissan being sent to go to Lebanon to retrieve evidence. These are just lawyers, they're called lawyers from Nissan. You had revelations that a number of executives had benefited from share appreciation rights when they shouldn't have. I mean, you know, substantive amounts of money being taken by these guys when they weren't entitled to take them. And you do think, yes, how is this going to look later on? It's going to look quite concerning. So that triggered, for me, the sort of assessment that, well, I'm going to have to do something because up until this point, I haven't put down on paper these conflicts and these issues. So Rob Posse makes a fateful move. He writes this letter to the board, listing every suspicion he has in great detail, backed up by evidence, backed up by memos of why this internal investigation had serious problems. He sends a letter to the board and it's crickets. He doesn't hear much of anything. Nothing happened then, often. Nothing at all. Just like it just gone into a black box. And he began to suspect that there was a desire, even at the highest level within Nissan, to kind of sweep these conflicts of interest under the rug. Unfortunately for me, I think, you know, again, with hindsight, people must have thought that this is the nail that's sticking out and we can't have this. Within three days of me submitting that to the board of directors, that letter to the independent board of directors, I was removed from the go-and-executive conduct matters. I was then told that I could not attend board meetings anymore. And up until that point, I had attended every single board meeting. I was then also told that after eight years of being in Japan, I'd be going back to the UK. Eventually transpired that I'd be the VP of projects and transformation, managing a team of three. So you can imagine what this feels like at this stage. Almost an arbitrary removal from Japan where I've lived for eight years, had three children there. My family has grown up and we've been saddled there. Having a few months early been promoted to vice president at a global level to being almost demoted. So Pasi was essentially being reassigned to get him as far away from the internal investigation as possible and also to a certain extent in retaliation to some of the issues that he brought up regarding the internal investigation and Harinata. What happened to Rav Pasi can be seen as a series of corporate humiliations. I mean, first of all, his immediate responsibilities were taken away from him. Eventually he'd lost the coveted general council title. But it didn't stop there. Toward the end of his stay in Japan, Rav and his wife were convinced that they were being followed. During that period, I'd noticed that once driving my car, I'd have other cars following me. First on my notice this was a round mid-march and I was driving. I can't remember where I was going, but this grey van.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2524,2022-10-13 16:23:38
14299," First time I noticed this was around mid-March and I was driving, I can't remember where I was going, but this grave van, small van just literally started following me. And I noticed that there was somebody in the car taking pictures. And lo and behold we were absolutely being followed by either by people on foot or other individuals, two or three normally two burly men in a car, different cars at different times following us around. They were following the family as well and given we'd seen, right seen the Nissan Security Department behaving a very, very egregious manner with others in terms of following and surveilling. I was very concerned as to what they were doing and who they were giving this information to. Because if they're giving this information to the authorities, you do think, why? What's going on here? I mean this is just not normal behavior. And this all culminated in a rather dramatic event in the middle of 2020. Who are you people? Where Nissan had hired a legal team and had obtained an unusual court order from the District Court in Yokohama. To basically do a search end of his home and seizure of his corporate laptop and phone and other documents. If you don't let us in now, we have to break this key. So it's a pretty extreme way to treat someone who had spent 16 years at the company. These people have all come in. We don't really know who they are apart from the fact that I've been shown a badge that says the Yokohama Court. And they hit to recover a laptop and a mobile phone. It was even more weird because I'd highlighted to the directors that certain Nissan executives were trying to recover this laptop and this phone whilst I was still in Japan. And I was very concerned because it had evidence on there that related to misconduct matters and other forms of inappropriate conduct. It was just another form of intimidation, another form of harassment, forcing me almost to leave the company and the country. Because once they'd retained and obtained these items, we were still followed. Which again, I just couldn't understand what is the point of doing that. This is not a car company, this is not the KGB. I think it's fair to say that Rob Posse didn't have full battlefield awareness of all the intrigue going on at Nissan. I mean, Harry Nata is interesting because he's both charismatic and charming and one of the most brutal corporate infighters one could ever run across. It's a confidential company email, right? You should not have this. If he had fallen into line, he would probably still have his job at Nissan, be paid very well, and continue to his work. The career that he spent 16 years building at Nissan is irretrievably broken. It's been smashed to smithereens. He and his family paid a huge price certainly, but in terms of being able to sleep at night, I think he's come out ahead. I highlight issues to the highest levels of the company, so that they could be dealt with appropriately by those in charge. There was no response to those, and there was retaliation against me. What's really profound, like absolutely profound, is that none of your colleagues, I mean people who you have known for years, forget it. You're on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2525,2022-10-13 16:27:54
14300," out is that none of your colleagues, I mean people who you have known for years, forget it, you're on your own. And yeah, you've got to be ready for that. You've got to be ready for that. If you take it on anyway. This is the awful truth. There's always someone in the family that's pushing it. This lady does not deserve to be taken advantage of. Expressionally, at your age with your own grandchild. My grandma is having to sue them. I'm testifying against them. Nobody's talking. They're one floor below right now. It's sad that it had to devolve to this. It's like a soap opera to me. It's a very sad thing. It's a family feud. Here's a family that on paper you would think has the wealth that so many people seek yet. At the end of the day, it's seen to rip everybody apart. My name's Tom Schoenberg. I'm a senior reporter here at Bloomberg News. Cover financial enforcement. I was approached by someone close to the Shottenstein family and asked whether or not I would be interested in writing about Beverly Shottenstein in this case that she had against JP Morgan. It was immediately clear that there was a great story here to be told. I started just assembling all sorts of documents that the family made available to me. It included a diary that Beverly had begun writing when she started having suspicions about what was actually going on with her money. Beverly obtained her wealth from the Shottenstein retail empire that has, at times, included big lots, value city, American Eagle Outfitters, DSW shoes. Beverly's husband died and at which point they sold off their portion of the company, bringing them an enormous amount of wealth in around 1990. Estimates of her wealth were around $90 million. She, for many years, had that pool of money being managed by outside advisors. Her grandsons in the late 2000s had both graduated and were...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2526,2022-10-13 16:32:15
14301," She for many years had that pool of money being managed by outside advisors. Her grandsons in the late 2000s had both graduated and were becoming financial advisors. She gave them a little bit to work with and over time, her grandson Evan became the trustee of her entire state. Managing sort of family money is not a conflict. In fact, some ways in wealth management, it's kind of how you get your start. It's kind of the seed that you need to sort of get going in the business. But, Beverly started having suspicions that something was wrong probably in around 2016. Well, there were suspicious things, but taken separately without everyone talking about their own experiences, it was hard to really put it together. She had written a check to her caretaker Dawn that bounced. So she went down to her local chase branch to sort of find out what was going on. She wasn't getting paper statements in the mail, so she asked them to print out a number of her statements having to do with her checking account and her credit card account. So we went to the bank and asked for the statements. And she got a whole year and going through all of them, page by page by page. And it was there, she saw all sorts of charges that she said she did not theorize or didn't know about. I was becoming very, very suspicious. I would start to look in the money part, and that's what bothered me more when I saw that money was going. And I was not a big spender. Around the same time Dawn, she starts noticing Beverly's son, who lived in the condominium below her, came up with Evan, with a shredder, and started grabbing papers in her office area, including some with JP Morgan Letterhead, and just started sitting at the kitchen table, just shredding documents over and over. Yeah, they came in one morning, used to do it the back, through the back door, and they brought this shredder inside, and then they went in the drawers in the office and took out all the papers, and they started to do it. I was very suspicious because I know you don't go around and get in destroying papers. Beverly said that they had done this many times before. That's when she said to me, you know, Dawn, I'm going to write my feelings in this black book. Diary. And it's a diary, and she started writing. Each day, she would write a little at a time. Around the holidays of 2018, the package had arrived, a FedEx package, and in it were materials about her venture capital fund, based out of the Cayman Islands, Dawn, and some other family members take a look at this, and they see that Beverly is signed up for this fund to the tune of $5 million over the course of several years. And that was really the beginning of it. That was sort of the tip of the iceberg when it became obvious that something was going on that my grandmother really wasn't aware of this fund. You know, Beverly started to panic. She was got really upset and called, you know, JP Morgan's headquarters in New York and asked for Jamie Diamond. She said she was told someone would call her back, but she says that that never happened. She wrote a letter to Evan and Avi, and in there, she laid out a number of things that were concerning her on authorized trading, the checking account, she had about a million dollars worth of jewelry in a safe deposit box, and that her son Bobby had the key to that box, and that jewelry had gone missing. All this was kind of packaged in this, you know, five-page handwritten, a memento will and trust. They're such an evolving narrative about why the jewelry was taken, the only truth we really know is that the jewelry is gone. But why it happened, there have been a lot of different stories. You just don't take your mother's wonderful things and hand it out. And they email that note to JP Morgan to seize all activity on her account. And it ended up setting off a firestorm after that. As soon as they got the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2527,2022-10-13 16:36:53
14302," to JP Morgan to seize all activity on her account. And it ended up setting off a fire storm after that. As soon as they got this email that there was a season to assist and that she wanted to send her money and change brokerage firms, they were actually vacationing one floor below downstairs. They're there right now. The next day, Beverly's in her place. The granddaughter's still in her place visiting. Dawn is there and up comes Bob, kind of barging through the door. And he's screaming about what was sent to the JP Morgan. They're now investigating now. And he's furious, takes his mother and sort of puts her into a chair, gets pen and paper. And she says physically forced her to write a retraction letter. They were pushing me around. It was a scary time. I was really afraid too. I had to take her to the doctor and she did an x-ray because she was in so much pain. The locks had to be changed. The phone number had to be changed. I really thought we were going to have to hire guards to be outside just for protection. Oh, it was terrible. Horrible scene. Beverly brought her case before the financial industry regulatory authorities, usually known as Finra. It took several months' hearings. She sees all sorts of transactions that's going on. Hundreds of them that she claims that she never knew about, never authorized. But yet we're logged to JP Morgan's files as having been direct requests from her. That included the sale of a large amount of Apple stock worth several million dollars as well as all her stock and big lots. Over the course of their time with JP Morgan, Evan and Avi were making all sorts of trading on her account that was generating millions of dollars in commissions for themselves in the bank. Yet she was not getting any of the type of gains that you would expect sort of an 80 million dollar account in a bullish market to be able to get. They issued a ruling entirely in her favor, finding that her grandsons as well as JP Morgan, they were liable for violating their fiduciary duty, misrepresenting themselves. And they also found that the bank and her grandson, Evan, reliable for elder abuse. Evan and Avi, they were fired from JP Morgan. They issued an award of about 19 million dollars. I reached out for comment and JP Morgan emphasized that Evan and Avi were no longer with the firm and that their actions do not represent the sort of values of the bank. I reached out to Evan and Avi, heard back from their lawyer saying that they disagree with the law and the facts that Finra kind of used to decide the case against them and are seeing if they can have it withdrawn. Her son Bobby wrote her a letter. Said his sons weren't criminals and he also admits to taking her jewelry. And he says he needed it to pay off some bad business debts he had. They never once came up to say I'm sorry. If there had been an apology and some acceptance and asking for forgiveness from my grandmother, I don't think we'd be in the position that we are now. Since the piece came out, we've received dozens of messages from people, many of whom are telling their own sort of personal tales of you know kind of financial advisors gone bad or family members who got control of an estate and abused you know those within. Seems that it's really resonated with a lot of people. Like keep you know hearing a lot of feedback about Beverly and how you know a lot of people feel she did the right thing. You're never too old to stand up for yourself and try to write an injustice. She was adamant that she wanted to stand up for herself. At the end of the day they did wrong. It's a painful life lesson. You know Beverly taught them that you don't mess with grandma.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2528,2022-10-13 16:40:57
14303," On April 20th, oil markets did something they never had before and they crashed, went into negative territory and closed the day at minus forty dollars. Meanwhile in a place called Thaden Bois in Essex, a group of nine traders led by a guy called Cuddles made $660 million over the course of a couple of hours. The price of oil has collapsed to a record low. We've never really seen anything like it. WTI this morning down more than 35%. People maybe wouldn't have been so surprised if the oil price had fallen to zero, but the oil price went to minus thirty eight. It went far lower than anyone expected and so lots of people in the market were saying, well hang on, something else is going on here. A couple of months later I started to get wind through a kind of network of sources that a tiny firm in the outskirts of London had made a huge amount of money that day and potentially had some parts to play in what happened. The information we got was that nine traders at Vega Capital London had made in the region of $660 million in one day. As a group I think they made as much money in one day as Apple makes from its international sales in one day. I mean it's an insane sum of money. Did they pull off a fantastic trade? Did they predict the way the market was moving and get it absolutely right? Or was there something else going on and had they actually done something that breached market rules in a bid to push the market and that investigation is ongoing? So Paul Cummins is a trader who cut his teeth in the pits in the 80s and 90s when everyone had a nickname his was Cuddles. If you can imagine that was a very sort of cut throat type of world where people are doing you know hundreds of thousands and millions of dollar trades by shouting at each other giving hand signals and then scrolling on scraps of paper. The culture of the trading pits in London was very influenced by the working class guys who became traders there. They weren't like the city bankers that had gone before them. They weren't usually Oxford or Cambridge. You know they didn't wear saddle rose suits. They were ordinary working guys who happened to have a talent for trading and a lot of them came from Essex. I think it was 400 traders in the pits and Cuddles in his you know oil and gas pit was described to us as amongst the top three amongst you know in amongst that was very successful and made you know very large amounts of money as a young man. But you know inevitably mechanization and the arrival of electronic markets was the kind of death knell for the pits and in 2005 the IPE closed down. And when the pits shut down a lot of the traders who worked there lost their jobs or quit or went to work for financial institutions but Paul Commons decided to start his own trading collective out in Essex. Some of them are ex-pick guys cut from the same cloth as him. Lots of them are actually sort of in their 20s and they're he's you know drinking buddies sun or they're he's own kids friends from football. You know they're young lads hungry and ambitious and he brings them into the fold and fairly shortly he's got you know maybe a dozen or so traders that they're independent let's be clear but they're all part of this collective.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2529,2022-10-13 16:45:22
14304," Collective. Yeah, I'll let Liam do with Essex. I am from Essex, so I feel like I'm free to get into it. Sweet, as they say. If you were to ask someone in Britain how they would imagine a Essex person, they would see someone who's maybe slightly flamboyant with a cockney accent, like Guy Richie Starlachsen. You know, not afraid to splash the cash, but it's probably pretty bright and it's done well for themselves. Don't even make sense, does it? But you know, these guys, they drove around very nice rolls, roises and bent leaves. They went to places like Marbaea on holiday. Faden Boyce is a very wealthy place. You have to have considerable income to be able to afford to live in that village. It's a really nice place to live, and it's 20 minutes to Cheob ride away from the city. Earlier in the summer, we have this lead, which is that there's this tiny firm called Vega Capital London, and they were the biggest winners from the biggest oil crash in history. You know, anyone that covers markets, it's going to be surprised about that. You know, you're thinking, you're BP's of the world, you're Glencores, but there's this tiny firm. And one of the big challenges that we had was actually finding out who worked with Vega Capital. It wasn't immediately obvious, and at first we had absolutely no idea. If you go to the Vega Capital website, it says it's under construction. If you do basic online searching, it's very difficult to find anyone who's publicly connected to the company. So inevitably, we're incredibly curious at this point. Like, who the hell are these people? The more reporting we did, the more it became clear that this group were connected socially as well as professionally. They went to weddings together, they played golf together, they would go and holiday together. We found out that a number of them were members of the West Ham supporters club in London. A few of them started companies together, so you could see all the connections between them and start to see a distinct group emerging. And it really just was this kind of shock that, you know, this wasn't just like a hedge fund or a firm you'd never heard of. This was actually a group of buddies who all had the same experience on this day, and it had all made a huge amount of money. So if you're an oil trader, there's a number of different ways you can trade, and probably the most popular is WTI futures contract. And it's basically a contract that says, I'm going to buy a thousand barrels of oil from you at this point in the future, or I'm going to sell a thousand barrels of oil to you at this point in the future. It's actually just a financial contract to gamble on to predict where the oil is going to go up or down. On the 20th of April in Essex, there have been signals for a while that this was going to be an exceptional day in oil markets. And we know that some of them arose early and started their trading in the early hours of the morning while it was still dark outside. Essentially what they were doing is buying contracts that gave them an obligation to buy oil at whatever the price ended up at 2.30pm. So they're basically placing a bet that oil was going to fall throughout the day. But they're simultaneously selling lots of oil as well. And whether they make a profit and how much profit they make is the difference between what they buy the oil for and what they sell the oil for. Now of course, we now know throughout April 20th the price dropped and dropped. So this is going very well for them. They are committed to selling oil at these prices and the prices are continuing to fall, which means they're going to be able to offset it and buy oil at cheaper at the end of the day. Now once it gets to kind of 1.30pm, that's when things start to get really interesting. Suddenly there's a kind of influx of buyers and sellers. You know, as desperation increases in the market and trading volumes go up. Now at 2.08pm exactly something bizarre and unprecedented happened, which is the oil passes into negative territory. And it fell to a record level of minus $38. We've never seen anything like a period in terms of the contraction of the global economy. That huge gulf between what they were buying the oil for and what they were selling it for enabled them to make more money than they ever thought possible. So their profit was the difference between minus 37 and all of these positive numbers on every contract they sold. The price...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2530,2022-10-13 16:50:00
14305," than they ever thought possible. So their profit was the difference between minus 37 and all of these positive numbers on every contract they sold. The price of crude briefly hit minus $37 a barrel. For one group of traders operating from a small office it was a very very profitable day. It's important to remember this this had never happened before in the history of oil trading. No one could have predicted it. I can't think of another example of where you enter a trade or you get paid on both sides. You get paid both to sell and to buy. You know it's unthinkable. One thing we know about the cuddles trading arcade is that they were very comfortable taking large risks and you know you have to be clear this was a large risk. Yeah we spoke to oil traders, both people that know these guys and people that don't and they all say that this is you know incredibly risky. And that's actually what stops a lot of oil traders doing trading like this. They simply aren't willing to stomach the risk but cuddles and his friends were. So when the kind of final calculations came down the group of the nine most profitable traders made $660 million or thereabouts between them. I mean if you can imagine I think three or four of the made in excess of a hundred million each. One of the astonishing things about this trade is that two of the individuals who made more than a hundred million dollars in a single day were in their 20s. One of them was 22 years old. You know in a few years earlier he'd been posting on his social media about doing teenage stuff with his mates in town and going to see girls and rap music. And here he is a few years later making a one hundred million dollars in a single day's trading. When me and Liam discovered that we were just we couldn't believe it we couldn't believe what we were seeing. All trading is a zero sum game. Anytime you're making money as an oil trade or someone else is losing it. Amongst the biggest losers were the investors in this Chinese fund, crude oil treasure fund. There were thousands of them and they lost everything. Lots of people have put their savings into oil funds. They lost money that day. Big banks and brokers who sort of stand in the middle of trading parties, they lost money that day. And another interesting thing is the oil producing countries like Q8 or Canada, they sell oil as an average of the WTI closing price over the preceding month. So the fact that one of those numbers in that average was minus 37 meant if you can imagine countries like Saudi Arabia and Q8 potentially lost a couple of dollars on every single barrel of oil they sold that month. Vega capital traders made such an extraordinary sum of money that it was inevitable there would be some scrutiny of what they did. But it wasn't just the sums of money they made. In the vital half an hour before the settlement price was set, they were by far the biggest sellers of oil futures in the market, which is an incredible thing to think about. When you consider that the other participants in that oil market are going to be the world's biggest banks, you know oil majors BP and Shell and here you have a group of nine guys in Essex who are having this significant influence over a global market for oil. I mean I think you have to assume that if these guys have made seven million or ten million dollars, they probably would be celebrating in Essex right now. But the fact that they made closer to 700 million has meant that they are facing understandable scrutiny. We wrote individually to all the Vega traders who did exceptionally well that day and we got a letter in response from a law firm representing the group. The law firm was at pains to point out number one that they haven't been accused of any wrongdoing, that they all traded independently and separately and they basically all made up their own mind that this was what was going to happen in oil markets based on publicly available knowledge and decided to execute this trade. What I love about these stories is there's a real variance of opinion and some people will look at what happened and think that must be dodgy. They all traded at the end of the day, they all made a huge amount of money while all these people lost. That's shocking but lots of people say these guys are acute disadvantage. They're in a market that's inhabited by you know huge technology driven phones and firms and oil giants that have got all the advantages in the world and when you get a bunch of Essex geeseers who are...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2531,2022-10-13 16:54:16
14306," Technology-driven, funds and firms and oil giants that have got all the advantages in the world and when you get a bunch of Essex geasers who essentially beat the market and find a way to make a huge amount of money they should get a pat on the back really because that's the dream. Since this happened a lot of the guys have stopped trading the monthly settlements that they've done so well out in the past, several of them have set up new companies. They've essentially gone very quiet. You know, the kind of social media presence they had is kind of closed down. By all accounts there, you know, waiting this out. It's certainly too early to try and predict how the regulatory investigations are going to pan out. You know, we just don't know. There's a number of potential outcomes for these guys. There are potential punishments if there are any findings of manipulation against Vega or anyone affiliated with it, might be you could be fine, you could be banned from trading and you know, in most extreme cases there have even been criminal prosecutions in the past of people who have been found to have been manipulating the settlement and misconduct related to trade settlement. There are other outcomes too. You know, one obvious one is going to be they're able to walk away from this life-changing trade with all the money that they made and celebrated as heroes in the trading community and they'll go down as legends. It's very important given that the nature of the climate crisis right now for the general public to have an understanding of what progress is or is not actually happening. And I think many readers right now they'll see these hundreds and hundreds of companies making these big bold climate claims. And they would be forgiven to think that, you know, we're well on our way to meeting the emission reduction trajectory. We need to be on and the reality of the matter is we're just not on that trajectory and a key reason for this sort of disconnect is the use of offsets that aren't doing what they claim to be doing. We have a massive potential for sort of willful blindness. We can convince ourselves of things regardless of what the facts are. And so that's what tends to happen in these cases. It's not that anybody is setting out to commit climate fraud. They sort of walk themselves into a situation and they convince themselves of one thing and that allows them to convince themselves of another thing. But at the end of the day, they're doing something that makes no sense at all. My name is Ben Elgin. I wrote the story about how the billion dollar market for carbon offsets is setting back the fight against climate change. So one of the challenges in reporting on carbon offsets and trying to figure out what's going on is really finding good experts who have been steeped in this marketplace and are willing to candidly talk about it. One of the best people for this is a fellow named Mark Trexler. And I've been talking to him for more than a decade. My name is Mark Trexler. I've worked in climate change for the last 30 years. I was actually hired by the World Resources Institute in Washington to work on the first carbon offset project in 1988. In terms of defining a carbon offset, one of the beauties of greenhouse gases, sort of the silver lining of greenhouse gases, when you put up a molecule of CO2 into the atmosphere, it can be anywhere in the planet in seven days.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2532,2022-10-13 16:58:25
14307," as is sort of the silver lining of greenhouse gases, you can, when you put up a molecule of CO2 into the atmosphere, it can be anywhere in the planet in seven days. And therefore, if there's an option to reduce emissions on the other side of the planet, and you can do that very cheaply as compared to doing it in your factory, for example, then why not pay that person, that factory on the other side of the planet to reduce their emissions, then you are in a sense offsetting your emissions, and the atmosphere doesn't really see your emissions anymore. So carbon offsets have been around for quite some time, and they were actually key with these international climate agreements, such as the Kyoto Protocol, which mandated the wealthiest countries reduced their greenhouse gas emissions. The treaty was signed on the 11th of December 1997. Decided. The business community, in general, saw carbon offsets as a huge opportunity to comply with whatever policies and measures might be coming down the pike on climate change, much more cost-effective. We've seen a huge surge in companies making big proclamations about how they're going carbon neutral or zeroing out all of their carbon emissions. We're going to reduce our carbon footprint to net zero. Unilever is committing to net zero emissions. We can achieve a net zero emissions world. We began looking at these corporate claims of dramatically reduced emissions, and we noticed so many of these companies were using carbon offsets to achieve these aims, and as we began to look at the carbon offset projects themselves, what we found is that the environmental benefits claimed by these companies are not actually what they seem to be. And as we sort of saw and spotted a number of these very aggressive carbon offset projects, which appeared to be generating inflated credits or bogus credits, we saw a number of them were associated with the Nature Conservancy. This surprised us. The Nature Conservancy is the world's biggest environmental group. They have about a billion dollars a year in revenues, and they've been around for seven decades. They've preserved about 125 million acres of land. And they've done so many good works over the years, and they've been very strong in terms of working with corporate partners. The Nature Conservancy has taken a different approach, a very pragmatic and pro-business approach. They will not go out and criticize a big polluter, but they're very happy to work with them. Some might say that, well, that's selling out, but others would say, and those at the Nature Conservancy would say, these companies have deep pockets. They can help fund important preservation work, and we have absolutely no problem working with them on this stuff. So companies are very warm, and they've partnered with the Nature Conservancy for many years. And yeah, it definitely lends a sheen of credibility to these projects. Here at 20 NERI, this is the biggest Disney world this year. One, two, three, four. If you look at, for instance, Disney. It's a sprawling company with theme parks and cruise lines that burn up diesel fuel. They have office buildings and television studios that consume electricity. So these companies are trying to make major, major reductions in their carbon footprints, but it's very difficult to change these fundamental ways their businesses operate. So Disney has been a big buyer of carbon offsets that are orchestrated by the Nature Conservancy. One of the projects that they buy from is called Pennsylvania Riges. And that's a plot of land. Most of the land is actually about a three-hour drive outside of Philadelphia. Interestingly, this land, 3,000 of these acres, was actually acquired by the Nature Conservancy in the late 1990s. This land was imminently threatened. There was a pending logging contract on this land. So that...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2533,2022-10-13 17:02:59
14308," by the Nature Conservancy in the late 1990s. This land was imminently threatened. There was a pending logging contract on this land. So they do what they have done so well for all of these years, which is they go out. They raise money from local philanthropists, and they go buy this land to protect it from developers and loggers. And at the time, according to an archive version of the Nature Conservancy's website, when they were proudly announcing this deal, they said these threats have been abated because of this acquisition by the Nature Conservancy. So it's really interesting now, fast forward two decades to earlier this year when they put forward this carbon project. And if you look through it, this land is a key part of that carbon project. And what they're now saying is this land is now, once again, imminently threatened. 72% of the trees are going to be cut within five years. Now this is just astounding because this land is owned by the Nature Conservancy. They do not clear-cut land that they've bought through philanthropic donations. So this scenario that they've put forward to get carbon revenues is not really plausible. And what that means is when you have Disney coming in and buying these credits, when it eventually lowers its carbon footprint because of these credits, well, that won't be a credible or truthful claim by Disney. So this is an organization that truly understands the threat of the issue of climate change and is wanting to do its part to address this. However, in this situation, it just appears they're their drive, which they've had for decades, to increase the amount of revenues that it can use for land preservation work. Nature Conservancy and many others see that carbon credits as a part of money that they can tap into to further their own benevolent aims. But unfortunately, what this has resulted in is claims of climate progress that just aren't really happening. So the Nature Conservancy defends vigorously these deals. And they and others will say, look, our projects are just following the rules that these registries set up. So somewhat also put some of the blame on the registries themselves because they're setting up the rules which allow these vapid projects to get up and sold. So we've reached out to all of the companies we mentioned in this story, including Disney, they didn't want to be interviewed for this story. But they all told us that, look, we have to rely on the experts out there and those experts, they say, are these carbon registries that have been set up. Most of these nature Conservancy deals are set up and sold on this exchange, it's called the American Carbon Registry. Now it's the oldest of these registries that allow voluntary carbon credits to be sold. They've been around since 1996. What these offset registries do is they set up rules and any carbon offset project has to follow those rules. But there's this tension that's always there. If the rules are too strict, then it's going to be very hard for carbon offset projects to get up and running. So there's this balance going on where the registries want rules that attract projects. But they don't want it to be so strict where it will disincentivize projects from getting listed. One of the challenges with designing carbon offset systems is that there are normally two people at the table. You have buyers and you have sellers. And to some extent, you have policymakers. But the buyers and the sellers are really the ones with the expertise, with the incentive to really participate hard, make a lot of things happen. And the challenge there is is that both of them sort of want the same thing. Or they're both happy with the same thing. They're happy with low cost offsets and a lot of them. Because that works for their business model. You end up, though, with nobody really representing the atmosphere, so to speak. Nobody's really representing the climate in those discussions. And so the policies end up.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2534,2022-10-13 17:07:13
14309," really representing the atmosphere, so to speak. Nobody's really representing the climate in those discussions. And so the policies end up biasing the whole system and you end up in sort of a race to the bottom. And that's what we've seen happen. When it comes specifically to the topic of carbon offsets, I am a fan of carbon offsets in the sense that they can help mitigate climate change. They absolutely can. But if we're not going to do it correctly in a way that actually does help mitigate climate change, then it's nothing but a distraction. And after 30 years, you have to start wondering, is it really just a distraction? And that's really unfortunate, but that's where we are. Ultimately, what needs to be, what needs to happen is systemic change. We're sort of nibbling around the edges with some of these different things. We need to change how we produce energy. We need to change how we transport ourselves. We need to change what and how we eat. You know, we need systemic change associated with transitioning to a low carbon economy. A lot of what we're doing today is not promoting systemic change. It's sort of trying to stick your thumb in the dike to preserve the current system. And at the end of the day, that can't really work. downtown zel actively that natomiast The Hyperloop. There's a good chance you've heard the name by now. This is the Hyperloop system. You can take people hundreds of miles in minutes. The Hyperloop is a series of tubes that would transport people in pods at ultra high speeds over long distances. This is a remarkable new form of transportation that can whisk people from city to city in a flash. 29 minutes from New York to DC, 30 minutes from LA to San Francisco. For years we've been seeing these futuristic utopian renderings of some cross between a spaceship and a monorail. But lately, the Hyperloop is becoming much more real. It was surreal to be sitting inside a Hyperloop and just even more incredible to actually be riding down a track in something that was nothing more than a crazy idea six years before. Companies all around the world have been developing and testing the technology needed to propel passengers at speeds of over 1000 kilometers per hour. But for many, speed is only the first step to unlocking the full transformational effects of a new mode of transportation. Fast is what we just sort of take for granted in the Hyperloop world. It's the network effects that really deliver the benefit. That opens up a completely different scale of economic opportunity. We've got planes, trains, automobiles and boats. We're getting around to this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2535,2022-10-13 17:11:32
14310," Trains, automobiles and boats, we're getting around Earth. But what if there was a fifth mode? And I have a name for it, name for it, which is called the Hyperloop. The Hyperloop? Hyperloop, yeah. In 2013, while riding high on the growing success of Tesla and SpaceX, entrepreneur Elon Musk released a white paper outlining the basic framework of the technology he called Hyperloop. The basic idea goes a little something like this. A tube reduces the air pressure to a near vacuum like environment. A Hyperloop pod is then suspended in the tube, usually by magnetic levitation. The whole pod can then be propelled forward. Because there's no traditional friction sources like air resistance or rolling friction that would push back against the pod, the Hyperloop is able to move at incredibly high speeds and do so fairly efficiently. Despite its futuristic name, however, the general concept behind Hyperloop is actually pretty old. In fact, New York City's first attempt at an underground public transit system in the 1870s was based on a similar principle. The pneumatic transit system was short-lived, however, only stretching one block and topping out at a rather leisurely 10 miles per hour. While Elon would make some 21st century improvements to this concept and bestow a very 21st century name, he wouldn't end up pursuing the technology itself. Instead, electing to focus his efforts on something a little bit deeper, literally digging the requisite tunnels by a his boring company. It would take another billionaire industrialist who dabbles in spaceflight. No, wait, not that one. Yeah, that's the one. After Richard Branson would make a large investment in the company Hyperloop 1, it would be renamed to Virgin Hyperloop. What we've always been trying to do as a company is show that this technology could work, that it could be made safe, and that ultimately it's something that's happening in the next couple of years, not the next 20 years. Josh Geigel is the co-founder and CEO of Virgin Hyperloop. In a familiar tech startup story, he's seen the project go from a garage to a large-scale testing facility outside of Las Vegas. So we started building the first kind of Hyperloop system in 2016. We've done a lot of work, about a 500 tests that we've done in that over the last five years. And what we realize that we need to do is take that technology, show that it can be commercial, so drive the cost down, improve the efficiency, improve the performance. But the key thing is, you know, is actually making it approachable and safe for individuals. In order to do that, Josh, along with Virgin's head of passenger experience, Sara Luchia, bravely volunteer to take the inaugural ride. What her and I were realizing is like, we're the first two people sitting in a Hyperloop. The only type of people that have gone through this environment are in spaces, and there we are in just like normal clothes, because of the system, the safety of what we designed. Three, two, one, launch. And then once we started going, you felt a bit of acceleration. We accelerated a little bit harder than we would in commercial, be like a sports car. Yeah, we got it to about 108 miles an hour on that test. And it's a short run. It's about 500 yards or so, and came to a stop. The test lasting only about 20 seconds and covering only a quarter of a mile at just over 100 miles per hour. It is a long way away from a true functioning Hyperloop. But as for optics, it's a crucial step for the future of funding. The number one question we got from investors or from project proponents, or just people in general, was like, is a Hyperloop safe? And what better way to show something is safe than by actually getting people on it? But convincing investors and governments that would likely be fronting some of the construction costs for an unproven technology is no easy task. First and foremost is the question of safety. Most people don't know how an airplane works, but yet they get on an airplane. They get on an airplane because it's faster than driving. And most importantly, they've probably gotten off of one before. They've seen someone get off of one before. And so what we set out to do was actually show that Hyperloop could be safe. With two normal people, not astronauts, not adrenaline junkies or test pilots or anything like that, two normal people getting on a Hyperloop. And then most importantly, those two people getting off. But beyond safety concerns, constructing Hyperlopes will undoubtedly be...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2536,2022-10-13 17:16:07
14311," These are test pilots or anything like that. Two normal people getting on a hyperloop, and then most importantly, those two people getting off. But beyond safety concerns, constructing hyperlips will undoubtedly require a significant capital investment to the estimated tune of around $60 million US dollars per kilometer of track. So a track from San Francisco to Los Angeles, for example, is likely to come with a price tag over $10 billion. And before large governments are willing to come in in front of those costs, investors who are funding hyperloop development must accept it as a long-term mixture of technology and infrastructure investing. Investors that are used to short returns because you're developing apps or something to that effect. Those aren't the investors that really get excited about hyperloop. What you start to see is the people that are looking at platform technologies. So this idea that because this smartphone existed, Uber could exist. So who are the Vanderbilts of this century? And that's the part where you're going to get a lot more knows than yeses. But those people that have the ability, that the fortitude to stick it out to see the game-changing platform here, those are the people that we're looking for. And since we've done that passenger test, there has been a lot of interest that's really, oh, this is a lot sooner than I thought. {\an5B》// Invisiting the ripple effects of what Hyperloop could achieve, though, is fairly challenging at this stage of development. It's fast, yes, but for point-to-point travel, traditional maglev trains can move pretty fast as well. In outside of China, South Korea and Japan, even those haven't seen much adoption elsewhere due to the high costs and questionable profitability. The Shanghai line in China, for example, loses around $100 million every year. Hyperloop companies, however, believe they can offer something different than traditional railway lines. My name's Alan James, and as far as I know, I'm the only guy on the planet who's written the government-level business case for 300 kmh conventional high-speed rail, 500 kmh maglev and 1000 kmh Hyperloop. It's fundamentally about moving people from where they are, to where they want to go, when they want to make those journeys, and doing it in much smaller numbers. So pod designs for Hyperloop range from 12 to 28 seats, typically. Why are they small? It's because small enables the network to operate flexibly. A great example of that is the East-West strategic route across the north of England, from Liverpool to Manchester to Leeds. So to get from Liverpool via Manchester to Leeds by train is just short of two hours today, which will probably take you two hours driving as well in average traffic conditions. That result is those three city regions remain three separate entities. Liverpool Manchester Leeds, there's very little commuting traffic between those urban areas. Hyperloop absolutely changes that from the ground up. Liverpool to Manchester is a five or six minute journey, Manchester to Leeds is also a five or six minute journey. What effectively does is create a single super city economy. In this vision, the Hyperloop acts a little more like a highway, where pods have fixed destinations and don't need to stop along the way. Meaning you can travel on a Hyperloop network from, say, Liverpool to Leeds, while the pod behind you travels from Liverpool to Manchester, and if that metro Hyperloop network is connected to other networks from the same location, you could travel from Liverpool to Paris or Liverpool to Amsterdam, all without making a single stop. For passengers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2537,2022-10-13 17:20:40
14312," As the work is connected to other networks from the same location, you could travel from Liverpool to Paris or Liverpool to Amsterdam, all without making a single stop. For passengers, for business, for leisure, that is utterly transformational. For high-value freight and logistics, it's equally transformational. But critically, if you do a hyperlute network at scale, you begin to deliver massively significant carbon savings to it. A multi-regional hyperlute network could become a replacement for both short-haul passenger and cargo flights and traditional ground transportation, both of which are significant cargo producers. One hyperlute connected distribution hub, perhaps at an airport that is predominantly used for international air freight, replacing maybe 10, 12, 15 distributed road hubs. It takes a lot of polluting and inefficient truck haulage off the roads. That itself means roads gain extra capacity. Hyperloups will still need to use electricity to both move pods and maintain the near vacuum environment and the tube. Proponents of the technology believe that this could be done by using renewable sources, including a combination of solar panels and battery technology that could be used along the hyperlute itself. But even with all multipliers of time and carbon emission savings that a hyperlute network may provide, the investment capital required to actually build such a network becomes even more economically and politically daunting. Committing doesn't mean spending billions on day one. Committing means how do we phase it? One company in the Netherlands is working to develop that technology, and perhaps more importantly, the international coalition needed to make the hyperloup network a reality. So we are here in Europe's first full-scale hyperlute test facility, where we can already prove every conceptual technology of the hyperloup. This is Tim Houter, a co-founder and CEO of Heart Hyperloup, headquartered in the city of Delft. And while this testing tube might not seem as large as others, inside is a key technology to create the on and off-ramp type infrastructure of a hyperloup network. That is, a lane switch. That's something we can already test here. You can actually see it here. The track is diverging from one track into two. It makes it possible to eventually split up the hyperloup track into two sections. And in that sense, you can create a complete hyperloup network. But in the end, we'll make it possible to travel for example over a whole continent. I think Europe, for example, with the same ease as you can out travel with a metro in the city. The nice thing about this magnetic levitation system that we have developed is that there's absolutely zero moving components in the track. So for example, if you have to do a lane switch, all you do is that the tube basically splits up. And statically, the track also split up. And whenever the vehicle enters a switch, it either pulls itself to the right with its magnets, or it pulls itself to the left with its magnets. Lane switching on traditional rail requires the physical movement of the rail. Even modern magnetic levitation tracks use lane switching techniques in order to transfer trains from one track to another. And this is a very crucial element, because this is the thing that limits the capacity and in the end, the usefulness of the real network. Because the moment that a track is switching, that means that at that moment you are creating an unsafe environment for the trains behind it. So you need a lot of space between trains. Then a hyperloup because you have no moving components in the track, all the vehicles can be much closer to each other. You can achieve a very high frequency, and basically have vehicles moving and merging in and out of the network very much like a highway. For now though, Hart's physical testing has been limited by the size of their tube. Because the test track is only 30 meters long, they haven't tested...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2538,2022-10-13 17:24:42
14313," For now though, Hart's physical testing has been limited by the size of their tube. Because the test track is only 30 meters long, they haven't tested this lane switch at speeds greater than 20 kilometers per hour. However, the company is working to build a new test site where it plans to increase that testing speed to 300 kilometers per hour. We're now in a phase where we have proven most of the most important technologies in the test facilities that we already have. And we have also demonstrated the viability and the feasibility of a network. If you look at all the top systems that it consists of, most of those are proven systems. We already demonstrated in lab conditions, so we don't really believe that the technology itself is going to be the biggest challenge. Because for all Hyperloop companies out there, actually building a Hyperloop system requires more than just a good product. We're talking about the safety aspects. We're talking about integration into the environment. We're talking about social aspects. Do people feel comfortable traveling in such a system? So it's about all these different aspects. And the complexity is really getting all the different stakeholders that are relevant and that they need to contribute to bring this to market to get them all following the same roadmap. In order to help build this coalition of private and public interest in Hyperloop development, we are working with all the Hyperloop developers together in setting up the first structure of the system. The idea being that as companies around Europe create the first commercial Hyperloop tracks between individual cities, one day those can all be connected to a larger network. Everyone that believes that Hyperloop is a future transport system also realizes that there is a need to have this network because that's where Hyperloop thrives. Hyperloop is such a huge project. It's definitely not something that you can do in your own or as a single company. So you need to do it with a lot of other companies, you need to have the governments. I think in that sense the biggest challenge is to really get all the required parties together to take the steps in development and in commercial implementation. Hart's next plan is to build the European Hyperloop Center, an open testing facility which will include a 2.6 kilometer test track. And the company hopes to test travel speeds there at up to 700 kilometers per hour. Virgin Hyperloop is also racing to construct the first commercial Hyperloop route, with projects in various states of development in India, Saudi Arabia and the United States. Recently the company announced plans to build a Hyperloop certification center in West Virginia, which will include a 6 mile long test track. Proving the technology here will be crucial, if Hyperloop networks can find a home among infrastructure investments that the Biden administration hopes to make. The idea that there's multiple Hyperloop companies, I think is a redeeming aspect in the business. People really want to see something happen, so having multiple people move forward is good for that. I was struck when...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2539,2022-10-13 17:28:43
14314," really want to see something happen, so having multiple people move forward is good for that. I was struck when Josh and Sarah rode the pod. Two or three of the major outlets used the phrase, we now have a new mode of transport. And although all of that technology had existed before those two human beings rode it, it was the moment at which those two human beings traveled that short distance down the tube that in popular imagination Hyperloop became a mode of transport. The metaphor I use with my team is that the Wright Brothers refers but none of us fly on Wright Brothers Airlines anymore. If you don't continue to innovate, you're not going to be around and so we'll continue to be at the forefront of building Hyperloop. Back in 2013, Elon had an idea. I think the difference now in 2021 is some brilliant engineers have spent real time grinding out the details and I thoroughly expect the next three to five years to be decisive. This week, how hydrogen can transform our energy usage. We'll look at why the universe's most abundant element could be a game changer in the climate revolution. Hydrogen technologies are not new, they are used in other sectors, we use them in space on our rockets and we don't need the laws of physics to change to be able to use hydrogen on our planes. From iron ore to green hydrogen, one of Australia's richest men tells us about his pivot to sustainable energy. Plus the hydrogen revolution. We'll speak with the CEO of Italian Utilities firm Snam about his new book and how green hydrogen could be competitive within five years. Cossacks are coming down and people are waking up to the fact that it's the only way to decarbonize certain sectors. From Bloomberg's Global headquarters in New York, I'm Kaylee Lines and this is Bloomberg Green.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2540,2022-10-13 17:33:06
14315," For Nurse in New York, I'm Kayley Lines, and this is Bluebird Green. It's a new year, so here at Bluebird Green we're highlighting new solutions in the fight against climate change. And one of those is as old as the universe itself. Hydrogen. It's the simplest element around, but could well be a game changer when it comes to turning around our dependence on fossil fuels. Today, hydrogen is used in the chemicals industry to produce petroleum products. It's also starting to be used in steel production and industry under a lot of pressure to decarbonize. But it has far more uses as well, from power and cars to heating our homes. And Bluebird New Energy Finances is a seismic shift in the sector in the next 10 years, as green hydrogen squeezes out dirtier alternatives. No-called grey hydrogen dominates today. But as renewable electricity gets cheaper and more accessible, so will green hydrogen. In this week's edition of Bluebird Green, we'll explore what this push into hydrogen means for tackling climate change. We'll hear from Australian billionaire Twiggy Forest about his pivot from Iron War 2 Hydrogen, and we'll also speak with the CEO of Italian utility company Snam about his book, The Hydrogen Revolution. But first, what are we using Hydrogen for? And why does it actually matter? Interestingly, Edwards explains. Hydrogen, the most plentiful element in the universe. On Earth, we find it mostly bonded to oxygen in the form of water, or in other gases known as hydrocarbons. Hydrogen gas, H2, burns hot and clean, making it an attractive tool in the race to net zero. But isolating hydrogen from other elements is no easy task. Today, the cheapest way to do this is via chemical processes that break up natural gas. This releases a lot of carbon dioxide. Another method is to use electricity to split water molecules in a process called electrolysis. Although there is no carbon byproduct, a lot of electricity is needed. And if this power comes from burning coal or gas, it negates to zero emissions goals of using hydrogen to begin with. Hydrogen produced in this way, powered by fossil fuels, is called gray hydrogen. If carbon capture its storage is used together with fossil fuels, then it becomes blue hydrogen. If nuclear power is used, it's called pink. And finally, green hydrogen is what is produced via electrolysis and powered from renewable sources. This method is considered emissions-free. It's predicted that by the early 2030s, H2 made from renewables will be cheaper than that made from fossil fuels. But that hinges on the cost of electrolysis declining, which will be achieved through larger projects and an expansion of manufacturing. To be clear, vast amounts of H2 are already used today. Global production in 2018 totalled 117 million metric tons. This hydrogen is mostly used for its chemical properties, not as a source of energy, and very little of it is clean. Some sectors like steel could start using hydrogen for these chemical properties, replacing coal. Industries like cement and glass may also use hydrogen as a source of heat. Another advantage is its energy storage potential. It can be stored over long periods of time, and used when more power needs to be added to the grid. It also could hold an advantage over batteries and heavy transport and shipping. The promise of hydrogen for energy has been around since at least 1874, when Jules Verne wrote about it in his book, The Mysterious Island. But the future of hydrogen will depend on policy. Countries with net zero targets, carbon pricing, and hydrogen strategies with investment mechanisms are likely to see the highest H2 demand. That was Bloomberg's Christine Lee Edwards explaining what hydrogen means for the energy transition. But how are businesses approaching the sector? Well one of Australia's richest men is making a big play into hydrogen. Andrew Forrest, better known as Twiggy, made his portion from iron ore, being the chairman, former CEO and major shareholder in Fordouski metals, one of the world's biggest miners. But after having made over $10 billion in...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2541,2022-10-13 17:37:33
14316," He had his portion from Iron War, being the chairman, former CEO and major shareholder in Fortescue Metals, one of the world's biggest miners. But after having made over $10 billion in profit from the metal in the last fiscal year, Twiggy wants to transform Fortescue into a clean energy company. He's been scouring the planet in search of investment opportunities in hydrogen and renewables. The firm plans to allocate up to 10% of its annual profits for green energy investments and is exploring projects across the globe from Indonesia to Argentina. Prancing Laqua caught up with Twiggy Forest. There's only one type of clean hydrogen. All the rest is dirty. That is green. If you just say, green hydrogen is clean, the rest is dirty, then you've actually nailed it. And, you know, anyone else who produces any other hydrogen, any other agri, just look in there and say, why is global warming accelerating if anything you're saying is true? Then there's no actually, it's greenwashing. Yeah, but there's a lot of greenwashing because I keep on being told it's a transition. We can't just, you know, make the transition at a click of a finger. So what are we doing wrong? What can we do better? I don't remember the personal computer having to transition the typewriter. I really don't remember that. I don't remember the smartphone having to transition the pocket calculator and the old landline. You know, transition line is complete rubbish that lie got put to it. Two days ago when JCB, a really loved British company, every right for the country to be proud of JCB and Portsky, holding a bit of a similar reputation, fantastic track record of it, and super welcome. Portsky, huge balance sheet, super strong. When those two companies got together and agreed, a 79 billion USD agreement, per atom. Then that's a real wake up call to say, hang on, Greenhagen is obviously commercial now. You know, every other form of possible fuel, possible fuel, Hagen, you know, it can compete with it on price. It can probably lose on price, but what we know, it is cooking the planet. And only Greenhagen zero methane, zero carbon in the supply chain. Don't worry about the molecules in the supply chain. But at the moment, we're not even phasing up coal. If you look at the G20 company case, so we have a long way to go to talk about only using greenhagen. Yeah, so look, I have a call, which I'd like to make now, that the world should not fund any more coal-fired power stations, coal-fired mining projects ever. We should wind them down as quickly as possible because they are cooking the planet just like grey and bluehagen, it's cooking the planet blue. We are heightened to not make renewable electricity releasing 10 to 16 times more carbon, let mine the methane, which is worse than it is hydrogen. So we've just got to stop doing things which are self-harming under the guise of green energy. So why are leaders so slow, even if you look at the appetite for e-states investments, they're growing exponentially, so are emissions, so where are we allocating capital? OK, so take the recent G20. There's probably a reason why there was a strong action coming out of the G20, because people were not aware that major transactions between large companies were taking place now on greenhagen, that actually this pollution-free, all the way to the supply chain fuel, which now have been transacted at multi-billion dollar scale, that none that I don't believe any sovereign leader or any energy minister or climate change minister could not take altru seriously, that greenhagen is never here to stay, it's broken through, the history has been made, it will never go back. OK, what is the one thing that you would tell leaders today and business leaders? How do we transition faster than what we are now, because we're at real risk of missing our targets? So that's really simple, do you stop funding, do you stop subsidising, do you stop using money into possibly, could be carbon sequestration, it could be fuel rebates could be anything, hundreds of billions of dollars getting ashed while we ashed the planet on fossil fuel subsidies, because we haven't had that renewable energy, we haven't had that greenhagen, it's kind of been pushed down, it's down, it's also excuses, I'd never be commercial.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2542,2022-10-13 17:42:03
14317," because we haven't had that maneuver because we haven't had that green option. It's kind of been pushed down, pushed down, it's also some excuses, are never be commercial, they're never be supplied in the quantities we needed. I'm glad I've lied. Now we know it. Let's take action. It's practical. It's implementable. Let's do it now. Okay, if we do it now, is there going to be a shock to the energy system? Is there going to be a shock actually to economically? And is it worth, not talking about transition, just going from A to B? Yeah, it's a fantastic person. A to B is the solution. Let possible fuels do what possible fuels do. Just burn their coal, burn their oil, burn their gas, at least they're pumping up carbon and methane into the atmosphere, honestly. Well, not that honest, because they don't mention methane, which is 90 times worse than carbon. But at least the carbon has been done honestly. Encourage the green hydrogen sector to come in really fast. Okay, it's there. There's, there's, there's renewable power all over the world. We now know how to make electrolyzes much cheaper. Like 25% of the original cost. We know how to do that now. We don't have an excuse to get into it. Does it need to be cheaper than oil and fossil fuel for it to be viable worldwide? Well, right now it is. Okay, so let's just swallow that bit of financial data. Right now it is cheaper. And it's getting more cheap. It's, it's the own fuel you know. It's just a carning and value. You don't have enough of it. Right, to power the world. Ah yes, that, that's only because we haven't had policies to support. We had policies to support it five, ten years ago. It would be everywhere. You'd see the global warming budget start to come down. Now, we've got five or ten years to make a huge difference. And it policy leaders all over the world to appreciate now, okay. Big business is transacting with green hydrogen in multi-billion dollar agreements. We now know it's here at its here state that's spread everywhere. Coming up on the program, the hydrogen revolution. We'll speak with the CEO of Italian Utility firm, Snam, about his new book.

14318," Music From Bloomberg's World Headquarters in New York, I'm Kayley Lines and this is Bloomberg Green. What will the world look like in 2050? Will global temperatures have stabilized, electric vehicles be abundant and solar and wind power homes around the world? According to Marco Alvera, the CEO of Italian Energy Company Snam, that vision of the future could be your reality. And he says that hydrogen will pay its way. As he tells it in his new book, The Hydrogen Revolution, Alvera's moment of reckoning came in November 2018 when he tasked the Snam scenarios team with studying how Europe could reduce its CO2 emissions to zero by 2050. Looking through the results of the study, Alvera said he was struck by how much hydrogen was in Europe's energy mix by that year. Beyond the abundance of hydrogen, the Snam model also predicted that it would be the cheapest form of decarbonized energy for many sectors, and that it could be cheaper than today's prices for oil, coal and nuclear power. Our Maria today is spoke with Alvera at COP26. It's happening all very fast. We see the cost of hydrogen coming down a lot. Hydrogen will play a big role in the energy mix. I don't know if it's going to be 15 or 25% of a fully decarbonized energy system, but it's going to be big. Coss are coming down and people are waking up to the fact that it's the only way to decarbonize certain sectors, so-called hard to abate sectors. And you say it's the only way in the cost are coming down. Where do you see prices moving? Because a lot of the reticence of times has to do with the pricing. That some argue is still not the cheapest option out of the market. So when I was first working in hydrogen in 2004, it was costing $1,000 per megawatt hour, $2,000,000, $600, today, $100,000, and we see it going down to $50,000, $5,000, and to going down to $25 per megawatt hour in the next 10 years or so. Which is a quarter of what is today. That's really because renewable energy, and we're talking green hydrogen here, renewable energy costs are falling. But the cost of making the electrolyzer, which is the kit that you use to convert solar or wind energy and water into hydrogen, the cost of this kit is falling a lot, because it doesn't really exist on an industrial scale. So as we build up capacity, we industrialize it, we standardize it, and we squeeze costs out. That's really the cost trajectory. And for that, of course, you need demand, however, for governments and also institutions to kind of buy into this idea that it is a future we want to invest in creating infrastructure. What are they telling you? When you speak to governments, when you speak to officials, are they keen on this? They're very keen. So the Department of Energy shares our view in the states of getting to below $1,000, which is $25, a megawatt hour. The European Union has a hydrogen strategy, which is very clear, and several member states have the same. Chile wants to export a lot of hydrogen. China's big on hydrogen. Australia's very big on hydrogen. Japan is blending already hydrogen. So I would say the world is now really focused on this, because it's the only way to store energy for a long period of time economically, to convert it into either a liquid or a gas. And of course, you talk about the price, but the other big component is the volume. How big can you go? Where do you see that on a time scale? So wherever it's sunny or windy, you can produce very cheap hydrogen eventually. And so compared to oil and gas, which are concentrated in a few parts of the world, it's going to be very democratic from that point of view. So every sunny place, every desert, every ocean wind can be turned into hydrogen that we can put on ships in pipes and really start trading it around the world. So it's going to happen a lot faster than a lot of people think. So, and will you say a lot faster? What is that in time? As they said, $50, which is essentially oil parity within five years, and then depending on how quickly we ramp it up after that, we could get to $25, which is coal parity before the end of the decade. And in big scale. In big scale, because once you get to coal parity, that's the only way we're going to get China and India to stop burning new coal. We have businesses in China and in India, and I see a lot of hydrogen development, a lot of renewable development in both countries. The Indian announcement was incredibly strong on 2030. Some people were upset about the 2017 at zero deadline, but when it comes to 30, he announced the big, big commitment to get the 50% renewables. Where is the price? Buy it. I was surprised that they would make it so explicit, and even the net zero is a big thing for them. And so I think it will happen faster than...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2544,2022-10-13 17:50:45
14319," It's announced the big, big commitment to get the 50% renewables. Where is the price? I was surprised that they would make it so explicit. And even the net zero is a big thing for them. And so I think it will happen faster than 2070 because of the falling cost of renewable and hydrogen. India's burning 80 gigawatt of oil of diesel to keep the lights on. So there's an immediate opportunity there and we're very interested in working that country. And with regards to China, perhaps the fact that we haven't really seen them active, I guess the diplomats are working on this, but we haven't really seen the leadership. It's going to be technology, it's going to be industry, I think. China has committed to a net zero, which is very important. At the G20, China was clearly behind the one and a half degrees. So I think a lot has been achieved between the G20 and COP. And I think what's really important is to see in the coming years, how quick it's in our hands to make part of this happen in five years or could otherwise happen in 15, 20 years. It's about building the project. The capital is there. We saw how many trillions of dollars are already committed. This missing is really the projects and that's where companies like us step in. Marco Alvera, CEO of SNAM there speaking with our Maria today. Let's turn now to the aviation industry. It's a big contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions and it's under pressure to change that. In October, the International Air Transport Association, a trade body representing airlines, approved a target of achieving net zero emissions by 2050. To achieve that, many airlines in the US and Europe are looking to buy sustainable aviation fuel made from renewable sources like used vegetable oil. Initiatives like these are pushing plane makers to come up with some radical new aircraft that will eventually cater to our growing appetite for travel without hurting the environment. We took a look at how Airbus, the world's number two aircraft manufacturer, is stepping up to the challenge. How long until we can fly emission free? Airbus says it's more confident by the day, it can be done by its 2035 target. Airbus, a CEO, spoke about its ambitions for hydrogen-powered planes at the company's summit in France. The physics works. Hydrogen technologies are not new. They are used in other sectors. We use them in space on our rockets and we don't need the laws of physics to change to be able to use hydrogen on our planes. So every day we become more confident. But we think we need to have a plane. We need to have the right fuel, the hydrogen available in the right quantity at the right place at the right time and we need the regulations to be ready. So we really need the work and the collaboration of many people on the globe to make it happen on time. But it could be a long way to until green passenger jets go mainstream. Larger aircraft with more than 150 seats are not expected to feature globally until about 2050. That means manufacturers and airlines today are under growing pressure to ramp up short-term innovations to cut their carbon. In a long term, meeting the ambitious plans for so-called green hydrogen means building a giant industry almost from scratch. To make that happen, British airline EasyJet is among those saying governments need to get involved and fast. Aviation's emissions over the last three decades leading up to the pandemic grew by about 80% to over 1 gigaton, and that's projected to double by 2050. According to Bloomberg, any F, about half of the airlines with the largest global market share have set net zero targets by that same date nearly three decades away. Coming up from Blue Sky projects to the bottom line, we'll speak with our Bloomberg AnyF expert Meredith Annex and dig into their models about how hydrogen fits into the future energy mix. Voice. 6. Thanks提castsğ apartments in a short time. I'm Rebecca Mychop and this is Steve Shawn. Two sizes. Gotcha.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2545,2022-10-13 17:55:11
14320," Music collects.... From Bloomberg's World Headquarters in New York, I'm Kaley Lines, and this is Bloomberg Green. Now let's bring in Meredith Annex, our Bloomberg N.E.F. Hydrogen Specialist to talk more about how hydrogen could change the energy landscape. So Meredith, what place do you think hydrogen is likely to have in the future energy mix globally? Hydrogen is this incredible solution for us as we look to decarbonize because it's a perfect solution in areas that are hard to electrify. So we're really like to think about hydrogen playing a role. It's in things like heavy industry, especially where you need a feedstock as well as energy source. And in things like dispatchable power, long call transport, maybe even shipping and aviation. That sounds great that it can be used for such diverse industries. At the end of the day, though, how much is this going to cost? Well, that's the amazing thing about hydrogen because depending on how you make it, it can actually see significant cost of clients in the future. So when we're talking about clean hydrogen, we usually mean green hydrogen produced for renewable electricity. And in that case, your hydrogen is almost as cheap as the renewables that are used to make it. So if you're in a place with really good renewable resources, you'll be able to have cheaper hydrogen. But even in places with less good resources, we think that hydrogen can be cheaper than a dollar per kilogram, which is the price of unabated hydrogen today. And around $8 per million BTUs for those who prefer to think in energy units. And that can be achieved anywhere in the world by 2050, we believe. All right, so let's talk about kind of the pros and cons list. I don't know where cost fits into that. But what are the advantages to hydrogen over other renewables and then what are the drawbacks? Yeah, main advantage is the fact that hydrogen can serve roles that electron struggle with. And that's things like seasonal storage, for instance, or just anything where you need storeability, where your electrons are harder to store, hydrogen is going to be easier. That also leads to a downside though, because hydrogen is less energy dense than the usual things that we use for storeable energy today like coal or oil or natural gas. So you will need more volume of storage to handle the same amount of energy. Let's talk about the viability as well and how it may differ in different geographies. What is your view on that? Yeah, so for green hydrogen again from renewable electricity really places with the best renewable resources, things like Latin America or the Middle East, even southern Europe have really, really good potential for producing hydrogen. And then when you're looking at blue hydrogen, which is produced from natural gas or coal with carbon-caption storage, we do see that becoming more expensive than green hydrogen in the future, especially as renewable electricity costs come down. But that can be a viable option in places like.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2546,2022-10-13 17:59:25
14321," storage. We do see that becoming more expensive than green hydrogen in the future, especially as renewable electricity costs come down. But that can be a viable option in places like the US Gulf Coast or Russia, where you've got good geological storage for the carbon, as well as ample natural gas that's quite cheap. All right, great breakdown. Thank you so much to our Meredith Annex, our Bloomberg NEF Hydrogen Specialist, and of course you can get more from the Bloomberg NEF team on the terminal and online.

From Bloomberg World Headquarters, I'm Charlie Petta of S&P 500 index, holding very close to session highs after wiping out a loss that had 2%. The S&P's on track on this CPI Thursday to halt a six day selloff that took it this morning to a two year low. So here's where we stand. S&P right now up 85 again of 2.4%. The Dow at 30,010, it is up 797 points, Dow industrials up 2.7%, and NASDAQ up 207 again there of 2%. The NASDAQ 100 index up by about 2.1%. 10 year yield at 3.91%, the two year 4.40%. Spot goal down 1 1 1% 1670, the ounce, while West Texas, intermediate crew, it is up 2.5%, 8945, the barrel. Stocks storming back from losses, sparked by that hot inflation reading this morning, reaction to the report from Mona Mahajan, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones. Look, this is presenting a real challenge for not only the Fed, but the broader economy here. You know, inflation was supposed to be moderating. We were looking for two to three, maybe four prints lower. In fact, today we got a print that is moving in the wrong direction. Again, we've got the 10 year yielding 3.91%, the two year 4.40%.

Plus global business, finance and tech news as it happens. Bloomberg Business Week with Carol Masser and Bloomberg Quick Takes Tim Stenevick on Bloomberg Radio. All right, a very good afternoon everyone, live from the Bloomberg Interactive Broker Studio streaming on YouTube at his Friday's Eve, also known as Thursday, October 13, 2022. It's also known as CPI Day. Did you see that number this morning? Those numbers? Yeah. Just hotter than expected across the board. At first stocks really seemed to care, but look, they are roaring back. We just heard the numbers from Charlie Pellet. Yeah, I mean, stocks sold off, yield shut off, shut up, speak much. And now we've got kind of the other way. We've got stocks shooting up and yields backing off a little bit of their high levels. So we've got a lot to talk about. We're also going to talk about Netflix, a disruptor that's been disrupted. Will a coming makeover be enough? Some news today too on its ads supported service. Plus two conversations from Bloomberg Invest. We're going to hear from Kathleen McCarthy, global co-head of Blackstone Real Estate, the largest owner of commercial real estate globally. You spoke to her earlier today. I did. And then you had an incredible panel about Bitcoin and blockchain last night. Yeah, we're going to hear from folks over who are handling digital assets and strategy at T-Row Price, City, and Susquehanna. All right, we're also going to talk about key Senate races that will make or break President Biden's agenda and then a really cool author who has spent a long time on Wall Street. Yeah, the new book, Permanent Distortion, How the Financial Markets Abandoned the Real Economy Forever from a Wall Street Insider. Sounds kind of serious. Let's get to the Market Drivers report. Let's set your business week agenda on this. Yes, it's Thursday, everybody. Criticouped, Anchor and Market Sports, on an app-loom, or interactive broker studio. I'm Michael McKee, International Economics and Policy Correspondent at Bloomberg News from our 991 studio in Washington, D.C. He has had a busy day and I've got to start with you, Mike. CPI print, it was hot, wasn't it? It was hot. You know, I'm feeling right now a little bit like Godzilla and just start destroying the city and then you get shot down by all the war planes. I don't know why the market's going to come real soon. Don't worry, Clinties here, she'll tell us what's going on at the markets. You stick to the policy stuff, Mike. The marketing numbers told us that the markets should take because yes, we had expected maybe a flat to slightly down CPI and instead both the headline and the core were higher than expected and that tells us that inflation's going to be around for a while. We saw a drop in gasoline prices which was kind of obvious but we know that they're going to go back up again and housing prices are really the problem here. They're up 8% to 8%, that's after several months, strong months of 7th 10th gain so they were accelerating in the month of September and it takes a long time for them to get into and out of the CPI. So it looks like we're going to be living with this kind of high inflation until middle of next year or late next year and it just solidifies the fed's intention to keep raising rates aggressively. Nobody needs shelter. No. The little thing named shelter. Hey, well, we heard Mike say he has no idea what's going on with markets. He's not the only one created because at one point this morning we're seeing significant declines across the board. Looks like it's going to be just a really, really bad day and then suddenly we start to see stock shoot higher where they are now. I mean the Dow up 2.8% S&P up 2.5 and as that higher by 2% right now, what happened? A more than 1,000 point in today's swing in the Dow. It is wild to see this turnaround story. A couple of things have happened. I couldn't point to one specific reason. I don't think anyone on the street could, but I'll give you a couple that are moving it. The first is positioning. When we got into the CPI report, we were already positioned for a super, super bullish reaction. So, that's why you saw such a steep decline, which I think we dropped 2.5% or something.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2548,2022-10-13 18:08:16
14323," We were already positioned for a super, super bullish reaction. So that's why you saw such a steep decline, which is I think we dropped 2.5% or something like that on the headlines itself in futures trading. So to see a rebound was that, it means the 2.5% wasn't overreaction. That just has to do with positioning. So some of this is simply a fact of pairing that original loss. The second one is going to be what happened in the UK. When you got the headlines from, I think it was Liz Truss and the reporting here being that, even though Quasicarte, who's in DC right now, had said that they have no intention to turn around the plans. I think there was still some reporting that said that actually Liz Truss is actively looking at alternatives to turn things around. What that did to UK yields and as a result, US yields kind of having that contagion effect, then push down the treasury market and then the dollar and therefore that would push up the S&P 500 as well. The third reason, and this is just a rumor I don't have an actual source on this, but that some Russian newspapers were speculating, big, big opposites on speculating that perhaps Sergey Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister and by extension Vladimir Putin may want to engage in talks as something that the US has actively dismissed. And once again, it was just reports from local newspapers in Russia. So take that with a massive great of salt. But altogether, this is what you get a 2.5% rise in the S&P 500. What incredible swings. All right, Mike McKee. So we got the memo, inflation's persistent. I mean, when you see these numbers, are we seeing any signs that inflation though in some regards is topping out? Well, we're seeing a few. We know that there was a big inventory build as stuff that was backed up in Chinese ports made it to the US. So retailers have big stocks that they want to sell down. So they've been discounting and we saw a peril costs pretty much across the board in every category go down. We saw a few other things like use cars go down. We've been waiting for a big drop in use cars on a wholesale basis. They've done that. And we got a 1.1% decline. People thought we might get over 2%. So that might still be out there. Some of the things that we thought would decline did not like airfares were past the travel season, but still airfares went up, which may reflect higher jet fuel prices. But those things might begin to turn around. The real issue is going to be shelter. Now, the Fed knows that shelter is a lagging indicator. So they won't necessarily make their policy on it, but they will be under pressure from Americans as well. The politicians here, because the numbers will still be high, even if we know it's a lagging indicator. Hey, Mike, just in the last 40 seconds that we have with you, what ends up happening when it comes to what the Fed does in November? And then what the Fed does in December, are we thinking 75 basis points for each one given today's print? Well, we're definitely thinking 75 for November. That's pretty much locked in at the moment. And then we'll get another CPI report and another jobs report before the December meeting. So that will have an influence on what they do. The idea was to go 125 basis points more by the end of the year, which would be 75 and 50. But if they feel like they need to do more probably in December, they would do that. They'll wait to see what the data tell them before they make their final decision. Meantime, Jamie Diamond, of course, the CEO of JP Morgan commenting at the Institute of International Finance Conference. I believe that's in Washington saying his gut tells me the Fed rate will be higher than four to four and a half percent. He does say the consumer could be strong though for another nine months. So he's weighing in as well.

14324," ready to announce yet if it will be making criminal referrals to the Department of Justice. We are getting the White House's reaction to another hot reading on inflation, the last one before the midterm elections. President Biden put out a statement saying that progress is being made, but inflation remains a global problem. We spoke with top White House economic advisor, Brian Deese. The United States is in a better position than virtually any other country to address this challenge and do what is necessary to bring prices down without having to give up all of the economic gains that we have made. National Economic Council Director Brian Deese. One positive side effect to inflation is that social security benefits are going up 8.7% next year. The cost of living adjustment or COLA is the biggest increase in 40 years. It will amount to about $140 a month.

Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quick Take Powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. All right, Nancy. Thank you so much, Nancy Lyons, in our 991 Newsroom in Washington, DC. Kind of story in the Bloomberg by Jordan Fabian that we wanted to bring to you. This has to do with the White House accusing Saudi Arabia of coercing other OPEC plus countries into agreeing to a huge cut in oil production last week, really escalating a dispute with Riyadh over the move. Remember, we covered this a lot. This cut, although we were saying that some nations were already not producing at max capacity. So the cut maybe wasn't as big as everybody thought. Don't forget about the fist bump what Biden had with MBS a few months ago when he went over there and tried to get Saudi Arabia to produce more oil. The US administration had asked the Kingdom for a pause that would have effectively delayed expected pricing increases until after November's congressional elections. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said in a statement Thursday that the administration had provided the Saudis with analysis showing, quote, no market basis for a production cut. Yeah, Mr. Kirby going on to say other OPEC nations communicated to us privately that they also disagreed with the Saudi decision, but felt coerced to support Saudis direction. Again, those that's a direct quote from national security council spokesman John Kirby. Saudi government suggesting yesterday that the US had sought a one month delay of the decision, which would mean no production cut until after the US midterm elections in November that will decide control of the House and Senate. Kirby confirmed the US had sought a delay. Yeah, President Biden and top US officials have expressed outrage at the OPEC plus alliances decision to cut oil production by two million barrels a day saying it will help keep revenue flowing to Russia to support its invasion of Ukraine. Some Democrats have also questioned the timing, suggesting that Saudi Arabia seeks to raise US gasoline prices before the midterms to damage their party's prospects. All right. So all of this is going on. If you look a little bit lower on this story, Biden said you might recall this week, his administration would undertake a comprehensive review of its relationship with Saudi Arabia. There's no timetable to complete the review and lawmakers, administration officials and national security experts are split over how to impose consequences on the kingdom to say it's a complicated relationship is probably to put it mildly. It is. And you know, we have a great piece coming up from Stephen Dennis in just a few minutes. It's today's big take and it's all about the Senate races to watch as what happens when it comes to midterm elections, which are what about a month away. All right.

What a deal in aisle 3. There you go. I love what I can make myself laugh. All right, Charlie. Or Charlie laugh. Charlie Bellet there, of course, with the Bloomberg Business News Flash. All right, you are listening and watching Bloomberg Business Week on this Thursday. Carol Maser, long with Tim Stenevich. Charlie, of course, giving you some of the top business stories the market run up. We had a big hot CPI inflation print earlier today. And then we've got business as usual in Washington. And that includes the president making his way across the country to the west coast. Yeah, fresh off a visit to Colorado, the Vale area, where he went to Camp Hell and designated this area, National Monument. He's now in Los Angeles, where he's expected to make some comments very soon on the bipartisan infrastructure law, and also talking about the CPI report. So we'll bring those comments to you when he starts to speak. Yeah, we'll certainly monitor and take you there as soon as it begins. In the meantime, there's something that's already important going on across the country. And you know it because we've got midterms coming up. And the Bloomberg big take today also among our most red on the Bloomberg, about the seven Senate races that will make or break President Biden's agenda. Bloomberg mapping out three plausible outcomes of the US Senate after the 2022 midterms. If Democrats win big, President Biden could accomplish something no Democratic president has in decades. Stephen Dennis, a Senate reporter for Bloomberg News, he joins us on the phone from Capitol Hill this afternoon. Follow him on Twitter at Stephen T. Dennis. I think Stephen, okay, so a handful of really important Senate races to keep an eye on. I want to go through him one by one. I want to start in Pennsylvania because that one's been in the news a lot this week with John Federman and Dr. Oz. What do we need to watch for there? Yeah, so we've got a big debate coming up October 25th. It's going to be their one debate and Federman, you know, obviously has been dealing with this stroke, which is impact. It is ability to process speech. And so, you know, his health has become a big issue in that race. And Mehmet Oz has, and his Republican allies have been really pounding him on criminal justice issues. On the airwaves that have really tightened that race. So, you know, Federman has still been leading in the polls. But, you know, that isn't lost when race for either side. You know, we've got a very close Senate. And, you know, if you look at all the polls right now for all the Senate races, if you just took the polling averages, we ended up with a 50-50 knife edge Senate once again. So the Democrats really need that seat if they want to retain the majority. And, Steve, we just want to put out to you that we are monitoring the president, getting ready to make some comments. He has expected to talk infrastructures out there on NLA. We're going to monitor and take you there as needed and as necessary, especially if he talks about today's inflation print. Hey, Steve, talk a little bit about not just the importance of what's happening here, but I think what's most interesting is President Biden's sagging poll numbers, and the fact that we're even talking about Democrats being able to hold on to the Senate or even gain Senate seats, what gives here? Yeah, so a lot of these Democratic candidates are pulling three, four, five points ahead of Biden in their state. That's sort of defined political gravity, and it's one of the reasons why there's a real chance here for Democrats to divide history. It hasn't been since 1962 that Democrats have gained seats during a midterm with the Democratic president. And there's a lot of issues that aren't really related to much to Biden, but to the environment. We haven't had a situation where a 50-year popular president, president, like Roe vs. Wage, gets overturned and causes a backlash in a huge wave of fundraising enthusiasm for Democrats. You also have a lot of Democratic incumbents who are experienced, have been very good at fundraising, and are against a lot of political neo-fights who are somewhat untested and allied with President Trump, who have tripped up in a series of gaps in certain states and they're dealing with situations like Georgia, where Herschel Walker, every week, there's another revelation about his personal life accusations that he paid for an abortion, all kinds of things that you don't want to be talking about when you're, you know, if you're...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2552,2022-10-13 18:25:30
14327, personal life you know accusations that you pay for an abortion all kinds of things that you don't want to be talking about when you're you know if you're the republicans you want to be talking about Joe Biden and inflation you don't want to be talking about abortion and some of these other issues like former president Donald Trump's claims about the twenty twenty twenty twenty election you mentioned these seven senate races we've talked about pennsylvania are they all really close these senate senate races are all within about four points you know and we know polls it's very easy for them to rely on the base for point yeah so these are the reason for the seven that are within about four points each and you know one of the things we wanted to do with this story just point out to our listeners our readers just how this could go either way uh... you know you have uh... all these dates you know the vata senate races when a pointer to there's a poll yesterday that had four tests master up to points the previous five polls at lack of one or two points and you know it's a really hard to take the poll because there's so many new voters every year in the vatts very trained that's right now the republicans best pick up opportunity they really need to win in the vata and they need you know people like her shawakert's a sort of rally uh... after some of these stories have come out uh... and and and when or else they're not going to take back the majority and and it's really key one of the i'll just say one team uh... to remember uh... is america garland the reason why he is not on the supreme court and the reason why row was overturned because in the twenty fourteen midterm elections right and republicans took back the majority and then ultimately didn't hold a vote alright very important to keep in mind um... steve dentist thank you so much great story and we appreciate it of course he sent a reporter at bloomberg news joining us on the phone from capitol hill let's go to law sandalus present by making some remarks on the bipartisan infrastructure law and also on today's inflation report and would you have a little left for some breathing room just a little bit of breathing and that's my view of what is important and critical and a lot of people hurt these days and today's report shows those some progress overall inflation was two percent over the last three months that's down from eleven percent over the prior three months that's progress but a lot of it is a result of getting the cost of living at the gas pump down by more nightman california not by more than a dollar nationally and since the start of this summer there's a big difference for working folks but the price of gas is still too high and we need to keep working to bring it down all more to say about that next week we also need to make more progress bringing down the prices across the board that's why I just couldn't disagree more with my republican friends who say the biggest problem on our economy right now is that working folks are making too much money now that's the argument workers are making too much money and too many people are working too many jobs are being filled I think that's a bunch is we already said much more larky the biggest problem the biggest problem is the world's challenge global inflation and the pandemic and Putin's unconscionable invasion of Ukraine here's a deal because my economic plan we are better positioned than any other major economy in the world to whether the challenges have come through this in a stronger country we've created nearly seven hundred thousand manufacturing jobs just in the last nineteen months business are investing here in america a record race they see what i see the resilience of american people potential building an economy from the bottom up in the middle look when the middle does well the bottom has a chance the wealthy do very well they never get hurt i'm so tired of trickle down i'm finished with it so we're going to keep at it by taking on big farm and insurance companies for the health insurance companies with a lot of democrats and congress here today i signed the inflation reduction act which gave medicare the power that we've been trying to get for the last thirty years the power to negotiate law or beğena,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2553,2022-10-13 18:29:44
14328," today, I signed the inflation reduction act, which gave Medicare the power that we've been trying to get for the last 30 years. The power could negotiate lower prescription drug prices. We pay the highest drug prices of any nation in the world. For seniors on Medicare, we're capping the cost of prescription drugs at $2,000 a year, even if they're using the most expensive cancer drug in the world. We're capping the cost of insulin, which is 30, 40 times higher than the number I'm going to give you at $35 a month. You can't go higher than that. Folks, we're locking in savings and healthcare agreements for millions of people and the Affordable Care Act. And today, I'm announcing the Social Security benefits are going to go up by an average of $140 a month, even as Medicare premiums go down. So folks, seniors are going to get to have inflation next year. For the first time in 10 years, the Social Security checks will go up while their Medicare premiums go down. Here's my final point. We've got an election in the month. Boters have to decide. Democrats are working to bring down the cost of things and to talk about around the kitchen table, from prescription drugs, the health insurance, to energy bills, and so much more. They're standing up for working people and they're right to get a raise and get a better job. The publisher campaigning every day on an agenda to raise your cost. You know, I should point out before I go on to the Republican platform so far for this off your election and led by a senator from the Cessna. All right. You've been listening to President Biden there on the west coast of the United States Los Angeles. We're specifically to really talk about the bipartisan infrastructure law investments on public transit, jobs, the job market, and opportunity. But he did, of course, address that very hot inflation print today. Core U.S. inflation rising to a 40-year high. Yeah, the president's saying people don't need a report to tell them they're being squeezed. He also said the price of gasoline is still too high and need to keep working. He said that he's going to address gasoline prices next week. All right. So we'll continue to monitor and bring you any headlines as they come to our attention. In the meantime, a lot going on in the world, business as well as the financial markets for that. Let's turn things over to Charlie Pellet with the Bloomberg Business News. You got the right guy. I thank you very much, Carol Master. Here's what's going on. Do you want to begin with some remarks from Jamie Dimon? He says the Fed is unlikely to engineer a soft landing for the U.S. economy as it raises rates to choke off inflation. Dimon is the CEO of JP Morgan Chase. He says central bank policy makers probably can't cool the Red Hot economy without bringing on a recession. His remarks coming at an industry conference today in Washington. Stocks so storming back from earlier losses. What a day for the U.S. stock market. A swing of roughly 1200 on the Dow from high to low. Right now we're looking at a gain of 750 in the Dow up by 2.6 percent. The S&P up 78 again there of 2.2 percent. Asdaq up 177. That is an advance of 1.7 percent. Ten year 3.93 percent. The two year 4.42 percent. Spot cold down 5.5 dollars. Younts to 1667 drop. There are three tenths of 1 percent. And West Texas. Inemidia crude rallying 2 percent. 88 99. A barrel. As for where this morning CPI report leaves the Federal Reserve. Jenny Johnson is the president and CEO of Franklin Templeton investment. We are probably in a longer term inflationary period for a period of time. The Fed has to get aggressive. We are afraid of what happened in the 70s by stopping raising too quickly. I think probably everybody after seeing this number is not only expecting the 75 maybe in November in the 50 after but starting to look into 23 and saying there will be some additional hikes there as well. Sources say Bloomberg or sources tell Bloomberg. Kroger is in talks about a merger with the rival U.S. super market company Albertsons and a deal could come as soon as this week. We have got Kroger little changed up by 1 cent now Albertsons surging by 11.8 percent.

That's amazing. Like talk about owning the market. All right from I have no good segues. So we're just going to get into our next segment. The past this past Monday you all know this and depending on where you were around the country, Columbus Day and or Indigenous peoples day. And on the latter, the World Health Organization has noted that the health of Indigenous peoples is often marked by higher rates of health risks, poorer health outcomes and greater unmet needs in terms of health and social services. We've got Dr. Donald Warren with us co-director of the Center for Indian Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Dr. Warren joining us on the phone from Baltimore this afternoon. Dr. Warren how are you? Doing very well. How are you doing? We're doing well thanks. Hey, I give us an idea of the health challenges facing Indigenous people in this country. What are you focused on at the Center for Indian Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, which I should note is supported by Michael Art Bloomberg, the founder of Bloomberg LP and Bloomberg philanthropies. Yeah, so we've had the Center for American Indian Health for over 30 years actually. And the original work took place in Arizona and collaboration with a couple of the tribes who are facing some infectious disease issues. And at that time, there were children, very young children who are dying from dehydration. So the original work was actually to develop oral rehydration therapy that you actually became pediatrically. So a little long fact, the pediatrically originated out of that work. Interesting. So the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health and collaboration with tribes in Arizona. And since that time or last 30 or so years, they've expanded the work to well over 200 tribes across the US and expanded beyond infectious disease. So include things like maternal and child health as well as addressing behavioral health considerations and chronic disease. So we just recently, within the last less than one month, changed the name from the Center for American Indian Health to the Center for Indigenous Health and will be having more of an international focus moving forward. Talk to us about Indigenous communities in the US, in the United States, or even globally. Why is it that they're having such a tough time in terms of access to good health care and having good health outcomes? Well, each population is different, but there are some commonalities. And when we look at the Indigenous populations, those are the first inhabitants of various parts of the earth. And of course, the United States, that would include both American Indian and Alaska Native populations as well as Native Hawaiian and other Indigenous peoples and the Pacific Islands that are in US territories. So we have a very diverse group of Indigenous peoples in the United States. But specifically for American Indians and Alaska natives, what really makes us unique is that we have sovereign nations within the United States. So there's actually 574 federally recognized sovereign tribes. So we have our own elected officials, our own governments, in many cases our own health systems. But the big challenge is that we face terrible rates of poverty and marginalization in many of our tribes. So one of the things that we see across the population served by Indian health service is a lot of poverty-related illnesses and other socially determined health disparities. And unfortunately, the Indian health service is terribly underfunded. And if we look at just the funding for IHS compared to Medicare, for example, IHS is funded about $3,000, $4,000 per patient per year. Medicare is funded at $12,000 per patient per year. So we just have a terribly underfunded health system coupled with an impoverished population generally speaking. Dr. Warren, can you talk a little bit about your bio and in f...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2555,2022-10-13 18:38:27
14330," funded health system coupled with an impoverished population generally speaking. Dr. Warren, can you talk a little bit about your bio and from what I've read, this medicine runs in your family. Can you talk a little bit about your background and how you bring a traditional approach to what you're doing today? Absolutely. So I'm Oglala Lakota, originally from Kyle South Dakota on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. And I was very fortunate to have in a family with a lot of traditional healers and medicine men. So several uncles and a head of grandfather who were all traditional healers. And I've learned a lot about traditional Lakota approaches to health and wellness just from my own family. And it's also a ceremony family. So we have sacred ceremonies that we participate in every year and really hanging on to the beauty and the benefits of connectedness to traditional culture. In addition to that, my mom is a nurse. She's 83 and still working. I like to tease her that she failed retirement. She's trying to retire as she is still. So working as an educator and really helping to educate the next generation of American Indian nurses. So I've been exposed to the whole field of health care from traditional cultural perspectives as well as modern medical perspectives. And then I was very fortunate. I did well in school and was able to go to Stanford for medical school and Harvard for my master public health. I've got to ask you. We've only got about a minute left. So this is not an easy thing I know to answer. But I mean, it feels like another population in the United States that gets an incredible raw deal. And indigenous people over and over again, you know, you can pick your point is being left behind. What what big program or policy change could we do that would make a difference on the population in the United States specifically? I'm asking we've got about a minute. And in the US, one of the unique considerations that most of our tribes also have treaties with the federal government. So there's a government to government relationship. And as part of those treaties, it's well documented in case law and in other examples that we have a legal treaty right to health services in the United States. So the only thing that we would ask is that the federal government live up to its treaty obligations much in the same way we would criticize other nations for not living up to their treaty obligations. We should actually be looking at our treaty obligations to our indigenous peoples in the US and recognize that underfunding the Indian health service really is a breach of those treaty obligations. Very interesting and informative. Dr. Donald Warren, thank you so much. Really appreciate your time today. Co-director for the soon to be Center for Indigenous People at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Center for Indigenous Health People's Health, I should say. And of course, Johns Hopkins is supported by Michael R. Bloomberg, founder of Bloomberg LP and Bloomberg Philanthropies. Dr. Warren joining us on the phone from Baltimore.

Well, the House Committee looking into last year's attack on the US Capitol is taking a brief break. Committee members have been summarizing the evidence they've collected. Congresswoman Elaine Luria of Virginia this afternoon spoke a former president Trump's efforts to find votes in Georgia. I just want to find 11,780 votes. That's an extraordinary demand by the president, especially since he already knew from the Justice Department. There was no genuine basis for this request. Again, Congresswoman Luria, today's hearing is the Committee's ninth and likely final hearing before releasing a report with recommendations. There are reports though that Committee may vote today on whether to Sabina Trump himself. The midterm race for control of Congress is getting tighter. A new CNN poll shows 50% of voters prefer the Democratic candidate in their congressional district compared to 47% for the Republican. In competitive districts, though, it shifts the other way. 48% of likely voters prefer the Republican candidate in those tight races. 43% go for the Democrat.

Just a couple of hours ago or so, we got some headlines crossing Netflix. We'll introduce an ad-supported plan. On November 3rd, we knew it was coming. Yeah, we knew it was coming. We didn't know how much it would cost or where it would go. Now we know what it cost. Yes, 7 bucks a month. You're going to downgrade to that? I don't know. We're getting to a point where we have so many different streaming services. It's got kind of back to cable, I feel like. That is so true. At some point, we're going to have to be like, do we really watch this? What's old is new again? Yeah, Netflix was the market leader, the innovator, the disruptor. So we shall see. But the companies making some new big bets to entice new budget conscious customers and jumpstart. A graph, this is really about kind of juicing the bottom top and bottom line for the company. Yeah, this is huge and it's interesting investors are reacting positively to this, but Netflix shares are just beat up this year after it reported in the first couple months of the year. An actual decline of two million customers. We're going to have more on this with Lucas Shaw in just a few minutes. In the meantime, some more details on this. This lower price streaming package, it's going to debut here in the US on November 3rd, also in 11 other countries, including Japan, France, Brazil, and a few others. Four to five minutes of commercials per hour, Carol, and offer a lower video quality than higher price tiers. The lower video quality thing is something that Netflix has experimented with in the past, with its full price packages. So if you wanted 4K or I think it was 4K, you would pay a little more. So check it out. There's a great little chart in the Bloomberg story. So basic, we're going to add to 699 a month. Basic is 999 standard. I'm going to crick you what that means. $15.49. That gives you a number of screens you can watch at one time. So that would give you two premium that you watch on four screens at one time. That's premium and it costs almost 20 bucks. And you get ultra HD. Woohoo! I want to see what they do with password sharing. Yeah, we're going to talk about our Lucas Shah who put this story out on the terminal. He's got a great story in Bloomberg Business Week. We're going to talk about the new Netflix. That's coming up next.

So we mentioned that's going to launch that ad-supported plan on November 3rd. That story was reported by a Lucas Shaw as is a most read on the Bloomberg that is in the new issue of Bloomberg Business Week magazine and that story about Netflix is coming makeover in the face of some real streaming competition.

14333," face of some real streaming competition. Yeah, the piece by Lucas Shaw, Entertainment reporter for Blueburg News, he joins us on the phone from Los Angeles. Give him a follow on Twitter at Lucas underscore Shaw and then sign up for screen time, his fantastic newsletter. Lucas, good to have you with us this afternoon. I want to go back years ago to sort of the DNA of Netflix, the way that it disrupted blockbuster, but then kind of had to disrupt itself when it really brought streaming to the masses. Because I think that's a big part of your piece because Netflix once again in order to succeed in this new ecosystem has to disrupt itself one more time. Where should we start? I mean, you can start with advertising, which is where we started earlier because it's something Netflix has always said it would never do. You know, never say you ever. Yeah, being an ad free streaming service was sort of a core part of its proposition, something that made it better than cable TV where people were overwhelmed with 10, 15 minutes of advertising per hour and is really a sign of kind of the maybe not desperation, but the you know, the challenge they face here where they've just hit a wall in terms of growth over the last 18 months and are now doing two things, both advertising and charging for password sharing that they long set were not an issue. The one the one quibble I take with the comparison to starting streaming, which I think is totally valid, is that if you asked the leadership of the company, they would argue that this is more of a minor alteration because they still believe it's streaming. They're just making changes to it, but that is of course a little bit of corporate spin. Joel Weber's here, the editor of Luburg Business Week magazine and it's you know, really timely story considering the head lens we got earlier today about Netflix launching that service and we got some details on how much it's going to cost Joel. Yeah, so Luke is the the thing that I just wanted to spend a little bit of time talking to you is this the culture at Netflix and you know, Sarandas obviously been there for a while has been the architect of sort of the content strategy. The the thing that you know like we say in the story, you never wanted to do was ads right and so internally I'm really curious to see how they tested this the price of this model like what's your early sense of just like how did they land on this particular price? Well, I think the price comes from mimicking other services. They don't like to say that out externally. You know, there's a call earlier today where a reporter asked Greg Peters the CEO of the company if they chose six lines nine a month because it's a dollar less than Disney pluses at zero just seven nine a month and they said no, but I've had conversations with people at the very top of the company who said that they were modeling it a little bit after Hulu, which was sort of the first big streaming service to offer ads one of Netflix's earliest competitors and it's priced in a way where they believe the six ninety nine a month, seven dollars a month plus what they'll make from advertising means that they'll make as much if not more from an ad to your customer as they will from the premium one. To your question about culture, I just think this year in general the past couple of years have been very destructive towards the culture that was was pretty unique in business. Well stick with that because one of the things that you talk about was the I will call it a debacle, which was the quickster moment where they said you know what we're we're we're gonna change the name and we're gonna turn this streaming thing into quickster and you know it boy did not go over well but it speaks to this company's ability to sort of try things maybe you saw for something it doesn't go well and you pivot and boy that last decade since the quickster thing looked really good but one of the things you point out in the story is that there's not that many people left at the company from back then. Yeah I mean you have to give them credit to your point about quickster with the advertising and the password sharing they're moving very quickly I mean they went from at the end of last year still not thinking they were doing advertising to standing up an ad service less than a year they're doing it faster than Disney got their ad sported here out there and keep in mind Disney already has an ad sported service in Hulu and Disney is a major player in video advertising so there is a degree to which the company can still move incredibly quickly and I think that's a credit to to re-h things and and Ted Sarandas but a lot of the senior leadership around them has left there's just in general a way.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2559,2022-10-13 18:55:50
14334," The company can still move incredibly quickly, and I think that's a credit to re-h things and Ted Sarandos, but a lot of the senior leadership around them has left. There's just in general a lot of restlessness among employees, and I think there was a feeling for a long time that Netflix was the place to work if you wanted to be in media, and in some cases in tech, I mean it was at the top of every list of most desirable companies, and it's not like it's completely fallen off, but for a lot of the folks who work there, it now feels like another company because there was forever this very unique culture that re-tasting that built and written a book about, and while it's still there in pieces, it has fallen to pray to the same thing that all companies do as they get scaled, they just become the more corporate and traditional. So what is stuck around from that infamous culture deck that kind of went viral years ago? The idea, the company is like a sports team, not a family, right? They'll cut people who aren't top performers, but at the same time they encourage you to go out and see how much you're worth in the marketplace and come back, and you can get a raise from Netflix that way. I mean, what parts are sticking around to you and what parts are kind of gone there? I mean, I'd say it's a moderation of things, right? So the company is infamous for having radical transparency, you know, re-tasting model, the law of leadership off of Ray Dalio, the bridgewater guy, and that comes in a couple of forms. It's a lot of feedback, so people being very direct and blunt with one another, and also then sharing metrics and dating, you know, Netflix makes pay, the pay available to, or excuse me, employees can see what one another is making above a certain level. They share their financial results weeks before they announce them publicly with hundreds of employees, which is very rare. Some of that is still sticking around. They still share some of those financial results ahead of time. They do still have the pay available to some, but you talk to employees and they say that a lot of the decision making, which used to be decentralized, that used to be, you want to do empower people who are, you know, VP level, relatively mid-level executives to be able to buy a project or try something. That just doesn't happen as much anymore. A lot of the decisions seem to be made by a few stakeholders, and people are just playing with fear more because the company is under more pressure. Hey, just got about 30 seconds left here. I love this line, though, and your story with all this going on, you say it's important to note that in some ways Netflix has never been stronger. 20 seconds, why? It's profitable. It doesn't have to borrow money anymore, and it is far and away the bigger than all these other companies which are dealing with the decline of cable TV, which does not affect Netflix. I mean, Lucas, thank you for this story. Perfectly timed. I mean, you think about all these other companies that are basically going through the growing pains that Netflix has gone through, Netflix built its dynasty on cheap debt and they're profitable and know how to do this. It's like, you know, to some advantage, there's a serious advantage there. Yeah, it's a great deep dive into so much when it comes to Netflix and the changes that it's making. It's like you knew something was going on, there'd be some headlines here, Joel. I mean, I get to work with people like Lucas, it's amazing. He is amazing.

You've got Delta up almost 5%, United up more than 4%, and American up about 3%. You did have Delta reporting today. They see fourth quarter profit outpacing Wall Street's expectations. Thanks to corporate travel is coming back and this is even as cost-remeant elevated and economic volatility lingers. We're going to hear more from the airlines next week. And we're finally seeing a good day for semiconductor stocks. Look at the stocks today. It's up close to 3%. It's outperforming the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ. It was down as much as 5% earlier in the session than up as much as 4.6%. I was going to get to that, Carol. It just was doing in the system. Well, some context there. Okay. It's down 42% this year. Carol, with a couple of days. About time for a good day for the stocks. Qualcomm and Vidia, TSMC, Lam Research leading at higher, everything in there is in the green, actually. Well, I mean, over benchmark, major benchmarks in the green as well. It's interesting that you point out the chip stocks and, in fact, it's not the NAS stock that wins out on the day, but it is, the good old Dow Jones up more than 3% on the Dow Jones industrial average. We're at 30,096, remain cracks has had back out. We got the NASDAQ up 2.2%. We've got the Russell 2000 up 2.45%. That's basically 41 points to the higher side. The S&P now almost up 100 points for up 2.7% on that benchmark. And it is a breath kind of day for remain only 23 names in the red. And so it's green across the screen on all the major indices as well. And I count about 5 of these sectors remain where 100% of the securities in the sectors are also green on the screen. It's energy, it's financials, it's also technology up more than 3%. Technology up more than 3%. That's been a little bit resilient. You're looking at Apple shares, which at one point on the day, we're actually down as much as 3% now, higher, by about 3% in this flip flop of a day. But two interesting things to keep an eye on. We did hear from ALS with Smith, which makes water heaters on a lot of stuff that goes into homes. And we actually were a lot more cautious here about the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2561,2022-10-13 19:04:42
14336," Smith, which makes water heaters on a lot of the stuff that goes into homes, they actually were a lot more cautious here about the economy going forward. And in fact, those shares had been down as much as 5% they're higher now by about two tenths of a percent, but they actually did drag down a good portion of the rest of the building sector here. And I think that's something to keep an eye on as we get this CEO commentary and get a little bit of insight as to whether they think their businesses can hold up. We did hear from the CEO of Domino's pizza and he said, you know what? Everybody's still buying pizza. Nobody ever stops buying pizza. In fact, the great quote was, he said before the pandemic, one in every three pizza sold in the US was Domino's. He said right now, one in every three pizza sold in the US is Domino's. I don't know if that's a good or bad thing, but if you're a Domino CEO or Domino's investors, it's good. Those shares are up 11%. You know what goes well with pizza? No. But ball, Romaine. Oh my gosh. Don't stop. You're going to say wine or beer. No, no, she's vegan. I thought you also didn't eat any of the flour in pizza. Meanwhile. So let's just suck off a sports. Let's look though at the sport of how companies manage this inflationary environment. And to your point, Romaine, you're going to hear from CEOs. The earnings are going to be so important because this chart shows the S&P 500 under pressure, clearly in the blue line for our radio audience sinking. But so too, therefore, slowly but surely, the margins getting hit. High in pop costs are taking forward margins sharply lower, but clearly not affecting your pizza ripper. Exactly. Hey, I'm going to just say one thing. The Fibrescent swings in the S&P and the Dow. I just don't get it because you've got another VIX down more than a point. I just, I don't understand it. Yeah. And you've got a two-year yield, I or by 16 basis points right now. I said that up. So add that up. Just, you know, let's just go eat pizza and watch a football game or something. Yeah. All right. So let's obviously, everybody's trying to make sense of the inflation print that we got today. And our TV team caught up with Brian D's director of the US National Economic Council, who talked about the shelter cost, which alone rose seven tons of a percent in September from the month before. Here's what he had to say. Shelter inflation represented more than half of core inflation for the last couple of months. We're seeing some contemporaneous real-time evidence of sharp deceleration in rental price appreciation, sharp deceleration in home price appreciation. So that's going to be an area that we're going to have to stay very focused on here in the days and months ahead. And that's, of course, Brian D's of the US National Economic Council director. You know, Mike said something interesting to us, you guys. And he talked about that. It's a while for housing and shelter to get into the CPI, and it takes a while for it to get out. It's a lagging indicator. So it's just something to think about in terms of the stickiness of it potentially, and the lagging aspect of it as well. Yeah, but the problem is the stickiness of it. The problem is that this was higher across the board. It doesn't matter if we were talking about core or non-core. It doesn't matter if we were talking about month over month or year over year. Everything was above expectations. And it just makes us think about what happens in December. And look, we do get more data before the December Fed meeting. I mean, it's not even worth actually thinking about what the Fed is going to do in November, because we've got the data. Yeah, and Rick Reader came out with a great tweet, basically saying 75 basis points. It's pretty much locked in, particularly after this report. I think I'm probably one of the few people out there who actually thinks that some of the focus on the shelter cost is a little bit of a red herring and kind of deflects, I think, from some of the more painful areas. Because remember, that step up that we saw on shelter cost, it was a lot more gradual. Meanwhile, the real inflationary shock came and a lot of the more essential goods primarily in the food sector. And the fact that you're now seeing a re-acceleration in some of those prices, that has a material impact. Because, again, it's not about the headline number two, but it's also about expectations, consumer expectations. And if those are still high going forward, I don't know what the Fed is going to do to actually get them down. And again, we'll talk about break events, which have actually since March felt pretty well anchored. And that was the sign that the Federal Reserve's talking, of course, then the lag on some of the actions were working. But then I'm hearing more and more market participants saying, maybe we don't believe the break events, that we're actually not sure that even 2.5, 3.5 percent in the coming years is actually now even realistic. So that also could be the debate about long-term, is this sort of inflation anchored or not? And what does it mean when you're trying to bargain with your employer for higher wages? Real average hourly earnings dropped again in September. That's one of the jobless claims. You're going to be out there saying, I need a match to this. And therefore, is some of your wage spiral in Stickingness County. Let's not forget too, in those FOMC minutes that we got yesterday, that the members reminded us that the Fed rate hikes haven't played their way through all of the economy. So they did kind of say, hey, we know inflation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2562,2022-10-13 19:09:22
14337," It hikes haven't played their way through all of the economy. So they did kind of say, hey, we know inflation is still high. And yet we've got to kind of wait for some of the rate increase. A long does it take on. And we basically started this in March officially. We've seen it in the last year. And the drawbone started at the end of last year. And Rick Reader. And Rick Reader. How long is this leg? Rick Reader in his note saying, we're a little, I mean, not surprised that this is a big lag. And then we all thought that we were going to start to feel it by the fourth quarter. That the March would be felt by Q4. And if we're not feeling it now, does that mean it's more entrenched? Why has there been such a lag? If you're trying to buy a house, you're feeling it, right? Like that has certainly played out. We're just waiting for other aspects. I guess freeze that wrongly, Ron. Yeah. Wow. All right. So good bye, girl. All right. OK, Roland. OK, Roland. All right, we will be back in less than an hour's time. We're going to continue this conversation on radio TV and YouTube, be on the bell. We're going to cut you down the clothes on this Thursday. Is that work for you, remain? Hmm. OK. This is Bloomberg Business Week with Carol Maser and Bloomberg Quick Takes Tim Stenevig on Bloomberg Radio. All right. You are listening and watching Bloomberg Business Week on Bloomberg Radio. Carol Maser, along with Tim Stenevig, live in our Bloomberg Interactive Broker Studio. I got to say that inflation print and then the crazy market activity in terms of a sell-off, yield spiking, and then yields coming off their eyes, and then arreiling the equity markets. Certainly has made me a little wacky. I mean, could one say short squeeze at all? I guess potentially. Potentially? I don't know. I just don't know why it's higher. Yeah, I don't know. It's really kind of fascinating. The VIX has come down. We are talking about, Crety pointed out, about a 1,265 point swing on the Dow. So about a 5% from peak to trough. That a 5% move on the S&P 500 peak to trough. I got a thousand points on the Dow. I would argue that these are the kinds of things that you start to see when we are trying to find a market value, a market bottom kind of incredible selling or incredible swings like kind of back and forth. So I don't know. That's my take on it. But we'll see, I guess. Victoria Greene yesterday from G Squared. She was in the studio with us. She said she's still looking for 32 to 3,400 on the S&P 500 for a bottom. So we'll see. OK. The other thing is, no one knows. I mean, at some point, investors are not stupid. How many Fed officials have to come out and say, folks, we've got high inflation. We are going to keep raising rates. We know we're concerned about other things. So at some point, investors price that in. I mean, we're down what we're up for the first day in six, I think. So we've been down for a while. Hey, let's get on over to World in National News. Nancy Lyeth is in Washington, DC, and our 99-1 newsroom. Hey, Nets. Thanks, Tim. There are multiple reports. The House Committee investigating January 6th, that's meeting today, will take a vote on whether to subpoena President Trump to testify. This afternoon, committee members have been summarizing their findings with Congresswoman Zowloffgren saying they have documentation that months before the election, Trump was planning to declare victory regardless of the outcome. We now know more about President Trump's intention for election night. The evidence shows that his false victory speech was planned well in advance before any votes had been counted. The law of course says Trump was also ready to declare that only votes tallied on election day would be legitimate. Well, the US Supreme Court is handing former President Trump a loss in his fight over records the FBI seized from his Mar-a-Lago estate. The Court agrees with the government that a set of materials with classified marking should be excluded from a special master's review. The President Biden says his economic plan has the US in a better position to tackle inflation than the rest of the world. The White House put out a statement after the latest report on consumer prices showed core inflation hit a new 40-year high last month. Commerce Secretary Gina Romando says the plan needs time to work through the economy. I wish there were a magic wand. The fact that every country in the world is struggling with inflation and frankly America is doing better than any other country tells you there's no magic wand and we have to get up every day and attack it.

Rapping things up, US mortgage rates surge to the highest in 20 years reaching 6.92%. Live, from the first of breaking news test, gone. Bill Maloney. Okay, we thank you very much. Bill Maloney into here live. Breaking news over your Bloomberg-type squawk. SQU-AWK on your terminal. I'm Charlie Pellett and that. There's a Bloomberg business flash. All right, Charlie. Thank you so much. Well, today, Bloomberg Live hosting a second day of Bloomberg Invest. It's an annual gathering of the leading names covering everything from crypto to credit markets and then everything in between. And it was in person for the first time since the pandemic and comes amid, as you know, an error of lots of market volatility and uncertainty. I cut up with an executive from the largest owner of commercial real estate globally. Kathleen McCarthy, she is the global co-head of Blackstone Real Estate, which has a $577 billion portfolio and about 320 billion that is in investor capital under management. Lots to talk about. We began, though, when I asked her how against a tough market backdrop and daily mix signals, how things are going. It is an exciting and interesting time because as you can see, there's different signals coming through and I think we are better positioned than anyone to know what's really happening.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2565,2022-10-13 19:22:34
14340," It is an exciting and interesting time because as you can see there's different signals coming through and I think we are better positioned than anyone to know what's really happening. We have $600 billion real estate. We're in 37 different countries. A portfolio that's highly concentrated into four key themes. 80% of our capital is in warehouses, rental housing, lab office and hospitality investments. And what I'd say we're seeing is actually very strong fundamentals in those sectors. So when you talk about property performance, particularly for rental housing, that continues to be strong partly because of the pressures on the poor sale market with rising interest rates, logistics demands of warehouses. In the US today we are at record low vacancies, less than 3% vacancies in the markets we operate in, which are the densest, most urban kind of areas. And we're also seeing very strong rent growth. So in the US last month, rent growth in our markets was 30% in Canada, it was even stronger 50%. And so I think when we're thinking about the real estate market, we continue to see a lot of strength. Notwithstanding, there are pressures around us in terms of interest rates, an economy that the central governments are of course trying to cool and persistent inflation. But we feel really well positioned for that. And I'd also highlight that I think this moment in real estate, this cycle is quite different than others we've been in the past. Different, good, different facts. That's a good different. I mean, good different. When you think about what kind of led to real estate downturns in the past, there were really two primary factors. It was too much capital, generally in the form of debt, creating greater leverage, fueling new speculative development. And it was too many cranes, too much development. And really when you think about what happened in the years following the financial crisis and leading up into COVID, we really never saw those excesses come into our market. And so as we head into, you know, period where there may be more economic headwinds, real estate actually is really well positioned from a fundamental standpoint. Economic headwinds are recession. It's very hard to call. And I'm not... I think, you know, I think part of it is what we're seeing. And some of the things that I think the central governments are trying to combat, which is just this continued strength, they see low unemployment, strong rent growth. And that is part of what the big challenge is ahead. So I don't know if we're going to have a recession, I'm not an economist, but I would say are there definitely economic cooling? Are you guys having conversations internally like thinking like, hey guys, we need to be thinking that maybe in this market, in this market? Yeah, what I would say is we've been planning for a long time. And this comes through in the portfolio we've constructed for an environment that might have been like this in terms of higher interest rates, higher inflation. And so we really focused on trying to be in those high cash flow growth assets. And again, I'd say today we're still seeing those stronger than inflationary cash flows in our portfolio. But certainly we are always trying to position for environments that change. We've been doing this for 30 years. We've seen a lot of different environments. We thought we had seen it all. And then COVID hit. And hotel revenues went to zero. I'm telling you, no one underwrote that. More we had a pandemic. But the great news is our portfolios are built really to try to withstand any kind of environment. And the higher than anticipated rent growth we've experienced, again, may kind of come down modestly. But we feel really well positioned for that. And distrust for you guys can be opportunity big time. We saw that after the financial crisis in terms of housing. I would say environments with distress, with volatility, with a pullback in capital markets activity. And we're seeing in particular much more constrained capital markets today. That tends to be a great environment for us. And really for any investor who is well capitalized and who has real strengths to lean on. So we have a data advantage. Our portfolio gives us more information on what's really happening. That helps us build conviction around what we want to do next. And then I'd say the combination of deep experience from a large team in capital makes us well positioned to really support situations where others may be needing to sell assets, others might need liquidity. And we're able to then get in and buy high quality real estate. All right, that was a conversation earlier at Bloomberg live. Their Bloomberg Invest event, Kathleen McCarthy, Global Co-head of Blackstone Real Estate, Massive Portfolio, as I mentioned, largest donor of commercial real estate. We covered a lot of ground.

14343," I in September, core consumer prices up 6.6% year over year. The data pressures the federal reserve to lift rates even more to stamp out inflation. Biden administration reaction to today's report from U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Romando, who is interviewed right here on Bloomberg Radio. As we all know, this is a global problem. There's not a country on Earth right now, not struggling with inflation. And as we put COVID behind us and get back to business as usual in the supply chain, I think the Fed's action will start to have an effect and consumers will continue to feel it. But it takes a bit of time for the Fed's actions and the supply chain actions that we've taken to work its way through the system. And again, we do have the tenure yielding 3.95%. Goldman Sachs and Apple have announced a partnership to offer savings accounts to users of the tech company's credit card. Goldman Sachs shares they are advancing today up 4%, Apple up by 2.8%. And this headline now from the Bloomberg Professional Service, the January 6 panel, probing the capital attack, has voted to subpoena Donald Trump. I'm Charlie Palatette. It's a Bloomberg business flash. All right, Charlie, thank you so much. Well, while Market Ride today, equity markets, bond markets, that's for sure. We did, as I mentioned, saw treasuries tumbling. We did see that 30-year yield over 4% for the first time since 2011. We had policy sensitive two-year yields also surging as much as 24 basis points to 4.53%. That was the highest since 2007. There's been a lot of stuff going on today. I got to turn my microphone on. Is that kind of a day, right? You know, Ira Jersey is with us. He's chief US interest rate strategist for Bloomberg Intelligence. He joins us on the phone from New Jersey. Ira, we've been trying to explain the equity market for the last hour and a half. And now you have you on the program to try to explain what's going on in the bond market because the signal is a little more clear there. What are you seeing? I mean, I mean, the equity signal is, or if the equities are signaling anything, it's a little bit baffling to me. But in the rates market, it's pretty simple. Inflation seems like it might run a little bit higher than the market was thinking. So a lot of this bond market sell-offs is, as Carol mentioned, in part policy rate sensitive, right? We're pricing in another, you know, maybe a 75 basis point interest rate hike, not only in November, but in December. And then on top of that, you have inflation expectations that have jumped. So five-year inflation expectations have jumped about eight basis points today and two-year inflation expectations have jumped almost 20 basis points. So you're seeing a pretty significant increase in inflation expectations after today's report. And I think that's a reasonable market reaction quite frankly, because the data this morning, as we all know, was higher than expected. But the details, I think, were really telling in that inflation might take a long time to come down, even if it has peaks, which I think it has. It'll just glide path is not going to be nearly as steep as the market was pricing. Hey, I think it was something you said earlier. I thought on Bloomberg, Ira, which is when you look at market expectations for the terminal rates, that still think, investors still think that the hiking cycle or traders, that the hiking cycle will stop by March. Is that still the case? Yes. So the hiking cycle, the market is still thinking will stop by March. And then I think what's more baffling, it's not so much that they might stop by March. Because I think that we'll have a pretty good idea about what the glide path is, and if the Fed does hike 75 and then 50 and 50 and 25 or something like that, then they're going to get close to 5% plus or minus 25 basis points. Then I think that the question is, you know, that what the market might have long, is that the market currently thinks that they're still going to start cutting interest rates very early. There's still an interest rate cut price into 2023. And I think that that's something that's not likely to happen. I think once the Fed reaches their terminal rate, it'll take some serious market reaction, and in particular inflation coming down significantly more than I think that it likely will, in order for the Fed to start cutting interest rates. But once they start cutting, say in 2024, 2025, they'll probably will cut pretty quickly. So the market...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2569,2022-10-13 19:39:20
14344, likely will in order for the fact that start cutting interest rates but once they start cutting say in twenty twenty four twenty twenty five there probably will cut pretty quickly so uh... to so the market kind of has it wrong i think on both ends one it's pricing for cuts too early and then to it's not pricing for enough cuts later and i think that that that's one reason why i still think that the yield curve has more flattening to do which you know it's already very very inverted but it could get even much more inverted from where it is right now hey i wrote what what about when it comes to how like what the fed needs to see in order to start cutting when you say inflation needs come down significantly what are we talking here i mean are we talking to like i think they have to wait until it gets to two percent or you saying that you know what you guys think about it bloomberg intelligence yeah uh... uh... you know it's a good question to him so i think one of the that the big thing is it has to be trending the right direction right so if uh... inflation on a year on your basis you know comes down and and let's say it's at five percent and the fed fund rate is at five percent that means you have a neutral fed funds rate and and anything uh... then if if inflation comes down just a little bit more you everyone will start to say okay policy rates are now restrictive and keep in mind the federal reserve has always hyped until the federal funds rate was at the same or higher then the uh... personal consumption expenditure deflator so until we get to that point and we're not quite there yet uh... will will like the fed will likely continue to hike interest rates so so they need to see that uh... that the core pc deflator i think coming down now if it's three and a half percent looks like it's going to two percent over six months and yet that the fed might might start to think about a not uh... about cutting interest rates a little bit particularly if the unemployment rate is higher but you know right now it doesn't you know the labor market still so tight it's hard to imagine the federal reserve cutting and until you see a couple percentage point increase in the uh... uh... in the unemployment rate so glad we could talk with you i would thank you so much i would jerseys chief u.s interest rates strategist at bloomberg intelligence joining us

14345," on inflation news this morning in the market reaction. In the meantime, we're seeing some special situation activity going on and this has to do specifically with some of the big supermarket chains. Yeah, we've got a great deals team here, including Michelle F. Davis, Ruth David Edhamon and Crystal C. All pitching in on this story, a Bloomberg exclusive, Kroger saying to be in talks to combine with the rival Albert Sins. This deal, if it would happen, would create a US grocery giant, according to people familiar with the matter. So, so funny, you were like, darn it. Yes, I'm so frustrated because this was one of my decliner's Kroger, but shares are now higher by more than 1%. It's funny because I looked at them too because Albert Sins is rallying big time. So, it's one of my gainers, but I looked at Kroger to see what kind of market reaction. So, at some point investors are either, first of all, it's either getting caught up in the market, moved to the upside or investors are saying, you know what, this consolidation of two supermarket giants, maybe this could be a good thing for the acquirer as well as obviously the target. Kroger was down earlier. So, and it only recently went higher and it's only up by about 1% so it's underperforming the market. But still interesting that the acquirer, right? Yeah, usually it's lower and that's what it was earlier today, even when the benchmarks were higher. Yeah, so I think it's kind of interesting. I mean, soaring food prices are a key driver behind inflation in the US. Well, industry consolidation has given top players in the space much greater market share. We'll have to see whether there could be political and regulatory hurdles for this kind of tie up as politicians blame corporate greed for higher prices. Well, antitrust officials, I excuse me, tougher merger rules. So you don't know whether some of that might put into this or make it more difficult. We should know representatives or Albertsons and Kroger could not immediately be reached for comment. This potential deal though would be among the largest US retail transactions in years and the biggest US supermarket deal since the last time Albertsons changed hands. That was back in 2006. It was bought by Super Value, CVS Health Corp and a group of investment firms for about $9.8 billion. Kroger, by the way, is the number two grocery seller with a 9.9% market share. Albertsons is fourth with 5.7%. I believe a top-the-list is Walmart with about a 21% share. All right, you're listening and watching Bloomberg Business Week on this Thursday and this is Bloomberg Radio.

From Bloomberg World Hent queaters, I'm Charlie Petit, U.S. Stocks holding onto games out of the close here with the Dow, the S&P and Nesdek all advancing S&P on track to halt a six day selloff the S&P right now up 97. That is a gain of 2.7%. The Dow higher now by 873 points in advance of 3%. We've got NASDAQ up 242 points again there of 2.3%. Stocks came storming back from losses. Sparked by that hot CPI reading this morning on speculation the year-long selloff has potentially reached a bottom.

The key take away here we've got the Dow back above 30,000 30,000 91 up now by 3% S&P up 2.7%. I'm Charlie Palette that is a Bloomberg business flash. I'm ready to my call. I turn on the radio. How about you let me drive? Oh no no no no. Who's going to drive you home? Honey please I'll do the drive. Drive-o. This is me I want to drive. It's the question of the drive. This is the drive to the close. Now punk to me a thing. Well drive up. I'm going to go. I'm going to understand. We keep getting lots of emails and thank you everybody listeners in the Wall Street community and others who are saying here's what we think is going on. So we're going to continue track. We've got another voice to tell us what he thinks about the trade because we are definitely well off for those and big swings in the equity averages today. Big swings today. Dave Donnebidian is chief investment officer at CIBC Private Wealth Management. Dave joins us this afternoon on the phone from Baltimore. Dave good to have you back with us. How are you? Doin' a well. How are you? We're doing pretty well. We're trying to kind of scratch in our head. Heads here quite a bit thinking about today's equity trade. We had some great comments from Ira Jersey earlier giving us some insight into what's going on in the bond market. How do you look at things? Well you'd love to think this sharp turnaround was because everybody took a second look at the CPI report and said gee not as bad as we thought but we know that's not the case. The timing of the move late morning it was a rather violent turnaround to the upside.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2572,2022-10-13 19:52:38
14347," But we know that's not the case. And the timing of the move late morning, and it was a rather violent turnaround to the upside. And usually that suggests some kind of programmatic or algorithmic buying. So I think that's part of the story. Down six days in a row, a lot of the sentiment indicators show we were sort of at the extreme levels of bearishness, the bull bear ratio coming into the last couple of days is about as low as it ever gets. So they've just been an oversold market. OK, I mean, I'll take that as a good explanation as any. You don't sound like you got conviction behind it, though, Dave. I mean, does it feel, you know, it's funny. I just put out a Twitter poll. And I'm asking everybody, again, stock market bottoming. Are you tweeting during the show? I'm a multi-tasker. And the majority of responses say, no, it's not a bottom. Almost 53%, about 18% say yes, and about 30% say no idea. And I had hashtag volatility. So it is, what does a market bottoming look like? And can we say that the market bottoming that we are likely to see this time around is going to be same as what we've seen in the past? Because I do wonder how the pandemic and all the liquidity that was pumped into the market has kind of changes what it looks like. All right. Yeah, I don't think a day like this signifies a market bottom. Obviously, we had a really strong market from mid-June to mid-August, and it was just a bear market rally. But I think we're certainly closer to the end than the beginning of this bull market. And we've really identified three things that need to fall into place to feel confident that a new bull market can begin. And we're just sort of doing a progress. The first one is we need to see clear evidence that inflation is peaked and is on a downward trajectory. Safe to say we're not there yet. The second one is we need to see a downside surprise on expectations for the Fed funds rate. And that's kind of interesting after today because we're getting there. Our view has been that the Fed funds would need to go to 5% next year, which was way high on the consensus list. But that's about where the market is now. So we'll make it some progress. The third one is I think there needs to be a more realistic outlook for corporate profits. The current estimate still calls for an 8% increase in corporate profits next year. That's kind of magical thinking to me given the economic environment we're likely to see. So we actually, the funds counterintuitive. I think we actually need to see earnings estimates come down for us to feel that they're appropriately valued before we can really begin a new bull market. So we're away from anything. How much do earnings estimates have to come down in your opinion? Well, right now they're expected to be up about 8% versus this year, 2023 numbers. I think we'll be really lucky to be flat in 2023 versus 2022. And more likely slightly negative. So they need to come down another quality 8% to 10% to say, this is realistic. It's interesting to that you were talking about downside expectation on the Fed funds rate. And I'm looking at the warp function on interest rate probability, world interest rate probability for the United States. And we were just talking to Ira Jersey who thinks that pricing cuts that are being priced in right now by the markets, he thinks they're pricing it too early. In other words, that the Fed stops raising rates. He thinks it's going to be later rather than earlier. And he also says they're not pricing more cuts to come later on. I mean, do you trust market indicators right now at this point? I mean, here we have what? A 5% swing on the S&P and the NASDAQ today and the Dow excuse me. And yet the VIX comes down. I don't know how to explain that. I can't explain it either. I think in terms of the path for Fed funds, again, our view has been, they funds peak at 5%. Probably in the second quarter next year, the warp function, as you mentioned, is saying that's about what the market now thinks. But I think so.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2573,2022-10-13 19:56:41
14348," next year. The work function, as you mentioned, is saying that's about what the market now thinks. But I think that the missing piece may be that we go for a multi-month period where whatever the peak is, let's say it's 5% it stays there. And the Fed watches, you talk a lot of market participants and there's an assumption that the Fed is going to do their final rate hike at one meeting and the next meeting, they're going to start to lower rates. I don't think so. So I think we're going to be stuck at that rate for most of the second half of 2023 as well. What would you be buying in this environment? Well, I think the equity market, our advice generally has been to go slow in terms of putting money to work because as I said, we don't quite think where we're at the bottom of this fair market. We are focused mostly on dividend payers and in those companies that are still going to be able to grow their dividends through this difficult economic environment, defense contractors, infrastructure stocks, healthcare, or some of the areas. Small caps continue to be quite attractive on a valuation basis. Now, they're not going to be immune if we continue to be in a fair market environment that they may be what leaves us out when the bull market begins. Go ahead, Carol. No, go ahead, please. So Dave, Carol asked what you'd be buying. I want to know, I know you tried to explain when you'd be buying here, but in terms of time frame, how long are we going to be searching for a low here and just treading water in the S&P? I think for a couple more months, again, impossible to know exactly, but I think we've got a couple more months of this sort of sloshing back and forth and probably with a little bit of a downward bias. But as negative as we may be on the economic forecast, we're actually pretty positive about equity prospects for 2023. We're likely to see a recession begin probably sometime in the first half of 2023, but we know from long history that the stock market tends to bottom in the middle of the recession, sometimes even in the early stages of the recession, doesn't wait till the recession's over. So we do think things are falling in place for a better market for equity investors, but it may not be until next year. If you had to make a choice, US versus non-US, where would you go right now? Who? Short-term US, if you're a longer-term investor, non-US, you get truly inexpensive valuations. So I think with a one to three-year view, non-US. All right, well, good to know and certainly something to think about on a day where we're all trying to make sense of another volatile day with lots of swings. Dave Donnebidian, thank you so much. He's Chief Investment Officer at CIBC Private Wealth Management, joining us on the phone from Baltimore. So we've got just about two, almost two minutes, 40 seconds left in today's trading session. We are hovering near our best levels of the day when it comes to the equity trade. So what does that mean? We're up 2.6, almost 2.7% on the S&P 500, up to 859 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. That's good for almost a 3% gain. The NASDAQ also, it is up 2.3% in today's trade. But again, keep in mind that we were down more than 2% on each of these major averages earlier in the session. I know it's not the end of the week, Carol, but we're actually up over the last five days on the Dow in green and the green. That would be interesting to see if we end up higher. All right, folks, coming up next, we'll be joined by Bloomberg TV team for Beyond the Bell on Radio TV and YouTube. Beyond the Bell, Bloomberg's comprehensive cross-platform coverage of the U.S. market closed, darn it right now. And right now, we are two minutes away from the end of the trading day. Romain Bostic Caroline, hi, Taylor Riggs, counting you down to the closing bell and here to help take us beyond the bell. It's our global simal cast. We're joined right now by Carol Master and Tim Stenevich. We welcome our audiences across Bloomberg Radio television as well as on YouTube. A wild day, Carol. I mean, we started off deep in the red here on the markets, but I should point out the low on the day on the S&B 500 was at 9.33 a.m. So three minutes into this session, about two hours after that, we were in the green and right now, we're not far from the highs of the day. Yeah, pretty remarkable, right? We're really hovering and holding on to these gains that we've had and it was quite a swing. I've been looking at the bank sector, the KBW Bank index. It's up more than 5%. Let's not forget.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2574,2022-10-13 20:01:01
14349," as of the day. Yeah, pretty remarkable, right? We're really hovering and holding on to these gains that we've had and it was quite a swing. I've been looking at the bank sector, the KVW bank index. It's up more than 5%. Let's not forget. We're going to get big bank earnings, JP Morgan leading it off tomorrow, but a lot of enthusiasm ahead of those results and definitely some outperformance today. We talked big picture with Dave Donnebidi and the chief investment officer at CIBC Private Wealth Management. He said we're going to be sloshing around like this, like we've been doing for a couple more months back and forth in the S&P, but he's overall pretty positive about what equity looked like in 2023, even though we could see a recession, we could see the bottom of the S&P 500 in the early or middle part of that recession in the first half of next year. So overall classes have full form. Yeah, we're here in similar. Just got to get through March, right? Find some stability further out that echo. Sort of similar comments. We just had Lori Calvacina on over at RBC. Fresh off a revised note that she just printed hot off the press, looking at it down great now for the price target for this year. We're closer to 3,800 previous forecast were for 4,200. So Tim that really speaks to the sloshing around as we try to count down to this year end. Correlations break down there today. In fact, they work for once. Remain bonds go lower, stocks go higher. Yeah, interesting to see whether that sort of correlations are rather that sort of a decoupling to a certain extent, actually the old year going forward. We're getting the closing bells here in the market is the update pretty much all around the Dow Jones industrial average higher by more than 800 points or 2.8%. The NASDAQ composite higher by more than 200 points or 2.2%. And the S&P 500 going to close higher right around that 36, 69 level up about 92, 93 points or about 2.6%. The widest trading range that we've actually seen on the S&P 500 since January 24th, 194 points swing and that's the second highest swing that we've seen on the S&P 500 from peak to trough both on a point spaces and a percentage basis since the big breakdown back in March of 2020. Russell 2000 not to be left out of the party here up Carol by 2.4%. Yeah, I mean all in and if you dig a little bit deeper into the S&P 500, we're going to get into industry groups in just a moment, but the S&P 500 almost all the names 471 higher in today's session. That's good. That leads like what 30 for Tim. Yeah, it's probably I have to tell you he's been stewing years like I can't find any decliners. Sometimes you have to do it for me because Carol my day is also very easy. When you take a look at the sector winners and the sector losers, it is all green on the screen all day long. Let's start with summit. The big winners given this banner day. It's banks, it's energy, it's dividend financials. We talked a lot about the yields that are jumping banks are benefiting somewhat from that sprinkling in their technology hardware semiconductor, some of the software and services. Those are also catching a bit of about 3% as well. There were some I guess we'll call them losers. They're under performers. They're only out about one half of 1%. Even though they're in the worst performers column. It's food and staples and it's consumer durables. It's the retailers as well on this big inflationary day. All right, let me get to some of the gainers. I had so much to choose from, but I did go to bio. J. Where did Rubbin end? Give me a hard day today. All right, bio gin top in the S and P 500 NASDAQ 100 a stifle upgrading it to buy from hold saying skepticism surrounding its new Alzheimer's drug seems over done. They set a new price target of 299. It closed at 269 in change. But remember at the end of September, bio gin rallied what almost 50% after some key clinical trial data came out showing its Alzheimer's therapy slowed the regression of the drug of the disease. But nonetheless, that's stifle call giving another boost to bio gin today. Domino's we talked about it. We know why this stock up 10% in today's session, top of the S and P 500. It wasn't mixed quarter, but the US Comp Sales top the average analyst estimates. So better than some had fear. At least that's the words that city used. And then Albertsons, let's go there because we could see maybe potentially a big tie up in the supermarket space rallying. According to people familiar with the matter, Kroger said to be in talks with a tie up with Albertsons. If so, it would create a US grocery giant Albertsons up 11%. Well, yeah. Well, the key word there is if so, there was actually a great note out by Morgan Stanley, a send me and gutman talking about the potential animal trust issues how that they might be up against, particularly with this administration. Yeah, we'll see what happens. All right. All right, let's go to the decliners. Slim pickings, as you mentioned, and actually Taylor, you did a lot of the work for me earlier, talking a little bit about consumer discretionary.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2575,2022-10-13 20:05:42
14350," Yeah. Alright, let's go to the Decliners slim pickings as you mentioned and actually Taylor, you did a lot of the work for me earlier talking a little bit about consumer discretionary stocks being at the bottom right here. Amazon down three tenths of 1% weighing on the S&P 500 also at see finishing the day down by 9.3% among the categories to and consumer discretionary. And then rounding it out, we got match group down at a record low today. Down 5% people stop daily. I don't know. You know, we're going to have to wait to find out details unless they do any sort of pre-announcement because we're not getting earnings. We're all married until the first of November. Oh, meanwhile, I'm totally missed on a commodity's front. Everyone just walked away from that. You're like, OK, you're married. Bye. I mean, let's go. Move it. I don't, don't bring our partners into this. OK. Wow. Can you bring candy into the situation? Did you see that candy prices leapt about 13% in the inflation report? Let's talk about some other commodities because candy is a commodity in my household. We're currently seeing Brent crude up 2%. In fact, commodities across the board had a good day where a higher on the Bloomberg commodity index and natural gas at more than 4%. Look, if you thought your inflation and your pressures were going somewhere, not so. If you're looking at all prices back at $94.65 on Brent, we're up at 89 on WTI crude. So managed to get about to the moment. That is perhaps US dollar does roll over somewhat. And we see strengthening across the board. Maybe some of the injection of risk on attitude came a little bit in the UK in the last bit of trade. We saw the sterling up. What? Strengthening 2% in terms of cable levels. We're seeing the likes of US UK bond markets. Actually, you've outperformed the bank of England. Really tries to ride to the rescue here. And most notably, there's talk about a U-turn coming from the government in terms of some of those tax policies. We're looking at the Euro Strengthening. Some tens of percent, as I say, the Bloomberg dollar index off by 4% to 10%. And look at that. The 10-year gill, as we see, yields down 23 basis points, Taylor. It was another story here of price lower yield higher. And a huge rate of change kind of day, Carol. The two-year yields, we've definitely wiped out the year to date highs. Now, looking at a two-year yield, the highest we haven't seen since August of 2007, you jump 19 basis points on the day up to a 448. As really many are now thinking in terminal rate of closer to 5% is now the goal. Just around it out, a 10-year bond auction, I think, that came today decent on the 30s as well. 10-year yields, the highest now since 2010. So you're really getting some of these multi-decade highs. Yeah, and maybe that's why banks spiked overall, or maybe there's expectations. I find it's interesting that J.P. Morgan I think was up 5% or 6% here on a day where you had J.P. Diamond come out with some concerns about the economy, but those stocks really riding high in today's session. One interesting thing though about some of those comments, not just from him, but from a lot of folks. And I think we kind of touched on it at the top here, and also with our previous television guest, Alori Calvacena, this idea here that while there is going to be a lot of pain over the next few months, there is general consensus right now that maybe by the time we get to the end of 2023, things will maybe be a little bit more right-size. And I feel like some people are maybe looking all the way ahead to the second half of next year as a reason to justify some of the valuations out there today. I'm still trying to understand the position the consumers in right now, and that's what I'll be listening to when we get bank earnings in the coming days, and then also next week as well. Because you get news from dominoes like we got today, and we got the news from Pepsi like yesterday. And I'm wondering if this is people Pepsi for the dominant. I know, so I'm wondering if they're trading down, right? Actually, the domino CEO had some interesting commentary about being concerned about delivery in an inflationary environment saying, okay, well, delivery could struggle because of tip, but carryout could actually see more so. Just in the past few days, so you get that sort of generally upside out of Pepsi and dominoes. We heard from LVMH, we said people at that end are doing well here. What about in the middle? What about airline still doing well? Delta, maybe. Yeah, maybe. Signal there that people are still willing to be doing traveling. I thought in the inflation data is meant to be showing the armability of transport costs are actually coming down a little bit. Yeah, interesting. Do you figure we're going to get retail sales tomorrow as well? Yeah, we'll give some other costs. Thank you. Okay, you're welcome. You'll get my bill. Alright, we got to wrap guys. We'll be back again, cross-platform coverage, radio TV, YouTube. We will count you down again, same time, same place tomorrow. You're listening to Bloomberg Business Week with Carol Maser and Bloomberg Quick Takes Tim Stenevig on Bloomberg Radio.

I want to see with JP Morgan. Jamie Diving though said a lot. There's just a lot on the terminal already. Brian Moynihan, we had this story coming out on Wednesday and he said the American consumer is in good shape. That's what I was talking about. That's what I was talking about. That's what I was talking about. That's what I was talking about. That's what I was talking about. That's what I was talking about. That's what I was talking about. You have people still able to jump from one job to another job which we know is the best way for people to get a raise. We do still have an economy where there are more jobs available for people who are looking for them. We're at the time of year where I think people start to think about compensation and ask for raises. Still tightly, my market. Still tightly, my market. That's why it's going to be great to hear from the banks about what people have in their cash accounts. What are they spending on credit cards? Are they putting stuff? Are they paying their credit cards on time? Here's what Moynihance had. The consumers basically have more money in their accounts by multiples than they did pre-pandemic. This was at the Institute of International Finance Annual Membership Meeting. This was on Wednesday in DC. Here's more of his quote. Their earning more money, their credit quality is as high as it's ever been. They have more excess capacity. It makes you think. Because we're in an environment where inflation is higher than it's been in the last 40 years. We're not seeing that come down. We're all experiencing higher prices, but we're still paying for things. So we'll see what the retail sales data system are. What are we seeing? Is that inflation adjusted though? I don't know. I don't think it is. Okay. But still, it'll be. Hey, I dish it back, okay? You're allowed to give it back. The Twitter versus to me. Come on. Yeah, they're saying you're going to hold you hard on me. Just a little. When Katie grifles away, you know, and she can't give me a hard time on our crypto show, you have to step in. I do. I do. I do. I do. We'll see what they have to say. And of course, you'll have all of the information you need right here on Bloomberg. Let's get to world and national news into our 991 newsroom in Washington DC. Hey, Nancy. Thanks, Tam. The House Committee investigating last year's attack on the U.S. Capitol is issuing a challenge for former President Trump. Members want him to come in and testify about the attack. And they've unanimously approved a resolution to subpoena Trump. Memberswoman Liz Cheney offered the resolution. We must seek the testimony under oath of January 6th Central Player. Cheney says the vast weight of evidence presented by the committee has shown nothing would have happened without Trump. The Supreme Court has rejected former President Trump's plea to step into the legal fight over the FBI search of his Florida estate. The Justices do not otherwise comment in turning away Trump's emergency appeal to allow a special master to review the classified documents that were taken. The Justice Department had argued that Trump had no legal interest in what were clearly government records. We're getting the White House's reaction to another hot reading on inflation, the last one before the midterm elections. President Biden put out a statement saying progress is being made, but inflation remains a global problem. We spoke with top White House economic adviser Brian Deese. The United States is in a better position than virtually any other country to address this challenge and do what is necessary to bring prices down without having to give up all of the economic gains that we have made. National Economic Council Director Brian Deese. One positive side to inflation is that social security benefits are going up 8.7 percent next year. The cost of living adjustment, or COLA, is the biggest increase in 40 years. It'll amount to about $140 a month.

And you need to figure out ways to get that next trillion dollars in market cap. Secret stalling, or you're just tapping into your universe and giving them more services. Well, it's a good question. And more services that make it a stickier ecosystem. Correct. So you're guaranteed to buy another product from Apple. I mean, in my house, when it comes to devices, it's become very sticky. But are you going to open a high yield savings account with Apple? I do Apple Pay already. I do too, but that's like, you know, I know. You don't have to sign up for that. You just set your credit cards in your phone. Yeah, I don't know. Should we tell everyone what we're talking about? Yes. It's been a full minute. All right, so here we go. Sorry. Apple card users will be able to open the new high yield savings account and have their daily cash automatically deposited into it with no fees. Love that. No minimum deposits. Love that. And no minimum balance requirements. Apple saying this in a statement today. Daily cash refers to the rewards that card users generate through their purchases. The move builds on existing credit card partnerships between the two companies. The Wall Street Titan has pushed in recent years to expand its offerings for consumers. Though the effort has been dogged by cost overruns and missed profitability goals. We talked about that with Shree earlier this week. For Apple, though, Goldman remains a key partner even as the tech company works to shift more of its financial services offerings in-house. So is it just rewards? Or is it real money that you're putting? Daily cash refers to the rewards that card users generate through their purchases. So is that what you were just putting in? Yeah, but I would imagine you can also put more than just your daily cash. I'm not positive about that. That's not clear to me. All right. Stand TBD maybe and just stay tuned. Because it does sound like Apple move it increasingly into the finance area. This is Bloomberg. Lord,, they are saying,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2578,2022-10-13 20:19:27

From Bloomberg World Hanquaters, I'm Charlie Pellet, C.P.I. Thursday at one point we had a two year low for the S&P 500 index and then a turnaround and stocks came roaring back today. The S&P 500 index ended with a gain of 92 points at 3669 up today by 2.6% the Dow back above 30,000, 30,000, 38 on the Dow up 827 points a gain today of 2.8%. As deck up 232 points higher by 2.2%. So stocks rallied after that hot inflation reading on speculation the year-long sell-off had potentially reached the bottom. 10 year-yield 3.95% 2 year-yield 4.47% spot-goal down $8.00 y'all's to 1665 Bitcoin today of 1.5% 19463 on Bitcoin and West Texas and West Texas, and immediate crude up 2.2% 8919 of arrows. So again recapping the Dow, the S&P and S&P all moving higher. S&P had a bank earnings tomorrow up 2.6%. I'm Charlie Pellet and that is a Bloomberg business flash. Thank you so much for that update, Charlie Pellet. Well, Bloomberg Invest has wrapped up but last night I ended up hosting a panel here. We discussed a lot about the wider adoption of crypto when it comes to asset managers and institutions. Carol, I'm not sure if you saw this news this week. Bank of New York, Melon launched a digital asset platform here in the US. It's the oldest bank in the US. And it's going to allow some clients to hold and transfer Bitcoin and Ether. So they're saying, you know, we'll be your crypto custodians. Establishment, right? Yeah, it's something that we talked about. This is exactly what we talked about last night on the panel here at Bloomberg HQ. Taking part, we're blue Machalari. She's head of digital strategy at T-Row Price. Punit Singh, the city's head of digital assets, institutional clients group. We also are from Bart Smith, the global head of digital asset strategy for Susquehanna International Group. Take a listen. What we're seeing this time is that even though we're in another crypto winter and we've obviously had this, you know, this big drop in market cap, the institutions are still committed and moving forward with plans and we saw the announcement yesterday from Bank of New York, Melon, which, you know, everyone knew that they were working on this. But the institutional commitment is there in a way that it wasn't in 2018 and I think it is no longer, depending on who you ask, it's no longer an existential question on, I'm like, well, will crypto cease to exist? Why is that institutional commitment here now and it wasn't here in 2018? I think that it was such a new technology and a new space and we saw, you know, what looked like it was a significant bubble or run up. And when the bubble burst and we, like, the floor back then in 2018 was like, we're talking like 6,000, like, as a price point for Bitcoin, so it was a huge drop. And I think, you know, a lot of people who were already skeptical said, okay, this is it, like, you know, crypto.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2579,2022-10-13 20:22:55
14354," I guess a price point for Bitcoin, so it was a huge drop. And I think a lot of people who were already skeptical said, OK, this is it. Like, crypto is going to cease to exist. I think that institutions and the market more broadly has seen the way in which I guess I think it's largely driven by retail and by have embraced this and continue to stick with it. And I think that there's a real generational piece that people are starting to recognize as well. Bart, jump on in here because you started in the current position that you're in, which is Global Head of Digital Assets Strategy at Susquehanna, December of 2021. So right as the air was started to come out, what were the conversations that you guys were having about sticking with this versus saying, wait a second, this might not be something we should do? So I was involved in kind of the 2016-2017 phase. The firm has been involved in Bitcoin, particularly for a long time, mostly just buying it proprietary in kind of 2014, 2015. We did have a build out in 2017 of a desk that was providing liquidity for retail platforms and some limited institutional customers, the limited few that they were there. And really, what we've seen is this infrastructure being built out. So there's a lot of institutions, pensions, and diamonds foundations who don't want to or can't practically use crypto-native infrastructure. So even something like Coinbase, which is a very well-known name, it's listed on the equity market. If you work at a pension or you work at an endowment, getting that on as a custodian is like a hurtly in task. And so when you see firms like Bank of New York and Melon and State Street, with BlackRock announcement that they're going to have it on the Aladdin program, it's the vast majority of institutions used as a critical piece of infrastructure. I think that's the piece that in Blues Commons is different now. I've wanted to invest in it. But I don't want to have to set up new vendors and new fixed-line connectivity. I don't want to have to get new software. I can't use a non-brand name custodian. And all of those solutions, while they haven't fully fixed themselves, you can see it on the horizon of that infrastructure being usable. But where's the drive coming from? Is it coming internally? Or is it coming from clients externally? Like clients, clients, and then, of course, their clients want access to it. Is that what it is? I think that there's, I think you're seeing from our perspective. Because we obviously trade in the spot markets. We trade in equities. But the kind of bread and butter of Susquehanna is derivatives, futures and options. And you're seeing a world where when you get to a real, bonafide prime brokerage solution, where I can not only cross-marge in my collateral for different crypto products by asset class and by investment type, so options and futures where in the equity markets or traditional markets, they're all fungible. Now you're talking about real scale. And you're seeing real institutions who can do strategies. And it has liquidity that they would need for a brevon-hower to run a macro fund or a DE Shaw. And these brand names, they're not going to mess around in an asset class where they can get $50 or $100 million of liquidity when they need $1 billion of liquidity. And there's partners out there now, like Susquehanna, who can provide that. And so as these infrastructure things continue to get built out, you will see the types of strategies that people can to run right now are growing. You just heard from Bart Smith with Susquehanna, Blue Machalari of T-Roll Price. Penuiting the city was also taking part. You can catch the full panel and more from some of the world's top financial executives. You can do that by going to BloombergLive.com and searching for our Bloomberg Invest event. That was just a taste of the panel that I moderated last night. It was about the wider adoption of crypto among asset managers and institutions. The first question that I asked to everyone after asking them if they all had crypto, which they do. I asked everyone in the audience to raise the hand if they had crypto as part of their personal portfolios and pretty much everybody in the room, including all three of those folks on stage. Say yes. Yeah, I mean, all the handshot up. You know your crowd, right? They're interested in it. So that was really interesting. That's true. I asked Blue though about whether the latest crypto crash should be looked at differently from the downturn of 2018, the last crypto winter, because she spent the last five years at a crypto first hedge fund. And? She said it is different. Yeah, I mean, she said, look at all the institutional involvement that you're seeing right now. I mean, you go back how many years right now, everybody?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2580,2022-10-13 20:27:09

Let's go over to Charlie Pellet, though, because we've got to catch up on all the after hours action. Indeed. And let me focus first on what happened on Wall Street today.

Look at the S&P up 92 points today, a gain of 2.6 percent, the Dow up 827 up 2.8 percent, and we had NASDAQ also roaring back from losses up 232, a gain there of 2.2 percent, so the Dow back above 30,000, at 30,000, 38 today. The S&P 500 index is snapping a six day selloff 10-year yield 3.95 percent, 2-year yield 4.46 percent, spot-cold 16-60-60 ounce down 4-10s of 1 percent, while West Texas, NVIDIA crude up 2.3 percent, 89-25 of barrels. So what about the turnaround on the CPI Thursday? Dave Dottapenian is chief investment officer at CIBC Private Wealth Management. He was our guest right here on Bloomberg Business Week. The timing of the move late morning, and it was a rather violent turnaround to the upside, and usually that suggests some kind of programmatic or algorithmic buying. So I think that's part of the story. Netflix shares up 5.3 percent today. Netflix will introduce and add support at plan on November 3rd, charging $7 a month for a subscription. RealMata Therapeutic shares plunged today after experimental treatment for major depressive disorder failed to show a benefit in a late-stage, critical trial.

Our next guest, but years working at several iconic Wall Street firms, former Goldman Sachs managing director, former senior managing director at Bear Stearns, over in London before that Lehman and Chase Manhattan, Nomi Prins is an economist. She's also an author and an investigative journalist. She's also the author of several books, including her newest permanent distortion. How the financial markets abandoned the real economy forever. She joins us live in the Bloomberg Interactive Brokers Studio this afternoon. Nomi, congratulations on the new book. It just came out on October 11th, so it's been out for a couple days. We're going to talk about the book. We got a great chunk of time with you, but given your background, your role as an economist, we got to get your take on what's happening in the markets right now, and what's happening in the economy. I mean, a wild day on Wall Street where we saw markets open down more than 2 percent and then end up finishing the day close to session highs. What's going on here? Mass insanity in the markets. I mean, what's happening right now is that the markets don't know how to process whether they're going to have sort of cheap money forever, whether the Fed's going to go back to sort of what it used to be like, whether it's going to continue to high grades, how to actually interpret every little teeny piece of data. So there's no idea if forward-looking analysis in the markets right now. It's all reactive. And that's something that's very new to the period that we're living in right now versus when I was on Wall Street when it was like, okay, this is what rates are. They go up, they go down. They're sort of a balance. But by the time we've gotten to this point, where rates have been at zero for so much of the last 14 years. And now they're sort of moving up. But the Fed is still sitting on a book of almost $9 trillion worth of assets. And all the central banks around the world are in similar kind of positions. It's really hard to figure out where there is actually value in sectors, in names, and in the specifics of the market. So a lot of this is more knee-jerk reactive than necessarily forward analysis. How should we think about the financial markets? Is it the real world, the real economy? It isn't. And this is part of the process that we've been in since really 2008. And a little bit before that, I mean, we got into 2008 because in the beginning of the 2000, 2000, 2001, we had rates very low. We had mortgages going crazy, we had a subprime crisis, and we got this whole quantitative easing period that we are still living in right now. And we're not at the back of this by a long shot. We're like in the middle of potentially, you know, queue forever, even if books come down by a little bit. And so what does that mean? I mean, it's a real economy. Doesn't necessarily get the benefit of financing the same way it used to get the benefit of financing in the 60s and the 70s and the 50s when we were building roads in highways. Because it's come second to money being created quickly, being leveraged excessively and flowing into financial assets that are quicker to turn around.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2582,2022-10-13 20:38:45
14357," Because it's come second to money being created quickly, being leveraged excessively and flowing into financial assets that are quicker to turn around. So wait, can I ask you something? So the sophistication of markets and how we can trade it and slice and dice it, is that why you're saying it doesn't? It's just a whole different game on Wall Street, versus years ago, decades ago, when it really was reflective of what was going on in the economy. Well, there was certainly more information that was coming from the direct economy through companies that were involved in creating different components of the economy, and being more directly related to individuals. Right. And now, of course, we have much more technology, much more analysis. We also have far more leverage. And so we combine the technological leverage with the financial leverage. We have this complete disconnect between, again, money going into the economy and sticking around and being used for longer term capital investments and creation and all of that relative to, I'm here now, I'm there now. I'm trading on momentum, I'm trading on technological factors, I'm trading on computer science, and I'm not necessarily trading on value and the long-term view. You said something that makes me think about the role that government takes, because when you think about big infrastructure projects in the 1950s and 1960s, you think about the post-World War II boom here in the United States, the building of Levittown, for example, all of these shovel ready projects. That's something that you need to have widespread agreement on when it comes to putting that up. You know, implementing them. We don't have that right now. It's all a joke, it's always infrastructure week, right, in Washington, and nothing ever gets done. Is that a big obstacle to kind of getting past where we are, the financialization of the economy? That's a really good question, and it's true. In the 50s and 60s, we had a connection in politics that related to the connection of what was needed to be done in the country. The building of those highways, the building of the space program, the building of permanent lasting features. We even had that in the 1930s, the Hoover Dam was built in the middle of the Great Depression, because it was a process that had started and had financing, and it retrieved that financing throughout the all the years that it took to build it. So there's a lot of longer term thinking and longer term capital commitment in those days, not just from the direction of Washington. I had that too, but also from the direction of private industry, from Wall Street, from companies throughout the country. There was a collaboration that has really become disintegrated now. We can't even build a tunnel between Manhattan and New Jersey. We can't. We haven't been able to do that. And there's an incredible need for it. Sit tight. We could do some news, but we want to come back and talk a little bit more. Because I also do wonder, something Tim and I talk a lot about, the role of kind of private markets and private capital, where there's so much going on, and I feel like it adds to the distortion that we're seeing that you're talking about. We're going to come back with Naomi Prins. She's an author, she's an investigative journalist, spent a lot of time at the well-known Wall Street firms, Over in London as well. Her book, Permanent Distortion, How the Financial Markets Abandoned the Real Economy Forever. And I feel like this fits into so many things we talk about. Let's get to world and national news for that. We turn to Nancy Lyons. She's standing by right now in her 99-1 studios in Washington, DC. Hey, Nancy Hens. Thanks, Tim. President Biden says, even though inflation is still high, his economic policies, well, help the U.S. handle the uncertainty. The Labor Department says the consumer price index shows the rate of inflation last month was 8.2 percent down slightly from the month before, but prices for virtually every good and services higher than it was last year. Because of my economic plan, we are better positioned than any other major economy in the world to whether the challenges have come through this in the stronger country. We've created nearly 700,000 manufacturing jobs just in the last 19 months. Biden spoke in California at an event to promote his infrastructure plans in Los Angeles. While the midterm race for control of Congress is getting tighter. A new CNN poll shows 50 percent of voters prefer the Democratic candidate in their congressional district compared to 47 percent for the Republican. In competitive districts, though, it shifts the other way. 48 percent of likely voters prefer the Republican candidate in those tight races. 43 percent go for the Democrat. The poll finds 32 percent of voters think Republicans have a clear plan to solve the country's problems. 28 percent say the same about Democratic candidates.

Thank you so much for that update, Nancy Lyons. Tim Stenevich and Carol Massive were live in the Bloomberg Interactive broker studio in New York. We've got NoMePrinze with us. She's an author and investigative journalist. She's got the new book out permanent distortion how the financial markets abandoned the real economy forever. She was a managing director at Colpin Sack. She ran the international analytics group as a senior managing director at Bear Stearns. She was a strategist at Lehman Brothers. She was also at Chase Manhattan Bank before that. She also was on Senator Bernie Sanders Federal Reserve Reform Advisory Council. NoMePrinze, what I want to talk to you is about how you made the transition from banking into becoming an author and investigative journalist. Like, why did you leave the industry? Did you run from the industry? No, just kidding. 9-11, how two things happened from the industry. 9-11 happened. I was at Goldman Sachs, Cornwall Office, 29th floor the whole thing that was going on at the time. And at the time, also there was a lot of corruption that was happening on the corporate side. That was sort of when Enron was breaking. There was some World Com was breaking. There was a lot of tension in terms of what the reality of balance sheets were, what the role of Wall Street was, and of course, what we found it to be in all those corporate scandals. And I was seeing a lot of that and getting sort of, you know, very disgusted with a lot of that. And then, of course, 9-11 happens and sort of, you know, add one and one, get two and two is basically, I need to go and I need to talk about this stuff. And so a lot of the first writings I did were about what was going on in terms of the corporate scandals, telecom sector, the energy sector, and Wall Street's connection. And I wound up taking that route into my first book, Other People's Money, the corporate Monking of America, which also talked about the energy of Goldman Sachs as well as banking industry and everything that was going on there. Because I thought, at the time, nobody was talking about it. I mean, at the time, we couldn't even talk about being inside Wall Street. It's not like today where everybody's talking sort of about everything all the time. It wasn't like that. It was very much a sort of more secretive sort of situation. And I needed to talk about it. So I needed to be outside to talk about inside. I was going to ask you if it's better, but I've only got 20 seconds left here. So maybe we'll do it on the other side. You do yes or no. Is it better today? Yes or no? Or quickly, but 10 seconds. It's not. It's more confusing today. More confusing. All right. We're going to continue this conversation. Noee Prince is going to stay with us. We're talking about her new book, Permanent Distortion, and this is Bloomberg Business Week.

There's a Bloomberg business flash. All right, Charlie. Thank you so much. Want to get right back to Nomey Prins author and investigative journalist. I'm going to give you a little hard because her background is incredible. She's got a new book out. Permanent distortion. How the financial markets abandoned the real economy forever. Permanent distortion. Why is it permanent? Excellent question. It was not taken lightly because I like words as well being an author. It's because in the wake of the financial crisis, when we went down to 0 percent interest and we created 4.5 trillion dollars worth of money from no or to take debt out of the market at the time, US debt in general was 9 trillion dollars. 4.5 trillion equivalent was on the Fed's books. Some of that was mortgages to reduce the revenue and the rest of that was mortgages to reduce the revenue. Then we had a double down situation that happened in 2020. So the period in between there was a..................................................................",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2585,2022-10-13 20:52:03
14360," There's four and a half trillion equivalent was on the Fed's books. Some of that was mortgages, to register, it was all connected. Then we had a double down situation that happened in 2020. So the period in between, there was a lot of speculation, when will the Fed raise, raise, etc. They raised in 2015 markets were insanely negative on that whole prospect. They didn't raise again until 2016 and then sort of bits along the way to 2019, turned around in 2019 and to 2019 because Wall Street collateral wasn't working between Wall Street and its own customers. The repo markets were falling apart. So the Fed turned around and created more QE, brought rates down again. Talked about as if it was related to the economy, but in fact it was related to liquidity on Wall Street, which by the way right now we're going to see a lot of problems I think coming into tomorrow's numbers. But besides that, when we got into 2020, just a few months after that, and the pandemic hit, that's when there was an overdrive factor. And that's when the Fed went to $9 trillion from at the time 4.1, but effectively doubled in a few months what it took a number of years to get to the first time. Other central banks around the world followed and what became just a sort of help which was enormous to begin with became a permanent artificial cushion to the markets. And even right now, even with rates coming up now and all the speculation with Fed's totally changing and it's going to be this inflation hawk, even though it can't fight it out of the inflation, it says it's trying to fight. It doesn't actually change the fact that this cushion is underneath all the financial markets. And that's why we have days like today where the market basically spans 1500 points in a day on the doubt that's not normal, that's not healthy. That's related to the speculation versus this permanent idea of this distortion between where the money goes to the real economy, how it gets to the markets and where it stays. It's not a question of blaming the Fed. It's a question of the Fed is responsible for creating the cushion. So I blame the cushion, the Fed created the cushion. So in that respect, yes, I do blame the Fed. But you have to look at the bigger picture. Not just what is the Fed doing now with interest rates. That obviously is creating uncertainty in the markets. And it's certainly oppressing people trying to get mortgages right now, which are twice as expensive as they were six months ago. And that's a really quick change if you're trying to budget and you're at the bottom level of your own sort of the economy. But this is more about the fact that that cushion exists. It's not just the Fed. It's the Bank of England. It's a European Central Bank. It's a bank, it's a global Central Bank network that has basically created this outside source of capital in order to be there when it deems necessary. And that uncertainty about what's necessary is now what's permeating in the markets. And it's a reason why capital can't go outside those markets when they're going up or when they're going down to long term projects and to the foundational economy to the same extent as before. When did this start? I mean, would you say that this was the in the wake of the great financial crisis? Or was this happening earlier? It was happening a bit earlier, but quantitative easing to the extent that we saw it. We see it now. And in doubling since the financial crisis was a post financial crisis phenomenon. We had a situation where the entire banking system was so over leveraged and all of the customers of all the overleveraged mortgage product were facing potential margin calls and everything else out the whole system from the top on all the way to the outskirts. And so from that point on, when the Fed decided, OK, Ben Bernanke just won a Nobel Prize for not noticing this happened in 1927 and 1929, because we had a home bubble then too. But the point being that this created, is this momentum in the fabrication of money that had not existed ever before. Japan kind of did it for a while, did it since the 90s, but nowhere near to the same extent that the Fed did it, and that every other central bank in the world followed. And so again, this became a global situation where the global cost of money was zero. And the global cushion continued to grow. And that happened in the wake of the financial crisis. So as a result, those who have access to that cushion basically and that velocity of money have really benefited in a big way. And hence, we have this massive gap in society that just gets bigger and bigger in terms of wealth. That's right, because obviously if you're in the market and you can leverage yourself into the market, that's whether you're a wealthy individual, the CEO of a company that buys a lot of its own shares or has the benefit of other leverage coming into that particular company or any of the financial markets. Those have this buzz up. Again, now there's a little bit of uncertainty. But for the most part, they have had the acceleration, I would say, the velocity of money. So basically, there's this tush of money going into those areas and therefore money has choices. But money goes, and I talk about this in the book, and then this, and that, is very卡通, so the producer or an engineer and with resources Sunday,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2586,2022-10-13 20:56:16
14361, velocity of money. So basically this is the swoosh of money going into those areas and therefore money money has choices. But money goes and I talk about this in the book that the if you visualize where money is going money is is flooding into the place where it can go most easily right and where it can stay most easily. We can have the greatest impact and that means that anyone using it anyone leveraging and anyone that has access to it gets that benefit and anyone who doesn't simply doesn't and as a result that gap. We're speaking with Nomi Prins author and investigative journalist she's got the new book permanent distortion how the financial markets abandoned the real economy forever. Nomi how can banks better serve the real economy? Banks can look at their balance sheet in terms of where their small business loans are they can look at where they're paying people for the interest on their savings account they cannot charge ridiculous fees relative to the amount of money that people have with accounts right now for example. You know what I'm not going to do. But you know the incentives aren't aligned for this right the incentives aren't aligned for this exactly so that's the problem. So why would you so so in 2015 I have this conversation out the Fed in 2015 I have this conversation as I'm saying at the Fed in in front of the Fed the IMF and it's central bankers who were involved in this in this you know the animal meeting they have there and then this the topic was why isn't Wall Street happening in half the main street and I just got up and I said because you you're not making them I mean they basically have the benefit of all of QE all of the loans all of the help all of the access to 0% money and you're wondering why they're not sort of just just giving it out to sort of little people that hold accounts with them I mean it's not really rocket science they're not because they don't have to. I know I get the argument for why they should because of the assistance they got from the government right and there are banks as you know you worked at Lehman they're not around anymore right I mean there are banks that are are survived because of it but I do wonder as publicly held companies they have got to constantly think about returns to investors and that's why I think I'm not pointing fingers or anything but I mean that's why they potentially don't do that and we've just got about 30 or 40 seconds left here so is there is you talked about I don't know what's the the final take away for our audience well the final take of me is that when I say permanent I actually mean permanent I don't think there's going to be a period where the Fed's book is going to go back down to the 800 billion dollars it was before the financial crisis of 2008 maybe it dimples from like nine trillion to six seven trillion but I mean it's still massive and then again you multiply that throughout the world so what does that mean that means going forward we're going to have more and more of these volatile days to this magnitude we're going to have more of these crises bubble crises bubble so it's not necessarily going to be one big thing it's going to just be a volatile scenario because there's a permanent distortion of where money is created where it goes who gets it and who doesn't which is in the real economy it could be always a Christian out there floating and it's massive um no me come back please no my friends author investigative journalist so much permanent distortion how the financial markets abandon the real economy forever um great conversation if you missed it check out our podcast feed uh on the Bloomberg.com that's it we got to run crazy day we'll see you tomorrow right back,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2587,2022-10-13 21:00:15

I'm Emily Cheng, I'm Francisco and this is Bloomberg Technology coming up in the next hour. What's old is new. And that goes for Netflix, which is starting to look a lot more like traditional cable, as it announces its ad-supported plan to launch in November details this hour. Plus, now you can turn any credit or debit card into a Bitcoin rewards card. Thanks to the rewards up, slowly. We'll talk about the company's mission to make Bitcoin more accessible to all with CEO Alex Adelman and investor Alexis O'Hanian. And Apple card users can see rewards automatically deposited into new accounts thanks to its extended partnership with Goldman Sachs. We'll talk about Apple's continued FinTech push. All that in a moment, but first stock surging roaring back from that sell-off spark by hot inflation numbers. How to tech fare? Well, our ad-load-low has been watching it all day. Ed, what did you see? Yeah, I mean, it was a wild ride. The hot CPI or inflation print from September really reinforced this idea that the Fed is going to be aggressive or remain aggressive with its rate hike path. But the market kind of stayed sanguine when we look at volatility data like the CBOE VIX or VIX index. You know, the market didn't seem to panic and it climbed surging back on the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500 we saw swings of more than 5% 5% to 6% and 1.0% the Nasdaq 100 was down by 3%. And if you allow me, and let's get technical, let's get technical together and look at this Bloomberg terminal chart. Because it was interesting. Technical levels did seem to play a key role here. At one point, the benchmark S&P 500 was down back below 50% below its post-pandemic rally. You know, at their 3500 level market, that seems to trigger some program buying. And what I'm saying in other words is the Algos kicked in to rebalance the market. And that was a key factor this Thursday. So let's dig into tech and how tech faired here because it's been an absolutely dreadful few days.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2588,2022-10-13 21:04:26
14363," Thursday. So let's dig into tech and how tech faired here because there it's been an absolutely dreadful few days. Yeah, a few days and a few weeks right while rates have been pushing higher, you know, the Nasdaq 100, the NYSE Fang Plus index, the Philadelphia semiconductor index, you name it, they've all kind of underperformed the broader market. In this case, we're looking at the S&P 500 as the benchmark for U.S. equities and we know the story right, higher rates discount the present value of future profits, particularly for corners of the tech market that a pre-profit or trade and stretch multiples, but there is debate out there about how tech fairs because when we think about the mega caps, for example, you look at the names like Microsoft and Google, they're down more than 30% year to date, really trailing the S&P 500, but there's also confidence that in a recessionary environment and if the Fed goes too far with rate heights, we do have a recession in that recessionary environment, mega cap tech fairs better because it has an entrenched market position, strong balance sheet. We're not seeing that play out in the market right now, but there is a feeling that if we do move towards the word recession in substantive terms, that you might see tech as a strong play. And we can't talk about markets without talking chips, obviously a huge week in the semiconductor industry so far and one that maybe they'd rather forget, but how are we trending? Yeah, so the Philadelphia semiconductor index or SOX was higher on Thursday after five straight days of declines. It's been really down troddenright. We've been talking all week about how there's a real slowdown in consumer electronics in the PC market. In other words, the end markets where those chips go into the latest news overnight was from TSMC, one of the leading fabs in the world that cut capital spending plans and that's a real signal to the world of tech that it's expecting a slowdown in demand for chip manufacturing. The other big story of course playing out is this ramp up intentions between the US and China, but we're on an upward trajectory at least for Thursday and as we've shown in the last couple of minutes on the screen, the SOX has really underperformed the broader market to date. The question is when do we bottom out and how much further does that slowdown in demand for the end markets for chips? How much further does that have to run? All right, Adla, thank you. Any time Netflix will introduce and advertise supported plan on November 3rd, charging a $7 a month for subscriptions. The streaming service hopes to attract price sensitive customers at a time when growth has plateaued joining us now. Chris Paul Mary, of course, who covers us cover Netflix in the entertainment industry. So how competitive, Chris, would you say this price tag is? Very competitive. You know, this was a lot lower than people anticipated. $7 a month is a dollar below what Disney pluses new ad-supported service is going to be a dollar below Hulu. $3 below the HBO Max ad-supported service. So this is really Netflix, you know, putting a stake in the ground and say we are here to get more customers out of this new plan. Talk to us about the bigger picture and, you know, how this will play out and, you know, what we've talked about is the sea of streaming services, you know, so many options out there in terms of where to get your content, you know, is it really this price that gives Netflix that much more of an edge? Well, this is a big moment in the evolution of streaming because, you know, when Netflix found to read Hastings at Lawton, you know, fought having ads on his service, he thought that, you know, not having ads was a big differentiator from traditional TV. And of course, it was, but we've now seen the whole industry evolve toward having various options, you know, Hulu, for example, has built a multi-billion dollar business with advertising and potentially that will be the same at Netflix. And so everyone now has these different tiers of plans, giving consumers the options. The irony is that the streaming business now looks a lot like traditional TV and unlike traditional TV, you can't even record the shows and then skip the ads. You're kind of going to force to watch the ads if that's the plan you choose. Our colleague, Luga Shaw has a new piece out in Bloomberg Business Week and the headline is Netflix's makeover is everything Ted Sarandos once hated. You know, you mentioned the word evolution, but you know,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2589,2022-10-13 21:08:53
14364," And the headline is Netflix's makeover is everything Ted Cerandos once hated. You know, you mentioned the word evolution, but you know, talk to us about just how different this is and sort of Ted Cerandos and read Hastings new vision here. There's so many ways the company is changing, you're changing because basically everybody copied it, you know, from Disney to Time Warner and that, everyone came out with streaming services. And so we're seeing, you know, not just the ad supported things that they read didn't want, but you know, they're cracking down on password sharing, which was for a long time, they let anybody, you know, share passwords. We're now seeing experimentation with the new Knives Out film is going to be in theaters for a week before it, a month before it comes to the streaming service. So we're seeing a lot of experimentation and changing in the old ways Netflix works and they have to change because you know, their subscribers were down in the first half of this year. Do you think competitors will make some moves as a result of what Netflix has announced here? And if so, what? Well, to some degree, you know, Netflix is playing catch up because a lot of the other folks have ad supported services. And so we're just, you know, we're seeing a real evolution of the streaming business. We're seeing a lot more price competition, a lot more offers and, you know, and all of these big media companies are using their traditional TV arms to promote their streaming services. They're putting some of their best shows on streaming first. So, you know, this is a major, major fight in the streaming wars for sure. So Chris, what's your outlook in terms of, you know, let's say where is the streaming industry a year from now? We've been talking about, you know, ESPN and potential M&A with sports betting. There's all of these, you know, potentially interesting and unique moves coming in the midst of a major market downturn, you know, and the streamers aren't going to be immune to that. No, and, you know, we've seen cutbacks in spending, and Netflix and a lot of the big companies. But it's very clear this is the way the industry's going. It's almost like shocking every week. We see no evolution, you know, NBC, for example, considering taking away an hour of prime time, you know, big shows dancing with the stars and big hit on the ABC forever, you know, now exclusively on Disney Plus, the Kardashians are only on Hulu, you know, so we're seeing this massive migration, you know, before our eyes, and that's not going to change. There is certainly going to be continued subscriber growth in streaming, and hopefully as the industry grows and rationalizes its spending, some profits as well. All right, Bloomberg's Chris Palmeray will keep following your reporting on this great migration. Thank you for your insights there. Another story that we continue to watch, meta has urged a judge to reject the FTC's attempt to block the company's acquisition of the virtual reality app within unlimited meta-sane the agency's claims about competition in the area are based on pure speculation.

14366," to save money, tend to do better in times of this kind of economic uncertainty. And so that that certainly factored into why we were so excited about lolly. And I think broadly, look, the big advantage to being an early stage investor, working with CEOs from the very start is no matter what the macro picture looks like, it is almost, it is, it is always a great time to be starting a company and almost more opportunistic during times of this kind of volatility uncertainty, because it really, it sobers up CEO to have to focus on making something that people genuinely need, genuinely want that have viable business models. And so in a way, I, you know, it's not that I look forward to these times, but I do think they bring out the best in new entrepreneurs who are solving real problems. And we have a lot of real problems that need solving. So we're still active. We're still busy investing. And obviously, I want to see this economy, you know, get its legs back under it, but I agree it's going to take time. What are you telling founders right now? You know, how are you telling them to navigate choppy conditions? I have a lot of keep, keep cash on hand, you know, focus on reducing burn and really isolate your focus of the company around not just growth at all costs, but, but real scalable growth, focus on things like revenue, focus on, it's not going to be about the story of how quickly or how much you grew in the next six months a year. It's about how much you were able to accomplish with the money you had. And ideally, to get yourself in a cash flow positive situation as soon as you can, because then you're ultimately controlling your own destiny. And it's not up to you. Or it's up to other investors, whether or not you get to the next round. And what's exciting is the companies that ironically, you know, don't need those outside sources of capital are often the ones that have the most luck fundraising during times like this. And, you know, we've really enjoyed seeing the trajectory of Lallie and have, have doubled out and excited to see if you're growing. Alex, talk to us about how many people are using Lallie, the demographics, and how they're actually using their rewards. Or are they holding their rewards? It's a great question. So we launched four years ago and we've already brought on over 500,000 users that are earning Bitcoin. These are across web with our Chrome extension and mobile with our new mobile app. So a lot of users where we are their first experience into crypto, and that's what we want to do. We want people, we want to teach people about Bitcoin, we want to teach people about the importance of this new world that we're entering into, and, you know, save people a lot of money in the process. Right now, you know, some of the most interesting statistics is that over 30% of our users are female. When I first, um, in 2018, when I first started Lallie with my co-founder, Matt, what we found was that less than 4% of crypto users were female. And so we're very proud to share that we're seeing a dramatic increase given the nature of all of our business. That's great to hear. Thank you for sharing that. Alexis, I'm curious for your outlook on crypto in particular as the market downturn continues. Bitcoin, for example, we're seeing slightly lower volume. Yes, less volatility, but the lower volume is kind of a red flag. What's your outlook for Bitcoin? And, and for the broader crypto market, you know, beyond startups and other places where you're investing? Well, look, I have, I have now been investing in building through multiple crypto winters. Uh, this is the time when the very best products are getting built when a lot of the, the charlatans and the hype have, have exited the building. And, and the folks who are left are the folks who are genuinely building and solving real problems. And so the next test for this next cycle for us to get to the next crypto spring, which I do think will come is really going to hinge on user experience. We, you know, we have an opportunity now to really expand the, the base of folks who are finding value in this technology. Uh, you know, Bitcoin rewards our one way. And I think what's so interesting about it is we're also talking about a net in the process of just having a lot of account. Basically being given your first crypto wallet.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2592,2022-10-13 21:21:50
14367," What's so interesting about it is we're also talking about a neck in the process of just having a lullaby count basically being given your first crypto wallet and through a really elegant user experience and e-commerce or even now brick and mortar commerce is something we all do. Here's some cash back it just happens to be in the form of a cryptocurrency Bitcoin and I really believe five, ten years out you know we're going to continue to see more cycles this is going to play itself out all over again but every single time we hit a new level of folks who are bought in, who have found utility, who have found value and I'm like I said I'm long term still very very excited there will continue to be volatility but this is the exact time to be building if you're a long term believer in the tech everything's everything's on sale right now and I think some great user experiences are going to get built in the next few years. So last quick question to you Alex then if lullaby is a gateway to this first wallet for so many new users more women users hopefully how are you playing out a market downturn a potential you know a lengthened crypto winter into lullaby's business how long does this last in your view? Yeah so you know as Alexis was saying you know businesses that save people money do very well in recessionary times our last company my co-founder and I's last company was acquired by Rakuten formerly e-bates which had its biggest growth years during the last recession so if we think you know if we can follow that that same path save people more money and bring on more incredible merchants continue to build new technology we're going to do very well through this recessionary time in this bear market because people are coming into Bitcoin with lullaby and getting it for free they don't have to risk you know investing in it they're just shopping as they normally would at their favorite merchants and getting it back so it really is a risk-free way of getting into crypto and continuing to dollar cost average in into Bitcoin. All right well we'll continue to track your progress lullaby CEO Alex Adelman and 7776 founder Alexis O'Hanian thank you both from crypto winter to spring potentially we'll see how long it takes okay coming up apple card users get ready to start saving details on the company's expanded partnership with Goldman Sachs next this is Bloomberg so",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2593,2022-10-13 21:26:03

The move building on the existing credit card partnership between these two companies joining us now with more who else but Bloomberg's Mark German. So what exactly have Apple and Goldman announced? What's new here? So if you have the wallet up on your phone, which all iPhone users do, and you have the Apple card, which is a collaboration on a credit card between Apple and Goldman Sachs, you will now be able to take your cashback rewards and put it into a new savings account built by Goldman in the wallet app so you can create or generate interest on those cashback rewards. Is this Apple card? Is this something that you think is going to be popular? I do. I think that this is going to be a entry-level free savings account built into your phone for many people. I don't think people are going to want to store a lot of money in this account, but the ability to generate interest based on your cashback savings, that's between 1 and 3%. Sometimes they have 6% deals on some Apple products. I think it's going to be interesting. Apple hasn't said what the interest rate is going to be on this account yet. Our comparison, Marcus, which is the consumer savings account, high yield savings account from Goldman right now, was 2.15% APY. I would imagine that Apple's will be around there as well. Yes, I do think this is a major push from Apple, and it just shows how far they're willing to go in financial services. So quickly, how does this fit into Apple's larger FinTech strategy? Yes, so they have been rebuilding their entire technical infrastructure, and this is a new piece of that. They have an Apple Pay Later service coming. They're working on another one with Goldman Sachs for longer term, higher priced installments, so it all fits together. Apple wants to own payments and basically create the iBank, and this is a key part of that. The iBank is coming. All right, Mark German, as always, thank you for bringing us your reporting. Appreciate it. Coming up, we're going to talk about the VC slowdown and just how much is sitting in dry powder on the sidelines at the moment. We're going to be joined by pitch book lead VC analyst Kyle Stanford on this latest data next. This is Bloomberg. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2594,2022-10-13 21:30:05
14369,"usters. Welcome back to Bloomberg Technology. I'm Emily Chang in San Francisco. While tech made a roaring comeback on the latest CPI print one pocket of the market, did get left behind on next service. multiple pre-profit software companies that we were talking about earlier in the show. And I guess it's this one two-punch, right? We're worried about inflation and how that's going to impact the consumer. At one point looking at Etsy, close down 9%, at one point was down 12% following the CPI print. It's biggest drop since June of this year. And also looking at IBI, or Amplify ETF, Tick-A-I-B-U-Y, which is kind of a basket of not just e-commerce stocks, but also gig economy stocks. At one point had a really deep 3% drop, but it actually clawed a lot of that back to close, 3% to 5% lower. There's also the question about Prime Day 2. We've been talking about this week. You see Amazon on the right-hand side of that chart, the big drop following the CPI print, it clawed its way back. But we're starting to hear noises from Amazon about how that October Prime early sales event went, they said 100 million plus items were ordered from partners in primary access. What does that even mean, Emily? They're not giving us a dollar value. We're not getting any sense of size and scope of how this October window did relative to the last window. We have that third party data, which basically showed consumers were cautious. They spent less money on much cheaper items than perhaps they did in previous windows. I know that's not the picture that Amazon painted in our show this week, but the signs are that it wasn't as strong as perhaps we thought it would be and it wasn't that much greater than any other day for Prime. So real focus right now on the consumer, especially in the context of inflation. OK, Ed, thank you. I want to stick to the markets, but from a private perspective, we've been talking a lot about the VC slowdown over the last few weeks and there's now new data to support that. Pitchbook is just out with the new report on VC deal-making, fundraising and exit numbers and the picture is mixed. Let's bring in Kyle Stanford now, the lead VC analyst at Pitchbook for a deeper dive on this report. Kyle, thank you so much. So what is the data telling you about how the VC ecosystem is being hit by this? Yeah, I think the data is really showing a very complex picture of what's happening in the venture market. At one end, you have seed deals and early stage deals that have been very strong, you know, lower than 2021, but much higher than we'd seen historically. In the opposite side of the spectrum, a late stage has seen deal value.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2595,2022-10-13 21:35:03
14370," The stage deals have been very strong, you know, lower than 2021, but much higher than we'd seen historically. And that the opposite side of the spectrum, a late stage has seen deal value plummet deals are very difficult to get done there because of the proximity to the public markets. So as we move forward, you know, we're really looking to see, you know, how that late stage is able to respond, obviously with the lack of IPOs. It's going to continue to be a difficult market, but overall the core of VC has shown to be able to still get deals done. Now, let's talk about the total money invested falling to a nine quarter low. Where do we go from here? I think again, we really need to look at where that deal value fall came from. You know, crossover investors and public market investors, especially had pumped so much capital into the venture market. The expectation of what VC was really got inflated in 2021. Now as those investors have kind of pulled back at least especially from a dollar value standpoint, that deal value has dropped really significantly very fast. Last year in mega deal, so 100 million and larger, there's $200 billion invested in 87% of those deals included investment from those private equity funds or public market investors that have not traditionally been part of the market. So I think when we look at a deal value perspective, that is where the decline has come from. There's still a lot of drive powder out there and there's a lot of fun, a high number of funds ready to make investments. You know, while those investors are probably taking a step back from the market and slowing the pace from what we saw in 2021, that deal value decline is really right now coming from the very top of the market. $290 billion in drive powder to be specific. How long do you think they're going to hold on to it? I mean, when are we going to see this money more meaningfully being invested? Well, I think first of all, there needs to be some sort of certainty in the market, right, or at least less uncertainty. Interest rates are still rising and inflation is still extremely high. The kind of area where the market is as far as what the expectation of valuations from founders and the needs of evaluation from investors is still a little bit dislocated. So we want really see a meaningful amount of capital come back until that that kind of deficit closes from a deal drive powder, drive powder perspective. I think we should look at that as capital for a seed in early stage. That is not meant to support unicorns or support the, you know, ultra late stage that has come about in the last few years. So $290 billion is a huge amount of money, but you know, more importantly, the high number of small investors that are in the market that have closed funds since the beginning of 2020, I think is really important for deal. I do account, especially moving forward, but again, you know, we'll be looking towards the public markets to help release some of the pressure that's being created at the top of the market before we really expect any sort of growth to come back to venture. I spoke with Andrew Yang earlier this week, you know, obviously he goes way back founded venture for America, ran for president has, you know, a lot of thoughts about the economy and he thinks there's a long way, long way down to go. Take a listen to what he had to say. We have a ways to go on the down slope. I certainly think that folks should try and keep some powder dry, you know, make sure that you have enough cash to make it through for a little bit longer than you might hope. So he's saying to keep powder dry for a longer period of time, you know, how much farther, how much farther down do you think this slope goes and how do you think these seas are going to negotiate, you know, not knowing how long this is going to last. Yeah, I mean, as far as, you know, we do see a lag in data from what we see what we're expecting in the narrative. And so even from right now, I would expect deal counts to continue to slide and deal value slide a little bit more for a few more quarters before it catches up to what we're talking about right now in the beginning of Q4. As far as keeping dry powder, I think again, a lot of the that unlocking or getting that dry powder back into the market is going to have a lot to do with what goes on in the public markets. LPs are very over.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2596,2022-10-13 21:39:04
14371," A lot of that unlocking or getting that dry powder back into the market is going to have a lot to do with what goes on in the public markets. LPs are very overbalanced right now. They've been putting a lot more money to private equity and venture capital over the past few years. Now with their public portfolios very much slower than they were last year. I think they're looking at their VC allocation as a little overweight. And so having those investors continue to hold on to dry powder, not call it down from LPs. So things need to be very important until we again see a little bit more certainty in the market. See interest rates, you know, stop rising and inflation kind of start to lower and kind of get to a sense of balance throughout the entire market. All right, Kyle Stanford lead VC analyst at pitch book. Thanks so much for sharing your thoughts here. Appreciate it coming up. What do blockchain and the commonwealth of Dominican have in common?

Justin, thank you so much for joining us. So talk to us about this new agreement with Dominica. How did it come together and what is the vision? Sure, I believe this is a historical moment for both Tron and Dominica. This is the first time a blockchain protocol has collaborated with a.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2597,2022-10-13 21:43:22
14372," moment for both Trump and the Dominican. Since this is the first time a blockchain protocol has collaborated with a Caribbean government developing the new digital currency infrastructure for the nation. Trump has been a widely used blockchain infrastructure for almost four years now. Today we have 115 million users with a very big use case on stablecoin, transact among five Q10 billion US dollars every day. But this is the first time we collaborate with the government and to build their designates blockchain for the structure and also the same time all the Trump cryptocurrency including Tiax, BTT, NFT, JST and all the stablecoin, TUSD, USDT and USDD on Trump has granted a status of median of exchange and authorized digital currency on Dominica. One lessons are you taking from El Salvador and the Bitcoin legal tender situation there which has had mixed results. Yes, I think Dominica move is definitely a next level compared to the move of El Salvador because in the El Salvador Bitcoin tender bill is only focus on Bitcoin. I will take Bitcoin as a very good source for value storage. But in terms of payment, stablecoin, Web3 and the old new concept comes out. We need a smart contract platform. We need a new blockchain which is much much like faster speeds, cheaper fees and easy to develop on it. So that's why I believe we can definitely benefit Dominica people with more power for blockchain and the Web3 technology. Given the state of the markets, I'm so curious for your outlook. Are you interested in or trying at all to invest in some of these distressed crypto assets for example, the Celsius assets that are coming up for sale? Yes, definitely. I think today is a bear market. So bear market is for buy, right? So instead of buying all the crypto assets and assets in the boom markets with a formal emotion, I think right now is a good time to buy crypto assets when everybody wants out. So that's why I definitely believe there is some good opportunity in the markets now. But of course with thorough due diligence, which is very important and the understanding of good understanding of the business in the first place. But for Trump and myself, definitely right now, we are ready for lots of the opportunity now. Are you interested in the Celsius assets in particular? Yes, I think we have done some due diligence Celsius before. But whether we're gonna move forward on this opportunity, I think it's still pending. I'm curious about your role in Hwabi. Obviously another huge crypto exchange. I know you're an investor in Polonex. What can you tell us about Hwabi? How competitive you think it'll be, what the new owner plans to do with it, especially given China has basically banned crypto. Yes. So first of all, I'm the advisor to Hwabi and I have joined the company.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2598,2022-10-13 21:47:34
14373," Yes. So first of all, I'm the advisor to Wobby and I have joined the company for almost five days now. So I start to get familiar with the team and the policy we're going to adopt in the future. I think right now, Wobby has two major focus. One is focus on the edge heat token, which is the platform token, which I believe is the poor value of the platform. We need to push hard on the platform token, Wobby, sorry, platform edge heat. If we want to build Wobby as one of the most important exchange in the world. And also the second strategy is globalization since as everyone know, Wobby is very famous in China before. I think the real success story of Wobby in the next stage is definitely globalization. And also we have planned to go back to China once China has a has a better policy on cryptocurrency. And I think Wobby will be one of the most important to come compatible. Sorry, competitive exchange out there when the time comes. Interesting that you think China's crypto policies will become more friendly. You're not an owner or investor in Wobby as I understand it just an advisor. Is that correct and do you own any any HT tokens? Yes, I own lots of HT tokens for sure. And I. How many? I will say tens of millions. So when even those HT I will say some of it I already own before I become the advisor since I use like HT since day one. When Wobby first like founded in in 2013, I started to accumulate HT on my own. But right now I will definitely see myself as one of the biggest HT holder. And also for Wobby, I think definitely for the crypto policy in China, I'm optimistic. Since you know China is facing a big change. I think in the next month or two. After the new leadership, we will definitely see a lot of change in the economic policies and even for lots of industry policy. And the IPD crypto and the blockchain is definitely one of the table. All right, Justin Sun, thank you for joining us for sharing all of that ambassador and permanent representative of Grenada to the WTO and the founder of course of Tron. Coming up, meta doubling down on its VR envisions with its new headset, the Quest Pro, more what the move could mean for adoption across the enterprise with a mixed reality pioneer magically the CEO Peggy Johnson with me next. This is Bloomberg. Hey. Hey.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2599,2022-10-13 21:51:45
14374,"ION rugby tô Let's go. Metta doubling down on the Metaverse unveiling its newest virtual reality headset, the MetaQuest Pro, this week, seeking to transcend the notion that VR is primarily for gamers, but brought in the audience joining us to discuss what that could mean for adoption as a pioneer in the space, Peggy Johnson, CEO of Magic Leap and AR Venture, which was founded back in 2010. Before any of us thought this was really possible, Peggy, what were your big takeaways from Meta's announcements, aside from Mark Zuckerberg's Avatar legs? Well, basically, it's a real validation of the decision Magic Leap made a couple years ago to focus initially on the enterprise. The technologies in its current state will allow for an ROI in areas like healthcare, public sector, and manufacturing. So it really is the right entry point for these sorts of technologies. Sachin Adela, of course, the CEO of Microsoft, where you spent a very long portion of your career appeared with Mark Zuckerberg talking about bringing Windows 365 to the Quest, and Microsoft is forming this industrial Metaverse team. But do people really want to be working on Excel spreadsheets in the Metaverse? Well, I do think that is some of the challenge. If the goal is just to take what we're doing on our 2D screens and put it up in front of us in our physical world, I think you've missed the real opportunity. Augmented reality, actually, you continue to view your physical world, and then you intelligently place digital content in front of it. So if you're on a factory floor, you can put the digital twin of a machine that's gone offline on top of the physical machine and bring it back online much more quickly. So talk to us about the real enterprise opportunities that you see and what sectors you think will get the most traction. We've got a whole list of interesting applications, one from a company called senti AR, and what they do is heart catheterization. They used to do it where surgeons watch the heart on a 2D screen. Now, real time, they've imaged the heart in 3D, the surgeon can put it in front of their eyes. They're threading the catheter through the heart, just do it with more care, more accuracy, better navigation, and better outcomes for the patient. Another is a manufacturing company in the Midwest, PVC linear. They are having a hard time keeping employees because of the acceleration of retiring factory workers. They're able to reduce their training time of new factory workers by about 80% using magic leap, also reducing the rework and scrap by about 20%.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2600,2022-10-13 21:56:39
14375," their training time of new factory workers by about 80% using magic leap also reducing the rework and scrap by about 20%. So really two benefits and the new workers like the innovation. This is a PC on their eyes. So for the first time, they get to also enjoy some of these digital tools that we've all had as knowledge workers for years. So last question, how far out is the industrial metaverse, whether it's virtual reality or augmented reality? How many years is it going to take before, a significant number of people, businesses are using this technology? That's an easy one Emily, it's here right now. You can realize ROI right now in these training use cases and 3D visualization use cases and that's what we're focused on at Magic Leap. Thank you Johnson CEO of Magic Leap. Good to have you back with us. Thanks for sharing your perspective here today. And that does it for this edition of Bloomberg Technology. Don't forget to check out our podcast wherever you get your podcasts. I'm Emily Cheg and San Francisco. This is Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2601,2022-10-13 22:00:40
14376," Yea. The great sci-fi art of the mid-20th century teased a vision of the future with one distinct element and common, a life for humans in outer space. Whether vacationing on an exotic new planet or commuting to the moon for business, space travel seemed like it was just around the corner. Here we are, a half century later, and only about 500 human beings have ever left the bounds of Earth's atmosphere. But thanks to a set of ambitious private companies betting on the promise of space tourism, that long-awaited future could be here sooner than we think. For most of the history of spaceflight, governments have been the prime force behind nearly every aspect, from planning to funding to cruise selection. But as early as the 1980s, proposals for commercial space tourism began to emerge, along with innovative solutions for getting people there, such as the wild concept of sticking a 74-person passenger cabin in the cargo bay of a NASA space shuttle. Although various non-astronauts have been selected for missions over the years, true space tourism didn't happen until 2001. When an entrepreneur named Dennis Tito coughed up an estimated $20 million to hitch a ride with the Russian Federal Space Agency for a week-long vacation aboard the International Space Station. 20 years later, we're seeing a new contender in this final frontier of tourism. It's becoming a private enterprise situation, still very high-risk with the high-reward, potential reward. But, you know, government is really out of the business of flying people now, and it's really going to be companies like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson that do that heavy lifting. Commercial space tourism is usually about taking the non-astronaut, the private citizen into an orbital or suborbital flight, so you get a short amount of microgravity experience and you can float and take some photos. And then you come back. This was something that technology had gotten to a point where the private sector was going to make a business out of this. There are multiple companies that want to get to the place where they fly people into space. The first of these is Blue Origin, founded in 2000 by Jeff Bezos. Using the autonomous rocket system New Shepard, a tribute to the first American in space, Blue Origin plans to launch up to six passengers at a time, offering a rarefied treat of 62 mile high views and a momentary experience of weightlessness. Boking officially kicked off in May 2021, with the very first C to be auctioned off for charity. Meanwhile, Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic has also been pursuing a viable form of suborbital tourism. Aiming for launch in 2022, once Sir Richard himself has taken flight. I'm hoping to be able to go to space. I'd love to be able to coincide it with the moon landing and go to space. So I've got the whip on the team and we'll see how he goes. The company claims to have lined up over 600 seat reservations so far, including Justin Bieber and Leonardo DiCaprio. Virgin has projected that the final cost of the ticket will be at least 200,000.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2602,2022-10-13 22:05:17
14377," The company claims to have lined up over 600 seat reservations so far, including Justin Bieber and Leonardo DiCaprio. Virgin has projected that the final cost of the ticket will be at least $250,000 or roughly $50,000 for each of the five minutes or so of weightlessness that you'll get to experience. Although costly both companies' offerings aim to make suborbital flight a regular form of adventure travel, eventually driving down costs at scale to expand the customer base beyond the orbit of celebrities and billionaires. The third major contender is Elon Musk's SpaceX, which has set its sights even higher on orbital flights, which are a whole another level of complexity and energy and danger. When you go suborbital, if you're just going to go up above the von Karman line, which is 100 kilometers or about 62 miles, you only need to get up to maybe 5,000 miles an hour to get up there and you go basically straight up and then straight back down. You don't have the reentry heating that you would see coming in from an orbital. So when you go orbital, I don't care if you're a baseball or a battleship. You've got to go 17,500 miles per hour, not just 5,000 miles an hour. The energy is involved are much greater. By doing that, SpaceX has gone another level up and that's what they're doing with the Inspiration 4. Visit Inspiration4.com for your chance to go to space. Inspiration4 is the first planned all civilian mission into orbit, slated to launch in late 2021. The crew will bring their own set of diverse perspectives and backgrounds and experiences to test how a group of different people, namely people who aren't professional astronauts, could affair in space. Until now, astronauts have had to be physically perfect and this mission is changing that and so I feel incredibly honored to be representing those who aren't physically perfect. At H10, I was diagnosed with bone cancer and I was treated at St. G Children's Research Hospital and I spent a year there undergoing intense chemo and also surgery that ultimately saved my leg. I now work at St. Goud as a PA, a physician assistant and I work with leukemia and lymphoma patients. The kids we work with are so brave and they are very excited to watch me go to space because this is showing them that they're capable of doing this as well. Haley, along with three other crew members, will spend three days in space orbiting the Earth every 90 minutes before landing back off the coast of Florida. Well, when you think about access, the first astronauts for the United States came from the test pilot side and so women weren't allowed to be a part of that. We have somebody in their 20s, somebody in their 30s, somebody in the 40s and somebody in their 50s and so there can be access in all kinds of way whether you're talking about age, whether you're talking about gender, whether you're talking about race and ethnicity and all of those things. The first time people are going up into space and not sent there by a superpower, like the United States or Russia or China, well that's like really significant and you've got to be very thoughtful about it. The whole game plan right now is to make space really affordable and accessible for everybody so you can have fishing buddies going to space someday but the first is special and so with that we wanted to have a crew selection process that could make space available to everyday people. Getting to space is only the first step for space tours. The next challenge is what to do and where to stay when you get there. Axiom space is planning to launch the first segment of a new commercial space station in 2024. Their $2 billion project called AxStation would become the first free-flying private international space station or to use a more consumer friendly term. A space hotel. Axiom isn't the only company out to make your space stay a little more comfortable. Iglo Aerospace has been building what they call expandable habitat technology. Like their B330, an inflatable pod module that expands once in orbit. There's even one attached to a national space station right now they've been testing it and you take it up and it's rather small and then you inflate it and it seems to be working very very well. This is likely to be the first kind of tourist hotel that you're going to see up in space. First of all it's easy to carry instead of this giant tin can with all of that. The inflatable is lighter.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2603,2022-10-13 22:09:27
14378," uh hotel that you're going to see up in space. First of all it's easy to carry instead of this giant tin can with all of that. The inflatable sort of lighter, you can just blow them up and they get a nice big size for about you know half the less than half the weight probably. But even as space missions become accessible to civilians. The risks of going to the space are incredibly high. And you could die in thousand ways that we can think of and a thousand other ways that we can't think of. This is Michelle Hanlon. She's a space lawyer at the Mississippi School of Law focused on protecting humans in outer space. Now I'm not an attorney for any of the space tours so I haven't been privy to their private contracts. But I can tell you that the FAA requires certain waivers to be in those contracts. So for example the FAA says, well we're not going to make you make your spacecraft to a certain safety level. We are going to make you spacecraft operator make sure that you inform your space tours of all of that hazards that you know of that I imagine a very long waiver all the ways you can die in space. And you have to understand that there's health risks and you have to indemnify the US government if you are launching the United States. So those are things that we know a space tourist has to sign and has to wait. So now let's go back and think about our space flight participants. The FAA calls space tourists space flight participants. They don't call them astronauts. Why is that important? If you're not an astronaut there's no obligation to rescue you if something goes wrong. It's a lot of money to set up a rescue launch. If it can even be done it's something really important to think about and that difference as we as we cross this threshold from having astronauts in space to having real people like me in space. And when we are able to make it to space reliably enough there's still a host of other legal and ethical issues to consider before space tourism can truly take off. There are so many gaps in space law that we are going to put in a lot of sort of basement ideas. And so for example the outer space treaty is a treaty that offers principles and guidelines for state activities for the activities of national governments. It doesn't talk about private entities doesn't talk about humans in space. So now something goes wrong. So let's think about all of the times hotels on earth are sued. So slip and false you step on something in the bathroom used to the hotel and it becomes a private lawsuit because of the vagaries of international law. If something happens in space well boy you can sue the state that launched your spacecraft you can sue the company that brought you there you can sue the hotel you can sue the individual you can sue every government related to that because the way it the outer space treaty in the outer space regime have set this up. Is that anything that happens in space first has to go through a diplomatic channel before you think about suing in a court of law. And so every single slip and fall in a space hotel is a diplomatic nightmare. And so we really need to figure that out before we before we start sending a lot of people there. You think about human rights in space here we don't think about a human rights oxygen because it's kind of all around us and free. It's not in a space hotel. So what happens if something happens in the oxygen depletes who gets the oxygen first and then of course let's not even think about the labor how do you treat your labor in a space hotel where that person it may be there two or three years without coming back to earth. So a lot of things to think about. Space habitats are more likely in the near future to focus on research missions and be a home for experiments that can't happen is easily back on earth. Space hotels I think they garnered a lot of headlines and a lot of news. But at the same time that's not the first thing that you're going to see happen. They don't offer the compelling business case I think that you'll see from a place that wants to manufacture pharmaceuticals or a new type of crystal or some type of filament or fiber optic cables and other things that you can do in microgravity. Things that are actually high value finished good when you get that back to earth and you sell it for a very, very huge profit margin. That's what's likely to happen in space as opposed to having a real estate platform that you sell to a tourist by space hotel. It's really interesting and it will probably have a lot of money.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2604,2022-10-13 22:13:50
14379," It's as opposed to having a real estate platform that you sell to a tourist by a space hotel. It's really interesting and it will probably happen, but it's not likely to be at the forefront of space commerce. Even if space hotels are right around the corner, don't get too excited about booking a trip at one. It's not a cheap ticket to ride to space and it's gonna be, you know, millionaires and billionaires and that sort. But at the same time, you know, the point was made that in the early days of airline trips, that was also a completely on affordable ticket for most people. Those people who flew were people of means and over time it becomes affordable to the masses. And I think that's the goal for all the entrepreneurs in space as well to get those costs down to a point where it's not $10 million or $5 million or $300,000 right into sub-orderable space. When it becomes more like buying a first class ticket to go to Europe from the United States. So that's the goal and, you know, the question is, can we get to that point? Given the immense operating costs of getting to space, it may be years, if ever, until space tours and becomes a profitable venture for any of these companies. Virgin Galactic, the only publicly traded company of the three, has had a particularly rocky year, initially riding on the momentum of a spec deal, but more recently beset by launch delays and major funders, including Branson himself, selling large quantities of their stock in the company. Space is really, really, really hard. And it's an absolutely shay, but it's one that happens to be very true. It's just really hard to do. That's also the reason that you've seen the delays that, you know, Virgin had talked about flying years and years ago. And it became such a crazy point that Richard Branson actually stopped talking about it when he was asked because it was never going to be when he predicted, but it's not insurmountable. And you know, investors have stepped up because this is something that is doable. Despite the astronomical dangers and costs of getting to space, it may ultimately follow the course of other once fanciful modes of travel. Right, brothers, having, you know, what was by modern standards, a very unimpressive first flight, you know, at Kitty Hawk, I mean, you know, you had like less than 20 years later, you had your first airborne ambulances being used to save lives. Fundamentally, the world is a more interesting place when people can go and dance among the stars and such. The lure of space is in a, it's in our DNA. It's that exploration bug. We are an exploratory species and we want to go out there and see what's out there. A vision that I had in 1969, of seeing normal human beings travel into space, it's finally beginning to happen. When you get a bunch of people up there and they can all see it for themselves, that'll create even yet another revolution in how we treat our planet and what we think about it. So while 2001 came and went without quite looking like Stanley Kubrick's ultimate space fantasy, 2021 might finally be the year we're catching up. If you visit California, you might be inclined to go to Disneyland. We're jumping you're convertible and take highway one up the coast.

14380," I'm going to go to Disneyland. We're jumping you're convertible and take highway one up the coast. We may be making pilgrimage to Yosemite. All very fine choices. But if you're the kind of person who revels in our planet's extremes, then it's Route 395 that you're after. This one glorious road will carry you from Death Valley's desert floor to sky high views of Mount Whitney. You can see the 5,000 year old bristle cone pines. The oldest living organisms. Or the bizarre two-foot towers of Mono Lake. And true to California's boom and bust spirit, you can santa around the ghost town of Bodhi. What a novel experience to find an empty American city where all the businesses are shut down. To do 395 upright, it helps to have a guide. And mine is a man named Jan. And his crew. Aaron? Let's tell you. Tim Lemmy, the hardest partying dog of all time. Jan agreed to show me some of what 395 has to offer. But only if we agreed not to disclose any locations. My name is Jan Svorestra. I'm an industrial designer out of LA. And I spend a lot of time camping and a lot of time in the eastern Sierra. It's a place I love. And sometimes I'm known as 395 North because this is my Instagram account. And I don't like to be known as that, but I'm trying to use it to set a good example and do more with it than just social media. Waited we at a cab? But we got here laylazile. I was sure where we are. This is BLM land right on the outskirts of National Forest. And it's one of my favorite places in the world. Basically everything outdoors wrapped into one. Yeah. Could they go to California, man? Oh, man. We have so much National Forest in public land that you can literally just cruise out and find a place to camp. It's ours. What I wish was mine is Jan's sweet truck. It's a 2019 Ford Ranger. Has about 200 watts of solar in it and a fridge and has everything that an RV has except for a toilet. But just on a smaller, simple scale. And you drive us around day to day in LA. Yep. And then just roll out when you want. It's my daily driver. Handles great. And then when I'm done with work, I can just bail and go camping and out. So the camper basically has only what I need. Think of it as backpacking with a car. The fridge has a couple compartments. This is just a kitchen box. Stove utensils and a bunch of stuff. This one has just dry food. And when you get inside, there's a bed. The bed flips up so you've got tons of room in here. Miss Alany. This phenomenon. Is it going to pull that over? That's cool. I just popped that up. Sort of. So home on wheels. Yeah. My vacation house. Yeah, so nice, man. Even with his Nomad lifestyle, Jan faces the same big question as the rest of us. Do the internet and smartphones have to ruin everything? When you find the super special, beautiful spots is that you bustin' out a map and like, look at where it might be cool to go or is it worth a mouth?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2606,2022-10-13 22:22:20
14381," When you find the super special beautiful spots is that you bustin' out a map and like look at where it might be cool to go or is it worth a mouth and just get to know people of the locals. If I see a dirt road, I just want to go down. So a lot of it's just aimless rambling. It's a desire to just see something. Check that out. For some reason it's more fulfilling than getting a recommendation from somebody or there's tons of apps and websites now. Road trip apps, camping apps, they proliferate and the knowledge is accessible on the internet. Right? I used to fight the geotags and I would get really pissed off. Like why are you posting this place? It's gonna blow up, it's gonna get trashed. Now I've realized that you can't fight it. The internet has just shrunk the world. So we're not gonna stop it. We're not gonna stop people from going there. So I'm a lot more focused in conversation now with trying to set a good example. When you go, pick up your trash. When you're poopin' out in the wilderness, don't leave your toilet paper on the top. You know, make sure you follow good steps for leaving no trace. As a thank you for this quick guide to pooping etiquette, we made yawn, hair and and lemmy some tacos. And we all took in the night sky and knocked back a couple of drinks. Take that apocalypse. We're done. The thing about good times in serenity in 2020 is that they're fleeting at best. After we split up from Jan and continued on our way, smoke started to envelop us. The plus side was that our RV no longer smelled like feet. The downside was breathing. My man David here suggested that we try and outflank the smoke by cutting through your semity. Without a reservation, we had to talk our way in. Uh, yes, no stopping, no getting out. And... Yeah, no problem. We just wanted to get through. It was a beautiful choice. I'd be glad I have a little smoke. Whoa! But not quite as effective as we had hoped. The last four and four hours or so, and we had managed...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2607,2022-10-13 22:26:49
14382," Fast forward four hours or so and we had managed to trade the smoky majesty of Yosemite for the smoky... look at it. Strip malls of the Central Valley. We have made it sort of out of the smoke all the way across Yosemite National Park and here to the gorgeous Central Valley of California. We're off to see a kind of surprising tech startup that is making some pretty strange machines to serve all the growers out in this region. We're just out the Fresno town called Kingsburg so we're right in the Central Valley of California. Very very large farming valley here. It's kind of considered the bread basket of the world. The Central Valley stretches out over about 20,000 square miles and the farmers here produce about one fourth of the food that Americans eat, including a whole lot of fruits and nuts. Tell me a little bit of the background of God's. I know some of this is like a family business. The roots of this go back a ways. Tell me kind of like how we got to what's essentially like a startup I guess. Yeah definitely. So the founder of our company is Dave Crinklaw and he started the business back in 1982. He started with his basically with his dad was commercial spraying of trees and vineyards. Got to the point where our biggest challenge was labor. Just the shortage of it really. He was forced into innovating and he had had this idea for quite some time about doing a driverless sprayer and it finally got to the point where he said you know what I either got to get out of this business or I'm gonna innovate. Organic or not crops need to be sprayed and this process has to take place a few times a year. This means hiring a lot of people to work long hours under serious pressure and so just like the tech bros to the north. Gus decided to solve all of its problems with robots. On this like labor points you guys have set this up where you can have somebody in a truck and that one person can monitor I think like eight of these. In order to operate Gus you have one guy or girl that sits in a pickup and they monitor from a laptop computer. So that person is basically just watching all the vehicles on the screen. They can monitor up to eight of them at a time while they're out there spraying in the orchard and so that user interface really provides them with all the information they need to make sure that the machines are safe and that they're doing the correct job. So it tells them what speed they're driving the engine RPM the amount of gallonage per acre that they're applying at any given time. So if any one of the machines has an issue it's going to send an alert to that laptop. Much like a self-driving car these beasts use GPS, LiDAR and cameras to see and navigate the world around them. They also rely on pre-built maps of the orchards for extra guidance. Gus builds the machines right here and then takes them out for robot training on this orchard next door. It's here that the company learns if the machines will behave and do as their software and human masters command. So this is kind of like that. This is a test orchard where you guys put it through the paces and work on the technology. Yeah so this is our test orchard right here. It's right by our building so you can see in the background. So every new machine as it comes off the assembly line it's put through a commissioning test right here. We test all the sensors on the machine, autonomous computer, all the safety systems make sure it's doing what is doing prior to when it's delivered to a customer. So what's it doing now? So right now he's doing a test spray so he's just turning...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2608,2022-10-13 22:31:05
14383," I'm doing fire to when it's delivered to a customer. So what's it doing now? So right now he's doing a test spray. So he's just turning the water on to make sure that the system comes up to pressure. Spraying water out of the nozzle is just to make sure it's all functioning properly. Okay. It's got like a crazy turbine at the backer. Yeah, so it's basically just a big fan. Okay. And that fan's driven off of the Cummins diesel motor. And it just basically creates a big airflow. Gus is already selling these vehicles to brave modern farmers. And people the world over have taken notice of its machines. And have you just sold them in the Central Valley or like throughout the US or even overseas? Or where are they going? Yeah, so right now the majority of our machines are here in California in the Central Valley. However, we do have machines and customers in Florida and the citrus industry over there as well as Australia. And I think you start selling them in like December of 2019? Yeah, so we started taking orders early last year for the sprayers and the first delivery we made were in December of 2019. Okay. And how much do they cost each? So our retail price on these machines is $285,000. This is like it's not a small investment, but I'm sure the regular sprayers aren't. Yeah, I mean we're honestly not too far away from conventional equipment on our price. And the main thing is that the return on investment is very, very quick due to all the labor savings and the increased efficiency. I mean these machines, they just, they just drive. But basically what we're doing besides this machine, this is our first machine we call it orchard Gus. Mainly designed for your, your nut trees as well as citrus and fruit in the future. We're working on a few other projects. We're going to do more machines. One of them is actually a vineyard sprayer. So vineyards are much tighter spacing. So the machine has to be physically smaller and then we've got our eyes on doing a lot of other innovating. That right there friends is a central valley farmer putting his whole fruit basket on the table. Gary's Ted Talk can't be far off. And with that it was time to get back in the RV. And to confront what happens when three men are vested by their own failings. And the forces of entropy. Next on Hello World, we cruise into the Mojave Desert in search of a lunar lander. We have instruments that we are going to deliver to the South Pole of the Moon in December 2022. Instruments that are trying to scan the surface of the moon. And hang with a test pilot who walked away from this. She lives by herself. But for the last few months, she hasn't been alone. Ella Q, tell me a joke. Did you hear about the claustrophobic gastronolot? No. Apparently, he just needed a little space. Most technology isn't made for 93 year olds. But this woman is making sure that this particular robot is. Ella Q, who are you? She's researching the way we interact with machines. And if she has her way, robots will soon be a trusty companion for all of us. My name is Ella Q. How can I help you? Technology replaces all jobs.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2609,2022-10-13 22:35:21
14384," My name is Ella Q. How can I help you? A technology replaces old jobs. It's also creating new ones. I'm Aki Ito and I'm here to show you the jobs of the future. My name is Danielle Aishak and I am a human robot interaction researcher. It's really hard to intuitively design a robot meant for a consumer audience. You have to make sure that it's a robot that people want. People know how to use and people value. Danielle works for an Israeli startup called Intuition Robotics. Its US office is here in downtown San Francisco. Hello. Hey Danielle, it's Aki. Come on in. The company is funded by a couple big names like Samsung and Toyota. Full disclosure, Bloomberg's venture capital arm is an investor too. This is Ellie Q. Can I do a great job for a spin? Please? Ellie Q. Tell me what you can do. I am a proactive social robot designed for older adults. I can connect you to your family and friends and even play music. These features might remind you of the Amazon Echo, but you'd be missing the point if you compared her to a smart speaker. She's not meant to just be useful. She's meant to be a companion. Why don't you take a break and have a drink? That's why she has a head that can not make other subtle gestures you might expect from a pet. Through our research with older adults, we're finding that almost on a daily basis. We see that somebody tells her that they love her or that they like her or that they miss her. They'll also tell her I'm depressed or I'm lonely. They'll open up to her in a way that they might not necessarily open up to a human. Because they don't feel like they'll be judged. Ellie Q is an on sale yet. But a prototype is already in the homes of about a dozen early testers who live in the Bay Area. Ellie Q. Tell me what the weather is today. Danielle's job is to figure out what's working and what's not. Sorry, please rephrase your request. And she does that by visiting each of her testers twice a month. How important are these visits to your job? They're critical. We're building a product for people who we are not. I'm not a senior and how could you know how to design for somebody if you don't do research? Otherwise, you would just be designing in the dark. Jobs like Danielle's are just starting to emerge. Until recently, robots were mostly in factories separated from humans. But now, they're finally getting cheap enough, small enough, and smart enough to be in our homes. This has created a whole new challenge of designing robots that people will actually want to interact with. And that's where Danielle comes in. Her research has helped shape every little facet of Ellie Q. From the way Ellie Q moves to the way she talks. It's a very special job and it could be really hard and it could be really frustrating about the end of the day. It's incredibly rewarding. And I think the most rewarding part about it is when I see the joy on the user's faces. Like, they saw their feedback turned into something real. Today, we've driven east of San Francisco to go see one of Danielle's research participants. Ellie Q. Tell me something interesting.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2610,2022-10-13 22:39:42
14385," East of San Francisco to go see one of Danielle's research participants. L.A.Q. Tell me something interesting. Did you know that Ronald Reagan was a lifeguard in high school and saved 77 people's lives? Now see, this is where a conversation is. She should open up and I should say, no, I did not know that. I expect her to be able to continue a conversation for at least a couple of comments. Yeah. And why is that? Why? Yeah. Because that's companionship. When Betty was around Danielle's age, she was working with some of history's very first computers. When I was finishing up my master's degree, I was working at Harvard in the computer lab when they were building Mark IV. A large room size computer. But now, this artificial intelligence stuff is amazing. L.A.Q. Yes. Schedule a doctor's appointment. No problem. I'm working on it. When Danielle brought along the idea of working with robotics for the elderly, I said, are you kidding me? Will older people connect to a robot? And she said, I don't know, let's research and find out. Danielle grew up here in this suburb of Atlanta. Her parents spent much of their childhoods in Israel and met in the US. We as immigrants, we understood that we might need to work a little harder. In fact, I feel that rather than taking away from Danielle, it gave her so much more. Because she understood the fact that you need to run after your dreams and work really hard, no matter what the challenges are. School didn't come easily for Danielle. I have dyslexia and that very much affected my self-esteem academically. The principal of the school did not recommend her to take the advanced classes. She fought for it and she got into it and she did very well with them too. Danielle's first job at Ugradskoll was at X, the secretive research facility founded by Google. It's known for dreaming about kinds of wacky, far-flung ideas. Can you tell us about the moonshot she worked on? No, I can't tell you too much about the projects that I worked on. I can't say that I was working on robotics. She loved the job, but wanted to work on something that would reach real consumers sooner. So she left X after a year and joined Intuition Robotics. She's been working in the field for four years now and it took her a while to find her footing in a male-dominated industry. I've gone to different meetups where Chloe likes to circle with men with their zip up jacket with their company logo on it and a beer in their hand and I'll come in with lipstick and nobody wants to talk to me. This is my closet. But first she did her best to fit in, wearing a pair of glasses she didn't need and toning down her style. So what's the kind of thing you used to wear to a conference? Stuff like this, blousey things, that make you look like you're 40. But that got old after a while. And what's the kind of thing you wear now? No, it's like I just enjoy being kind of expressive and playful and what I wear. Before we wrap up for the day, Danielle has one more LEQ tester to visit. Joseph is 97.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2611,2022-10-13 22:44:01
14386," Joseph is 97. And he's had the robot in his home for eight months. How are you? I'm fine. How are you? Good. How has Miss Ellie Cuban? She always tells me to take a drink of water, at least four times a day. So we added a whole bunch of new facts to Ellie Cuban. Did you know that a cup of chopped red bell pepper contains more vitamin C than an orange? Okay. What did you think of that? Certainly the print was... I could see that quite clearly. What about this? I can see that. Now the cue, play music. No problem. It will begin shortly. By 2050, almost half a billion people are going to be 80 or older. And if current trends continue, more and more are going to be like Joseph and Betty, living alone. Ellie Cuban, stop. Today, both of them are doing okay. But some of Danielle's other participants have been struggling. It's a kind of hard to leave them at the end of the day. It is. Some of our testers are pretty advanced in the stages of depression through loneliness and isolation. And at times, I know that Ellie Cuban is cheering them up in their day. But I know that it's only part of the way. No source of artificial intelligence robots will ever be able to replace humans and human companionship or human care. The key to Danielle's work is to embrace that very limitation of machines. Robots should help humans do what they love, help humans interact with more humans, help humans in general. Not pull humans away from humans. Not take humans jobs and leave humans without purpose. Whether it's in our workplaces or in our homes, robots are soon going to be everywhere. And it's up to Danielle to make sure this robot-filled future leaves us just a little better off. So don't be afraid. And if you are afraid, come and join us. Because I promise it's a friendly place. If you're like the estimated 74% of adults in the US who use YouTube, this might be what your home screen looks like. An algorithmically curated look into what you like to watch. Maybe some tips on how to prepare a new meal or your favorite vloggers latest video. But if you're a parent who shares your phone with your children, it probably looks a little more like this. Kids content on YouTube is huge. Views for videos can reach into the billions. Five of the top 10 videos in a-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2612,2022-10-13 22:48:09
14387," It probably looks a little more like this. Kids content on YouTube is huge. Views for videos can reach into the billions. Five of the top 10 videos in all of YouTube's history are either music videos or kids videos, with Baby Shark having more views than people on the planet. Daddy Shark, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, Daddy Shark. And my shark. YouTube has created a revolution, not an evolution, in the way kids and families consume video content. And that extends then into how they view toys and play and all of the associated things that go with that. Kids YouTube for the unaware can be adorable. It can be boring. It can also just be flat out strange. Here I am, here I am, how do you do? But often it involves toys. And for toy makers who embrace the platform, it led to record success. And I think in the worst of the price, unclutching, it's the biggest phenomenon that has ever happened in toy industry. This is the story of how YouTube changed kids toys. Play patterns, the way children play is timeless. But how we deliver on those play patterns through product and how we market that to children has changed quite a bit over the years. And I would say that the last five to 10 years really ranks right up there with the 1950s when TV commercials directed to children was first launched by Mattel. This is Nancy's Wears. She led the Barbie brand during the 90s and spent four years as the chief marketing officer for Spin Master. It used to be that there would be a few play things that parents would bring into the home where that children would create themselves like a stick and a ball becomes a play thing. And the industry was at a certain level of volume at that point. Mattel was very innovative and actually put the first product on TV and advertised it to children. Let's play home. This created a huge explosion in the toy industry that unfolded across decades. The hit of the day when you're ready to play, everyone knows this thing. Here he comes, here he comes. Great as tall you ever been. And his name is Mr. Machine. G-I-D-O-D-I-D-O fighting man, forget to go on the land of the T-H-E-R-E-E-R. When you go back to the 1980s, what do you think of in terms of hit shows? You think of things like Masters of the Universe. You think of the original Transformers and Care Bears. The joke was they were 22-minute commercials. Just close your eyes and care. Let's make a TV show which is really promotion for our property or IP to help sell toys. There were a lot of those famous characters in which kids absolutely loved it. They were totally entertained, but there were huge toy lines behind them. This is Jim Silver, a 37-year veteran of the toys industry. In 1999, he started a consumer toy review magazine called Toy Wishes. And now he's the CEO of an influencer talent management group, TTPM. Regulations changed through the years. And also, parents became aware that they were purely commercials. And you saw a lot of the new channels, the Disney Channel and Nickelodeon. They realized that wouldn't work anymore. And to them, entertainment came before licensing. What happened over time was that Toy started to become designed for a 32nd commercial. Close it's a mild matter, two bucks open. It's a micro machine, USA. Cruiser mini-micro-machine vehicles, planes and both to the police station, the marine of the mini-model cycle repair shop, the gas station, the construction office, the real working garbage, highway, passenger rap and garage doors. So if you couldn't explain it in a 32nd commercial, cost reduce it out of the product and just stick with what you could say. And features of toys, magical features using electronics, lights and sounds and mechanical movements that magic, like they don't know how it happens, that became more.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2613,2022-10-13 22:52:50
14388," Magical features using electronics, lights and sounds and mechanical movements that magic like they don't know how it happens, that became more and more important. The sound of power is heard. Fire, boom, Batman! See ya, Batman. Batman's turbo powered, that mobile flies into high gear. Since 2000, with cable channels dedicated to kits, Disney Channel, Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, there became the opportunity to reach kids in mass numbers every day of the week. And so the toy industry has continued to grow. The toy industry, for the most part, was a pretty solid business. Just, you know, growing a couple percent a year here and there. There'd be big, big years here and there when there was maybe a hit movie, like a Star Wars movie come out, you know, drive a lot of toy sales. In 2014 to 2019, the global toy industry would grow by 15 percent. At about the same time, those major cable networks of Nickelodeon, Disney Channel and Cartoon Network would lose half their total audience. 2017 also saw the bankruptcy of Toys RS, as both parents and kids discovered and bought more toys online. If you think about kids, they're usually the first adopters of a new medium. Kids weren't watching things like Nickelodeon as much as they used to. They were watching things on YouTube. YouTube started in early 2005 and this was like, you know, the very early web 2.0, this beginning of sort of like what was the time, was going to be the most user-generated content. Web blogging was really big. My space was the biggest thing on the internet back then. There was an early video of a Brazilian soccer legend doing stunt tricks to just when I exploded on the site when the first viral video is lazy Sunday if you remember that SNL short. That's the chronic life-cultordia! Oh, Charlie! I'm going to be a bit me. You remember those early viral hits? YouTube in the early days was definitely comedy and music. It was a place of experimentation. I was the chief audience officer at Maker Studios, I oversaw essentially the creator partnerships and all over the world. Maker Studios was one of the largest multi-channel networks on YouTube and had partnered with some of the biggest YouTube channels of the time before being sold to Disney in 2014. Chris is now the CEO of Pocketwatch, which represents some of the largest kids stars on YouTube, including Ryan's world, and Love Diana, who can amass over a couple billion views every month. The truth is, one of the very biggest and earliest videos on all of YouTube was by a creator and star named I Justine, where she unboxed her first mobile phone bill for her brand new iPhone, and it came in a box. And this ultimately morphed into many different formats associated with unboxing and tech was actually really big. And those became fairly successful pretty early on on the platform, and you saw them expand from tech products to beauty products, and then around 2012 and 2013, we saw this explosion in the toys. So here's the Furby inside right here. We used to call them handschannel, and a handschannel was literally a top-down view of someone's hands. Unboxing typically a toy, and they'd unbox it, they'd show each component. We just got Uncle Scrooge. I would speak to many of those creators. We signed many of those creators at Maker Studios to be our partners, and it was fascinating in that it was this whole new genre and this whole new format, and that corresponded with a rise of kids and family viewership on YouTube that was stark, that was hard to miss, and you would see it in the data. And we had access to a lot of data in Maker Studios around YouTube. Let's see what's inside. First up, we have the Storm Super Pig. You saw the launch of EvanTube, who I consider the first child, so to speak.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2614,2022-10-13 22:57:21
14389," First up, we had the storm superpig. You saw the launch at EvanTube, who I consider the first child, so to speak, unboxing star. And they would open toys, and kids would just mesmerize by it. They loved watching it. And next thing you know, you had literally 50 unboxings. They were unboxing just about every toy. You know, and people were just really excited. You open the toy, and you see a toy pop out. And kids just got excited to see the piece by piece. Yeah, he's in a bathroom wearing a, he's eating a lobster. You know, the early days of these unboxing videos, the videos were, you know, from a adult's perspective, just terrible. I mean, they were 10 minutes long. They were boring. It was a shaky camera. There was absolutely no production value. And if you think about these executives, you know, they're trying to figure out how to reach this new audience. And they're brought these videos and say, we'll look at this video, it has 200,000 views on it. And it's terrible. When I first heard of it, I thought it was the weirdest thing. It just seemed kind of bizarre. Who would want to watch someone opening a toy, taking it out of the box? But then when I started thinking about this idea of exploration and discovery as a core play pattern, the most fundamental play pattern there is, it started to make sense. And I think that I have to say that the company that really jumped on that in the most concerted way was MGA with their launch of LOL. LOL Surprise! LOL Surprise had three key elements, a doll play, which is, you know, basically the most popular play pattern there is. Collectible. So within each LOL Surprise you'd get a little sheet that showed you all the other dolls you've collected. And then the Surprise factor, you don't know which doll you were getting. It was a blind pack, as they call it. And LOL was made by this company called MGA. Back then, you know, in 2016, they were a small player of the toy industry, founded by this guy named Isaac Larian, he's the CEO and founder. I have three adult kids, and they were making fun of me that, oh, you're old, you don't know anything about what's happening in today's thing. And they said, like what? And they said, for example, there is, do you know about this iPhone unboxing videos that get millions and millions of views? So I thought they're pulling my leg. Children do to make fun of their parents. And then I did go and look one night, and I was frankly shocked and flabbergasted that, why would anybody buy an iPhone, take it home, and open the box and show it on the camera, and everybody can go and watch it. So I typed toy on boxing. And my God, I saw so many different videos and people, kids and adults, might toys like an apple and unboxing it and video and posting it. So that gave me an idea that, why, why not come up with the ultimate? And that's the first LOL surprise. All right, oh, yes, we've got a goal, Paul. LOL changed the way you open with toys, and everybody saw that, and the packaging became part of the play, which became part of the entertainment. So normally, if you get a package that you just open a package you take the toy out, that's not exciting. You open up LOL, you peel it away, you open up inside, you have seven surprises. And it took off like wildfire and quickly became the top toy in the country. By December of 2018, eight of the top ten toys sold were all LOL surprise brand. And according to MGA from 2016 to 2020, LOL would generate over $10 billion in retail sales worldwide. You know, LOL is bigger than Star Wars, it's bigger than Marvel, it's bigger than Barbie. These brands with huge advertising budgets are known basically by everyone. You don't have to, you know, figure out when Marvel are Star Wars is. And LOL eclipse them all. In the toy world, blind bag or blind box toys have been growing in popularity. The most famous example in recent years is Pokemon cards, where you open packs in hopes of getting a Charizard, but more often wind up with something common like Black R here. Two years before the launch of LOL.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2615,2022-10-13 23:01:37
14390," Example in recent years is Pokemon card. Where you open packs in hopes of getting a charizard, but more often wind up with something common like Gligar here. Two years before the launch of LOL in 2014, the Australian toy company Moose Toys launched a blind bag collectible called Shopkins. And in 2016, Spin Master would launch a more expensive blind box toy it called Hatchimals. But the thing that sets LOL surprise apart is that it mainly focused on YouTube. And not putting ads on YouTube, but working with creators and influencers to get their products in the hands of these kids doing the unboxing videos. For MGA, actually, the move towards YouTube was kind of a bit lucky and almost out of necessity. In late 2015, Nickelodeon parent company Viacom would sue MGA for breach of contract after it failed to pay $3.5 million for the production of a TV series based on their Lala loop seat dolls. They tried to flex their muscle and they said, well, if you don't agree to our way of seeing things in the conflict that we had, they said that conflict. We are going to stop your advertisement of toys. At the time, Nickelodeon was the number one ranked children's network. And not to be able to advertise in Nickelodeon could have been a death nap. But MGA, necessity is the mother of invention, that caused them to lean into digital advertising far more than any big brand had ever done before because they had to. They had to find a new way to reach kids. The court would ultimately rule in favor of Viacom. Both in LA federal court and on appeal in the 9th Circuit, Larian blamed the court to feed on what he contends was judicial bias. Nickelodeon parent company Viacom didn't respond to a request for comment. So that by itself forces us to go and say, okay, they help with Nickelodeon. Let's find another way to reach to children. And that's how we went and doubled up on YouTube, especially. And the rest as they say. So early on, MGA partnered with YouTube creators with huge audiences like Cookie Swirl-C. Good morning, Chocolatey Chibi Cookies. We are going to be spending the morning with this LOL surprise, baby. Dancing! They took it another step further. They actually helped kids learn how to do their own unboxing videos. They gave them support and learning and tools. And so all these kids got to be kind of a little mini influencer themselves as they were unboxing their LOL products. So just to give you a flavor of how popular these videos are, go onto YouTube and search LOL surprise. And you'll see videos with a million views, 10 million, 25 million, 50 million, even 100 million. There's a lot of them. And kids are watching these videos and they're probably watching them over and over again. The old way toy manufacturers would do things is they buy TV, which was about 90% of their ad spend. And then traditional PR, get on the big morning shows. It's an entirely different formula. It's much harder for toy companies right now. Because the formula is so complicated, you have to really take a deep dive into each platform. Am I promoting on Twitter? Am I promoting on Instagram? Am I promoting on TikTok? What am I doing on YouTube? You have to look at every possible social channel. By 2017, big toy brands like Mattel had shifted nearly 50% of their marketing budget to social platform advertising. Fans would help seed videos of their...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2616,2022-10-13 23:05:44
14391," social channel. By 2017, big toy brands like Mattel had shifted nearly 50% of their marketing budget to social platform advertising. Brands would help seed videos of their toys, and if they were lucky, that could kick off a wave of creators making their own content around the product. In 2020 alone, tubular labs estimated that LOL-related content had amassed 5.1 billion views. This idea of imitation, so when you see kids playing with product, it kind of excites the same neurons in your brain that happen when you do it yourself. The more we could show children, having this experience, the more kids felt what it would be like to have it and then wanted to experience it themselves. In one of the criticisms of this whole influencer movement among kids is that kids are young, they don't understand what's necessarily an advertisement versus real content, and that's a big criticism of this industry is that a lot of kids are getting on YouTube at young ages not being supervised by their parents and just watching these videos, and they don't realize that maybe that influencer is getting paid by the brand to do that video, or there's some other compensation, and that, you know, lures the lines for kids as they're sort of developing and figuring out how to consume media. Questionable advertising concerns aside, kids YouTube creators would take off. Channels like Ryan's World would grow to almost 30 million subscribers, and a whole industry formed around them. When we first started working with influencers, they were very happy to work for free product. You give them the product and they do something for you. And gradually influencers got smarter and started, you know, charging for their services as they started building a following. Now, because it is such a big business, the dollars can be significant investing in big influencers. When Spin Master launched one of its new TV series and associated product, we made it a point to buy an advertising package with Ryan's World to ensure that we could get really quick big reach right away. This is an advertisement for Spin Master. So from these unboxing videos, the content's gotten a lot more sophisticated. They're creating narratives around the toys, voices, meta-universes, if you will, and it's really engaging content, even more so than the original unboxing videos for these kids. And, you know, the content's coming out maybe once a week or even daily. So if you think about it, what they've done is they've created basically like a TV show around a toy. It's not unlike what we saw back in the 80s, which was criticized back then, by the way, when you've had toys like GI Joe turn into an animated series or Masters of the Universe or Transformers. So we've kind of seen this full circle now, right? So back to where we were, content and basically many television shows create around toys on YouTube. Kids content on YouTube is likely to face increased regulation in the coming years. In 2019, the company would agree on a $170 million settlement with the FTC for serving ads based on personal data to kids on YouTube. YouTube would put more emphasis behind its Made for Kids platform YouTube kids and each video uploaded to YouTube must be flagged as either Made for Kids or not. In a statement outlining changes to the site, YouTube would say that responsibility is our number one priority at YouTube and this includes protecting kids and their privacy. Still, the site is far less regulated than traditional television. I do think parents have a better understanding of YouTube now and the New John Risen formats there that they didn't prior and they now notice things like their kid isn't watching a toy unboxing that's a commercial for a toy. Their kid is watching other kids play with toys in an imaginative way which inspires them to go play with things in the real world in an imaginative way. In just a few short years, YouTube had caused a transfer of power from toy and network executives to nine year olds and their families.

14392," But now Ryan has launched his own line of toys, a cartoon series. He was even a blimp in the 2020 Macy's Thanksgiving parade. You and I might think about Spider-Man or Snoopy, but today's kids see that blimp of Ryan and they relate to him. He's the character they want to grow up with. He's the character they want to engage with. And as we go forward, these influencers are becoming more and more like big, giant, global brands. And that has profound effects for entertainment going forward. Airbnb is huge today. On any given night, you could have as many as two million people staying in an Airbnb all around the world. You know, our mission is that everyone can belong anywhere. We're talking, you know, 300 million stays on any average year. And there's tyranny and numbers. The vast majority of Airbnb stays don't result in a safety incident. But sometimes things go wrong. And for Airbnb, you know, we're talking thousands of safety incidents that occur every year that the company has to handle and has to respond to. I'm talking situations like kidnappings, hostage cases. We're talking murder, we're talking rape. We're talking, you know, the worst violent crimes that occur in our society happen inside Airbnb's. Airbnb never wants these kinds of cases to end up in the headlines. You know, that's really bad for their brand, their reputation and their public image, particularly because this is a business that's based on strangers trusting one another. So when crimes like this occur, that kind of threatens their entire business model. I'm Olivia Carville. I'm a reporter on Bloomberg's technology team. And I've been covering online travel companies like Airbnb for the last two years. Airbnb is a startup that's based in Silicon Valley. And like many of the sharing economy startups, it managed to grow so big, so fast, by essentially skirting regulations. It was based on that premise of move fast and break things. And it wanted to work against regulations in order to grow as big as possible and win the popular vote. Because it became so popular, so fast that cities could no longer control it. And a picnic this past August, we had one million people from around the world coming from 180 countries in a single night staying in an Airbnb home. The vast majority of Airbnb stays. We're talking, you know, two million people staying in an Airbnb on any given night don't result in a safety incident. But sometimes things go wrong. And for the company, you know, it was dealing with these cases was a really challenging, difficult, complicated area. You had hosts and guests and sometimes they disagreed on what happened. You had regulatory issues in some of their bigger cities. Then you also had, you know, the growth of the platform and the fact that if you're going to try and prevent some of these.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2618,2022-10-13 23:14:32
14393," on what happened, you had regulatory issues in some of their biggest cities, then you also had the growth of the platform and the fact that if you're going to try and prevent some of these incidents, it could cut into revenue and cut into the number of listings that you have. So for Airbnb, it was about trying to figure out the best way to handle these crises in a way that's going to not only protect the individual in crisis, but also protect the company's public image, its brand, its reputation, which is essentially what its business is based upon. As Airbnb grew, like way too big for them to be able to take all these calls alone, they developed a team of 100 highly specialized agents that handled the worst of the worst cases. Over the course of my reporting, I've talked to almost 50 former employees at ADIABNB and seven or eight of those work directly on this elite unit. These safety agents, many of them come from military backgrounds or trauma backgrounds, they're trained to handle traumatic situations and to try and help people who are going through what may be the worst day in their lives. For these safety agents, a lot of them understood that they had a dual role. First and foremost, they wanted to protect the user in crisis, but they also knew they had a responsibility to protect the company's brand and public image. I mean, everything about housing in New York is a total mess and it's always chaotic. It's not too surprising that Airbnb's biggest battle has broken out here. 2015 was a really challenging year for Airbnb. Airbnb's listings between 2010 and 2014 were essentially illegal hotels. You know, the company was seven years old now. It had grown huge. It was now a household name, but by growing that big that fast, they also came up against a pushback in regulations. Now, Airbnb's under attack and a lot of men are still interested in it. Yeah, so what are they saying about this? They can't give up on New York because New York's too important for every kind of reason. They knew that they couldn't lose the battle in New York because it was one of their biggest markets and also it could result in a domino effect. If other cities around America saw New York City either backing down on regulations or enforcing stricter regulations, that could in turn be rolled out right across the country. I think it's going to be awkward when they have to put in their perspectives, their risk factors when they have to say, well, one risk is that the whole thing might be somewhat illegal in our biggest market. And in December of that year, a young woman from Australia flew into New York and stayed in an Airbnb with a group of her friends. They picked up a key from the local corner bodega without even needing identification. The police report said this 29-year-old woman left her friends at a midtown bar and returned to the Airbnb on her own. She thought that she was alone, but she wasn't. She was a man inside the apartment hiding in the shadows with a kitchen knife. He grabbed her, dragged her into a room, and raped her. He laid a fled. About an hour after this attack, he came back and police were in the apartment at the time. They opened his backpack and found three items of interest. The kitchen knife, one of the woman's earrings, and a set of keys to the Airbnb. This case was a really complicated one for Airbnb, partly because it occurred in New York City where they were fighting this really tough battle with city officials over regulations, and partly because the alleged rapist had the keys and he was inside the apartment. That meant that Airbnb needed to do what it could to protect itself. They wanted to find out, you know, how did he get the keys? That was a really big question for them. They launched an investigation to find that out. But before they did anything like that, before they thought to kind of protect their own reputation here, they really focused on doing what they could to help this young woman. They paid for her to move to a hotel.�� cars, the fibre of the Cab back. Saw himesty.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2619,2022-10-13 23:19:00
14394," to kind of protect their own reputation here. They really focused on doing what they could to help this young woman. They paid for her to move to a hotel. They paid for her mother to fly in from Australia. They paid for both of them to fly home. They offered to cover any health or leave or canceling costs that she might need later. But inside the company internally, they also launched an investigation. They wanted to know how did the alleged rapist get the keys. How did he get inside that year, B&B? And when they found out that the keys had been left at the corner of Odaiga, that then created a problem of liability for Airbnb. They didn't have a policy around key exchange. They didn't tell their hosts how they did or didn't have to hand keys over to guests as they were arriving. So for Airbnb, they also wanted to know what was going to be said in court. They wanted to know if any media were going to pick up on this story. And they wanted to know what the illegal liability potentially could be. A week later, the alleged rapist was indicted in the Supreme Court in New York. An Airbnb sent a staff member to find out if the company was going to be mentioned in any of the court records. And it wasn't. It wasn't mentioned in the police report. It wasn't mentioned by prosecutors. There's no mention of Airbnb really in any public record. This case has never been reported until now. And for Airbnb, that was kind of lucky. This case never landed in the media. And 18 months later, when this woman's lawyer reached out to the company, they signed a settlement for $7 million. And part of that settlement, there's a clause that says she cannot assert or imply responsibility on the part of the company. We've spoken to legal experts who indicate that what this really did is gag the woman from saying, I blame Airbnb. Airbnb is one of the few companies in the world that has this like online offline kind of hybrid situation, where you have users who meet online and then actually meet in the offline world and stay under the same roof. And that means that the company at the end of the day really has to take more responsibility than other social media platforms might do. With Airbnb's terms of service, that really means that whenever there's a dispute between hosts and guests and the company, this is all handled behind closed doors in arbitration. Most of these cases don't even make it to the courtroom. And when they do, the company will settle them so it doesn't go on through the courts. And what that means is that there hasn't really been a legal precedent that's set to determine what your B&B's liability is here. You know, is it really responsible for when things go wrong inside its listings? What I learned over the course of my reporting is that this is anything but simple. This is a complicated, nuanced area. There are difficult trade-offs here. The company also has to have hard, you know, tough conversations about policy. Airbnb's business model is based on strangers trusting one another. We often hear from the founders and the chief executive himself saying trust is their number one priority. I've actually heard Brian Cheske, the chief executive of Airbnb, talking about how he didn't build a website or a platform that allows people to stay in each other's homes. What he built was a community that trusts one another. And when that premises undercut, Airbnb's entire...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2620,2022-10-13 23:23:04
14395," that allows people to stay in each other's homes, what he built was a community that trusts one another. And when that premise is undercut, Airbnb's entire business model is under threat. So forms, earth view, sounds far-fetched at the moment doesn't it? But you know, we may be seeing ads like this in the not-too-distant future. Living away from Earth has always captured our imagination. As well as providing a basics for survival, these ideas are a symbol of human kinds unique creativity and ambition. This advanced base or a space station would be hit quad us for the final scent of the moon. Today the idea of multiple outposts where we can live and work in space has never seen closer. We're going to fly. It's about making our lives the best we can make it. It's about as a species having a path for our future. And the mission to create these habitats is well underway as private companies get ready to take that next giant leap. The International Space Station, it's the only space habitat we have. One of the first places they take you in the ISS is the Kupua. So you can finally look at the Earth in all its beauty and I don't care who you are, it's always stunning, it's shocking, it's amazing because that's the view you've been waiting for your entire life. It passes over 90% of the world's population without most of us ever realizing. And at an estimated cost of $150 billion it's the most expensive object we've ever built. You think about like the Sistine Chapel, the Pyramids and the Burj Khalifa or take your pick, I mean it far outstrips those. It's the one and only non-terrest real human outpost. We've had a constant human footprint in orbit for almost 20 years because of the International Space Station. The collaboration between 15 countries started construction in 1998 and was pieced together in space over the course of a decade. Since 2000 it's been a permanently crude research laboratory, a space habitat that's allowed human kind to live, manufacture and explore beyond Earth. The overarching achievement of the space station has been education. It has educated us about how to do research, it's educated us about how to live, it's educated us about the harshness of the environment that it is in. And it's about learning I think. People say what was one of your favorite parts about being up there, hands down floating everywhere I went. But your first impressions for ISS certainly is how big it is. The ISS is a size of an American football field. With most of that footprint taken up by eight solar arrays, these provide enough energy to power 40 homes. The station has an American side and a Russian side, as well as contributions from other nations like Canada, Japan and the European Union. Astronauts on board can pass freely between these sections. They're living and working areas are made up of modules, each 4.2 meters in diameter. And in total they have the same volume as the Boeing 747. The three main labs, Destiny Hope and Columbus, are conducting up to 600 ongoing experiments at...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2621,2022-10-13 23:27:15
14396," They have the same volume as a Boeing 747. The three main labs, destiny, hope and Columbus, are conducting up to 600 ongoing experiments at any one time. And while it's been a collaboration between governments to build and maintain the ISS, its next chapter will rely more on private enterprise. Today is a very remarkable day. NASA is opening the International Space Station to commercial opportunities and marketing these opportunities as we've never done before. Managing and maintaining the ISS costs $3.4 billion a year. That's over half NASA's Space Operations budget. Aging hardware and space debris will only add to these costs, which is why NASA is now hoping to pass some responsibility for the station over to commercial companies. We would like to see a robust commercial marketplace in lower-thorbit-where space stations exist outside of NASA. The goal being that NASA could be a customer and we want to have numerous providers that are competing against each other on cost and innovation. With federal funding proposed to stop in 2025, opening the station to private enterprise would free up resources for the space agency's ambitions to return to the moon and journey to Mars. Transfrancumverting a more commercial model is allowing industry to take over many of those areas that NASA has traditionally been responsible for. Like the design and operations and maintenance of space systems. But the most exciting part, I think, is new opportunities. The iPhones would have never come from the government, for instance. The base technology came from the government, but the way it's used, the way it interacts with consumers, governments aren't really built for that. So I think that will be exciting to see how private industry uses the same technology or the same systems within using them in a different way. Every NASA achievement has been the collaborative achievement of NASA and industry. What's going on right now that's a little bit different is NASA is turning to companies not to direct them what to do, but it's turning to companies to build relationships with them because those companies are attracting investment from non-space sources and are bringing a different kind of innovation to the table. In the shadow of NASA's sprawling Johnson Space Center, the headquarters of Startup Axiom Space might seem a little modest, but their goal is big to build the first commercial space station. Led by a former ISS program manager, the team has been involved in every mission to the station since its inception. We know it has to be much lower cost-operate on orbit than ISS today, so this is key to continuing the heritage of ISS. It's to start there so we can evolve everybody to the next platform. I liken this to the Internet. So the Internet was created and we got very excited. And any kid with a good idea and just the basic programming skills could go build a program to do something. We have huge companies that grew out of that, and still today there's new ideas, new things being built. The thing about a microgravity environment is it's limitless. It's like the data we have access to on the Internet is limitless. And it is not immediately obvious to us all the benefits that that's going to entail, but over time it will become very, very obvious. By 2024, Axiom plans to send a central node to attach to the ISS. That will make up the core of their new station. This will be followed by crew quarters for 16 people and research and manufacturing modules. When the ISS is retired, this will break away. An additional modules with a lifespan of 30 years will be added and swapped out as they age using a robotic arm. And they're hoping to do all of this for 150th, the cost of the ISS. I mean when you talk about our vision, it sounds really simple. It really is about driving the thought process and the cost down so that anybody that wants to take advantage of our place in orbit and a microgravity environment can do so. And that's really it. Okay, Ellen, I need to go towards my feet. The International Space Station is a fantastic vehicle. But one of the big things is they have quite a few major components outside. Which means you have to do an EVA or space.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2622,2022-10-13 23:31:54
14397," It's a fantastic vehicle, but one of the big things is they have a quite a few major components outside, which means you have to do an EVA, a spacewalk to go fix it. A spacewalk on a good day is a hundred hours of crew time to get ready and actually go do the spacewalk. So we're able to take advantage of the reduced size of components, and so our design is going to have all of the components that are going to be in the personalized environment. So we know what the basics are, you know, water, food, clothing, life support, and we know how to handle those. And now the next step is how do we make it more intuitive, and we want to now take advantage of the technologies and the capabilities have today to build more luxury into the experience. The objective is to make the environment the background for all the users. You're every day doing whatever you want to do on orbit, research, manufacturing, looking out the window. Whatever you're there to do, we want you to be able to do that not even think about the environment. And it's because of our experience on ISS and what the team brings to Axiom Space, we're able to build that environment. You won't worry about that. Three, two, one, release, release, release. Like Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin, Axiom is hoping to attract space tourists with tickets starting at $55 million for a 10-day mission. But that's just one part of the commercial space station market that they think could be worth $37 billion over the next decade. Our first commercial customers are countries who have astronauts in space and want to expand their activity in space, and countries who do not yet have a human space flight program who want to send people up. And we've now got both research and manufacturing companies who want to do work with us while we're at the International Space Station and on our platform after it separates from ISS. Human space flight is particularly exciting because it's that slice of space that is really nested. It hasn't undergone the crowding that satellites have had. It hasn't already had that explosive growth. It's really ready for that now. The first thing I'm really looking forward to seeing happen is the face of our first astronauts on orbit looking back down on us and knowing that we had a hand in sending that person to space. And ultimately the separation of ISS when it's ready to be retired and de-orbited and then we continue in space independently. For me that is a stepping-off moment for humanity. It's almost like when Neil Armstrong put that first boot on the moon. This will be the first time that we've gone from a platform of learning how to live in space to building our permanent home in space. Other private companies also want to use the ISS as a starting point for their own ventures. Bigelow Aerospace already has one of its inflatable structures attached to the station and others including Sierra Nevada and Nanorax have put forward proposals. Space habitats are expensive. I think it's a false dichotomy to say okay we're done with the International Space Station. Let's move on to commercial platforms. What I think is much more likely and realistic in what NASA is certainly driving toward is an incremental transition where commercial platforms attach to the space station or work collaboratively with the space station. The next chapter cannot occur without the active engagement of companies. That said that active engagement might not be as customers might not be as drivers. It might be in service of government mission objectives. We will return American astronauts to the moon not only to leave behind footprints and flags but to build the foundation we need to send Americans to Mars and beyond. This proposed mission along with SpaceX's own ambition to reach a red planet has opened up a longer-term market and some companies are already thinking beyond orbiting habitats like space stations to actually building on a surface of other planets. I was working in a firm designing skyscrapers and you know I saw Elon and he landed his Falcon X rocket in the middle of the ocean and that for me was a trigger. I thought wow this could actually happen and it's always been my dream to put a building on the moon or Mars and if he's going at the pace he's going it could definitely happen within my lifetime and I want to be the one to build it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2623,2022-10-13 23:36:10
14398," The moon are Mars and if he's going at the pace he's going it could definitely happen within my lifetime and I want to be the one to build it. In this warehouse, alongside startups from across the US, architecture firm AI Space Factory are refining the production of Marsha. A full story structure they created for a NASA competition to design the next generation of space habitats on Mars. When we started designing our Mars habitat Marsha, I think we looked at everything that had been done already and tossed that aside. But what we were given was a set of guidelines from NASA. They think the best way to build a habitat on Mars or the moon is to use what they call in situ resource utilization. So use the materials that are there. If you've seen sci-fi movies, you might see glass and steel domes on distant planets, but the reality is to ship that kind of material to the moon or Mars would be so absorbed to the moon that you would never be able to build in the first place. So the idea is to send a 3D printing robot which can then harvest the materials you find on a site and build with that. The reusable print material is a mix of biopolymer made from recycled plastic or plants like corn and sugar cane and basalt, a rock found on Mars and Earth. It's the rock that gives us its incredible strength. We've tested this material. It's three times as strong as concrete in compression. It actually has what we call it a tensile capacity and prevent itself from being pulled apart, which is something concrete is not very good at. You need to think at all times how do you optimize the amount of material that you use. And that's also why this thing is shaped like an egg. And if you think of an egg, it's a very structurally optimized form. It's very, very thin. But it provides the strength that the egg needs and that's why this is shaped the way that it is. The egg shape, as well as a nested shell structure, also accommodates for extreme differences in pressure and temperature on the surface of Mars. But more research still needs to be done to find out how print materials could be gathered and how 3D printing would work in a unique environment of space. You're dealing with a completely different set of physics and environments, which is very harsh, the cold, the low gravity, the vacuum of space. And finding solutions for how to build their own or do anything in space just requires a high degree of innovation. There's no such thing as brute force when it comes to space. Like you need to think about the problem, find a very elegant, lightweight, cost-effective solution. The next challenge is really going to places on Earth, literally taking the dirt that we're finding on a site and beginning to print with the dirt. We have to perfect this technology on Earth, and then we go prove it out on the Moon, and then finally on to Mars. The first customers could include NASA and companies like SpaceX, who would lease out these structures for individual missions. But before that, AI Space Factory hoped their technology could be monetized, as well as transformational here on Earth. The challenge is a building on Mars forced us to kind of make this jump in construction technology, which we can now apply on Earth, to build more sustainably. So rather than building with steel and concrete, which are these manufactured, very energy intensive materials, to go to a site, have a solar-powered array that would then allow our 3D printer to print in the most sustainable way possible. And we never would have found these ways that wasn't for the challenge of building in space. Three, two, one. In addition, and lift off the Falcon 9 to the Space Station, on the first commercial launch from Kennedy Space Centers, historic at 39A. Humans have now been consistently living and working in space for more than 15 years. And if we want to keep that up, what do habitats need to look like? And frankly, they can be larger, they can be small. But the future of space habitats really, to me, comes down to the ability to persistently maintain human presence. Whether that's a few people or many people, that seems to be the dividing line between where we were before and where we want to be in the future. We have to learn how to benefit from what we do on orbit and bring those natural benefits back home. So we help up our cells out on the ground while we also learn to live somewhere.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2624,2022-10-13 23:40:30
14399," learn how to benefit from what we do on orbit and bring those natural benefits back home so we help ourselves out on the ground while we also learn to live somewhere else. And it really, at the very deepest level, is about survival or species. So I get pretty excited when I spend a few moments thinking about what we're off to go do because this really is the first step to learning to live off the planet. That first step is just the start of our journey to create a lasting legacy in space. While commercial companies may be stepping in to imagine what these new space habitats look like, it's what's happening inside of them that may unlock the future of space and industrialisation. On the next episode of Giant Leap, we'll visit the private companies who are looking to build their business around manufacturing in space. Using the unique properties of microgravity, they plan to create new materials with extraordinary qualities that can't be replicated on Earth, including new manufacturing techniques that could change how we build large structures in space and even unlock the ability to 3D print full human organs. But before low Earth orbit can become a new industrial centre, we're going to need to take another giant leap. This is how it used to work. A real estate agent would lock in the client, they'd stage the place, hold an open house every single weekend, and hope that the right buyer walks through that door. 10 years ago, you could probably go look at a house and circle back two to three weeks later and still have an opportunity to make a bid. The first time I received a lead through Instagram, my mind was blown. If you're seeing something in a neighbourhood that is established, you have two to three days after the open house in this market to make an offer. Our world has shifted so much. Folks are getting comfortable doing business either through social media or 100% virtual. Social media, like everything else it touches, has turned the real estate business upside down. You've heard this trope before, millennials aren't buying and owning as much as their parents' generation, be it a car, a diamond, or a home. But the lack of ownership is not always by choice. In 2018, a survey found that 89% of millennial Americans want to buy a home. They just can't afford it. As of 2019, millennials of all stripes owned only 5% of US housing, compared with 15% for GenXers. Millennials haven't been able to make these big ticket purchases the same way as their predecessors did. Now this is down to the financial crisis. We have rising student loan debt and a higher cost of living. Now, millennials are getting older. They're earning more money and saving more. So now is about the time where a lot of them are going out and making those purchases. And now, having been stuck at home for over a year, the same generation that embraced ubers and Airbnb's wants something to call their own. I got married and I have a child, so looking for more space and felt about a conventional route of young and single living in the city and then move out to the suburbs we have a kid and a wife.

14400," of young and single living in the city and then move out to the suburbs we have a kid in a wife. I've seen a whole bunch of my friends just move on down to the west Palm Beach, my amy area, Austin, Texas. So they are certainly moving out of the city but space was top of mind for them moving out. We lived in Williamsburg for about 16 plus years and week two in the pandemic we just realized we needed more so we started looking for a house right away. We now live in Gosha, New York which is about an hour and a half from New York City. Instagram accounts like circa houses and cheap old houses offer a glimpse into the perfect suburban life. Often at a price point not too dissimilar to what adults pay for rent in major cities. By the end of 2020 New Yorkers who didn't flee paid an average of $2,700 a month for an apartment even as rent prices plummeted during the pandemic. Millennials make a large percentage of spending right now and that makes them a valuable consumer for brands. That means they're being courted by everyone out there to spend with them. They grew up online. They're comfortable with pretty much anything that you can do there and that's that's buying things, selling things, Craigslist, eBay, all that. Making a $100 purchase on Craigslist or a $1000 purchase on eBay, it's not that much of a leap to go even further if you're buying a fancy piece of jewelry or a house for a million bucks. The uptick and home demand fueled by the pandemic combined with record low interest rates has made home buying extremely competitive over the last year. So much so that some millennials look to social media to shop and actually buy their first house site unseen. I saw sort of something on my Instagram feed and you know clicked and we ended up seeing this house. Houses weren't really being shown at that time because we were in full lockdown. We became really interested in one YouTube video, 20 Z-LO photos and that is it. The Red Hot Housing Market spells opportunities for developers targeting this demographic, getting eyeballs strictly through social media. People are not looking in the the back section of the times anymore for real estate listings. Our demographic is between late 20s to mid 40s and that demographic is spending a lot of time on social media and they're doing a lot of shopping via Instagram and other social media platforms. This is Joshua Gelb and Pepe Hamburger. During the pandemic the two New York City-based developers started Neville House, a new construction project two hours north of the city. Unlike most traditional real estate listings, the pair bypassed the use of a broker and advertised their homes directly on Instagram. No fees, no commissions. You used to have to hire a broker, work with them, they would do showings on site. Now you basically put your renderings on Instagram and within an hour you have 15, 20 replies saying can I come see it directly with you and let's see it tomorrow and it's just completely changed the game. Most people have that image in their head of the quit-essential upstate modern cabin set in the woods. We've definitely tried to tap into that and create something that's attainable for these people. Say you can have that. You can be swiping through Instagram and that can be your home too. There's been quite a proliferation of these direct to consumer brands. There's just tons of them out there. It's not that hard to start up a website that sells things and get things manufactured for that e-commerce platform. So like all birds with shoes, casper with mattresses or Warby Parker with glasses. All of that means a lot more opportunity for brands in the online shopping space. So it's natural that real estate would want to get involved as well with these big ticket items. 10 years ago the broker would drive the search. Now I think that my clients text me listings. They have alerts. They find things quicker than we do sometimes because we're out and about. I'd say that the buyer is much more involved these days. Social selling is creating brand new ways to shop. So let's look at vintage clothing for example. There are sellers on Instagram finding successful ways to sell one of a kind item. It's that fleeting nature, the ephemeral nature of social media. You post the item online and whoever's first gets that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2626,2022-10-13 23:49:11

Now real estate has similar scarcity to it. There's one place to buy. It's one home, one apartment, one thing. It's one of a kind. But the rise in social media real estate isn't just about the instant gratification. Researcher Andre Perry, who studies economic inclusion at the Brookings Institute, says social media has evolved from the days of online hangout spaces and mood boards to a powerful change agent. Social media is a primary source to get news and information. But it's not just about social media. It's about the movement that we're in. The racial justice uprising really gave people a sense of worth and empowerment. And so people not only are getting information about what protects people in the long run from economic shocks, things like wealth. In his research, Andre found that not only are more millennials buying homes during the pandemic, the rate of home ownership among black millennials are at historic highs. The fastest way to accumulate wealth in this country traditionally has been through home ownership. Millennials in particular are saying, hey, I want protection. I want to live longer. I want my education to go further. Let me acquire wealth and the fastest way to do that is through home ownership. When the pandemic hit many of the amenities or the comforts that came along with those living conditions were gone. Folks couldn't go to bars and fancy shops and so you saw instead of people going out and buying clothes, they saved their money and bought property and outside of the city generally. People are moving to the suburbs, to rural areas, places where home prices are a little bit cheaper. Many home buyers are looking for houses outside the major metropolitan areas. Additionally, many home buyers are looking for direct outdoor access and added space as the uncertainty about the virus persist. Millennials are also looking to influencers not just for the latest trends and tick-tock dances, but to partake in important conversations, be it about politics or personal finance or anything in between. Real estate ownership. Let's start small. Let's don't be scared to start small instead instead of renting a big house and a heels and California like most artists do buy you one that's on the flat. I meet folks like Brandon Ruhlin, Charlemagne the God. You have residential real estate and you have commercial real estate. They're talking about buying homes. When I was coming out, really home buying was a mysterious, shrouded process that only a few people could teach me. Now I can easily log on to Clubhouse or Instagram and find literally lessons on how to purchase a home, but done with savvy and finesse. Today we're going to make a greenhouse. I am DIY-ing the entire closet. Heather, having bought her fixer upper site on scene, also looked to internet personalities to help figure out how to modernize and to make sure her home was also an investment. It gave us a lot of confidence. They make it look super easy. How we could do all of those things ourselves. My husband just installed a laundry shoe, which is something we never would have thought of if we didn't see an influencer do that and how easy it actually is. Really simple to do it yourself, project. You can do that. You have any questions. Go ahead and message me. In the case of Neville House, Josh and Paley hope that buyers see these homes as potential secondary income. These young families look at these products and look at our homes and say, here's a turn key. This can serve our family, but this can also be the perfect rental. We've tried to strike a balance in the design of the home for working well as a family home. That's going to be lived in and also working as an investment. A lot of this points to how millennials can utilize and leverage social media to their benefit. But it also speaks to, again, this moment that folks want freedom. So millennials are really stepping up to this real estate game and until you're done.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2627,2022-10-13 23:53:27

Of course, not everything is as it seems online. While social media can be a useful tool for learning, there's still a lot it can't tell you about the home buying experience, or living in the suburbs for that matter. We knew going into it, budgeting for a lot of renovations. We kind of thought if we buy it at $450, we could put to $300,000 into the house and really make it ours and our own. I can't wait to replace in this kitchen and update our built-in deep fryer, which was not in the listing photos. We kind of got into the house and we realized that budget was completely unrealistic. We have a lot of people who see our design on Instagram, they say, I love it. Can you come build this on my property? And then they'll send us the lot, which they bought, site unseen during COVID, and because of site conditions or zoning, it's virtually unbuildable. I think we all know that what you see on Instagram and what you see in real life are two very different things. So while we can definitely, as brokers, create these fantastic narratives, the one recommendation that I would give is do your homework. Don't believe everything you say. That's not to say that there's dishonesty or anything where people are trying to manipulate you, but not everything you see is accurate. This shift towards social media house hunting may also help to bring equilibrium to a market that has historically disadvantaged specific groups of buyers. Many of the traditional ways that people get mortgages or loans often precluded black people because they deemed us too risky for those loans. With technology, there's ways to get around that. As long as more black people get educated on racism and discrimination and lending, we're going to figure out ways to get around that racism. When I was 24 years old, I saw the UFC on a paper view on TV, and I was so overwhelmed by the athleticism, the skill, and then at the end of the fight, the combatants hugged, they shook hands, and I just fell in love with it. Part of UFC's appeal is it doesn't look like a balletic display of martial talent and mastery as much as it looks like a bar fight. We choose to do this because we love this sport, but it is a business. And if you do not treat it like a business, I guarantee you that the promoter is, and you will be left broken, broken at the end of your career. Each of us have an individual story, but as with anything you take enough of these individual stories and you see not only crossover but intersectionality. A group of former UFC fighters that are suing the UFC scored a key legal victory on Thursday when a federal judge said he would grant their lawsuit-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2628,2022-10-13 23:57:47
