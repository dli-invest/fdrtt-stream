12435," This is about my neck broken. I had my left ankle broken, had to get that repaired. I've had a torn right labor in my shoulder. He broke my eyeball. I mean the bone holds up my eyeball. I've had my left eye orbital fracture twice where my eye caved in. I was walling my own blood. I knew, don't blow your nose or both eyes or blow. At the time that UFC was bought for just $2 million by the former boxing coach Dana White and a casino owner he'd been friends with, Lorenzo Fertita and his brother Frank Fertita. UFC was struggling as were other mixed martial arts promoters. It was pretty much a fixer-upper. The money that they spent to actually purchase it for $2 million was much less than the money they quickly had to sink into it in order to revitalize it. They've hold off a multi-pronged strategy that was quite successful. First they did what White has referred to as running towards regulation. They found ways to make compromises with state regulators so that the sport would not be illegal. And at the same time, they also popularized it. They made gambles like paying the production costs themselves for the first season of a reality TV show, the Ultimate Fighter on Spike TV. It's all over! It is all over! Delegal Sanchez! It is! The Ultimate Fighter! UFC, under Dana White, had a gift for weaving, compelling personal narratives and rivalry. People throwing shoes, a guy coming to the octagon with who let the dogs out playing while he was dragging another guy on a leash. Who would you go now? Go go go go! My first contract with the UFC is kind of an interesting story because here I am on this reality show, The Ultimate Fighter. And they started to realize how big of a stepping stone this was going to be for the UFC. It's at us all down individually. Put a contract in front of us and said, Hey, we realized that this is going to be huge and we really want to have you all a part of the UFC family moving forward. So we want to go ahead and get this out of the way. Just sign this simple contract and we'll be able to move forward as one unit. But as I'm looking at this thick contract and wondering what I should do, Dana White looks at me and says, Don't worry, this thing takes off. We'll take care of you. The fighters would say, at the heart of UFC's power, is the contract that it signs with fighters. Before boxing had competition boxing used to be dominated by a few dominant promoters and the contracts were ported over from boxing. And the contracts are basically designed to control every aspect of a fighter's career. They're long-term. They last multiple fights. Fighters under these contracts are bound to fight only for UFC for a period of time. And UFC can extend that time if a fighter declines a match or if a fighter gets injured. They control who the fighter fights. They control when the fighter fights. And then they have a number of different clauses that make it very difficult for a fighter to ever break free from UFC if that fighter ever did want to become a creation. Contracts are so one-sided. There really is no negotiation room for any of the things, especially as you're coming up and as their stranglehold on the sport of MMA, they got so much stronger. Part of what's at the heart of this lawsuit is the ways that UFC successfully took other competitors off the board. The UFC had such a stranglehold on mixed martial arts. And as they were buying up so much of the competition, shutting them all down, they really became the only option for anybody that wanted to do this professionally. If you follow Dana White's Twitter or watch him on YouTube, you could have seen Dana White calling himself the grim reaper and bragging about how he has defeated or derailed or acquired one after another.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,661,2022-10-08 00:04:01
12436," Calling himself the grim reaper and bragging about how he has defeated or derailed or acquired One after another company that tried to compete with the UFC in 2011 UFC acquired strike force which at the time was the most prominent rival still standing Conley is unbelievable. It was a great buy this year for one more time Scott Smith and The CEO of strike force Scott Koker Has said in the past that he saw himself like Luke Skywalker up against the Death Star trying to compete with UFC Eventually when strike force was bought out by UFC My only option was go to you because they had to rest in my contract now. I'm under a Conjure it's only an 18 month contract with six fights, but five years later. I'm still stuck in the contract The month before UFC's parent company Zufa completed its acquisition Of strike force a UFC executive sent an email and the subject line of that email was we own MMA And the UFC has admitted in documents that have now become public that they've almost never lost a fighter that they wanted to keep In internal UFC emails we now know The company referred to what it was doing as Choking off oxygen to the competition the most important oxygen that UFC allegedly Ranafowl of the law by cutting off to its competitors is the fighters themselves And not only did they make it clear to us they made it clear to the whole mixed martial arts world There is no negotiating these are our very strict never-ending contracts and that's the case of this day The UFC just says oh you want to fight for us you sign here if you don't want to we've got 20 other guys that'll take your spot They have 70 80 90% of the top fighters under exclusive contract meaning that those fighters are not available to any other MMA promoter and fighters even if they wiggled their way out of the very restrictive contracts that UFC imposed on them Didn't have another professional mixed martial arts option because there weren't robust rivals to go sell their work to On Tuesday afternoon a class action lawsuit was filed in US District Court in San Jose against Zufa LLC with fighters Kung Lee, Naked Corey and John Fitch attached to the suit Rampe Jackson came to me says hey, come I know this lawyer he will help get the fairness for the fighters on You know in the marketplace and I decided I wanted to step up for all the fighters that being affected At the end of 2014 more than six years ago now Group of now all former fighters filed Anti-trust class action lawsuit against UFC and in broad terms the case is an antitrust case Where we're claiming that the UFC is both a monopoly and a monopsony usually when we talk about monopoly We're talking about the power that a company has when it becomes the only one selling something Monopsony is about the power of being a monopoly Purchaser of something and particularly a monopoly purchaser of labor a Key argument in this lawsuit has been about as UFC succeeds and it's",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,662,2022-10-08 00:08:01
12437," company purchaser of labor. A key argument in this lawsuit has been about as UFC succeeds and its revenue sores, how much should we expect that absent illegal conduct, the fighters pay would soar as well. In UFC, year after year, the share of the company's revenue that goes to actually paying the workers doing the fighting has hovered around or below 20%. And what this analysis shows through complex statistical regression modeling is that if the UFC was competitive and did not allegedly violate the antitrust laws, it would pay its fighters 50% or more of the revenues is generated just like baseball, just like hockey, just like basketball, boxing. If instead of paying 20% of the revenues generated, it paid 50% or more of the revenues generated, the fighters would have made $1.6 billion more during the period that we measured 2010 to 2017. Sometimes when you write about allegations against companies and particularly about lawsuits against companies, those companies don't want to say a whole lot about them or are pretty dismissive of the significance of litigation against them. UFC in their comments to me has been pretty feisty about this, saying that they see this lawsuit actually as a threat to the ability of businesses to take risks and succeed, and that they don't want to roll over, that they want to fight it and they want to defeat it. The fighters I talked to described having side jobs, being reliant on UFC in part because after taxes and expenses, they weren't making enough money to feel financially secure. The overview of my career from a financial perspective is something that had a challenge in admitting, I can tell you now that I lived in my mom's attached caravans the entire time I was fighting and I had a second job as a boutser to bartender, a third job as a personal trainer, just to make ends meet. Nate Quarry told me that over his time in UFC, he fought fights while he was tens of thousands of dollars in debt coming into the fight. It gets so disheartening because I've seen fights that are called the fight of the year. This is just this brutal war and they battled for four and a half rounds until one guy's body just gave up and then you find out, oh that guy made $60,000 for that fight. In one of the hearings in this lawsuit, UFC's attorney argued that if the fighters were really the product, if all that UFC were selling were the fighters, then the fighters wouldn't need UFC at all, that a fighter is not themselves the UFC product any more than an Apple engineer who makes a cool iPhone is the product that Apple is selling. We the fighters make this whole thing happen and it's been driven by Chuck Ladell, it's been driven by Radik and Taurus, it's been driven by Conor McGregor, it's been driven by Brock Lesnar, it's been driven by all the greats that have walked before us and that walk this path right now. We are the product. If the fighters are not the product, then go ahead and release us from our contracts. You'll do fine without us, clearly. It's the identity and rank and popularity of those fighters that attract the eyeballs and make the sport what it is and if you can lock all those up and keep them from other promotions, you can dominate the sport, which is what they've admitted they've done. William Isaacson, a lawyer for UFC, said in a statement that UFC has spent many years building a world-class organization, enhancing the brand of our athletes and championing the sport of MMA. UFC pays its fighters more than any other MMA promoter with average fighter compensation rising by over 600% since 2005. Our efforts have raised the global popularity of the sport and the overall revenue potential of all MMA organizations.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,663,2022-10-08 00:12:30
12438," over 600% since 2005. Our efforts have raised the global popularity of the sport and the overall revenue potential of all MMA organizations and athletes. In December of 2020, the judge announced a crucial step in this lawsuit, which is that he is going to certify it as a class action. Class certification makes this lawsuit a much more significant threat to UFC and the judge made clear long before saying how he planned to rule that he expected whatever he did to be appealed into federal appeals court and on from there to the US Supreme Court. So we are likely in for many more months and years of wrangling over this. Kyle Pingsbury said that he doesn't think any settlement would be acceptable unless it includes a change to the restrictive contracts that UFC uses to keep fighters bound to the UFC. My son's about to turn six years old and it started when he was in the womb. We're in this thing to the end to change the sport forever. We want the same freedoms that are offered in any other major sport and we're every other major sport has gone through what we're going through right now. People tell fighters, you know, just shut up. Look at how lucky you are. Well, no, actually we're fighting for what we believe in. We're going to continue being fighters and that's how we are made. Every nation that's a coastal state has some region of the sea floor that falls in their territorial waters and many countries including the US, the area that's under water exceeds the area that's above water. So huge amounts of nations, areas and regions are just really unexplored, uncharacterized. We don't really know what's there. We know less about our sea bed than we do about the surface of the moon or Mars. Only 20% of it has been mapped. A map of the sea floor could lead to all kinds of discoveries like numerous species and rare earth minerals like cobalt that we need for electric cars and mobile phones. The value of all the gold deposits are known on the sea floor as estimated to be around $150 trillion. A map could also help us when tragedy strikes. Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared from radar screens. The mapping of the ocean floor has been carried out. Problem is that the southern Indian ocean is just so incredibly huge. To me, a map is a fundamental piece of understanding of who we are, where we are, where things are. Once you understand something, you start to value it more. When you start to value something, that's when you start to really think about making it healthy and preserving it and keeping it going. A map is the first step. It's the basic understanding that you need to figure out where you are. Oceans. They cover over 70% of the planet, but most of what lies underneath is a mystery.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,664,2022-10-08 00:17:07
12439," Oceans. They cover over 70% of the planet, but most of what lies underneath is a mystery. The sea floor is a really fascinating landscape. We don't have a lot of data to describe the shape of it in detail, but in places where we do, there are spectacular features, there's meandering channels with all kinds of interesting topography, there are canyons, there are sea mounds, mid ocean ridges, all kinds of things that we see on land that are just basically hidden from us by the water. As it stands, this is what a map of the sea bed looks like. All that black? Those are the parts we haven't mapped yet. At present, most people think that the sea floor is actually mapped because you'll see a world-ocean map and you can see some shape of the sea floor, but most of that is based on prediction. Roughly 80% of what you see for the world-ocean floor is modeled based on measurements of the sea surface height and a computation based on gravity. In 2017, the Nippon Foundation and the General Bathometric Chart of the Oceans, or Jebco, launched Sea Bed 2030. It's a collaborative project to collect and collate data ocean-wide and create a complete map of the sea floor by the end of the decade. To do this would take one ship around 350 years at a cost of up to $3 billion. That's why data is harvested by all kinds of vessels from fishing boats to freighters. Because there is so little data, it's important that vessels that are capable and willing to acquire data when they're just moving around the ocean do so. So we have a lot of data that's collected during transit. There's a lot of academic requirements to make data publicly available. There's industry data that's starting to become more and more available, there's government data. So there's a lot of different ways that this data is coming in and it's a really messy and challenging puzzle to put together. But what's exciting is that it's a puzzle to put together. Since Sea Bed 2030 launched, the area map has risen to 20% and all the information collected is freely available. The more data we have collectively and other people can access, the faster the discoveries are made, which really pushes forward our understanding at a faster rate than if you held onto that data and it was only you with that data. Things like machine learning and artificial intelligence are also going to kick in in the next decade. Because with all this data, they'll be able to make connections that are a lot faster than perhaps we would have been able to, which then again feeds our human understanding and also gives us new ideas, new ways of thinking, of exploration. Until the early 20th century, mapping technology was simple, usually a weight attached to a long rope known as a lead line. After the Titanic sank in 1912, explorers proposed using sound waves to find its hole in the North Atlantic. This led to Sonar, the most common technique used for mapping today. Operated by the Schmidt Ocean Institute, the Falcourt is an 82 meter long research vessel equipped with two multi beam Sonar systems that have helped Deborah Smith and a team of other marine technicians to map over a million square kilometers of the sea floor. You know, you go from somebody with a rope with some knots to sonar acoustics, that is, I call it, math magic. But it is incredibly advanced mathematical technology to be able to measure the distance and time of travel of sound on a moving ship. Multi beam mapping works by using sonars. So sonar is taking sound and measurement of time. So you have a multi beam sonar and it sends out a ping of sound. That sound travels through the water column, hits the sea floor and comes back to the ship and we measure that time and we're able to calculate the distance. Each individual ping of sound has many, many beams. So it looks like a giant fan across the sea floor and that fan is moving along the sea floor. So you have many tiny little beams going across and they're traveling along a track. You can look at that data and look at both of them.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,665,2022-10-08 00:21:15
12440," And they're traveling along a track. You can look at that data and look at both the peaks and the valleys and the highs and the lows and create a three-dimensional image of the sea floor. The accuracy of multibim sonar really depends on the water depth that you're in. Think of it like a flashlight beam. And if you're holding a flashlight and you're shining it on the floor, the closer you get to the floor with your flashlight, the smaller that beam is. If you have 400 of these beams all across, I think of 400 people holding a flashlight. The closer they hold that flashlight to the sea floor, the smaller your beam is, which also means the smaller that you can find information or data about. So it really depends on the depth of the sea floor in order to see how much you can define an object. This variation in depth means that mapping resolution will range from 100 by 100 meters in shallow waters to 800 by 800 meters in the deepest parts of the ocean, which go down as far as 11,000 meters. Remotely operative vehicles or ROVs can then be sent down to investigate sea bed features up close. We've just crossed the 1000 meter mark. It's 4.6 degrees C and now we're going to drive the ROV down at a high rate towards the sea floor. On a recent mapping expedition, scientists on the Falcon discovered a 500 meter tall coral structure in Australia's Great Barrier Reef, the first to be discovered in over 120 years. A place that is incredibly popular, well-visited, well-traveled, we're still finding new things. You don't know until you map it. And so until you get that high resolution picture, you don't know the sand waves or the old river beds that used to be there, or the waterfalls off the side of a volcano that used to be above the surface and now is below the surface. It's a little bit of everything. Think of let's say Hawaii or someplace where you see a volcano above the water, picture that below the water. I'm really kind of obsessed with the whole concept of scale here. Although we can create 3D models and kind of come up with these visualizations, it's not the same as that feeling of looking out over this big landscape. But I mean, I think we'll get there soon with VR and other kinds of technology, but it's really spectacular to think about, especially with the familiarity that some of us have with these features, like what it looks like. We look out at the ocean and it just looks flat, maybe with little bumps. We really don't think about all of this that's underneath. And it's really an amazing landscape that's just hidden from us. With more than 90% of the ocean deeper than 200 meters, fleets of autonomous vehicles could make the data gathering process faster, cheaper and safer. And new discoveries might help with exploration of all kinds. I think the ocean can actually provide us with huge insights as we go out into space as well and look for life and other kinds of life forms. I also think in this next few years, we will have a different kind of access to the ocean because of virtual reality and augmented reality. And so that will allow us to sit in our living rooms and really experience what's underwater in a different way and see at this different alien planet.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,666,2022-10-08 00:26:07
12441," Since the dawn of man, meat has been on the menu. And even with growing trends of vegetarian diets and plant-based substitutes, around 89% of the world population consider themselves omnivores. We've come a long way from our hunter and gatherer roads. We have managed to establish a whole industry designed to feed almost 7.7 billion people. We've maximized production and we managed to reduce hunger over the past couple of decades. And although we've become exceedingly efficient at putting meat on the table, raising livestock animals by the billions comes with its own set of consequences. If animal agriculture continues to expand the way it has, there is a race that we won't be able to stop climate change. But with rapid advances in technology, we might soon see a food industry that leaves all those problems behind. I'm Bait to be one of the world's first commercial customers for lab-grown meat, cultured meat. It's eat-just as the company and I'm very, very excited. Here is the chicken. It's pretty crispy outside. It's really good. I mean, look, it's really tasty. Here at 1880 in Singapore, cultured chicken is being served under a regulatory approval granted by the Singaporean government. It's the very first time a cultured meat product, meat made from animal cells grown in a lab, has been approved for commercial sale. Eat-just, the company behind these chicken nuggets style dishes is based out of San Francisco and got their start in 2011, developing plant-based egg substitutes, like mung bean scrambled eggs and mayonnaise. But it wasn't until 2017 that they announced they were shifting focus to a cultured meat product. In order to feed the world that we live in, a lot of animal protein, we need to take a third today and it'll be more tomorrow of our world and make it dedicated to feeding chickens and cows. We go to areas that are filled with biodiversity rainforests, taking a bulldozer to them and planting soine corn to feed the chickens that we climate change is accelerated by the kind of animal production that we engage in. When we bring animals in tiny little spaces, it accelerates the probability that more zoonotic diseases are going to impact our families. And from a morality perspective, why do we need to cause any harm to any other living thing, to have dinner that tastes good? It does not have to be that way and those things underlie the force of this idea. The meat alternatives that have made it to the market thus far have been plant-based. Immutation beef and pork made from ingredients like pea protein and coconut oil by companies like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods. That's a very different proposition from cultured meat, which is made from actual animal cells. On the huge fan of any company, of any person trying to make a product that's improving the food system, including all the plant-based proteins, maybe in some future menu you'll have this kind of cultivated chicken and you'll also have a plant-based version. That's fine, but I guess you have to ask yourself in our lifetime, is that diner likely to also remove the conventional option on the menu too? We do think we need a more permanent solution. We do think we certainly need, if you will, an in-game to this problem, and we just think this is more likely to be the path to achieve that. So animal cell technology has been around for several decades for applications such as development of vaccines and other biotherapeutics. The first known prototype of cultured meat was done by Mark Posts earlier in 2011, and essentially it was developing beef patty. It was a very expensive prototype.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,667,2022-10-08 00:29:55
12442," Essentially, it was developing beef patty. It was a very expensive prototype. If I'm not mistaken, above 250,000 euros at the time to produce just one beef patty, it was more of a group of concepts to really demonstrate that this technology is possible and that it can be done. The way that we grow and produce culture chicken is essentially a weak isolate chicken cells from the chickens without having to kill them. So from a small biopsy, for instance, we immerse these cells in a liquid broth that contains the nutrients that the cells need to survive and be healthy and to grow. We really need these cells to multiply to reach the numbers that are sufficient to make a meat product. We're looking into the cells that are really important for meat, so we think about muscle cells, fat cells, by the isolation, we are able to form those muscle tissues in culture. The culture happens inside of a fermentation tank, what we call the bioreactor, which is essentially providing the same conditions as the animal body. Warm temperatures, some sort of mechanical stimulation, so that the cells that are exposed to very similar conditions that they have inside of the animal. After the cells proliferate and reach a certain density, the final step is essentially to separate those cells from the liquid broth that they are in. We just make sure that the product needs our quality and safety standards, and then those cells are ready for consumption. Milk, cheese, yogurt, a lot of those derived from fermentations, the only difference is that they are starting from a different cell type. In this case, we're just using the animal cells as the initial and beginning of the product. Eatjust has developed chicken nuggets so far with far more textured chicken breast plan for the future. But another cell-based meat startup, Memphis Meets, has already started working on culturing other animal cells as well. We've done beef, we've done duck, we've done chicken, and these are things that are favourites in various parts of the world. For instance, people in America love beef and chicken. People in China love duck, so we wanted to show that we at Memphis Meets can produce meats that we as a global population love to eat. There's a lot of similarity on how we grow the meats from various animals or fish. But they're also different because of nutrients they need, and how they actually come together to form the final product of meat. And I think it's very similar to how we also grow various animals. There's similarities in the feed that we gave cows and pigs and chickens, but there's also differences how we cultivate, and it's very similar for us as well. So we've been working with the FDA and the USDA for the last three years, and really developing the guidelines on how this food should be regulated when we come to the market. As soon as we get regulatory approval in the United States, people will be able to go to the supermarket and buy it and enjoy it. They'll be able to go to a restaurant near them and order meat directly from animal cells. But it's not just getting the meat right. Once approved, the gates open to a very high potential demand, and scaling becomes the next big hurdle. Before we can only make chicken for myself, my friends, my girlfriend, my family, my colleagues, now we actually have the ability to make chicken for millions of people. So that allows us to invest in to allow the economies to scale to drop the price. The second is we need to reduce the cost of the nutrients that these cells are consuming. So they chicken feed, raises, or drops a price of chicken. The nutrients we feed ourselves does the same things. We need to drive that down. The cell density is another technical element. We need to continue to increase that, and hammering on those things of the course in the next five, 10, 15 years. We'll put us in a place where we're significantly below the cost of this animal protein. And that will be one of the main inflection points that we'll lead to a new way of eating meat. So here is a close-up of a half-eaten crispy chicken bite. You know what? What I'm really thinking is, just a meaty chicken. I like chicken. You know, the normal chicken's eat, I don't know where they came from. And so I don't know why I should be very stressed where this came from either. F Bachelor's Redeemer、 Oven순 yapt, S quasir.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,668,2022-10-08 00:34:41
12443," No, the normal chickens eat, I don't know where they came from. And so I don't know why I should be very stressed where this came from either. The meat market is worth more than $1 trillion annually, and there are over 60 startups in the cultured meat field. Cultured meat has attracted several prominent investors, including Sergi Brin, Richard Branson, and Bill Gates. What is also interesting is that even meat giants such as Cargill and Tyson have invested in space. It's this destructive potential of the market, as well as the promise to greatly reduce the climate impact of meat production that has attracted investors. It remains to be seen who will get regulatory approval in which countries, and whether consumers will like lab ground meat enough to make the switch. And while there's no evidence that lab ground meat is any less healthy than traditional meat, there's an ongoing debate over how healthy eating meat is in general. But if these products are a success, they could be the beginning of a more humane, less destructive meat industry. The food and ag industry is the most innovative industry in the world. It's always figured out how to feed a growing population, and we've never failed doing so. And it's been very clear to us that we are part of that, and we're going to figure out how to feed the next three billion people joining us. And I just see an evolution. We can do this a bit differently. We can do this in a way that is consistent with the kind of people that we want to be, the kind of planet that we all want to live in. We can build a food system that reflects really the best characteristics of who we are, and that makes me really helpful. In possible foods might be the world's most ambitious company. Just listen to founder and CEO Pat Brown. People wonder how big the plant-based meat industry is going to be. It will be the meat industry in 20 years. We're going to look back and basically say, wow, remember back in the day when we used to his animals to make meat? Yes, impossible stated goal really is to replace the use of animals as a food production technology globally by 2035. That would mean supplanting a $1.2 trillion industry, not to mention a source of sustenance as old as time. To be fair, the company has got a lot of people talking about its products. So there's this thing called the impossible burger. What's called artificial meat, the realest, fakes, burger in the world. Not bad. But before impossible foods can take over the world, it's going to have to overcome strong competitors, penetrate tough new markets, and generally transform its product from a conversation piece into a ubiquitous staple food. With the coronavirus turning the world of food upside down, this could be the moment when impossible's new fangled meat goes mainstream. Impossible foods was founded in 2011 when Pat Brown, a longtime vegan, was nearing the end of an accomplished career in biochemistry. I've been a scientist my whole life and just came to this realization that by far the most important scientific question in the world is, what makes me delicious? Pat Brown, someone call a zealot for his mission. He really doesn't hold",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,669,2022-10-08 00:38:39
12444," The question in the world is, what makes meat delicious? Pat Brown, someone called a zealot for his mission. He really doesn't hold back when it comes to talking about wanting to completely replace animal agriculture. Producing meat from animals is the most destructive technology on Earth. And if we're going to avert catastrophic climate change, we have to find a better way to produce meat. You've probably heard about the dangers of cow flatulence. Their digestive systems produce large quantities of the powerful greenhouse gas, methane. In fact, it's estimated that livestock farming is responsible for nearly 15% of all greenhouse gas emissions. Impossible claims it takes 89% less GHGs, 87% less water, and 96% less land to produce its burger. The key, of course, would be to get people to actually eat the thing, which is where the company's secret ingredient comes in. Him, a genetically engineered substance with a bloody iron rich taste like red meat. So, him is a very controversial part of the impossible burger. It's also what makes the impossible burger what it is. There are a lot of consumer groups and anti-GMO groups that oppose the impossible burger because of the heme. The studies on its safety are a pretty short term. But the FDA has approved it, and the company says it's completely safe. And there isn't any evidence that it isn't. Critics have also challenged the company's claim to health advantages over traditional meat, pointing out that while the impossible burger has less fat, sodium, and calories than its beefy cousin, it's also more highly processed. But let's be real, we're talking about minicking hamburgers here, not kale salads. These burgers are definitely better for the environment, so that's a plus. But they are not necessarily better for your health. After years in the lab, Patton's colleagues were confident they had a product even Ron Sponson could love. And the impossible burger made its debut in 2016. Their burger began its life in the public when it was sold at David Chang's Bama Fuku. And they went from sort of higher-end, fine dining restaurants into higher-end burger restaurants, like Bare Burger and Mommy Burger. And then suddenly they started popping up everywhere. It tastes like a burger. It tastes like meat. This is all made from plants. All made from plants. This tastes like meat. Doesn't it just look like real meat? So meat-like. They always say it's what they say. It tastes like a burger. It tastes like yuckers. The foam is the world's relics. No, it doesn't taste like a burger. Opinions differed on the impossible burger's relative meatiness. But the debate itself was fantastic free advertising, helping to propel impossible into major chains like white castle. And then in the summer of 2019 into more than 7,000 burger kings across the US. To date, the company has raised over a billion dollars and a funding round in March valued the company at around 4 billion. But fake meat is a happening space these days and impossible faces some daunting competition. So I'm now for the stock of the hour. And that is beyond meat shares of the faux meat or plant-based protein company that's so boring today. Beyond meat is also making a very meaty burger from plants. They're very non-GMO. They stress that all the time to differentiate themselves from impossible. It'll be much easier to genetically modify plant material to make it take on the texture and appearance and aroma of animal protein. But we won't do that. Beyond meat had one of the biggest IPOs of the year in 2019. So impossible, which is still privately held, has some catching up to do. But you won't hear Pat Brown knocking his biggest competitor. I wish I'm nothing but success. They have the same mission we have. The only rival we care about is the incumbent animal-based industry. Rivals or not, impossible and beyond certainly agree on one thing. The true prize isn't the American market. It's China. 27% of the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,670,2022-10-08 00:43:09
12445," American market, it's China. 27% of the world's meat is consumed in China compared to just 9% in the US. The Chinese population eats a ton of meat, they are a huge market. China is a really interesting case because they have long had vegetarian cuisine as part of their culinary culture. And whether they are looking for meat replacements is still an open question. What we found in our reporting is that some consumers are excited about them. It's just, we don't know if it's going to be enough. To improve its prospects, impossible is developing a plant-based replacement for pork. Globally pork is the most widely consumed meat. It's almost 40% of all the meat consumed globally. Number one in Europe, number one in China. So if we're going to achieve our mission, pork is, you know, right up there. No word yet on when impossible pork will be available. This morning, growing concerns about the nation's food supply. From butchers to national supermarkets, supplies now limited and prices rising. The impact of the coronavirus on the price and availability of meat has given a boost to companies like impossible foods. Over the four weeks ending April 19, sales of plant-based meat increased. But impossible has acknowledged some negative effects from the pandemic as well. This being a product that has primarily been served in restaurants, they took a pretty big hit with all the food service shutdowns. Although the company doesn't want to say, you know, how much of a hit. They have, however, announced some new retail rollouts. Recently, they announced that they're going to be rolling out with crogr supermarkets. And that's big. That's great for them. The question of whether this is like a long-term sea change for these companies. I don't know. Just up the way it's seen. It's just to say impossible stands a slim chance of achieving its goal of replacing the entire meat industry. But it's early days for the science of plant-based meat. And it's not impossible that these products could one day contribute to a greener, more humane future. In the meantime, as the technology improves, we get to look forward to many more years of this. This is meat. No, this isn't possible. This is the meat burger. I like it better. It's not even close to a veggie burger or a tofu burger or anything. Wow, that's very, very much. What are, is a strategically important point on the map of Pakistan. It's very close to Iran, actually, on the very southern coast. It's about a 10-hour drive west of Karachi, but it's only about an hour drive to Iran. The area is extremely poor. It's very arid. It doesn't have enough water. Electricity has been a very spotty. One of the most surprising things about visiting Guadar is the high degree of security that is absolutely everywhere. There are armed guards that are required to escort foreign visitors everywhere you go, because it is contested in the region, because there have been militant attacks in the past. Despite all this, Guadar is a key part of the China-Pakistan economic corridor, also known as CPEC. The Crown Jewel of President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative. We will leave no stone unturned in ensuring that CPEC and all the people in the world are in peace.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,671,2022-10-08 00:47:18
12446," The Crown Jewel of President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative. We will leave no stone unturned in ensuring that CPEC and all the projects under its umbrella are materialised in time and in full. So far, just one-third of all CPEC projects have been completed. In Guadar, none of them have been, and the promised improvements for local people like Job Creation and Better Infrastructure have not materialised. So what has China got to gain from developing this seemingly obscure city on the Pakistani coast? We have seen this movie before. An outside power comes into Pakistan. It spends heavily on big infrastructure projects. China is not the first to do it. Right after Pakistan became independent in the late 1940s, early 50s, the US was sending advisers into Pakistan to help plant economy. The US was doing infrastructure projects there too. Those early projects helped the US gain Pakistan as an ally against the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The US has provided about $80 billion in aid to Pakistan since its independence, but overall the result is disappointing. One of the recent attempts was in the late 2000s, as part of the US effort to combat terrorism in Afghanistan. The number one item on that aid package was to build these high-visibility infrastructure projects. So there are literally projects that the United States tried to do or Pakistan proposed to the United States in the 2000s during that period that have become Belt and Road projects. China is stepping into a gap which has been left by retreating ambition from the US. The Belt and Road Initiative is China's President Xi Jinping's signature foreign policy initiative. Launched in 2013, it comprises an overland belt stretching through China's central Asia into Europe and a maritime road stretching around Southeast Asia through the India Ocean and up past East Africa. So a benign way of characterizing China's Belt and Road Initiative would be infrastructure for influence. So when Xi Jinping announced the Belt and Road Initiative, shortly afterwards China designated Pakistan as its showcase flagship project. So the China Pakistan Economic Quarter was going to be the biggest and most important showcase for the success of the Belt and Road. Pakistan is in great need of infrastructure development. They wanted to create a railway, a highway road, all kinds of economic development that is intended to help Pakistan. And it's meant to provide jobs, 2.3 million jobs for Pakistanis. It's meant to provide a 2.5% boost to GDP growth. And China would gain economically as well. XiPek was intended to reduce oil and gas routes from the Middle East by thousands of miles, a way to cut overland into Western China instead of going around Southeast Asia by ship. Projects in Pakistan also provide Chinese state owned companies with an additional market. Chinese workers are brought to Pakistan to build infrastructure and then take wages home. XiPek is also strategically significant for China and Pakistan. China wants to strengthen this relationship to counter their shared rival India. XiPek is both an instrument of Chinese power as well as a test of Chinese power. If it succeeds, China will be demonstrating that it's able to do what great powers have not been able to do in Pakistan, including the United States. Which is why Guadar is so important. It's in Pakistan's Balochistan province, an area with serious electricity and water shortages. Balochistan province is actually populated by people who are of Baloch origin. There are different ethnicity, they speak a different language from the majority.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,672,2022-10-08 00:51:38
12447," It's actually populated by people who are of Beloch origin. There are different ethnicity. They speak a different language from the majority and power in Islamabad. And they feel as the poorest province in Pakistan, they have not sufficiently benefited from some of the economic achievements that the rest of Pakistan has had. That area is quite contested by the Belochistan Liberation Army. The people who feel that even Pakistani people have encroached into their territory. So quite a number of people are still staging attacks and they attacked the biggest international hotel in Guadar, shot up the lobby and killed, I think, five people. But this unsettled city is where the China-Pakistan economic corridor is supposed to lead to. Authorities plan to develop Guadar into an international port city. Guadar port has an interesting history and an interesting location too. It's located in Belochistan. It's about 120 kilometers from Iran. Pakistan purchased this territory from Oman, I think, of the 1950s. And so for a long time, Pakistan has had on its agenda trying to develop this area. Since the 70s, it's wanted to build a port in Guadar, actually approached the United States in the 1970s and tried to convince the Nixon administration to pay for a port, even offered naval access if the United States was willing to pay for that. The US rejected Pakistan's offer, concerned that the port would not be commercially viable and would cause geopolitical tension. But in the early 2000s, a Chinese company was awarded the contract to build the port and they completed phase one of construction in 2006. The port was then managed by a Singaporean government entity. In 2013, a Chinese port operator took over from the Singaporeans. In 2015, China announced that it will expand the port as part of the CPEC initiative, but five years later, little has happened. When you look out at the port, you can see it has only three berths and all of them were empty. And the only ship that was in the port at the time was a Pakistan naval forget. And so it indicated to me that the port is not particularly operational for commercial purposes. And a number of analysts have talked about the strategic importance in a military sense if eventually China were able to use the port of Guadar as a military base. No one would be surprised if China did use it in that way. I don't think in the short term, like it is set up in Djibouti, where it has a permanent base. I think it's more likely to use it as almost a sort of forward base to resupply option. Something it can use when it wants to. Other projects like Building Pakistan's largest airport in Guadar and two special economic zones have been delayed. A 19 kilometer highway linking the port with the Macarancostal Highway in Balochistan is under construction too. Most of the people who live there and work there already are fishermen. They rely on access to the sea. The way that the highway expressed from the port was originally proposed would have cut off their sea access. And so that was a real point of contention with the community. There have been some proposals to allow them at underpass. It's still a little bit unclear how that is finally going to be resolved. Even if those projects are eventually built, there are serious questions about who will what then. There is a problem with manpower, of course, in Guadar. It's a very small city. And so one proposal has been well. We'll just ship Chinese workers in from China and build lots of fancy housing for them. The first Chinese built community in Pakistan, a 500 million dollar development, spanning over 10 million square feet with over 60% open spaces. That kind of proposal is what makes a lot of the Pakistani local people quite upset. A Guadal-based journalist expressed concerns to Bloomberg over projects like this. The journalist spoke anonymously for fear of persecution from the Pakistan government. These projects are creating jobs, but they're not really creating jobs for the local people of Guadal. They're not against economic risk.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,673,2022-10-08 00:56:10
12448," persecution from the Pakistan government. These projects are creating jobs but they're not really creating jobs for the local people of Guadal, they're not against economic prosperity but they're against the development that leads them behind. Pakistan doesn't have the money to build these projects. It's gone to the IMF for its 13th bailout since the 1980s. By engaging in CPEC projects, the government of Pakistan has incurred more debts from China. Not only posing challenges for Pakistan but possibly the international community if Pakistan eventually defaults on its debts. But CPEC is still set to go on. Even if most current projects haven't been completed, the two countries have recently signed new projects worth $11 billion. Pakistan's Prime Minister said the country's economic future is linked with China. It's hard to imagine how the China Pakistan economic corridor is going to be the game changer that the Pakistan government would like it to be. We're not seeing the economic growth or benefit from the projects that we're set out and we're supposed to have seen by now. We're not seeing the job creation. Project delays accumulating debts commercial viability. These problems of CPEC are also typical of Belt and Road projects around the world. For China though, it's never the narrow accounting perspective that matters. It's the bigger strategic benefits. As China's dollars continue to flow, as China's concrete continues to pour, China's influence continues to increase. There was some degree of runaway expectations. I think there was also some degree that they weren't extremely forthcoming with the state of the game. The cyberpunk 2077 story is very much kind of a story of everything that can and will go rock in game development. What is this bug? Jack is AI flipped out. He wasn't there before. Where's my gun? The release of Cyberpunk 2077 in December of 2020 will go down as one of the most disastrous game launches in history and it instantly rewrote the narrative of its celebrated developer, CD Projekt Red. Larger studios with bigger budgets weren't able to create the same quality of open world game. The inside story of the making of Cyberpunk depicts a process marred by unchecked ambition, unrealistic timelines, and a focus on marketing and the expensive development. When CD Projekt stock was at a tie, it was the largest stock in the Polish stock market. Cyberpunk was supposed to be the biggest game of 2020. This was a game that was starring Keanu Reeves. This is a game that was from the makers of the Witcher 3. This was supposed to be the big temple release of last year and for it to become such a disaster for so many people, I think, will have pretty far-reaching consequences. CD Projekt Origins are somewhat unique in the game's industry. In the West and Japan, the late 80s and 90s were dominated by games through the home console market and characters like Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog were becoming household names.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,674,2022-10-08 01:00:19
12449," In the west and Japan, the late 80s and 90s were dominated by games through the home console market and characters like Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog were becoming household names. The same was not true in a post-Soviet and economically depressed Poland. Most gaming was done on PCs and most games were copied and sold in small markets around the country. You could go to the market down the street and Worsan and buy install CDs and these two guys, Marchinevinsky and Michal Kuchinsky decided they were going to start selling CDs and they wound up striking a deal with the people who made a game called Baldur's Gate which was kind of like the seminal role-playing game in the late 90s. It was never a business, it was kind of lifestyle so we're actually pretty bad with counting money. You can kind of think of it almost like Nike, you know, where Phil Knight was selling shoes out of the trunk of his car, you know, you can kind of think about it the same way it was, you know, just selling physical goods and then evolving that into a much broader enterprise. CD Project, named for selling CDs, would move on from just reselling games to localizing Western and Japanese made games into the Polish language. But it wasn't until 2002 that the company would make its own game, The Witcher. The Witcher is a huge, huge series, huge fantasy series in Poland and so it was a pretty big deal that these guys got the race to make the video games. The Witcher book series is a source of national pride in Poland and a CD project released The Witcher 2. The video game series would become an important economic symbol for Poland as well. The CD project credit became this behemoth of an institution in Poland and they were really big in the Polish technology scene because they were getting more worldwide attention than most Polish companies do and making a lot of money and in 2011 when Barack Obama came to visit Poland, the Prime Minister actually gave him a copy of The Witcher 2. I confess I'm not very good at video games but I've been told that it is a great example of Poland's place in the new global economy. But it would be the launch of The Witcher 3 in 2015 that would elevate CD project red from representing the best of Poland to representing the best of the game's industry. I mean really the thing people look for first and foremost I think is that the game is just good and Witcher 3 was just a phenomenal game. There's a level of just storytelling and emphasis on making every side quest count on top of the atmosphere, the dialogue, the character interactions, the different way stories can end. They nail that. Other open-world games felt empty and enforced and the developers of them gave excuses as to why there couldn't be more rich story or interactions and The Witcher 3 blew them out of the water. CD project red was beloved. They were seen as a studio that was willing to make what the player wanted and to truly put in the love and effort required to make a high quality game that really connects with the people playing with it. And the winner for Game of the Year 2015 is The Witcher 3. The Witcher 3 would go into an over 250 game of the year awards but along with being a critical success for CD project it was also a financial success. Estimates put the sales of Witcher 3 at around 28 million copies in 2019. A huge step up concerning by 2014 the Witcher and the Witcher 2 had only combined to sell 8 million copies and with two large expansions for The Witcher 3 CD project also helped separate themselves from other AAA publishers at the time. And the game award goes oh man I have to pay a micro transaction to unlock. That's so stupid that this has to hold on I got this guys. Here we go. Other games and the most notorious one to do this was EA's Star Wars Battlefront 2. They got really aggressive on micro transactions in a game that already cost at least $60. You could have paid more if you bought the premium editions but not only was it that they were being very aggressive and they moved in.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,675,2022-10-08 01:04:58
12450," on micro transactions in a game that already cost at least $60. You could have paid more if you bought the premium editions, but not only was it that they were being very aggressive and trying to get you to spend money, but you could actually get items that helped you win. Well, gamers kind of draw the line in the sand there, and they don't like them. CD Projekt had done this phenomenal job of marketing themselves as a gamer-friendly company. We've said this a million times, and I'll say it again, we're gamers, first of all, and we all like to be treated fairly. So it only makes sense that as developers, we apply the same principle to everything we do here at CD Projekt Red. So giving everyone a bunch of free DLC was an absolutely no-brainer. They said, we're not going to sell you DLC that's like horse armor packs and other nonsense. We're going to just give you free stuff, and then we're going to sell big expansions as part of the Witcher 3. And not only were they really good, they were offered at a fair price. And this is a company that was seen as just like, a company that really cared about quality and cared about its customers, and we're not doing anything to kind of screw fans over the way that fans see that EA and Activision and all the other big publishers do. With a critically and financially successful game, as well as the goodwill from the gaming audience, all the focus would shift to CD Projekt's next release, Cyberpunk 2077. It's actually funny. They first announced it through like a press release, and then they showed off a trailer of the beginning of 2013 that was like a CGI trailer of like a woman, and there was all sorts of cool cyberpunk stuff, flying cars, lots of stuff, but it wasn't really until after the Witcher 3 that Cyberpunk began really like building up this fever level of hype. CD Projekt Red though wouldn't put out another trailer for Cyberpunk until 2018 at the E3 trade show. And they showed off a, it was like a two minute trailer of Cyberpunk, look pretty rad. And then they showed behind the scenes for E3 attendees for press and anyone else who could get a score and appointment in there. They showed this 45 minute demo, and it blew people away. Welcome to the gameplay demo walk through of CD Projekt Red's upcoming title, Cyberpunk 2077. The gameplay you're about to see is from a work in progress version of the game. Everything you see is potentially subject to change. Holy f***. This, if they can live up to what they showed me, it's game over. It all looked incredibly impressive. They had enough action, enough narrative beats with just the right amount of tension. They touted how each of these NPCs, or thousands of them, each one with their own daily routines and everything. We've greatly enhanced our proud and community system to create the most believable city in any open world game to date. So yeah, so people were certainly blown away by this demo at 1 E3 awards, and just people left the theater, just in awe. What they didn't know, of course, is that the demo was completely fake. Fake demos are common at E3. Studios put together builds of games to show off what they intend the game to be like rather than the actual state of the game. What was unique about this demo was that it was impressively long. It kind of plays into this idea that CD projects is very different, evolutionary",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,676,2022-10-08 01:09:12
12451," game to be like rather than the actual state of the game. What was unique about this demo was that it was impressively long. It kind of plays into this idea that CD Projekt is very much a market-and-driven company, and so demos were really, really important to them. So it was really important that they make this demo blow people away, which it did. But that might have come at the cost of some time they could have been spending on the game. Later, at E3 2019, fans will get another big surprise. The cyberpunk trailers showed gorgeous cities, beautiful lighting, really cutting-edge technology when it comes to the rendering of the game itself. People were very excited to be immersed in this gorgeous cyberpunk world. They saw over 8 million pre-orders, which is a ridiculously large amount for any title to sell, let alone pre-sell. When you saw the stock price start to go up and up and up into the right, pretty much in a straight line. If you just look at the polished stock market, like the Wig Index, when CD Projekt stock was at a tie, it was the largest stock in the index. And that was around the time that they announced that the game would be coming in April of 2020. Behind the Seaheens, people were pretty shocked that they were saying April. I don't think a single person who worked on that game actually thought they had a chance of coming out in April of 2020. So in April of 2019, I published an article for Kotaku about the making of a game called Anthem, which is a game from Byware that was disastrous in many ways and the article kind of ran through why that was. Afterwards, I started hearing from other developers who had stories to share that they said sounded a whole lot like Anthem. The deadline is unrealistic. The direction keeps changing. Things are floundering. We're going through a lot of problems. This sounds exactly like what you wrote about Anthem. Around that same time, perhaps coincidentally, I heard from VCEO of CD Projekt Red who wanted to reach out to me specifically to talk about Crunch. CD Projekt Red had a reputation for Crunch, especially during the development of Witcher 3. Their management wanted them to have a reputation for treating workers well and not forcing them to go through Crunch. So Marchinevinsky, who is a co-founder and co-CEO of CD Projekt Red, came to me and said, hey, I want to make a vow right now that we're not going to force anybody to Crunch, that people will not have to work mandatory overtime on this project. Over the course of reporting, Bloomberg has conducted interviews with more than 20 current and former CD Projekt staff, most of whom requested anonymity so as not to risk their careers. CD Projekt declined a comment on the process or provide interviews with a story. The company would end up delaying the game three different times, first pushing from an April 2020 release to September, then November, and once again to December 2020. In order to meet the deadline, the studio would scale down the size of Cyberpunk's main city, as well as canceling some features. And while those measures helped, developers still said they were under significant crunch, including one former audio programmer who claimed to work up to 13 hours a day, five days a week, and stating he had seen friends who had lost their families over this. This was not a big secret in the office that the game was not going to be ready. But a similar sort of thing happened with Witcher 3, and a similar sort of thing happens with a lot of games where they don't seem ready until suddenly everything just clicks. Some of the best games ever made, like we're created through this process. I don't know that it's the most efficient or the wisest way to make video games, but it's what a lot of people do. I think that management there has genuinely tried to change it or they said they wanted to change it, but it has proven very difficult to change that when you make games in this one specific way. In students.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,677,2022-10-08 01:13:33
12452," They wanted to change it, but it is proven very difficult to change that when you make games in this one specific way. Game studios, some of them see Crunch is part of their core culture that all of their games that they've made under Crunch have been successful, so it must be a core element to the magic recipe for creating good games. And that's really not the case. We've run studies and seen that at eight weeks of working 60 hours plus, the output of a professional is the same as if they were working 40 hours a week. So chronic overwork degrades how effective someone is to the point where then it becomes negative and overworking them is just getting new less and less productivity. And so these guys, the People at CD Projekt, having made the Witcher 3, we're kind of riding on that high, you could call it arrogance or confidence or whenever you want to call it, of having made the Witcher 3. And I think that like having a certain level confidence can certainly be a good thing, but in this case it could also be dangerous because it kind of blinded them to the reality, which is that this game wasn't going to call us. Sony Pictures Entertainment is reeling from what may be the biggest and most devastating computer hacking in Hollywood's history. Fackers attacked in waves, first crippling Sony's internal systems, then leaking 5 Sony movies online. Today the U.S. government pointed the finger of blame directly at North Korea for the devastating cyber attack against Sony Pictures. Sony pulling the plug on the interview, saying it will not show the controversial comedy about an assassination attempt on North Korea's leader. The Sony Pictures hacking was taken very seriously because it was an attack on the free world. What we have been building in terms of our civilization and our freedom and our ability to exchange information freely have been disrupted by a country that we knew very little about. North Korea has reportedly made attempts to steal COVID-19 vaccine technology by hacking pharmaceutical giant Pfizer. The Justice Department has charged three North Korean hackers over a wide ranging scheme that included the attempt theft of billions of dollars from multiple companies. Despite so many attacks blamed on North Korea, there was not much known about the people behind the hacking attacks and my aim was to reveal who these people are and what they are like, what their operations are like and on what their dreams and fears were. My name is Sam Kim. I'm a reporter for Blue Mug News and I wrote a story for Business Week about North Korean hackers. My story is about people who are sent from North Korea to countries like China to hack the regime, spy on enemies and make money. North Korea's cyber abilities began about in the 1970s with a lot of students going to countries like Russia, China and even East Germany to learn coding. It was aimed at improving the productivity of factories at home but in some time in the 1980s and 1990s, the current leader Kim Jong-un's father Kim Jong-un thought that it would be a good idea to develop a team, an army of people who could hack.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,678,2022-10-08 01:17:48
12453," idea to develop a team, an army of people who could have for North Korea's military. So they began this team of basically hackers who would spy for the North Korean regime and also go out there and make hard currency for the regime. I think Kim Jong-un takes the hacking ability more seriously than his father. He also enjoys a bit of tech sadness as well. He's often shown traveling on his airplane where on the desk there's a Mac computer. He understands the importance of computers. He understands the importance of employing technology to improve productivity of his economy. North Korea is an isolated country with its economy pretty much dilapidated nowadays. It's been under increasing pressure and sanctions from the US and the international community basically. It does not have the resources and money to build a kind of conventional weapons that other countries are able to build. So what happens is North Korea concentrates its resources on building nuclear arms and missiles which exports coal basically a symmetric weapon. It's the kind of weapons that gives North Korea an instant edge. Think of cyberhacking abilities in that context. It doesn't cost them much money. But if you have the right people and if you have the right training, you are able to cultivate an army of people who are able to penetrate into computer systems of other countries. And that's what North Korea is after. But if you consider the fact that there are only about 1000 IP addresses in North Korea available and many of them are basically loaned from Chinese communications companies, you can kind of tell why North Korea is willing to send its hackers abroad rather than operate from within. What's the matter with operating from within? Well, first of all, it would mean that a lot of information would have to be coming in from the outside world which could risk exposing the government and the people to whatever truth there might be about them. So they're sending their trained hackers to China and other countries where access to information is better. But at the same time, because these are allies and also because they have their diplomats stationed in countries like these like China, they're able to regulate and control these hackers better. Performally, North Korea denies engaging in hacking and described accusations to that affect as enemy propaganda. It took me at least half a year to track down these people. It felt like a wild goose chase in the beginning because a lot of the people like these are protected by the government in South Korea. But at the end, I was able to find a person who had pretty extensive ties to the North Korean defective community here and then I was also able to gain access to the people who had actually done programming hacking from North Korea before coming to South Korea. And Jung is one of them. Jung actually is not a real name. I knew before meeting Jung that he was in his late 30s. But when I actually met him, he looked at least a decade older. He wouldn't open up. He took me at least an hour to make sure that he would trust me enough that he would share with me his life story. When he was first sent to China, he was a student studying computer science at a university near the border with North Korea. And in the ceremony he was GBAw... By Hwpillo. I felt much better in terms of making him native. And he got more into history as well. And leaves just as much in and on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,679,2022-10-08 01:22:14
12454," When he was first sent to China, he was a student studying computer science at a university near the border with North Korea. And he came back and realized that there was a lot more to do in China because he had more access to information. And he asked that he'd be sent back to China. And there was also recruitment going on for people who would actually do coding officially, but really hacking from North Korea. So he applied and he got the job. Once he got to the border, he crossed by foot and from there he took a bus. And then when he arrived at the station that he would spend years in later, he learned that the three-story building in the heart of a city was actually provided for free actually by a Chinese man who had business ties in North Korea. There were actually two other people that I had met. They all said that they'd go to this freelance website for programmers and clients from around the world would come and give them orders, give them jobs to do. Some of the jobs given to Chong were cracking open, commercially successful anti-virus programs. And once he was able to open that up, he replicated that program into another product which his client would repackage as a whole different product to be sold to other people. He also created what we now call bots. There are very popular online games including lineage. He would create a bot that would just roam around without any supervision from the user and basically trade items without the users on that game. He would grow that bot on lineage and sell it for almost $100. Another defector said the money from clients was wired primarily via PayPal to accounts controlled by minors because they were the only ones with access to legitimate bank accounts. Chong had to make at least $100,000 a year and he doesn't get to keep most of it. Most of the money goes to the minors to the North Korean regime. But if you don't meet the court, the minors will make sure that they'll put enough pressure on you. If that happens repeatedly, you will face the growing odds of being sent back home. Among the three people that I spoke to, there's a common thing that they all tell me which is that on every Saturday they have to do this propaganda session. It's basically about gathering all the hackers together into a room and they have to recite whatever messages, whatever lines come from Pyongyang about the Kim family, about socialism. If you're especially someone with a free set of mind, that's stressful. One person actually was really stressed out what he heard about North Korea once he was in China during the propaganda sessions. He just couldn't take it. Chong was a senior member of the unit that he belonged to and he was good at Chinese as well. Whenever a senior North Korean official came from North Korea to check on the hacking units in China, Chong would accompany that official. He doesn't provide me details but he calls it unsavory instant that happened between him and an official that he was traveling with. The altercation prompted him to defect. But there was no one that he could turn to after defecting. He would indiscose Rome around China. He called me that he actually enjoyed it. He actually enjoyed the freedom of not being known.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,680,2022-10-08 01:26:23
12455," In disguise, Rome around China. He called me that he actually enjoyed it. He actually enjoyed the freedom of, you know, not being known to anybody. Just roaming around a country that was huge. How did he make the money that he needed to carry on? He did the same thing he did, you know, at the North Green Unit. He would take orders, he would reverse engineer software to make money. But at one point, he said he was just sick and tired of all of a sudden. He just wanted to find a place where he could just settle down. And he contacted South Green authorities. Now, he lives in Korea. He met a woman here. You know, last time I checked, they had a baby. He worked for a software company, ironically, an antivirus company. What keeps coming up in my head, even long after I spoke to these people, is there was one common thing about them, which was the sense of disillusionment. Once they had access to outside information, once they were able to freely roam in the internet, there was a spark. And once they realized that there is a discrepancy between what they think is really happening and what North Green is telling them every Saturday morning, that's when the spark gets bigger. Their little fire is what eventually drives them to decide to leave, even if it takes a huge risk on their lives. Step into the shopping center of the future. A world filled with exciting ideas. Since they started popping up in the 1950s, malls have been the quintessential American shopping experience. Muscling temples dedicated to the wonders and excesses of retail, food service and entertainment, the rise of the mall coincided with the growth of the suburbs. The heyday of the malls really is the 1970s, sometimes referred to as the malling of America. They really thrived at providing some sort of public gathering space, some sort of social life, in addition to actually giving people places to shop. Everyone must always be relaxed towards getting better during the second ride.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,681,2022-10-08 01:31:42
12456," Some sort of public gathering space, some sort of social life, in addition to actually getting people places to shop. Over the past few decades before then, lots of developers were building malls and it kind of coincided with the growth of highways. So as more people started traveling and interstate started being built, developers really wanted to put something to attract people to stop. Take a look at an average American mall today, however, and you'll see a very different picture. Closed stores and empty hallways became the norm in many malls even before COVID-19 delivered them another set of problems in 2020. So what happened? This is the story of the rise and fall of American malls. When malls work best, they survived and thrived thanks to their anchor stores. Those are the stores that are on the edges of the malls and that are outward facing to the parking lot. So if you're a shopper, you're going to walk through one of these big, usually a department store. So if you're thinking about maces or sears or jcpiny, those are called the anchor stores. So once shoppers are done shopping there, maybe they wander to the middle part of the mall, shopping at the other apparel shops or even going to buy some food. But you really had to have a reason for people to shop in the first place. These anchors bring in all those people. They tend to pay very little rent. Around 80% of income from mall owners come from the inline stores inside the mall. Over the past few decades, malls have been facing challenges from all sides. The first being, there's just too many of them. As early as in the 90s, the malls were beginning to compete with each other. We have a lot more retail square footage per capita than Canada. We have only seven times more retail square footage per capita than Europe. After the 2008 financial crisis lowered retail spending across the board, malls and especially their department stores also had to contend with a new challenge that was growing fast. Mall started to suffer in the early 2000s with the rise of online shopping. Suddenly, they didn't have that captive audience who had to go to the mall to buy something. You didn't have to get up, get in your car, drive all the way to the mall and then see a bunch of other people. You can just do it from the comfort of your own. Department stores overall have become less relevant over the years. Many have fallen totally off. And that's Sears, JC Penney. Several bankruptcies in this space have really hurt the industry. But as department stores go, so does the mall oftentimes. So if department stores start closing locations, that means they're usually leaving malls. This is the Greenbrier Mall in Southwest Atlanta, Georgia. It's in many ways emblematic of the problems facing malls today. It's been there since 1965. So for more than half of a century, it's been serving this area of Atlanta that's predominantly black and also as middle-class neighborhood. It started with anchor stores that were department stores. So you had JC Penney and then Riches, which was later bought by Macy's. So you had these two national chains. It had the first Chick-fil-A in a mall, like that type of format. So when you think about the history of malls, like Greenbrier had like the perfect template, but now Macy's will be exiting the mall. Meaning that the mall will be left without an anchor, which is vital to attracting other shoppers to come into the stores. Greenbrier then because it's kind of an example or a test for all these other middle-ing malls across America about what do you do when these large department stores as a business decision on their end are trying to just stay in the high quality malls. How does a middle-ing mall survive? What's their next strategy?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,682,2022-10-08 01:35:15
12457," Greenbrier is a textbook example of how closely the deterioration of the middle class in the US is tied to the health of its malls. The median income for the surrounding area has reduced by $6,905 over the past 15 years, to a total of $20,756 per year. And yet, residents and store owners hope that Greenbrier mall will see better days. Malls are made up of the people and communities that help fuel them. Greenbrier is still a place that people go to and cherish, even if on paper it doesn't have the elements that make it a thriving mall. A lot of the existing constituents and residents there feel in many respects that they worked hard their whole lives to be able to experience the American dream. The single family suburb and housed in a leafy yard near a big mall that had a great Macy's, they're very reluctant to see that taken away from them. Now that Macy's is gone, Greenbrier may try to take inspiration from what many malls were doing in the years following the financial crisis, focusing not on shopping but experiences. That was a trend we were seeing in 2016 up into the pandemic pretty much. And by experiences I mean everything as dramatic as a water park or hosting concerts to have people want to come other than just to buy stuff. Having Instagramable moments, making sure your store is pretty that people want to take a photo and post it on Instagram or Twitter. Historically the mall has always been a place for teenagers. You like to hang out, see your friends and also kind of be seen at the mall and that hasn't completely changed like before the pandemic, about 95% of Gen Z. So today's teenagers had gone to a mall in a three month period. So teenagers are still going to the mall and they've always been key to having thriving malls because they're coming into their spending power and once you win over teens hopefully you're really winning over a loyal customer for life. That thanks to lockdowns across the country, most malls at one point or another were shuttered in 2020. That means no one using the multi billion dollar American Dream malls indoor ski slope. No one going to the king of Prussia malls indoor skydiving attraction. Basically the pandemic gave malls what they didn't need, another problem. What would your net income or net operating income have been in 2022 without COVID and what is it now in a post COVID world? So our views is roughly 10% hit to net income over that period. That's Vince Taboni from the analytics firm Green Street Advisors which rates American malls from 8 a deed just like a report card. And if malls did have a report card they wouldn't exactly make honor roll. During the US out of the thousand malls in the country there are roughly 250 malls, roughly grade a minus or better. The DNC quality malls which is the vast majority of the malls by count we think are on a negative trajectory and it's going to depend on a lot of the local dynamics ownership decisions around how much money to invest in the property. We'll determine whether this mall can survive its retail or rapidly melting ice cube. But there have been a few bankruptcies among real estate investment trusts.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,683,2022-10-08 01:39:25
12458," and whether this mall can survive as retail, or so, you know, rapidly melting ice cube. While there have been a few bankruptcies among real estate investment trusts that own mostly B2D malls in the past few years, A-Malls really are doing just fine. Some of the most productive shopping centers in the country are super high-end. So I'm talking about bal harbour shops down in Miami, Florida. There's Americana man has it in Long Island's Gold Coast, the Grove in Los Angeles. These are places that have all high-end stores and have done quite well. A lot of that has to do with efficiency of their properties, so their sales per square foot are really high, but also they've invested a lot in their actual mall, because it has to look beautiful. It has to have all the services that a wealthy shopper expects. So what will the future hold for less sought-after malls that can't revive their golden years? For many of these malls, it will mean closure and then hopefully conversion. If they can't get a new use to come in, it's expensive, but you can just demolish it. And there are still quite a lot of sites just sitting waiting. Amazon has been picking up more and more of those, building their big fulfillment centers. Also, a lot of communities think this is an opportunity to redevelop, reinhabit this dead mall to help that community meet the challenges it was never originally designed for. The number one reuse of an existing mall is as workspace. It's actually pretty easy to just throw some carpeting down, cut a few more windows and turn it into office space. So the number two reuse of malls is either medical, healthcare or education. Lots of great examples of community colleges all the way down to elementary schools. Moving into malls. Then the third strategy that I wish happened more is actually just demolishing the mall and re-greening. Either reconstructing the wetlands that used to be there and that frankly, we never should have built on in the first place or providing community parks and gardens. While most analysts say post-pandemic retail shopping could breathe some life back into the American mall, many are not long for this world. Depending on where you live, it might be time to make one last visit, grab some food, do some shopping and say farewell.

12459," to Utah today where he dramatically cut back the size of two national monuments in that state. When former president Donald Trump announced plans to scale back two national monuments in Utah, there was outcry from a lot of people. One company in particular. Patagonia really is a resistance brand. They embraced the liberal resistance against President Donald Trump and really put themselves at the forefront of that movement. In 2017, it sued the Trump administration for sort of slashing the size of these two national monuments in Utah that were kind of mechas for climbers. It said at the time joining the legal fracas was both extraordinary and obvious. So the company's general counsel said it took exactly one email to the board to decide to actually do that. I send the cases still out. Well, I think the only thing this administration understands is lawsuits. We're losing this planet and we have an evil government and I'm not going to stand back and just let evil win. This year it got even more active. It changed its mission statement to quote, Patagonia isn't business to save our home planet and then it manufactured these little tags on some of its clothes that if you flip them up, it says vote the assholes out. Very implicit. Running up to the election and it launched a digital tool to help people find the polling place and on that digital platform, it says both the climate deniers out of office again and again on the loop. This isn't the first time that taking a stand has paid off the Patagonia. The business which is now worth over a billion dollars was built on it. I couldn't care less about making more money but by doing the right thing it always ends up making even more money. So is this all a strategy, a sort of premeditated strategy? Who knows? I mean, Sean Arck has been very vocal from the start and makes no bones about he calls himself a dirtbag climber and an accidental entrepreneur. So I don't think he's fudging this but what's important is that it's sort of a textbook marriage of philanthropy and profit. If you want to understand the entrepreneur studied at Ju and Al the Lakewood because you know they're saying you know this sucks and I'm going to do it my own way. Of course like every other teenage kid I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. When I was 16 years old I took off and drove across the country, went into the Wind River Range and discovered mountains. Patagonia was born out of Rockclimate Avantue in our first business, Schu and Art Equipment which made and sold climbing supplies. The Bunchon Art was a blacksmith in the 50s and he started selling climbing gear out of the back of his car. That was less harmful to rock faces. This is sort of the origin story of the company it's called itself the activist company, a activist company. Six months out of the year, Avantue is a blacksmith. He makes mountain climbing gear. The other half of the year he climbs. In 1968 Avantue and four friends including Doug Tomkins, the late founders of the North Face brand embarked on the ultimate road trip from California where they were based to Patagonia in Argentina. The mountains in a good mood, dazzling sun, calmer all day. If this weather holds they could be on the summit within days. This trip became the documentary about these friends who were hippies in the 70s climbing in the new Samiti where the sport became a",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,685,2022-10-08 01:48:10
12460," The documentary about these friends who were hippies in the 70s, climbing in the new Samiti, where the sport became a lifestyle, and how these friends became pioneer of the outdoor industry. Schuannard moved from selling petons to polyester, and in the 70s Patagonia was born. In 1973, Schuannard and his wife Melinda opened the very first Patagonia store in Ventura, California, where the company's headquarters remained today. Melinda Schuannard was the driving force behind many of the employee benefits, like on-site childcare, that helped the company achieve an impressive 4% employee turnover rate. The retail and consumer product sector average is more than triple that at 13%. I do think that Patagonia was a leader, one of the first corporations, to take into account, you know, the human capital, and make sure that their staff, all their employees were cared for in many ways, not just wages, but also they just cared about their people and knew that that's a good business model. Patagonia began donating 10% of its profits to grassroots organizations in 1985. This later became the 1% of sales that Schuannard labels an Earth Tax. I don't think it's philanthropy, it's rent for us living on this planet. While Patagonia was creating the blueprint of how to be a socially conscious brand, it was also turning a profit. It even made Ink Magazine's list of the fastest growing privately held companies. So every time the company makes a decision to do something socially environmentally active, it is met with success and that isn't lost on Schuannard or any of the other leaders of the company. The more money Patagonia made, the more it gave away under its philanthropic program. Between 1989 and 1991, the payroll grew by 40%. But trouble was on the horizon. I think for 1991, we are looking at a recession. The question is how deep that recession is going to be and how long will be in it. Sales fell flat and the bank called in the companies revolving loans. A company that prided itself on taking care of its own laid off 120 people, roughly 20% of its workforce. That was when we decided that we were going to start doing things differently. We're going to start running the company as if it's going to be here 100 years. With a renewed sense of purpose, Patagonia was ready for what it called business unusual. It started with the costly move to recycle an organic materials before launching a clothing repair service to discourage fast fashion. And Patagonia's influence was growing. What was intended as Schuannard's philosophical handbook for employees became an international blueprint for sustainable business printed in term languages. What's interesting to me is that all this, I hate the term on brand, but it's very on brand. It really works for the kind of company he's created. It works for the kind of employees he's been able to recruit and retain. It all is very seamless in terms of the identity of him and the company and what it means in the marketplace. So over time, the company's mission and its marketing have become the same thing. The inflection point came in 2011, actually Black Friday, Patagonia took out a huge ad in the New York Times that said don't buy this jacket. And it sort of got into the nitty-gritty on the carbon footprint and the water footprint that goes into a piece of a peril like a parka. And at the time Schuannard said the best jacket for our planet is one that already exists. So the company at that time said it needed to address the issue of consumerism, which coming from a for-profit business hits pretty hypercritical. As the company encouraged its customers to buy less, its annual sales increased by almost 40%. The stance on this is hypercritical is loud and constant talking.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,686,2022-10-08 01:52:31
12461," As just customers to buy less, its annual sales increased by almost 40%. The stance of this is hypocritical is loud and constant. Talking about consumerism in a critical light while very much being a part of it. Fast fashion is top on the list of environmental destruction and not just destroying the environment but impacting human health. They are in the fashion industry, they're clothing retailer and to come head to head with that is courageous. You're not only just trying to create a product that'll last but you're also educating an entire generation of people to understand that whole ideology that you don't need to change out our outfits. In 2014, Rose Macaria was appointed as CEO. During the next six years, she grew Patagonia into a billion dollar company while also scaling up its environmental goals and bringing a more political voice to its activism. Ivana had this model where he was basically saying you can have a great business, you can make quality product, but you can also do the right thing by the environment, by your employees, by your community. And that to me was like the most holistic vision of business that I'd ever seen. So right now Patagonia has a team of about 20 people solely focused on activism and grants. And this all comes at a time in the past decade when consumers are paying much more attention to the social footprint of companies and where they buy their goods. So what's happened is all this is good business for Patagonia in the past 10 years, revenue and profit at the company of roughly quadruple. It's private, but estimates are it does about a billion dollars in annual sales, which is sizable. And that's part of the reason why it's been such a fortuitous cycle as it's ramped up its activism and become more vocal on these things. It's resonated with the market. As the company branched out into other areas, including a venture capital fund for environmental causes and sustainable food, revenue reached a new peak of over one billion dollars in 2017. But this was still small change compared to fast fashion heavyweights like Nike, who made 37 billion dollars that same year. Patagonia's conscience hasn't always been reflected in its customer base either. Personalized vests have become the go-to corporate uniform. And the expensive price tag has helped the brand and the nickname Pataguchi. It's expensive stuff, it's expensive apparel, and that is part of their calculus in terms of the activism, you know, a lot of the more sustainable parts of this pie chain art. There's a premium for organic cotton or sustainable down. The Pataguchi label is a symptom of that. Patagonia products are very popular, of course, with people who are active in the outdoors, but also with people who are not as active. For instance, you know, people in finance where the Patagonia vests go to the office. And that's because of the image that the brand projects. And so they have to leave with the fact, although they preach for the environment and want to stand for good, but they're victims of their own success. Patagonia sets sales records in the first three years of the Trump administration. Now, in 2020, things have changed. It's COVID-19 brought the business world to a halt, and the American people voted in a new administration. Patagonia, a point of Brian Gellert as CEO. As far as its CEO transition goes, this one's happening quite strangely. There's no real budget for next year yet, because of everything that's going on and all the uncertainty around that. Patagonia's new focus is going to be on forging a relationship with the Biden administration. It should be a more close relationship, but Gellert still has his guard up.

12463,"... Okay, so you built this, so this is all. This is new since the pandemic. We assume Googlers would want more indoor outdoor options. I mean, it's so exciting. It's such a fun. It is. It is, but I would say the thing we're really excited about are these new buildings because we're building sustainability and everything we do. So really forward looking. Good? Yes. Okay. From one of the newest workspaces at the Googleplex in Mountain View, California, this is Bloomberg Studio 1.0 with Alphabet CFO, Ruth Porat. We're not far from her childhood home. Her father was a physicist at Stanford, her mother, a psychologist. She graduated from Stanford herself and then earning a couple more advanced degrees. Porat landed her first job on Wall Street in 1987, where she would spend almost three decades until Google's co-founders lured her to Silicon Valley. It's wonderful to be here with you. It's great to have you here at the Googleplex. Thank you for having us. So we are at Google headquarters in Mountain View and at this very same time you are making massive investments in New York office real estate. You're expanding headcount in Atlanta and Chicago and Washington, DC. What's the strategy behind all of this? Well, at the core we believe in hybrid work. So we do want to bring people back on campuses, but not full time. We're thinking it would probably be a three to work week, but we think coming together is just such a core part of innovation, serendipity, culture, every element of it. And we're growing it a really rapid clip. So we are excited to be expanding our real estate footprint. And then we also wanted to make sure that we're meeting people where they want to be. And so enlarging the number of sites that we have available for people in particular sites where you have great diverse populations. Sundar just told me that Googlers will have this option to work in a hybrid mode forever, like literally forever. Obviously, you're embracing this massive cultural shift. But what are the risks? What do you worry about? So the positive we've seen is there's a productivity uplift we believe in giving people the opportunity to be at home some of the time, not do the commute, be able to deal with everything else in their life, and coming into the office. So the risk is, I think, about my career, and so much of the benefit in my career was the informal coaching being pot-pron into meetings, all of the touch points that you have. And so I think that one of the most important things for all of us as leaders is we need to evolve the way we lead. We need to make sure that we're thinking about this hybrid work life and why that's the way to be the best magnet for talent and make sure that we're continuing to reinforce all of those great practices while opening up new great practices. Speaking of your career, before you were CFO of AlphaBat, you were CFO's Morgan Stanley and you started your career on Wall Street in 1987. Talk to us about the journey of going from big banks to big tech. Why did you make that leap? And what impact did you want to have? Well, I love being at Morgan Stanley and I became CFO the day James Gorman became CEO, yes, needed to join him in that journey and that was January 2010. And we were still recovering coming out of the financial crisis. There were still some pretty rocky days and a lot of decisions that needed to be made. And then I got to a point where I felt like we were in a great spot at Morgan Stanley.

12464," Well, some pretty rocky days and a lot of decisions that needed to be made. And then I got to a point where I felt like we were in a great spot that we're in Stanley. And obviously, it's continued to do really well. And I just wanted that next chapter. On my view, in my career, I've always been focused on continually learning. And I feel like when you hit a plateau, the right questions, what's my highest and best use? And it's been an extraordinary time. You also survived Wall Street in the 80s and 90s, which is notorious Boyz Club. And Silicon Valley has sort of come to be known as a Boyz Club of its own. How would you compare those two cultures? Well, when I was starting my career many decades ago, it was tough and much worse than it is now. And it evolved. No question about it. Not where it needs to be, but certainly evolved. And I saw it through my career. I would say the biggest difference out here is the level of impatience. And I love it. As the viewers, if you can do some of the extraordinary break throughs that we have out here, if you can do natural language translation, everything we do with AI, with VR, with self-driving cars, why can't you fix this now? And that level of impatience, I think, is fantastic. Legend has it that when you got to Google, you were going to rain in the spending, tighten up on the moon shots. Your nickname, I believe, was Ruth Vader. Was that a tough job to take on? So I think the narrative was written before I got here. And what I find most interesting about that is I firmly believe the single most important thing in capital allocation is investing for long-term growth. I think if you don't, you are sowing the seeds of your long-term decline. And I learned that really early on in my career, now if you're investing in an industry like this and trying to do truly transformative things, by definition, everything can't succeed. And so by definition, you should have the metrics and data and milestones to assess, is it working or is it not? Because if everything's working, or if you think everything's working, I would say one or two things are wrong. Either you're not reaching high enough, or you're not being honest enough with yourself about the pace of breakthrough, whether you're going to get there. So to me, a really natural part, kind of a sister organization to investing for long-term growth, is actually thinking about, how are you doing with the risk that you're taking? Stack rack them and figure out what's at the bottom so you can redeploy those resources to the top. They go together, actually. And so I find the narrative, it's a false choice to think that it's either about growth or it's about pruning, stack ranking. They go together and you have to think of them as actually empowering one another. You advised the Treasury Department during the Great Recession. What lessons did you take away from that? What struck me is a lot of the lessons from the financial crisis are relevant in good times and bad times. So the most important is it's easier to prevent than to fix. And so that was really clear during the financial crisis. The financial crisis was about liquidity. And it dried up quickly. And it would have been really easy six to 12 months prior to build a interable liquidity. You couldn't do it in the moment. And so this notion about really building a solid foundation on which you operate, you need to do that ahead of time. It needs to be all of the work we do on trust and safety and content, moderation, security. That is the foundation on which you can build everything else. The handball is at one point said to me, you have to have the will and the means. And too often by the time you have the will, you no longer have the means. His comment was be decisive, act early, even in the absence of information. I think that's true in this whole notion of investing for long-term growth. Because if you're not actually assessing progress along the way, and you just assume, you know what, we can keep investing in everything. At some point down the road, you'll say, I wish I had made those tough calls to double down on the things that really mattered. What times are we in now? What's your read on the economy today, especially with rising inflation? Well, look, I think back to March of 2020, and where we were. And I think of all of the intervention and steps that have been taken since then. And you've certainly seen the recovery coming out the back end. And it's been really gratifying from those pain.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,690,2022-10-08 02:10:05
12465," of all of the intervention and steps that have been taken since then, and you've certainly seen the recovery coming out the back end. And it's been really gratifying from those painful days to see the breakthroughs that we've had not just on the medical front, but we've also seen the improvement across businesses. I think one of the biggest concerns in particular is you're seeing us go through a digital transformation and the acceleration of it is ensuring that everyone has the skills, the digital training and skills to thrive in this new economy. Google now reaches more than half the people on the planet. Why shouldn't we view Google as a monopoly? We often say that people come to Google not because they have to, but because they want to. We're opening the world for so many people, so that's the intent. I want to talk a little bit about regulation. You were drawn to M&A in your early days at Morgan Stanley. Microsoft is making some big acquisitions, deals that some think Google maybe would have wanted to win in a former life, is antitrust scrutiny constraining any of your business plans, and your ability to compete? The main thing that we've done throughout the life of Google is really invest in innovation, its organic growth, and we're continuing to do that at a really rapid clip. We have then layered onto it, tuck in acquisitions and larger acquisitions, and we're continuing to be active, more on the smaller ones and the add-ons to be fair. We think there's a lot of opportunity still ahead of us. We're continuing to invest in partnerships, in some acquisitions, and do you think that there's still upside in a lot of different areas? So would you say this regulatory scrutiny isn't slowing you down? It's really important for those of us in certain leadership positions to be very focused on constructively engaging and working with regulators on what are the issues, what is it they're trying to solve, and how can we constructively engage with them? At the same time, our engineers should focus on innovation and continuing to kind of up the bar on everything we're doing, address what is most helpful for our users. Google is facing more serious legal threats at this time in the United States than the other big tech companies. How are those conversations with regulators going? Are they frustrating at this point? Well, there's certain elements that are frustrating because I listen to the outline of some of the proposed legislation, and I think it's inconsistent with some of the priorities for public policy. So as an example, there are a lot of focus on what is called self-preferencing. Are you putting too many of your own products together? But during the pandemic, one in three small businesses said they would have failed without digital skills. Why? They were able to do what's connected with their users in different ways.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,691,2022-10-08 02:14:11
12466," But during the pandemic, one in three small businesses said they would have failed without digital skills. Why? Because what they were able to do was connect with their users in different ways. So if you go search for a small business, you can then go to a map and you can get directed to the small business. That's a good thing. We have 6,000 small businesses who wrote in and said, you know what, we need these digital tools and skills. Same with a number of things on racial equity. Real surge in searches about where can I, where's a black owned business near me and the ability to direct people through search and maps. So I think that what's really important and that's why I said it's about constructive engagement. Let's make sure we understand what they're trying to solve and work with them on what is it that we're trying to address through products so that the products are helpful in the ways that they want. Facebook has taken a serious reputational hit. Has that had ripple effects or created collateral damage for Google? Well, I think that whenever there's a backdrop that's challenging, it has ripple effects. But what we're really underscoring is all of the steps and investments that we are making to really protect the ecosystem the way we are commitment to our users. So we know how sacrosanct that trust is and it's all about privacy and what are the steps that we're taking to make privacy protected for our users. What is it that we're looking at to protect content and content moderations? Google now reaches more than half the people on the planet. Why shouldn't we view Google as a monopoly? So I go back to the earliest days when Google, I first learned about Google back in 1998 and in those earliest days, when I heard about this eight search engine, the question is why do you actually need it? And back at Morgan Stanley, it's working with our research analyst Mary Meekers. She actually had her team put up white pages all around the conference room and was doing this comparison. She was about provided the most responsive results most rapidly. And all of a sudden you could see, well, when did this Google thing actually maybe we do need something new? And that's been the ethos at Google since inception is just continue to innovate to make this eight never better experience for users. And so if we can deliver on that, which is what drives people here, it's really opening the world for so many people. So that's the intent. Facebook and Twitter are exploring digital currency. What is your thought on the crypto market? And is there a play for Google? So we look at it. There's nothing to comment on now. I think we're much more interested in blockchain and the underlying technology and the implications for the business and also for the way we can support our cloud customers. So certainly a lot of effort there. There's considerable chatter in the crypto universe that Web 3 and the blockchain could circumvent the power of Facebook and Google and more. What do you think about the next frontier of the internet? At this point, I think there are a lot of different things ahead of us that are actually studyingly exciting that enable us to actually continue to address different needs and requirements. I look at, for example, in something like health where I think blockchain will be very valuable when you think about health and health records. There's also a whole host of other areas where the data analytics that we provide are absolutely critical. Should we make excuses to our employer? Should we tell our, like, if I have to head to a parent's teacher conference or take a kid to the doctor, do I tell my boss that I'm doing it? You don't tell your boss. You've got to get over the guilt. Music Music",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,692,2022-10-08 02:18:27
12467," J breast cancer twice. What was your biggest fear at that time and how did you overcome it? Well the biggest fear was I wouldn't make it and I remember when someone at some interview while I was going through chemo said where do you want to be in five years and I froze because it was I want to be alive and I learned a couple of really important things. One, given breakthroughs in medical technology, I learned to love the word manageable. These this journey does become manageable not for all cancers but for many more cancers and that gave me a lot of confidence talking with other survivors about it is manageable get the best care and just plough through it. I was just very grateful. I'm grateful for all of the investments people have made over the years but for anybody out there and I think everybody sadly will be touched by cancer either themselves or someone they know and love. Many of these cancers are manageable and just go at it with gusto so that's what I did. You're a mom of three sons and I find that especially remarkable because I also have three sons. How have you managed that over the course of this you know incredible career? How do you find that right mix of focus and free time to spend time with your family and doing the things that you love? So my kids my kids give me energy they're remarkable and I think one of the important things for me is this notion that you do have to have a mix. It's not about trying to find balance the physics of which is really challenging. I think when people try for balance they always feel they're failing on something because something's out of whack. So this metaphor that life is like a kaleidoscope and you need to have different shaped pieces of glass and different color and sometimes one is larger than the other and what's beautiful about life is when it's constantly moving around and so to me that metaphor has actually been sort of an anchoring principle. The other is you have to put the kids first so like they they know that I'm there you know when they need always and and I think that just making sure that you're setting the boundaries the way you need to I would say it's much easier today than when I was growing up in banking you know and we had a cubicle there was a there was a computer room you were anchored to the computer room one of the many beautiful things about going through this evolution in work is understanding that hybrid works. So how do we get rid of mom guilt especially in this new work world? I want to shake my mom guilt how do I do okay so even when you feel it just say you know what it's an investment in my career because I can stay in this longer and be operating at a higher level if I'm really getting the stimulus from all parts of my life so you've got to drop the mom guilt and when on the other side mom guilt with kids I think they get it I think they understand what we're doing and you know they'll never forget during the financial crisis at one point I was working on AIG we went around the clock I came home to shower that one like right as we were landing AIG and my three kids had each written me a yellow sticky note with a message on it and one of them was based you know the the essence of which was I get",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,693,2022-10-08 02:23:14
12468," each written me a yellow sticky note with a message on it. And one of them was based, you know, the essence of which was I get why you're doing this. And they saw it as the right thing for the country. I don't need to over dramatize what it was, but that's what it felt like at the time. And that level of pride, I still have those three stickies right by my bedside because I get it. I get the mom guilt. I wish there were certain elements that you could have done differently. But I also see the relationship we have, and they understand what it means to actually be engaged in society and doing something you care about. No mom guilt. No mom guilt. Thank you. It's not allowed. Thank you. Should we make excuses to our employers? Should we tell our, like, if I have to head to a parent teacher conference or take a kid to the doctor, do I tell my boss that? You don't tell your boss. You don't tell your boss. Guys don't tell their boss. So what do we say? I don't think you say anything. I actually made this point at an event. At Morgan Stanley, I'm like, do not tell your boss. You've got to get over the guilt. The only way to move on from it is realize, I'm a professional. I do things when I can. And it makes sense. And I get it all done. I just do it on my own timeline. And I actually had a woman who emailed to me afterwards and said, I know you said I'm not supposed to tell my boss. So I won't. But I can't not tell somebody. So I'm going to email you. And I'm like, OK, that's step one. I'm going to have five step journey. Do not tell your boss. I need to do certain things for myself. And I'm getting, I feel guilty doing it, but I get everything done. There's no question. You are so beyond having to check in with people. Well, thank you. So not. We're in the middle of this so-called great resignation. And people are reflecting and changing and making big decisions. What's your advice to people in this big evolution? Huge choices ahead. Well, I think you framed it really well. I don't think it's the great resignation. I think it's the great reshuffle. And people are reflecting on what do they want and how do they want to work and how do they want to live their lives. So I think for all of us thinking about what does that mean for our institutions, it is about evolving the way we work, the way we interact, the expectations that we have to say, but I grew up in a cubicle on the 26th floor of a skyrise. It doesn't work anymore. And so what should we do as leaders? And I think that this generation appropriately, and it's very exciting, expects more from all of us. And so it's not just in how we work, but it is in what we do. And I think all elements of what's the mission, are you delivering on the mission? Is really important. OK, so if you rapid fire questions, someone you'd love to have dinner with? Well, I'd love to say my parents, because they passed away in a few years ago. Favorite family ritual? We do this crazy thing that we've done for years, which is everybody gets to pick where we travel. We come up with the five different locations, and then we all vote, and then we get the grid. And that's where we go. What's your favorite getaway? Probably, I would say maybe Iceland was the vast. That's an amazing one. New York or California? Ooh, so unfair. Well, sitting here outdoors right now, and knowing I can do that for the rest of the years, I'm very nice with the energy from New York, so I'm not going to, it's like, I don't pick amongst children. So, in closing, Google is a massive company, multiple divisions, many bets. Where are you spending most of your time now? I'm spending most of my time on your very more in question about capital allocation, because if it really goes to this core point, you've got to invest for long-term growth, and making sure that you're investing with the right intensity. I often say, I don't want to get to the two-yard line, but not score. So you need to make sure you're investing with the right intensity to support long-term growth. That's the most important area where I would say I spend the bulk of my time. And then, of course, you have to prioritize in order to recycle to support those efforts. What kind of discussions are you having with Larry and Sergey now about this next phase of Google? So when they made the announcement about the role of change, they were very serious about moving to this board role, and they're amazing board members. Sundar, of course, relies on them for council wherever whenever, but most of the interaction is.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,694,2022-10-08 02:27:34
12469," This board role and they've been their amazing board members. Sundar is of course relies on them for council wherever whenever, but most of the interaction is really around what are we doing at the board level and send great. And you have your freedom to allocate capital as you like. I work closely with Sundar and Philip and Thomas. Yes, we work as a great team. So what's the vision for Google then 10 years from now? It's fascinating to, I think I have the same reaction you do when I heard Sundar say search is the biggest moonshot. And I think that continuing to find ways to be helpful to users to solve what they need where so many people are coming online and it is video going to be the way they understand it's going to be about search is going to be a different type of experience, so much of it's going to be about voice, first, and language translation. So it's going to continue to evolve. And what about for you personally, where will you, it's been so amazing to hear about your journey and I'm just curious about your personal growth. What you feel you've accomplished in the last, since you've been here and what you hope to accomplish. I find that the opportunity to try new things and to invest in new things and as we think about, well, what does that mean for each one of our areas? I think that intellectual curiosity keeps you young and I think that continuing to learn is like your brain, it's like silly putty getting pulled in a lot of directions. So to me, it's continuous learning. Ruth Porat, thank you so much for joining us. It's been wonderful to be here. Thank you. Great to have you on campus. Come back anytime. Thank you. Thank you.

I guess you come in. Yeah. I'm in every day now. So no more kids on the set. I have to ask, is your son still mining Ethereum? He and I literally were talking about it last night. He's like that. You are the one who made me give up on it. I'm like, no, no, I didn't. But yeah, the thing that's good about this is, I think it. Excites a whole new generation about technology, which is, which is good. I really appreciate you taking this time. Well, thank you for doing it and thank you for coming down to do it. I'm ready to go and you guys are. From Google headquarters in Mountain View, California, this is Bloomberg Studio 1.0 with Alphabet CEO Sundar Pachai.

12470," No access to a computer until college, but just years later found himself rising through the ranks of the world's largest search engine. In 2015, it was Pichai that Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin chose to run Google and later Alphabet. Now valued at more than $2 trillion, it's one of the most powerful companies on the planet. Sundar, it's great to be with you today. Thanks for doing this. Great to be here in person. Google just hit a $2 trillion market cap. Alphabet, I should say. Where is the next trillion dollars going to come from? You know, I've always felt, you know, your market cap elevation is an effect of the value you provide. And I feel fortunate our mission is timeless. You know, there is more need to organize information than ever before. I still feel searches are biggest moonshot as a company. You know, people will want radically more conversational experiences. They will want what we call multimodal experiences. They may speak to search. They may look at something and ask what what the information is. Being able to adapt to all that and evolve search will continue to be the biggest opportunity. We are so excited about the YouTube cloud or hardware products, Google Play. So we're building a diverse set of businesses, but underlying all of it is the investments we are making in AI. We've invested $100 billion in R&D in the past five years. And so applying AI in a deep way is probably where we will create the biggest opportunity ahead. First off, just making some big acquisitions. Apple's anti-adtracking technology is shaking up the industry. What do you make of these competitive moves? Your competitors say they're on the right side of history. Are they? I look at the fact that there are three billion people who have access to knowledge of their fingertips. I look at the opportunity we provide. I look at the skills people are learning through YouTube. You know, I feel that everywhere when I go talk to people and and providing access to information and knowledge, I think we'll end up being on the right side of history as well. Your predecessor, Eric Schmidt, told me that he feels the latest Facebook revelations are disturbing. Google also has access to massive amounts of our data. Why should half the world's population more than half the world's population trust Google to do the right thing? We are trying to do more with less data. One of the biggest changes we made was making auto delete the default setting for new users signing in. And now over two billion users have their data continuously being deleted. Look, we rely on trust for people, you know, every day when people come to Google, you know, they place their trust in us and vulnerable moments. Maybe a healthy shoe on which they are trying to understand. You know, there's no more important responsibility we have than doing right by that trust. You know, when when we provide Gmail to journalists and realize that their accounts may be under attack by an authoritarian government, I mean, that's what motivates us to make sure be privacy, be security, be trust. We are doing the right thing. Over time regulation will have an important role to play here. I think privacy regulation is important in areas like AI regulation will be important. And so I think, you know, those will be part of the answers as well. The Facebook follow out that Instagram can be toxic to teens, for example, has this raised more or new concerns for you about the impact of technology, tech addiction, algorithms, YouTube even on our children and their development and their mental health. I mean, you're a parent and you also have a lot of power over how this plays out. You know, I mean, like you, you know, bringing kids up in this modern digital world is something I think all parents are anxious about rightfully so. I think, you know, it's part of why a few years ago when in YouTube, you know, we were exposed to a set of concerns. You know, we invested, it became our number one priority to work harder. The reason YouTube invested so much in developing YouTube kids as a safe destination for young children, so on. The technology is going to play a big role in helping give children the next wave of opportunities.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,696,2022-10-08 02:36:02
12471," in developing YouTube kids as a safe destination for young children, so on. Technology is going to play a big role in helping give children the next wave of opportunity as well. So the answer is to develop it responsibly. We have changed our balance in these areas and saying, we think about content responsibility first, and then the pace of development for new features in areas like YouTube. And so that's how we approach it for a while. Facebook and Microsoft are all in on the metaverse. What do you think about the metaverse? What's Google's metaverse strategy? It's always been obvious to me that computing over time will adapt to people and people adapting to computers. You won't always interact with computing in a black rectangle in front of you. So just like you speak to people, you see and interact. Computers will become more immersive. They'll be there when you need it to be. So it's always been excited about the future of immersive computing and being computing AR. And we are in that count as the metaverse. Is that what that is? You know, metaverse is, I think it means different things to different people. The way I think about it is evolving computing in an immersive way with augmented reality. As part of that, there'll be many experiences, some of which will be immersive, interactive virtual worlds, which is the metaverse concept. But I think this doesn't belong to any company. This is the evolution of internet and the web, the internet. All of it will continue to evolve. Google was famous for its campuses, where you could go and never leave. You had everything you ever wanted. Now you've said they can be flexible. They can work from home. They can work at the office. They can be hybrid. They can work remotely permanently, perhaps. Are you committed to really letting them do this forever? And if so, how does that change the future of work and society? Look, we've really embraced the fact that the future is going to be flexible. At Google, we've always tried to give agency to our employees. But we do realize the importance of bringing people together the creatively community and collaboration that comes with it. So the balance we are striking is this notion of tree two. And what we're giving, the strength of our companies, we have more locations than most of the companies. So we're giving people a choice to move anywhere in the world. Four weeks they can work from anywhere. We're going to accommodate 20% of our workforce to be remote over time. So we're going to embrace that flexibility. Forever. Forever, yeah. And we're committed to it. Through it to all it forces us to design better products. And since people use Google Workspace to run their companies, I think gives us a chance to innovate and bring all that out. I think there is so much value in giving people more flexibility between their personal and professional lives. And I think it will lead to people being happier. And I think companies can be successful in that model. And so we are trying to get the best of both worlds, but embrace the flexibility and see where we go. How confident are you that when you look back, you'll be able to say Google did enough to help save the world? We are putting so much energy and resource into it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,697,2022-10-08 02:40:31
12472," The You grew up in India, you lived through droughts, water was scarce. How has that experience shaped your feelings about the urgency of stopping climate change? I grew up in Chennai, India, and a big part of my childhood was a really pretty severe water scarcity. We would get water trucked in for the streets and stand in lines and carry a few buckets of water at home. There was no running water for many years. But fast forward a few years ago, Chennai had one in a hundred-year flood, which was a very extreme event, kind of drove home. That combined with a few years ago, waking up to the orange skies here in the Bay Area, seeing the look of concern on my children's faces and having to explain it, all kind of drove home in a deeply personal way for me. So I think it's the most defining issue we all face and definitely something very motivated on working towards. I remember waking up to those orange skies too and having to have that same conversation with my kids. Do you think the commitments at COP26 went far enough? You know, encouraged by many things, you know, we have to tip our hat to the people who are working super hard. The issues and the trade-offs are genuinely difficult. You have to keep the economies growing. It really matters. But at the same time, it's a pretty severe urgent issue. Some encouraged by the progress, I think it builds on the Paris agreement, so I can see the forward progress. There is a deep anxiety that it all may not be enough. But you know, we have to be optimistic and keep pushing. Google has set some aggressive targets to run entirely on clean energy, to be the first tech giant to do so 24 hours a day. How confident are you that when you look back on this time, let's say a decade from now, you'll be able to say Google did enough to help save the world. We are putting so much energy and resource into it. It's always been kind of a founding value for us. We've been carbon neutral since 2007. We've been matching our energy consumption with renewable energy over the past few years. So this, you know, we are not pushing. It's a moonshot to be 24, 7 carbon free. That means every search you do, every email you send, that we can do it carbon free. We were at 61% in 2019. The number is now 67%. We have set our goals to be 100% by 2030. And to do it globally, that means we have to solve new things which we haven't done before. Wind and solar alone won't be enough. We just started geothermal in Nevada. We will be investing in newer technologies, including carbon capture, etc. over time. So that's what excites me. We are a technology company at heart. So part of there are many answers to this problem. Some of it is that we are going to have to innovate our way out of it. And we want to push as hard as possible in doing that. Our Bloomberg New Economy Forum is happening this year in Singapore and the Asia Pacific region is one of the fastest growing internet economies on the planet. Where do you see the most room, the most opportunity for Google to grow there? You know, it's such a fitting timeframe. You know, glad you're focused on the region. It's the most vibrant region we see. It's our 20th year since we opened our office in Tokyo. It was the first office outside the Bay Area. You have two and a half billion people on the internet. There are many areas in which there are...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,698,2022-10-08 02:44:39
12473," It was the first office outside the Bay Area. You have two and a half billion people on the internet. There are many areas in which they are leapfrogging, trends which are here, and embracing the future. Digital payments is a great example. So many of our products originated from APAC, Google Maps, Google Pay. A lot of our journey to bring computing to more people is playing out in Asia as well. I am excited about also the work we are doing through cloud because the companies that are rapidly transforming themselves digitally. So a chance to provide that is something very exciting for us. So super dynamic region. I feel like we are learning as Google being in the region. And so I think it will transform. The first 10 years I would have said we took products here and brought it to APAC over the past few years. We are beginning to build things there. And some of our future global products will be APAC first and rest of the world later. You can't talk about APAC without talking about China. And you're facing stiff competition from Chinese tech giants there and beyond. What should US policymakers know about competing with China? There's a lot of conversations about US and China. The competition is fierce. Many of the cadeters like AI and quantum computing where we are investing a lot. Chinese companies are neck to neck. What I think about was encouraged by the news coming out of Glasgow, about the US-China Agreement on Climate. To me, while we talk about all the areas where we are competing, some of the biggest areas which are common challenges for all of humanity, the pandemic was one. AI and safety over time will be a shared one. Obviously sustainability is another area like that. So I think these are all areas in which the countries can come together. And so I think that's a way by which we think about as when we compete on the internet and there may be different versions of how the internet plays out. So I see opportunities both sides. What are the chances that Google search will ever come back to China? Or that Google Cloud would ever come to China? Today we don't provide most of our signs in services in China. I don't see that changing. But there are ways, as I said, in areas like AI or sustainability. I think there'll be opportunities for us to work together. Through Cloud, we will support multinational companies which have presents everywhere. So maybe there are opportunities to work that way as well. AI is advancing at an astonishing rate. And it is hard to understand sometimes what this really means. In concrete terms, how will our lives look different? Let's say 10 years from now as a result of AI. Done correctly, in many ways it's going to be helpful to you. You'll take it for granted. The same way today, for example, in India, over 1 third of the queries on many phones come through voice. That is something people take for granted. You can do it. So over time, you'll expect to speak and be able to understand any language in the world. And those are always, it's going to make it better. You may go to a doctor's office and go through a scan. And the system may be prioritizing for the radiologist so that they don't miss some important things, maybe giving them a second opinion. So these are all ways in which it will seamlessly start playing a role. And I think we'll see that if it's a fact. You mentioned if done correctly. And there are concerns. There are fears that AI will replicate the worst of society, even under Google's own roof, from your own researchers. What scares you most about AI? What keeps you up at night? It's the most profound thing we are working on as humanity. And any time you're developing technology, there is a dual site to it. Like the journey of humanity is harnessing the benefits while minimizing the downsides. The good thing with AI is it's both going to take time. I think I've seen more focus on the downsides early on than most of the technology we've developed. So in some ways, I'm encouraged by how much concern there is. And you're right, even within Google, people think about it deeply. I publish a lot of research.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,699,2022-10-08 02:49:03
12474," I'm encouraged by how much concern there is. And you're right, even within Google, you know, people think about it deeply. We publish a lot of research. There are, I think it's more important that there are outside academic institution, governments, nonprofits looking at this issue as well. So I think it'll be an issue which will have a lot of attention, which gives me a lot of comfort as well. You said you'd pick up some new hobbies in the pandemic. What did you start? The cooking pizza, this learning cook, which I was never good at. I'm caught in a little bit better. You have presided over Google through massive social movements that reverberated in and outside the company. What have you learned as CEO since the walk out? For me, you know, it was a moment. I think it changed the company for the better. You know, we've always been committed. It gave us an insight on what more we could do. We undertook deep commitments. And the biggest, you know, overall and diversity and inclusion, I think if you're committed and you actually put in the effort behind it, you can make a difference. Now we have stated clear goals. We are on track to meet those goals. But it forced us to think about new answers. So for example, you know, tech companies used to talk about the pipeline problem. But we are now going to places where the talent is. We are working much harder. So going to Atlanta, going to DC, going to Chicago, going to New York. That's improving our diversity and representation at all levels. The war for talent is even more competitive now in this new world. What are you offering? Elon Musk has said, big tech is a place where talent goes to die. How do you respond to that? I look at the fact that, you know, we are looking to hire 30,000 people next year. I look at the impact we have on many people coming and working in the latest cutting edge things. And many people come in, people leave Google. We are proud of people who have left Google. There are, I think there are over 2000 companies that have been started by whom we call as supers. I'm equally proud of that, right? I think we are one part of a big system. And, you know, I think I think I'm proud of the role we play in bringing in people. And the impact they have over time, and outside world. All right, that's most of the heavy stuff out of the way. We're going to do some rapid fire just to get to know you a little bit better. You said you'd pick up some new hobbies in the pandemic. What did you start? Hi, you know, pizza, cooking pizza, just learning to cook, which I was never good at. I've gotten a little bit better. Great.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,700,2022-10-08 02:53:42
12475," Mac, what did you start? You know, pizza, cooking pizza, just learning to cook, which I was never good at. I've gotten a little bit better. Cricket or soccer slash football? Wow, stuff. Both. Please don't make the quiz. OK. Squid Game or Ted Lasso? I watched both. The Ted Lasso is much more calming. And so I'd rather take Ted Lasso over Squid Game's any day. I know you're a voracious reader. So what's the last good book that you read? You know, I've been on a podcast bench. So a lot more podcasts than books nowadays. OK. Favorite videos you watch on YouTube with your kids? A lot of music videos, music videos. This whole notion where creators are watching other things and commenting on it. It's a trend which my kids are really into. And I've kind of gotten used to it now. So watching other games, it's a phenomenon. Screen time policy that's worked for you as a parent. And what's not worked? You know, I've kind of given agency to my kids. The only thing I tell them is that I can look at their digital well-being once in a while with them. And so. How do you do that? I asked them to show it to me. And they show it on their phones. So that's pretty much the only thing. So beyond that, it's agency and talking to them about it and making sure we are spending time doing other things. And making sure they develop good habits, basically. Metaverse or real world? Done correctly. You know, you shouldn't feel the need to make a choice. You know, you always want to be present in the real world. And when you feel the need to do something, you want to do that. But you know, I do think presence and the realness of the real world will end up mapping for humans for a long time. Do you own any crypto? I wish I did. I've dabbled in it, but you know, in and out. In and out. OK. Larry and Sergey, I'm not going to make you choose. How many times a week do you talk to them? I talk to them regularly. It kind of ebbs and flows. And so there are times we get excited about something. And we spend a lot of time talking it through. But it depends on what I need. A piece of advice you wish you had in your 20s. And a piece of advice you wish you had in your 40s. 20s would be, you know, being patient. You know, I think when you're young, you're very impatient, which is a great thing. But sometimes you do amazing things by slowing down and being really focused and doing it over a period of time. And so I would advise the young, you know, the younger version of me to be more patient. Maybe at 40, I would say, you know, when I look at climate, you know, I want all of us to be impatient. So, you know, I feel like when there's an urgency towards something, and I think the world needs to be impatient. So that's that advice I would give to a older version of me. How much do you personally wrestle with the decisions that you have to make? And how much longer do you see yourself being the CEO of Alphabet, not just Alphabet, but also Google? Yeah. On the first one, there are moments we all have to make tough decisions. And, you know, in some decisions way on me. And, but I, it's a privilege to do it. I have very good people helping me think things through. So I think the combination makes it all, you know, fine. On the second thing, I am, look, I'm so energized by the things we need to do. You know, I didn't have much access to computing growing up. It changed my life a lot. The one laptop or child goal really motivated me to come into technology. And when I look at last week, us launching a affordable smartphone in India, the chance to bring the next billion users in Asia and in Africa online, that gives me a lot of energy. Well, we'll be watching from afar. Sundar Pachai, thank you so much for joining us. It's a wonderful day. Thanks, Sundar. Pleasure to be here. How ever you get your news.

12477," I Bakelesh Jeff Bezos shocked the world when he stepped down a CEO of Amazon. Less shocking was his choice for successor. Annie Jassy was not only one of his longest tenured lieutenants, but the architect of Amazon's multi-billion dollar cloud business, Amazon Web Services, a moonshot that helped transform Amazon into not just e-commerce, but enterprise juggernaut. Jassy then needed to find his own successor, tapping a former colleague who helped grow AWS in its earliest days, but had since left to run Seattle software giant Tableau. His job to continue the reinvention of AWS and in turn, Amazon. Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, new AWS CEO, Adam Salipski. You worked for AWS for 11 years and then went on to become CEO of Tableau Software in 2016. Then you get a call from Amazon to come back and run AWS as CEO. Tell me about that call. Well, I was having a one-on-one at my prior company and my Apple news alerts went off like everybody else's did and it's at Jeff Bezos is taking on a new role and Andy Jassy is taking on the CEO role of Amazon. And of course, Andy and I worked shoulder to shoulder about 20 feet apart for 11 years. So of course, I reached out and congratulated him and we started talking. And the conversation turned to some of the possibilities and next thing I know a little while later, here I am back at Amazon, absolutely delighted and honored to be the CEO of AWS and helping to shepherd this amazing business for our customers. In that process, did you talk to Jeff as well? I had some communication but it was principally with Andy who of course was a new AWS business best and of course was taking on the CEO role. But yeah, there was contact as you might expect with a small handful of other people. So what did Andy tell you he wanted in the next chapter for AWS? Andy reminded me nothing I needed reminding but that it has really still day one for AWS and for our customers. It is still so early in this business and we shouldn't think that just because the business has grown rapidly or just because we are currently the leader in the cloud that it is anything close to mature. And so he really reminded me that we have to stay hungry, innovate as quickly as we ever have done in the past. You are about half a year into the job. What changed while you were gone that surprised you? Well, I think that so many more customers have really adopted the cloud and have really decided that they are going all in. So I mean, it was a pretty decent sized business when I left but it's really grown and the customer base is really expanded. And so now we have very deep relationships at the CEO level, the CIO level across every country, every industry, every use case and we are regularly interacting with the most senior people at our client organizations. So you were working at real networks in the early 2000s and I understand you were offered a job at AWS without even really knowing what it was. I guess AWS was in stealth mode. Well, it was very secret. So it was hard that the company didn't want to talk too much about it but of course we had to talk a certain amount about it. So the call I got went something like we have this initiative to turn the guts of Amazon inside out and expose it to other people. And it sounded intriguing, although I confess I didn't fully understand what that was all about. So I came in and started talking to Andy and a few of the other senior leaders and eventually to Jeff. And I would have to say that even by the time I took the job I thought I mostly understand what they're talking about and it sounds like a good idea and I'm in.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,703,2022-10-08 03:06:26
12478," I would have to say that even by the time I took the job, I thought I mostly understand what they're talking about and it sounds like a good idea and I'm in. But I also was like, well, we'll just have to see how it goes and Amazon's a big place. And so I think we got a lot of intent to succeed here and that's the thing that impressed me was Amazon really had the desire and the intent and the belief that this could be a really good business. AWS comes out of stealth mode and is the first to market with a cloud infrastructure service in 2006. How important was that first start and do you think AWS still has an advantage today because of that? I think the time to market advantage that we had, which was probably honestly five to seven years, had start before other companies really started to take this seriously, was an enormous, frankly, it was just one of the biggest things that happened to us in the early years. Because at the beginning, a lot of people didn't get it. I would get asked a lot in 2006. So what does this have to do with selling books? And I even had a slide with kind of a pilot books on it and a question mark next to it. And the answer was it has nothing to do with selling books, but the technology which enables us to sell books, being global, being at a massive scale, being secure, being low cost, being a highly performant. All that technology has everything to do with offering these types of services externally. Now AWS isn't a scrappy startup anymore and you do have big rivals, even though AWS is still the leader, Microsoft and Google are big rivals. How do you make sure that being big doesn't slow you down? It's a great question because we are currently the leader and I mean, depending on which you're going to be the leader, you're going to be the leader. So I think that's the key to the idea of being a third party. You look at probably a little bit more than twice as big as number two. And it's really important to continue to act as if we're insurgents and to be insurgents and not to start to act like incumbents. And I like to talk about actually managing the business. Put more and more layers into your company, it's all too frequent that you start managing math. You start managing ratios and percentages and growth. And I think it's a real disease if you stray away from really focusing in a deep way on the product you're building and in a deep way on what your customers are telling you. And so we try and organize both with our org structure as well as just with our culture and what we choose to focus on, on really making sure that everybody is thinking about one or both of those two things, product and customers. And if you keep even the most senior leaders engaged at that level, then all of a sudden you maintain the urgency and you keep acting like an insurgent. We got to feel that urgency every day. So keep acting like an insurgent, that's the motto. Absolutely. And structure yourself and build a culture that allows you to. It's one thing to say it, but it's easy to say it, but it's much harder to put in place enabling mechanisms that enable you to do so. We focus a lot of effort on those mechanisms. Now do you think the cloud keeps getting bigger and that AWS and Microsoft and Google just get bigger pieces of an ever-expanding pie? Or at some point does it become a zero-sum game and that fight for market share becomes more brutal and more bloody? Well, I mean this is a very large market segment. I mean if you look at global IT spend, it's in the trillions of dollars I've seen estimates like three trillion dollars. It doesn't really matter how many trillions it is. It's very, very large. We've always believed that this was too good a market segment opportunity for the really to only be one winner. And sure enough, you've seen robust competition emerge and we all compete vigorously, but it is the segment is just growing so rapidly that I think really for us we believe that the winning business strategy for a long time to come and I would maintain forever is to focus not on the competitors but to focus maniacally on customers and wake up every day understanding exactly what it is that they need us to build next and then work backwards from there, back internally to how can we build those things. And if we do the best job at building the most quickly the things that are most important for our customers then I'm really not worried about what the competitors will do.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,704,2022-10-08 03:10:48
12479," At building the most quickly, the things that are most important for our customers, then I'm really not worried about what the competitors will do. You worked 10 feet away from Andy Jassy in the early days. Tell us something about the Amazon CEO that no one knows but you. You're gonna get me in trouble aren't you? You're gonna get me in trouble aren't you? You worked 10 feet away from Andy Jassy in the early days. Tell us something about the Amazon CEO that no one knows but you. You're gonna get me in trouble aren't you? I grew up in Seattle and Andy coming from New York has this fascination I don't understand with New York sports teams so I've had to endure that for a lot of years. New Yorkers yeah so what are you gonna do? I think come to adopt some of the Seattle teams particularly the new hockey team the Kraken here as he should exactly. So how do you expect Andy will be different from Jeff or how has Andy already been different from Jeff? Well I think we're all different as leaders. I think it's all important that we all bring our own stamp to it and operate within ourselves. I don't think I would be a very good Andy. I don't want to presume but I would assume that Andy wouldn't be a great Jeff because Jeff's Jeff Andy's Andy and I'm me. So I think that Andy was certainly bringing a great depth of experience from AWS which is one important part of the business and well having operated that business for so long and I expect that will also give him an opportunity although he was involved in other parts of Amazon certainly for a number of years will be able to bring a fresh perspective to the whole company just as I hope to bring to AWS and I think that fresh perspective is often helpful I think just the mere act of change is useful for the business, for customers, for employees and just to shake things up a little bit. So I think just a fresh perspective. How will you be different from Andy? Well I think that the world around us is changing so much that we're going to have to be different. It doesn't matter what we did yesterday and right after I joined we actually added two new leadership principles which is very exciting. One's around striving to be Earth's best employer and the second around focusing on the fact that success and scale bring broad responsibility and those are things about which I personally am very passionate and so I really personally look forward to digging in and helping the company to figure out what are those things that we have to figure out where can we innovate to be Earth's best employer.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,705,2022-10-08 03:14:56
12480," I personally look forward to digging in and helping the company to figure out what are those things that we have to figure out? Where can we innovate to be Earth's best employer? And then also to figure out externally, what can we do to really be great citizens of our local communities, to be great citizens of our national communities, and to be great citizens of the global community? And I care a lot about those things, as a lot of other people do here, but I plan to put a good amount of energy and time and focus and hopefully help Amazon innovate in all of those areas. How closely do you work with Andy Day-to-Day? Does he regularly weigh in on AWS decisions or not? Well, he's got a pretty broad scope of things to worry about now, so he's got a pretty intense day job, I believe. So he's really focused across the company as you would expect him to be. But that being said, obviously, AWS remains an important part of Amazon, and so we touch base regularly, be it in person or via email, just on the most important things going on in the business. Does Jeff ever weigh in on AWS decisions? Yes, I mean, really from the beginning, Jeff was involved at the very, very beginning at some of the most fundamental decisions. How do you price EC2? What do you name? S3? What does the detail page look like? Obviously, over time, the business grew, but Jeff was always available when we needed him, and I certainly anticipate that'll be the same going forward. So is he still available now? And what do you understand that Jeff's priorities are? Well, I'll let Jeff speak to his own priorities, but certainly Jeff has been available when, for example, we've been doing our annual planning cycle as many companies have, and it's been great to have Jeff weigh in on really where we're heading for the next year and beyond, and to just make sure it's easy to get focused on the details of the business, and it's great to have multiple people who can help you pick your eyes up a little bit. Now, you joined AWS in the middle of a pandemic. You came back to AWS in the middle of a pandemic. That's hopefully moving into the rear view mirror. Moderna is one of AWS's biggest customers. If it weren't for the cloud, if it weren't for AWS, what do we have had a vaccine as quickly as we did? I've got to tell you, Emma, it's been an absolute privilege for us to work with Moderna, because what they're doing obviously is literally life-saving, and they've been so innovative and so creative. Moderna took a drug development process to get to a vaccine candidate. That process would typically have taken them 20 months. And doing that on AWS in conjunction with all the innovation on their side, reduced that 20 months to 42 days, 42 days to get the vaccine candidate, the mRNA vaccine candidate for COVID-19. And that was really running multiple parts of Moderna on AWS. So if you look at the drug design part, they had their drug design studio running on AWS all the way to manufacturing with the new digitized manufacturing that they call their digital manufacturing platform. So it's really end to end and the ability to use massive amounts of resources and to pick the exact type of service and capability for each part of the job and to really bring the full set of resources to bear. In addition to not having to focus on the IT and the infrastructure and the technology, and rather letting Moderna focus on the all important job of drug discovery. So working in partnership, it was just magnificent to see what they accomplished. Since you joined AWS, a number of longtime AWS leaders have moved on to Microsoft, to Stripe, to Tableau. Does that concern you? Well, actually retention has been very good. If you mentioned the senior leaders, if you look at the VP Plus ranks, the VP and above ranks at Amazon, the average tenure is over a decade, over 10 years. So that's actually very, very strong retention. So of course, you're always going to have some level of people coming and people going. And at the end of the day, that's actually healthy for the business. You want new perspectives to come in. Of course, in the right proportion. Amazon has opened an investigation after 550 employees supported a petition claiming a culture of discrimination, harassment, and racism.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,706,2022-10-08 03:19:24
12481," in the right proportion. And Amazon has opened an investigation after 550 employees supported a petition, claiming a culture of discrimination, harassment, bullying, and bias. What's the status of this? Well we are incredibly focused and I personally believe it's incredibly important to really have a very diverse, you know, inclusive and equitable environment. And we're going to make sure that whatever it takes that we've got that. So we believe that we're really doing a lot of things to deliver on that and we've got a lot of innovative efforts around bringing in a diverse workforce, which we have to have both because we're going to serve our customers best, they're diverse, we have to match that diversity. And also I just believe it's our responsibility and it's the right thing to do. But anytime there is any possibility that something is not gone the way we wanted to, we're going to investigate it thoroughly. That's what we're doing in this case and we'll make sure that we're operating in a way that's consistent with our values and that's always the only goal. If you could rewind to the early 2000s, the earliest days of AWS, is there anything you would have done differently to build an inclusive culture, to start with a more inclusive culture, to make sure that it didn't become a boys club? Well, I don't think that's what we have. I think that we do have a really fun, exciting innovation led and inclusive culture. And that being said, these are hard problems. I think we've done a lot but we are nowhere close to where we need to be. We're going to be restless and dissatisfied with our progress on DE and I just as we are with every other part of our business. Mark Zuckerberg is making a big bet on the metaverse. How big do you think it's going to be? It's such an interesting sentence. The metaverse is real. I think it's going to be a great deal. AWS has the biggest trove of sensitive corporate data in the world. I'm curious how you think about the balance between data and privacy and freedom and civil liberties in the modern era. I mean, there are governments. There are nation states around the world that want that information. Hackers and criminals want that information. Well, we are very clear to start with that. Our first job is security. We often say security is job zero. It was on the first page of our operating plan pretty much every year that I can remember. But what about when governments request that information? So, it's a pin of that information. Sure. Well, we are very clear that our customers data is their data. So the data belongs to our customers. And not everybody operates that way. We are not going to look at customers data. It's using their data.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,707,2022-10-08 03:23:45
12482," So the data belongs to our customers and not everybody operates that way. We are not going to look at customers' data. We are not going to compete against our customers using their data. Their data is their data. And furthermore, we have all sorts of architectural best practices that our customers should be and are using for any sensitive data. And so a lot of that really relies around encryption. And so we build a lot of different encryption capabilities so that any sensitive data, which could leak for any reason, be it to a government, be it to a hacker, be it to anyone else, any form of security breach, that it's encrypted and useless to anybody else. Given the broad array of encryption solutions that we provide, it's actually very doable and powerful for our customers to safeguard their data that way. Mark Zuckerberg is making a big bet on the metaverse. Is AWS going to have a role in the metaverse? I think AWS already has a big role in the metaverse. So I think the cloud enables the metaverse. So if you think about all of the compute capacity, all of the storage, all of the machine learning, which is required to create, compelling and delightful end user experiences in the metaverse, a lot of that is already today running on AWS. So if you take Epic Games, for example, so Epic Runs Fortnite, massively popular game, 350 million users worldwide and Epic Runs, almost everything on AWS from the back end servers to the analytics and everything in between. So I think that's a great example of the metaverse at work and all that's happening today on AWS. And we anticipate that's only going to grow really rapidly in the future. How big do you think it's going to be? Such an interesting sentence. The metaverse is real and yet it's virtual at the same time. I think that if we continue to do what we've always done, which is to provide a technology platform that allows organizations to transform, then these gaming and entertainment and social media and other companies will be able to do what they do best, which is to focus on innovating on behalf of their end users. And I think that the metaverse in many other areas will be rich with invention. So this next conversation will happen in the spheres in the metaverse. That's where we'll next meet. That could be on me. I'll meet you in the metaverse. Let me see you there. Now I know that climate change, you know, and stopping climate change and your data center footprint is a big passion of yours. How fast will Amazon's data centers get to carbon neutral? Amazon is already the largest purchaser of renewable energy in the world. And we're, we intend to be 100% renewable energy by the year 2025. We originally said 2030. We actually accelerated that by five years to 2025. And that's part of our broad or climate pledge that Amazon created, and to which we've now gotten 200 other organizations to sign on to. And the climate pledge is to be a net zero carbon by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Accord target. We know how to do some of that other part are going to require invention, but we really look forward to it. And I think it's, it's one of the most important things we can do for our generation. Amazon counts some of the biggest oil and gas producers as its customers. Isn't that a contradiction? Should you be kicking them off your platforms? Those customers are trying to get to sustainable business models, which rely on new energy sources. And so many of those customers are figuring out how do they get to wind, how do they get to solar, how do they get into batteries, all new business models relying on renewable energy. And I think rather than abandoning them and having them maybe dig in more on fossil fuels, if we can enable them to move faster, to be more innovative, and to be more agile in figuring out new business models, new technical solutions, experimenting, failing fast and moving on to the next next idea, then the whole world will get to the renewable energy solutions that we need.

12483," Not giving the keynote. You will be, give us a preview. What can we expect to hear? We're going to have a lot of really exciting announcements. So I think across our service portfolio, you'll see that. We have a lot of exciting partner announcements. Partner ecosystem still remains to this day so important to what AWS is doing. And we have some great announcements lined up for that. And then I think people are going to want to see that we're making it easier and easier for them to consume the cloud and to work with AWS. And so we're going to continue to, in addition to building more powerful basic capabilities, we're going to continue to make it easier and easier in a variety of ways to interact with AWS.

Since this very first YouTube video was uploaded 16 years ago, the world's most popular video network has exploded to more than two billion users in the farthest corners of the planet. Now, raking in billions of dollars every year. It's evolved a long way from Pat videos to become a one-click journey to the center of the zeitgeist pop culture and kid culture. Amplifying some of the brightest and sometimes darkest traits in all of us. While YouTube has elevated a generation of creators and educated and entertained generations of viewers, it's fought misinformation, terrorism, racism, and violence many clicks along the way. Lately, YouTube's biggest battles are focused on eliminating COVID and vaccine misinformation and keeping the platform safe for kids and teens. On this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, we rewind to talk about where YouTube has been and fast forward to where it's going next with one of the longest tenured employees and women at Google, the CEO of YouTube, Susan Wajitski. It's been five years since we last talked on camera and we have a new president. We are weathering a pandemic. The most watched video on YouTube is... Baby Shark? Baby Shark. So, a lot's changed since 2016. How do you feel about YouTube 2021?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,709,2022-10-08 03:32:25
12484," YouTube is baby shark baby shark. So a lot's changed since 2016. How do you feel about YouTube 2021 versus 2016? I feel good about it. It's definitely been a while and in technology things moved so quickly. So a lot of things have changed since 2016. And I mean, overall, I've been really pleased that we've continued to grow and grow our ecosystem of creators. We've invested a lot in responsibility and that's been a really big focus for us. And with weather through a pandemic and a lot of hard challenges, but overall, I'm feeling really good. You've been at Google for 20 plus years going all the way back to Larry and Sergey in the garage. You've been the CEO of YouTube for seven plus years. How has your job changed in that time? Since I joined being the CEO of YouTube, I would say one of the biggest things that has changed, certainly has just been maybe the recognition of the importance of digital video. So when I first joined, actually a lot of people would say, oh, like, why did you join? I was running ads beforehand. And that was, that's been the main way Google generates revenue. And so a lot of people said, like, why did you leave that and go to YouTube? But I always believed in digital video. And I believe that now we see that the world also believes we've seen a lot of adoption of digital video and the benefits that that can have. You've championed this diversification strategy at YouTube since you started. What's working and what's not working? Well, our main way of generating revenue is from advertising. But we also have really grown our subscription revenue. And that has been really, really important from many different reasons. So that has enabled our users to have an experience where they can have music, YouTube music and premium. We just announced the 50 million subscribers that we were really excited about. But we also see other ways that our creators generate revenue. So our creators, for example, generate revenue with channel subscriptions. They may sell merchandise. We also have things like digital goods, so like super chat, super thanks. And so we've basically diversified the number of ways that our ecosystem is generating revenue. The original tagline for YouTube was broadcast yourself. And that concept has exploded. You have ordinary people in the spotlight. When they grow up, they want to be an influencer. They want to be a YouTube star or a YouTube creator. What do you see as the future of the creator economy? I see a lot of possibility with the creator economy. And because I see that many people have a lot of interest and they have a lot to offer. And beforehand, they went up and been able to have shared that with the world. And so there are so many people depending upon what their talent or their interest is, whether it's a sport or cooking or gaming or hairstyles that people have come out and really been able to share that and create a lot of jobs. So we actually see, like our, we actually saw a 35% increase in the number of creators that are generating six figure income out of YouTube. And in the last year. And so that's just an example of like how the creator economy is continuing to grow. Well, and for years, YouTube was the only company that actually paid creators. But now a lot of companies are paying creators. Facebook, Instagram, Snap, TikTok. How do you see that competition playing out? Who wins? But it is a competitive landscape. And in general, competition is good. It makes everyone work harder and that's good. I mean, we look at creators and we say, they're going to come to us if we do the best job. And creators come to us looking basically for fame and fortune. Like, how can I, I have a skill or I have a talent, something I want to share with the world like, and YouTube can help that be known, can help them provide that fame. But also we can generate revenue for them. And so as long as we're doing a good job of that, creators are going to come to us. If we start to fail, then they're going to leave us and they're going to go to another platform. And so we just need to work really hard to make sure that we deliver that for our creators. A year ago during the Black Lives Matter protest, YouTube made big commitments to Black creators in particular. What's been the progress there? And how do you see YouTube, the potential for YouTube to be used as a tool?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,710,2022-10-08 03:36:55
12485," YouTube made big commitments to black creators in particular. What's been the progress there? And how do you see the potential for YouTube to be used as a tool for social justice? Well, so we've made an announcement that we were gonna do a $100 million black voices fund. And so we're continuing to develop content there. But one of the other thing, and I think there's been a lot of great content that's come out and we'll certainly see more. But because YouTube doesn't have any gatekeepers, like you can just post and become a creator, we have seen a lot of people of different backgrounds and underrepresented backgrounds become creators and have audiences. We never really measured it beforehand because we didn't have a way. And so one of the things that we've done is we've enabled creators to now tell us what backgrounds they affiliate with so we can have a better understanding of how they're doing on our platform. Let's talk about YouTube shorts. It seems to be a top priority. We all know that TikTok is on the rise. It's an important R&U to shorts to the platform, to the company. So YouTube first, it's very important. We see that creators and users wanna watch all types of content, long form, short form. It turns out that the first video that was actually ever uploaded to YouTube, me and the zoo was an 18 second video. So it was a short form video. And we have lots of short form videos and we've had it way before TikTok did. But what we have really been leaning into more is just enabling those to be found. And then a lot of the creation tools. And so bringing a lot more mobile creation is really important for us going forward. Did you notice that viewing time was being lost to TikTok? Did you see that trend? And do you see TikTok as a sort of existential threat? I mean, we definitely see many competitors in this space. What we're just focused on are our own metrics. Like do we see our users engaging? Where's our opportunity? We're always looking around and seeing what our competitors are doing. And if they're doing something that we think would be good for our users and our creators, we're also gonna look at how we can improve our own economy, creator economy, and what's good for our users. I think a lot of people, we talk about vaccine hesitancy and they blame social media. They say YouTube's not doing enough. One of the big things for us is to continue to work with public health experts to get their messages across. Today's your big day, are you excited? Mama is tired. This is Peter Plarr. You have to feed your creativity. So this tree house, you guys ready for the movie? See what we can do. At this point, YouTube has become a hub for discovery, for information, for information, for, you know, it satisfies our curiosities, right? That comes with a lot of inspiration, but also with misinformation. When it comes to vaccines, vaccine hesitancy, videos that...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,711,2022-10-08 03:41:45
12486," satisfies our curiosity, right? That comes with a lot of inspiration, but also with misinformation. When it comes to vaccines, vaccine hesitancy, videos that cause a public health risk, where do you want to see YouTube do better? We've taken responsibility very seriously. It's been one of my top priorities. So first of all, we want to make sure that if there's information that violates our policies, we came up with 10 different policies around COVID. Then if that's a violation of policies, then that's something that we'll remove. We removed over a million videos associated with COVID. But we also want to make sure that we're raising up information that we think would be that come from trusted and authoritative sources. And we've really been able to do that. I think a lot of people, you know, we talk about vaccine hesitancy and they blame social media. They say YouTube's not doing enough, you know, how do you respond to that? Yeah, I mean, I think, first of all, we're always learning. I just just to be fair, like we're always thinking about how can we do better? We're looking at the feedback and working with public health experts across the board. And, you know, I think one of the big things for us is to continue to work with public health experts to understand, you know, what are the ways that we can partner with them to get their messages across. And I really believe that that is something that has really changed is the evolution of bringing creators, musicians, experts talking about public health. We never would have seen that before in the pandemic. How much do you internalize the criticism of YouTube's content? Do you take it personally? And how does that influence the decisions that you make as CEO? I want to be doing the right thing. And I care about that. I care about the legacy that we leave. I care about the world that we leave to our children. I care about how media is consumed by the next generation and by everyone today. And so I really have put a lot of time and effort to make sure that we are acting responsibly. And there's always a balance between the free speech and the right, but being responsible and taking down content that we think could lead to some kind of real-world harm. And so I mean, sure, I think whenever you're in a position like that, there's going to be a lot of criticism. But our goal is just to continue to talk to experts and evolve. And how do you make decisions in those tough moments where it's a tough call? Like how much of it is making a decision or leading by consensus and how much does it come down to you? The goal is that when we have tough decisions, they're not, we're not, they are like improvising in some way. Like we've made a concrete set of decisions beforehand and then we're looking and saying, is this something that meets our standards? Is it a violation or not a violation? And if it seems like there's some set of issues with the content that we have on the platform, we're going to go back to experts and then reevaluate, should we be making changes to our policies? YouTube helped keep a generation of children connected, educated, entertained, distracted, through the pandemic. What have you learned from that experience? And what do you see as the potential future of YouTube as a tool for learning, as a tool in schools? When I meet people and they find out I'm the CEO of YouTube, almost always, they tell me about something they learned on YouTube or someone that they're something their family member learn. So I see that as being a very significant part of YouTube. And during the pandemic, we certainly saw that a lot more education went online and we had all the home schooling, we had people who had to also just learn a lot of skills that they hadn't learned beforehand. But probably the biggest thing that we also learned was just, and that I really saw, was the need for us to continue to work with educational institutions. And the need for us to be able to integrate with some of the learning tools that the kids are all using because they are using YouTube. And there's a lot more that we can do to really help educators have YouTube be a key part of the curriculum. My kids are on YouTube a lot and sometimes more than I want them to be and sometimes it's super productive and they're learning something cool and sometimes it's not productive at all. How are you innovating to make the time that kids spend on YouTube more valuable and of course safe? It's very important to me as a parent to make sure that we're giving parents options about how what they want their kids to see. And that's one of the reasons that pretty much as soon as I got to YouTube, we started working on YouTube kids, which is a separate app which is important.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,712,2022-10-08 03:45:36
12487," about how what they want their kids to see. And that's one of the reasons that pretty much as soon as I got to YouTube, we started working on YouTube kids, which is a separate app, which is important for kids in terms of how we can control the quality. And we can give parents a lot more control about what kind of content is appropriate for them and their family. And there are many other things. Like we actually just came out with a supervised experience for tweens because tweens was one of the age groups that was actually hardest. They usually don't want to be on the kids app, but they're not 13 to be on the main app. And so the supervised experience is something that we recently came out with. The Wall Street Journal has been doing some in-depth reporting on Facebook. The report is that Facebook knew that Instagram was toxic for teen girls and didn't do anything about it. Does YouTube look at the impact it has on teen users? The influence it might have on someone's body image or self-esteem? First of all, I think it's a very important topic. And we do have a panel of experts that we work with to be able to help us understand what are the different ways that our product could be used or what are, how do we face some of these challenging issues to make sure that we're getting the best advice. And we certainly do see for a lot of really tough issues that YouTube can be a really valuable resource. So body positivity, mental health, we see a lot of creators actually talk about mental health. And that for a lot of kids, it's really, it like destigmatizes and enables people to talk about what's happening and what's going on with them. The potential long-term impacts of YouTube on teens and on children, whether it is toxic or whether it's addictive, is that something that you wonder about, is that something that you struggle with not just as a CEO, but as a mom? We certainly want to make sure that we are doing what we can to be responsible with kids in an every way possible. And that's one of the reasons that we actually have worked hard to give parents as many options as possible for them to decide what is important for them and their family, whether that's limiting screen time, limiting what is the content they actually have access to. Even letting parents just say, these are like the 10 videos. My kid can only see these 10 videos. And so that is really important for us to give the tools back to parents for them to decide what is best for them and their family. Are you concerned about looming regulation? There may be regulation that is well intended, but actually then has a really negative impact. I would like to begin by addressing the heinous attack on the United States Capitol. Like all Americans, I am outraged by the violence, lawlessness, and mayhem. How much did President Trump test?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,713,2022-10-08 03:49:58
12488," like all Americans I am outraged by the violence, Trump test YouTube and how much did it test you as a leader? is incredibly important and with leaned into in every way we possibly can. we treat all public figures and all public leaders the same as we treat any individual. and so meaning that everybody is held to the same standards. and so we definitely held President Trump as we would hold all other presidents and all other elected officials to the same standards that we hold our creators and anyone else on YouTube. but was that difficult for you as the CEO of the company? I mean that's kind of that's like a big responsibility. I mean yeah it is difficult but it is very important and we also are global. so we're dealing with leaders from all over the world and there were a number of leaders that are and there continue to be a number of leaders that poster that there's content that may be a violation of our policies. but we do hold a consistent standard across everything that we do. YouTube was the last platform to ban Trump and you have said his channel will be reinstated when an elevated risk of violence has subsided. how and when specifically will you make that decision? well we'll make that decision based on a number of different factors whether that is like events in the news, signals were seeing from the government. and we'll certainly continue to evaluate that based on a large number of signals that we see. and will he ultimately be reinstated? I mean we've stated that we will reinstate him when we believe that there is no risk to public safety or no public danger. we'll just remove devoting app for Russian opposition leader Alexi Navalny. the Russian government seems to be stepping up requests to take down content. you've talked in the past about your family history, your grandparents living behind the iron curtain, being concerned about censorship back then, and Russia is a huge YouTube audience. how concerned are you about Russian government overreach? one of the things that is important to us at YouTube is the fact that we do enable so many voices and that we do enable people to express themselves and really celebrate the freedom of speech. and we certainly, that's a core value of ours. but when we work with governments there are many things that we have to take in consideration, like whether it's local laws or what's happening on the ground. and so there's always going to be multiple considerations that we're going to have to take into consideration. Navalny said that YouTube deleted a video, one of his videos. was that at the request of the Russian government? we certainly get requests from governments. and we look and consider why are we getting the request? what's actually happening on the ground? and based on a whole bunch of different factors, we make a decision. so we don't always, those are not always requests that make sense for us to honor, but in certain cases, we will honor them in that country. the five administration seems to be targeting big tech. we've seen Mark Zuckerberg, we've seen Jack Dorsey now testify before Congress multiple times. and I've heard it said that YouTube is getting a pass. do you think you should be up there testifying? well I think we do get a lot of scrutiny. I feel like there's a lot of scrutiny. and because YouTube is part of Google, sender has testified a number of different times and answered many different questions on YouTube. so I do believe there's a certain amount of scrutiny. and if I were ever asked to testify, it certainly would go and testify as well. you're one of the most senior women at Google. if not the most senior woman at Google. Google has faced a lot of scrutiny for how it treats women in recent years. how much progress do you think Google has made in hiring and promoting women across the company? and how much progress do you think still needs to be made? I see a really big effort across technology as a whole to be able to be more inclusive. and I think that is really positive. I've been a big supporter of it. it's the very beginning. and I think at Google there are many efforts.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,714,2022-10-08 03:54:13
12489," And I mean, I think at Google there are many efforts and there's a lot of work that has been done. And I'm sure there's a lot more for us to continue to do. And if you just look at the stats, you can see they're not enough women. We need more women in technology. And I think we have made a lot of progress. But it's still hard. It's harder to be a woman in technology. It's harder to be a minority of any kind. And so I think there's still a lot of work for us to do. When we last spoke five years ago, you know, I asked you about being a mom. You have five kids and you said something that really stuck with me. You said being a mom makes me a better leader. I prioritize better. I see something growing fast. And I run towards that. If something's growing closely, I'm like, I don't have time for that. How has that management strategy played out for you? I think it's played out really well. I mean, prioritization is everything when you look at it because we have a lot of opportunity. There's a lot of moving pieces, very dynamic environment. So if you can prioritize and say these are like the most important things to do, then you're going to get there faster. Lauren, started having a left. How long do you plan to keep running YouTube? How long do you plan to stay at Google? As long as I have a mission that I believe in and that things that I'm excited about getting done. So I have a lot of ways that I see that YouTube can continue to grow. I have a lot of products and ideas and things that aren't yet released. And things that we don't aren't yet doing. And I'm excited about getting those done. So I think if there comes a time where I no longer have a list of projects, or I feel like I don't have that much more to add, then it'll probably be time to do something else. Would you throw your hat into the ring to be Alphabet's next CEO, or if the board asked you, would you step up and do that? Well, I think Sundar is doing a great job. Very, very, very, please. I think he's doing, I mean, it's a very challenging job. There's a lot of different constituents and a lot of product, a lot of different issues. And I mean, I'll just say I'll always do whatever would be, wherever I could be most helpful to the company. Do you still talk much to Larry and Sergey? I do still see them socially, though, not work-wise. Do you ever talk about work? I mean, sometimes we'd be casually, but our business is very complex right now. And there's a lot of things that are happening. And so it's hard for, I mean, people may have different opinions, but to really engage, it's a long conversation. What do you want your legacy to be? I am proud of the way that we've been able to enable people to have a channel, to have an audience. And I've been able to work with a number of three creators, and YouTube really was able to let them shine and create audiences in a business, and employ people that otherwise never would have happened. And so that's certainly one. Continuing to grow that. I'd say second, it's been really important to me too, to see a lot more women in technology. That has been just a personal goal of mine, is to be a role model, and try to support women. It's very fortunate to have gotten to where I have, and I know it was due to many different factors. And I want to support the next generation of women, and see technology as like an open place where anyone can come and be successful. And then probably lastly continue to grow what we're doing with education. Susan, would you please do your YouTube? Thank you so much for having me. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. We have to get interest rates higher and bring inflation back to our target. 33 million people have been affected by this flooding and losing. Disruption is the whole point of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,715,2022-10-08 03:58:31
12490," It's higher and bring inflation back to our target. 33 million people have been affected by this flooding and losing. Disruption is the whole point of a strike. With unmatched reach and resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks, 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, you are global business authority. Indonesia's economy is rising fast with massive factories like these ones dominating the outskirts of Jakarta. I last met President Jokko Widodo, or Jokkoi, as he's more often known, in his home town of Solo, but that was almost three years ago and a lot has changed. You've dealt with Elon Musk? Yeah. We left Jakarta's presidential palace by convoy for a huge Hyundai factory built during COVID on three quarters of a million square meters of land. Jakkoi, who once ran a furniture business, has equally large ambitions for his country's economy. He's banned the export of raw nickel in favour of downstream products, and will instead produce refined nickel that will be used in the batteries to power electric vehicles. An equally impressive factory is being built nearby for just that purpose. If you work in a factory, it's a salary much higher, bomb-firing bomb.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,716,2022-10-08 04:04:42
12491," An equally impressive factory is being built nearby for just that purpose. If you work in a factory, it's a salary much higher. Comparing with the other industry, in the automatic industry, higher. Much higher. Higher than furniture. Of course, yes. If Joukoui has his way, other raw materials will follow. Coal, boxite, tin, golden copper, even palm oil. This November, Indonesia will host the G20. Joukoui is one of the few leaders to have met both China's Eugene Ping and Russia's Vladimir Putin since the invasion of Ukraine. This is a conversation with President Joukoui of Indonesia. President Joukoui, thank you for talking to Bloomberg again. When I was last here in 2019, you had just been re-elected. Now, you're halfway through your final term as President of Indonesia. You are the biggest country in Southeast Asia. You are right in the middle of the United States and China and their arguments. You recently said the world was in dire need of responsibility and wisdom. I suppose my first question for you was Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan? Was it wise? Was it even responsible? Yes. Rifalitas and Taranaka Rapa Sarmaemang. The rivalry of the big countries is indeed worrying. What we want is for this region to be stable, peaceful, so that we can build economic growth. And I think not only Indonesia, Asian countries also want the same thing. I think you are being very diplomatic, President. There was word that Nancy Pelosi was going to come to Indonesia and then you decided to change that plan. Is that true? No, no. We will openly receive, but there was no visit. There now seems to be a more serious danger of a Chinese invasion in Taiwan. And there is a concern that if there is a conflict in Taiwan, it would spill over into the South China Sea, where you have territory, territory that China can test. Is Indonesia ready to defend itself or defend its land and waters in that case? Are you ready for that conflict militarily if it happens? Yes, once again we are thinking about this. We do want the region to be peaceful. It shouldn't come to the point that tensions rise until it affects economic growth and then later on affects the well-being of our people. In my opinion, it is very important that there is a space for dialogue between leaders, especially leaders of big countries. The global situation is extremely difficult and there shouldn't be further unnecessary issues. We are going through a food crisis and an energy crisis that hasn't been resolved. The pandemic still exists since some countries. Is that going to be a big theme for you at the G20 that you want to turn the debate away from these rivalries between superpowers and focus on issues like food security, inflation? Yes, it is better than having open conflict. It is better to have a forum for dialogue like G20. If there is space for discussion, we can discuss and have debates and hopefully come up with solutions. This is what we want. This is why we have a space for dialogue. I know that you have invited President Xi Jinping to come to the G20. Has he said he will come here in November? Yes, President Xi Jinping will come. And President Putin. President Putin has also told me he will come. Do you worry at all about the G20 being this conflict where you have the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,717,2022-10-08 04:07:09
12492," President Putin has also told me he will come. Do you worry at all about the G20 being this conflict where you have the democracies coming forward with plans? And you have Putin sitting there in one room like this, and you have Xi Jinping with his own agenda. It will be a very difficult house party to run. We are the ones who are in the G20. At the G20, we do not want to add to conflict or problems, but to resolve the problems. How we can resolve all these problems, not to add problems and conflict. You know, you've been to Xi Putin, you've been to Cesar Lensky, you've been to Xi Jinping. Do you think that by bringing people together, that that is a way to solve conflict? Sometimes it can increase it. There must be communication. Even if it does not necessarily resolve the problem, it is better to have dialogue than to have open conflict. When we started this interview, I said that you were in the middle between China and America. But having looked at Indonesia, I looked at the numbers. America's investment in Indonesia over the past five years is $9 billion. China has invested $40 billion. You know, you look around here. We have a Chinese car factory around the corner. China is buying up a lot of the refineries and make precious metals. America at the moment is losing the battle for hearts and minds in Indonesia, but also in Southeast Asia. Do you think that is fair? Yes, that's a possibility. This is an approach that needs to be renewed because what is needed by countries in Asia, including Indonesia, is investment. What investment? If it comes from China, we welcome it. If it comes from America, we welcome it. We are not going to be choosy. We are not choosy. One side is coming and saying, I want to invest, I want to trade. And the other one is saying, no trade packs. I want to come and talk about other things. That is why I said previously they need to renew their approach. You have dealt with Donald Trump, who famously insulted his allies and promoted America first. Joe Biden was supposed to be different, but rhetoric aside, is there any change? Surely Joe Biden is still saying America first. He just isn't insulting you at the same time. Indonesia wants to be friends with everyone. With any country, we don't have problems with any country. Each country will have their own approach. Each leader has their own style and approach, so there shouldn't be a problem. But now what's needed by Indonesia is investment, technology that will change our society. I just wanted to ask you about ASEAN since you mentioned it. You have a group of countries. But it is one where you look at the countries, it includes Myanmar, which seems to have all these problems with human rights and so on. Why do you keep Myanmar in ASEAN? We already had a meeting in Jakarta with all members of ASEAN. All the leaders came, including Myanmar's junta. And there's a consensus, five point consensus. The implementation hasn't taken place, and the approach we have taken hasn't worked. That's the complication we're facing. There are several ASEAN meetings after that, which we did not include Myanmar participation. One very last thing on foreign policy, you've been to go and see Vladimir Putin and tried to talk to him and you saw President Zelensky in Ukraine. I think you've focused on food security and issues like that. Do you see any sign of peace or progress there as the President of the G20? I went to Kiev and talked to President Zelensky, one and a half hours, then went to Moscow, Russia, to meet with the President.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,718,2022-10-08 04:11:28
12493," I went to Kiev and talked to President Zelensky, one and a half hours. Then went to Moscow, Russia, to meet with President Putin and talk with him almost two and a half hours. I want to see a space for dialogue after the meeting so we can discuss. Anywhere is no problem, but I see the chances are small. So I turned to issues like food crisis, and President Zelensky said they can't export because there were no guarantees for security to ship goods from Odessa port to Istanbul. That was the message I conveyed to President Putin. And President Putin said he will guarantee security for ships to enter Odessa. Those are what I told the media. Imagine simply climbing a cable into space. The concept is known as the space elevator. Not only could it significantly change how we leave planet Earth, but it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space. And there are scientists who think we could have already built it. We have the material, we have the technology, we have the lasers, we have the climbers, we have all of them. If a private entity wants to build it or a government, they can build it. It will change society. We have no clue how colonizing in the space, how really spreading on the space, really change our society over the next 50 to 200 years. It will be completely different. Indonesia is an extremely resource rich country and the economy's potential is enormous. It has a third of the world's nickel reserves used in the lithium batteries of electric vehicles. It's the world's biggest grower of palm oil, the second largest miner of tin, the third biggest producer of coal and ranks fifth for boxite. Its grassberg mine has won the largest reserves of gold and copper. Resource nationalism is nothing new, but Indonesia's two term president is doubling down. After banning the export of raw nickel, he's now planning the same path for all the others. Jikoi is moving downstream, creating higher value products, who will be used in everything from aircraft to semiconductors to touch screens and the batteries in electric vehicles. We want the added value to be in Indonesia, so there will be state income in form of tax, provide jobs in Indonesia. And the most important thing is that we can enjoy the added value. John, I'll give you nickel as an example. When we exported raw materials four to five, six years ago, the value was only $1.1 billion. So we went downstream in 2021, our exports were valued at 20...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,719,2022-10-08 04:15:48
12494," Once we went downstream in 2021, our exports were valued at 20.8 billion, that's nearly 18 times. That's what we want to do with Bauxcite, copper, tin, crude, palm oil, and others. We are not being closed. We are being open indeed. U.S., China, Europe, want to come and cooperate. We are open. We want to come here and use these raw materials to make things. And so just to be clear, ferronical and pig iron, they will be the next ones to be stopped exported. So people have to use them here. If this is what we are doing, we will be able to do it. When we, the industry here, are ready. Exports automatically will stop. What we want is to build a large ecosystem to produce electric cars, as many as we can here in Indonesia. And Bauxcite and tin will also be in this list of materials to use inside Indonesia. Yes, that is correct. Not only nickel, Bauxcite, for example, is used to produce alumina. And then be used to make cars body or cars chassis. Okay, this is more beautiful. You've talked about putting a tax on nickel products. You know, the next stage up, is that going to happen this year? An export tax on nickel products. Yes, common good, then. You're just possible to impose it this year. I can see around here you've had a lot of success. You and I went around to a rather nice car factory. And you have the electric vehicle, the electric battery construction, Hyundai, LG, Volkswagen and Toyota, Seamkin. The person who everyone talks about is Tesla. And you have a $5 billion contract to supply nickel ore. But you wanted to have a Tesla car factory. It now looks as if you hope together a Tesla battery facility. And I wondered if you could give us any news on that. Is that any closer? If it is Tesla, we want them to build electric cars in Indonesia. From Ford as well, we want them to build electric cars here. From Hyundai, electric cars, from car makers in Japan, Toyota and Suzuki. We want to be a big ecosystem. We want a huge ecosystem of electric cars for the world. We don't just want to reach batteries only because this is just half of them. You made a very eloquent case and Elon Musk is a famously reasonable man. Why is he said no to the car factory then? It's still in discussion. Let's see later the final result. You have negotiated with Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin. Either of them is difficult to deal with as Elon Musk. Everything needs time. I don't want to go quick with no result. It needs an intense communication and the result will show. Do you think there has been an element, though? Again, looking around here, there tends to be the Asian countries which have been first trying to build electric battery facilities here. In the future, we want to build a large ecosystem for electric cars that is truly environmentally friendly. So the energy will come from green energy, such as hydro power plants, geothermal, wind, sea waves, solar panels. The famous case of the palm oil, I think people back in April, you suddenly imposed an export ban on palm oil. The price shot up to $1,600. Fludded the domestic market, then you...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,720,2022-10-08 04:20:12
12495," But it could mean more farmers going organic for the long term. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. We have to get interest rates higher and bring inflation back to our targets. It's better to pass this become a skier. We are running on thin ice. No one deliberately wants to go into the better, but we still walk into conflict with unmatched reach and resources. From more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. Everything you need to get set for the start of U.S. trading, Bloomberg, the open with Jonathan Farrow. Filling down in the numbers and preparing you as only Bloomberg can, weekdays on Bloomberg. Every Friday with 30 minutes dedicated to fixed income, I'm Jonathan Farrow this. Here's Bloomberg real yield. A consistent thing you've been talking about is green industries in the environment. You have a goal to make Indonesia carbon neutral by 2060. As you know, most of your energy now comes from coal, coal prices have gone up. And I wonder, will you stick to your pledge that you would build no new coal-fired plants that that has gone forever? Our target is very ambitious. 41 percent, 2030 and 2060, we should be at zero, but this requires technology and funding. Money, the potential is clear. We have potential of renewable energy to produce 434,000 megawatts. But to shift from coal to renewable is not an easy thing because the price to produce energy from coal is still cheaper than geothermal. You're sticking to your pledge that there will be no new coal-fired power. Yes, it's being done. It's just that there are still some that are still in the process of being completed, not new ones. Indonesia has an oversupply of electricity. You think all is correct? Half of the emissions from Indonesia come from land use and forest clearing. And 51 percent of Indonesia is forest and you have committed to keep to that level. But you are still letting people cut down rainforest, which is the really most useful bit. They're building other forests, farm forests. Isn't that the wrong thing? You should be protecting the rainforest first and then thinking about the other kinds of forests next. John forest fire happened more than 20 years ago. Since 2016, it has been reduced by 85 percent. We also do restoration on more than 2 million hectares of peatlands. Within the next three years, we will also do restoration for 660,000 hectares of mangroves forest. In the past five years, we also imposed a moratorium on new palm oil plantation. Does it make you cross when people from the rich world like me appear? And countries that have already taken down their forests used their coal and you have a country of 270 million much poorer people who have not done this yet. And we come and lecture you about this. Massive forest clearing is in the past. No more today. What we have now is restoration, revitalizing, taking care of the environment.

12496," No more today, what we have now is restoration, revitalizing, taking care of the environment. I have required all mining companies to build a nursery for reclamation of their mining areas. We are working to improve the environment. I can take you to the nearest nursery center in Bagoor that produce about 2 million seedlings a year. And we will have 30 of those nurseries, then you will believe that we are serious. Can I ask you very quickly about New Centaura, this capital that you are building. $34 billion, the aim is to finish it by 2045. This would be the new capital of Jakarta in Borneo. I wondered, will you finish the first stage in August 2024? Are you on time in terms of that? The shift to a new capital is a long-term plan since the first president, Sukarno. It's my responsibility to put the policy in place, but we still check the feasibility studies. It will need funding of $33 billion, and we will use state budget to cover for 20%, while the rest 80% from private sector from investment. And this isn't just for two years. It's for 20 years. I'm confident with a good concept, and with good returns for the investments, I am sure many investors will come in. You know that many people in Indonesia look at problems, look at challenges like building New Centaura. That will happen long after you are supposed to give up. You are currently very popular. You have a 68% approval rating, and some people, some of your allies in the legislature have suggested you could amend the constitution so that you could do a third term, keep building this capital, keep building car factories. I wonder if you said before you will follow the constitution, but can you rule this out, regardless of the constitution? Let's talk about the new capital, New Centaura first. There is law on this that is supported by 93% of the parliament. What's there to be afraid of with that much support? Secondly, an amendment of constitution I have said repeatedly I will abide by the constitution, although support from the parliament is at 84%. Once more I will abide to the constitution and wishes of the people. Sayat bada quansitusi. President Jekowi, I'd like to say that you are still looking forward. Thank you very much for talking Bloomberg again. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,722,2022-10-08 04:31:00
12497," here I've talked to you about my own sort of fear of my kids playing too much. A friend was like, try to think of it like he's like a painting. Yeah. Like show it, ask him to show it to you like the same way you would treat a painting. Yeah. I'm gonna say what you mean. Yeah, that's right. So make it a family. Mm-hmm. Do you have kids? I have two daughters. Do they play? Yeah. But they, not a lot because like growing up, I think it was always the thing that dad did. He's in charge of one of the top gaming consoles in the world. Microsoft Xbox, a $16 billion business, home to Minecraft, Halo, and perhaps soon, call of duty. If a $70 billion deal to buy Activision goes through, the executive behind that deal is to Phil Spencer. And if he has his way, he hopes the gaming industry will level up in the next 20 years and be less of a battle between rival consoles and more home to platforms that reach every potential gamer on the planet. Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer. So we're gonna start by going in the way back machine a little bit. Did some research. You worked at a computer mart in Vancouver, Washington where you were selling and playing a lot of computer games in the 80s. Yeah. I'm thinking like stranger things. What are your things resonates with my, yeah, definitely growing up my inner geekdom is there. I'm gonna need some photographic evidence of this. What were your most played games in the 80s? So it was funny when I started growing up playing video games, most of it was going to the arcades. Now most people won't remember these days of like going to a store where you'd put quarters and play. Robatron was one of my favorites in the arcades. I would go play that. And then probably more in the 70s and the 80s, I remember my dad bringing a video game, the Atari 2600 with the cartridges home. And I was kind of the beginning of it and it just kept playing and it's still with me. You started out at Microsoft as an intern in 1988. How would you compare Microsoft's history on games under Bill Gates versus Steve Balmer, versus Sacha Madela? Yeah, I think like many things at Microsoft back in the 80s, we started in video games as much out of kind of a defensive. We were worried that other companies might be putting the home PC in place. And the avenue to get there was through video games and game consoles. So we said, okay, we're gonna go start our own game console because if anybody's gonna build a computer for the home, we wanted it to be Microsoft. I think through Steve's years it was more about growing the business and how do we bring kind of business leadership into this group of Ragtag people who are out there just having fun building video games as part of Xbox. I think when I first took this job and I got this job as head of Xbox about two months after Sacha Nadella became the CEO of Microsoft. Well, and when Sacha started, there were activist investors targeting the company. Yeah. The stock hadn't been doing well. They were targeting Xbox. Absolutely, yeah. The time, absolutely right, that there was a question of why are we in video games? In fact, one of his first questions to me was because he had come from the cloud part of the business being in the cloud, he didn't actually understand why we're in video games. Not as a negative, just as literally, why is Microsoft at the time what $1 trillion market cap company, why are we in the video game business? And he challenged us. Let's go figure out why we're in the video game space and see if it makes sense. And if it does, let's be all in.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,723,2022-10-08 04:36:04
12498," and he challenged us, like let's go figure out why we're in the video game space and see and if it doesn't we make other decisions early in that journey is when this game which I know you know about is Minecraft and the opportunity to acquire Minecraft came about like months after this moment. I might have a kid or two that plays Minecraft. Yes. And it really caused us as a team to think about okay if you're going to go spend two and a half billion dollars on this blocky Java based game how does this fit into the mission of this company. Let's talk about that strategy was the idea to tie gaming to the cloud was that the clincher. If you think about a game like Minecraft or Fortnite or Roblox these are games that play on iPads they play on Xboxes, play stations, PCs that games were going from per device to per user and cloud would be an enabler for that. But we didn't start with how do we fit cloud into video games we were just kind of watching the trends of creators and where they were building and saw this transformation of games being ubiquitous. How does this all as you see it connect to Microsoft's future. The cool thing I see going on now and it does fit with the investments Microsoft's making in Azure and other places is today the world anybody's a creator and video games are going through that same transformation where if I rewind to my childhood and playing video games I walked into like an egghead software and there was a line of boxes. We might go create the best game in the world but there was no way for us to get it in front of an actual person who might want to go play because we couldn't get shelf space all these things today we see gamers on our creators on our platform from all over the globe who can create a game that can literally reach billions of people through our distribution capability to a player a game is a game and you can deliver that game through the cloud to anybody who has a device that's capable of reaching the internet. I hear you're still an avid gamer. How often do you play games like how many hours I go to bed early so I got a bit at 10 it's Seattle at 10 o'clock people who play with me online they tease me about how militant I am at 10 o'clock I'm out I probably play 15 hours a week. As I understand it you do your own deals you don't necessarily need permission from Satcha to do a deal is that true? No there's definitely depends on the amount of the money in the deal but when we think about some of our bigger deals we go to the board and so Satinadella Amy Hood the CFO have been incredibly supportive as Xbox for one of the biggest consumer businesses in the company were a brand that makes Microsoft relevant to a whole generation that probably doesn't think about a lot of other Microsoft products in their day to day life. Activision specifically is facing a lot of challenges here there have been lawsuits there have been employee walkouts how much did that concern you when you're thinking about this deal? Markets are preparing to close but the day is not over yet. Talked it is now up about 45% a lot of volatility right now. You need the power of the Bloomberg terminal to get you market moving data before anyone else. There's numbers of much higher than expected. Upgraded today to overweight. You need top analysts to bring you exclusive global insight into cross asset markets. The meaning of on market is a really big focus. This coin ain't lying along today it's going to be short term. Bloomberg markets the close weekdays on Bloomberg. We make it very transparent to the shopper before they accept an order. What's the order is going to look like how much work on a pays them and how much like the consumer is paying them. And so they can decide whether they take an order or whether they refuse it. And that's a kind of flexibility that our shoppers really value and the kind of transparency that they want. Are you seeing a labor shortage right now and what are you doing to combat that? It's different in different places or demographic of shoppers is completely different from food delivery and right sharing. We're 70% women and half of them are moms. And that's because a lot of the job at Instacart is very different and just being in a car with strangers. It's about like going to the store doing a good job of customer service of really picking the right products for the consumer. And we are seeing that being very appealing to women.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,724,2022-10-08 04:40:11
12499," Like going to the store, doing a good job of customer service of really picking the right products for the consumer. And we are seeing that being very appealing to women. MUSIC Well, you're in the process of a potentially monster deal, $70 billion acquisition of Activision. Talk to us about how this deal came together. When we were thinking about on that idea of what are we capable of doing today and where do we need to go? The biggest gaming platform on the planet is mobile phones. One and a half billion people play on mobile phones. And I guess, regretfully, as Microsoft, it's not a place where we have a native platform. As gaming coming from console and PC, we don't have a lot of creative capability that has built, hit mobile games. One thing about the video game space is, if you've been around maybe too long, you know most of the creators out there. So you kind of know teams that could be a good fit in terms of what we were trying to do. But we really started the discussions internally, at least, on Activision Blizzard around the capability they had on mobile and then PC with Blizzard. Those are the two things that we're really driving our interest. Big Tech is under a lot of regulatory scrutiny. Big Tech deals, our underscwritten-y, what's the status of the deal? What are your conversations with regulators been like? I kind of come at this that big deals should be scrutinized. I think that's the role of regulators why they're in place. I feel good about the progress that we've been making, asking good, hard questions about, okay, what does our intent, what does this mean? If you play it out over five years, is this constricting a market? I feel good about it. Microsoft had its time in the antitrust spotlight. Now the spotlight's on Google and Meta and Apple and Amazon. How is it that Microsoft has skirted the spotlight? Your competitors might say it's unfair. Well, I think you're point about us having grown through that time. I might call that the adolescent years for us as we were kind of learning. I think it's an important consideration that we did learn a lot as a company through that time and what it meant. And I think that sticks with us today. You've been a really big advocate of cross-platform play and this idea that gamer should be allowed to play whatever games they want on whatever platform they want. Why is that so important to you? Maybe you happen in your household to buy an Xbox and I buy a PlayStation and our kids want to play together. And they can't because we bought the wrong piece of plastic to plug into our television. It's just seems that these artificial constraints that the industry might put up for near-term kind of business dynamics in the long run. If you take a business that is at 3 billion people growing to 4 billion people over the next decade and saying how do we continue to grow this business, reducing friction for our customers as an industry has to be at the top. So how far does this go? Does this mean that Activision gave that call of duty? You'll be able to play on any platform and perpetuity? I don't know what that means and forever. Like when you think about how long and it's not for any kind of nefarious business reason, it's just like what do we even platforms mean 10 years ago, like I think the definition of some of these things might change over time. But our expectation is we want more people to play. So I know you're working with Sony on some things for the benefit of gamers. Can you talk to us about that a little bit? We have a pretty big publishing footprint on PlayStation as well as Nintendo, which means we have good relationships with those platforms because we're they're a big part of our business and we're a big part of their business. I think our long-term ambition of where we see this industry growing is also shared. I think the area where things get stuck a little bit, it's in the kind of near mid-term competition. If somebody walks into a store and they have $500 bill, they're either going to walk out with a switch, which is what most people buy. Or they're going to walk out with a PlayStation 5 or they're going to walk out with an Xbox or maybe somebody will go buy a Windows PC. But in that world of somebody's got to make a decision for one platform over another in the beginning. That is where I think we get stuck in some of the kind of near-term competition. I don't think that's bad. It's just the dynamic of each of us pushing each other to build the best product for our customers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,725,2022-10-08 04:44:41
12500," That is where I think we get stuck in some of the kind of near-term competition. I don't think that's bad. It's just the dynamic of each of us pushing each other to build the best product for our customers. Now, while you've been working to make the gaming industry more collaborative, the gaming industry has historically been tough for women, for diverse voices. When you look back on gamer gate, do you think you did enough? I can always look back at any incident for me and think about things that in hindsight I should have done more, I should have done better. I'm proud of how our team evolves, how our leadership team evolves. Now, there are societal issues around us. The gaming industry is not kind of immune to those. People in my position sitting here as kind of old white guys, head of gaming platforms, not in a more than norm than I should be. And I talk about 3 billion people who play video games. And if you say your audience is 3 billion people, then the demographic is the planet's demographic. I want our team to reflect the customer that we aspire to earn. I know that our teams ship their culture with every product that they ship. Well, Activision specifically is facing a lot of challenges here. There have been lawsuits, there have been employee walkouts, there have been accusations of sexual harassment, sexual assault, how much did that concern you when you were thinking about this deal? We had access to data from the company before we announced the acquisition to see what the actual numbers were in terms of reports. We definitely as a team signed up to say, just like we're on our own journey with Xbox, that we're going to expand that journey if this deal closes. It's a lot of people and a lot of people that will feel very dedicated to and committed to building a great workplace environment for them. That's true of any of our studios, right? But it's obviously a conversation that you're going to have. You think about the board of Microsoft. And when they're thinking about the deal and they're typing into their search engine, Activision, what are the headlines that they're coming back? And there were questions that we had. We've learned from this, we will continue to learn. And we're committed to that journey, not only for the betterment of our teams, but our customers, the creators on our platform. We think it's critical to our business success that we make progress here. Is Bobby Codic going to stay on? Yeah, I'm not in a position to make comments about their leadership team. We're in the regulatory phase and how that will close. Like, when the deal closes, then we have say in how they're managed and how it goes, but until that point, I'm not really in a position to say. There have been very specific allegations of Bobby being aware of things that happened and not reporting it to the board. What has he communicated to you about what he knew, what he didn't know? The discussions we've had were about the teams where they're at. Can they make the progress they need to make? Because the closing is a long process. Are they putting in the work that they need to put in to move along their journey? And I believe they're committed to that. When I look at the work that they're doing now, there's always more that can be done. Activision has divisions that are unionizing. And I know Microsoft has said they'll recognize those unions. What does that look like? I've never run an organization that has unions in it. But what I can say in working through this is we recognize workers needs to feel safe and heard and compensated fairly in order to do great work. So we thought it was important to make a public statement on that front for workers that are there that are making decisions about their employment and what that relationship looks like to understand what it would mean if Microsoft was able to close the deal. And I think about the environment on any of our teams. I build from a perspective of people building a workplace where people feel like they can do their best work in a sustainable way. And they could see this as a long-term career for themselves. So if Xbox employees decided to unionize with Microsoft support that? We knew we made the public statement that it wasn't that it would have a broader impact than just the impact at what would potentially happen on a close of Activision Blizzard. My view on metaverse is gamers have been in the metaverse for 30 years.

Watch Bloomberg's surveillance early edition for the news you need when you need it. I'm Daniel O'Kaley-Line's in New York and Anna Edwards in London. The Federal Bank raises interest rates twice as much as Paul Carp. Then surveillance for in-depth analysis. Outside Tom Kane and Lisa Brownbats, I'm Jonathan Ferro, the RPA, fronts and sensors. How does Japan get away with not raising rates? Can it sustain? It's normal at a time when everybody else is facing a very different reality. Bloomberg surveillance. Be informed. Be prepared. Be ahead of the game. So let's talk about some of the broader trends. You and I talked a lot during the pandemic, gameplay surge. During the pandemic, we were all stuck at home. Has that changed? It has changed. We've seen gameplay hours come down a bit, which I will say I think is a good thing. People should get outside. People should moderate. Long-term growth trajectory for the business is incredibly durable and strong. You have adults now that have grown up playing like myself and it's become a more normal part of how people entertain and how families spend time. As the economy has tightened for consumers, as gas prices are higher, people are worried about what their home economic situation looks like. We're seeing gameplay hours kind of stay strong. I think from a value perspective, gaming's a good value for people at a time of kind of economic constriction. People bought Minecraft. They can continue to go play Minecraft. What about supply chain? What challenges are you still seeing? Are all the consoles that you want to have made in time for the holidays going to be here? I still think demand will outstrip supply for us this holiday. We will see when we get into 2023. You'll start to see more that supply is catching up with demand and maybe actually see one in the store when you walk in. What's the future of the console? Our console is going to be around in 10 years. If even Microsoft is sort of deemphasizing. I equate in my head gaming on console to gaming on a television. Absolutely, people are playing on more screens. I think for us as a platform, if we don't adopt that as part of our strategy, we're kind of pushing against what our customers are asking for. We talked a bit about kids earlier and as a mom, I'm always slightly terrified that my kids are playing too much. Video games are ruining their brains. They're going to be exposed to all this bad stuff. That's all the positive things. You're a very pro game for kids. I wonder how do you support that? As a parent, you know what's best for your kid first. I'm not going to say what's best for any individual's kids. But we can say, in the research backs this up, that gaming can be a great on-ramp for kids into STEM education as they think about, well, how are these games built? I also think the community power of gaming is something that doesn't get talked about enough. Last night, I was playing Escape Room on Xbox with one of my friends. And while the conversation might start about how are we going to escape from this room, then we're talking about his daughter who's looking at colleges. And we just talk about life, like people will when they're in the same place. And I think that ability for gaming, whether it's with kids or adults, to bring people from different backgrounds, different geographies, different socioeconomic, different religion, different genders together and shared experiences, is pretty unique out there. I think building those connections that video games can enable, maybe this is too altruistic, but there aren't enough of those things in the world today. Which brings me to the metaverse, you know, obviously, Sasha came on my show. I hope that this is the next big thing that happens after the mobile internet. Facebook changed its name, to meta. Some gamers don't even want this whole meta-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,727,2022-10-08 04:53:15
12502," to meta, some gamers don't even want this whole metaverse thing. in the metaverse for 30 years. You're playing in a racing game where everybody's in a shared world. I think what we found is there's more connection as I was talking about before because we have shared purpose. It's not at all surprising to me that gamers might look at metaverse and think, well, I don't really get it. Because we've already have an avatar of myself and I can already go into a shared world. And I can already sit there and have voice conversations with people anywhere. But I do think the skills that we have as game designers and game creators make a ton of sense. And a lot of enterprise experiences. And this is why Satya gets excited about it. What about crypto? Play to earn is all the rage right now. Play to earn specifically is something I'm cautious about. It creates a worker force out of players for certain players to kind of monetize. Now, to be fair for us in the game industry, this has existed for years and years. There have been gold farmers of people who literally just spend their time doing some menial task and then a game to accrue some currency that they could sell to some other rich player for real money so that that person doesn't have to spend their time. But now you find games that are starting to build that into the economy of the game itself. We made some comments in Minecraft about how we view NFTs in this space. Because we saw people doing things that we thought were exploitive in our product and we said we don't want that. I think sometimes it's hammer looking for a nail when these technologies come up. But the actual human use or player use in our case of these technologies, I think there could be some interesting things. So let's talk about your priorities looking forward. You're in the middle of trying to do this really big deal. Are we going to see you keep doing deals? Are you still on the look out for new studios or new geographic locations where you want to build out Microsoft's gaming presence? Definitely on the second part, geographic expansion is critically important. We've hired our first people in Nigeria now as part of our team. We have teams in India, teams in South America. Again, when I talk about 3 billion gamers, I'll just use Africa for a second. Like 1.2 billion people in the continent. Average age is what? 20 or 21? I think it's very, very likely that the next big hit games that we're going to see are not from the traditional locations, not from the traditional people. I think that's fantastic. So geographic expansion is critical. Cloud is important to that as we put our data centers in places. And we can not only distribute the games, but allow creators to use our cloud development platforms to build games without having to have the local hardware right there in their house or in their office to go build. So we're going to do a little rapid fire. What video games are you playing now? Cult of the Lamb. Most important meeting you've ever played a game in. Have you ever played a game in a meeting with Sasha? It's easier on teams calls because they can't see your screen. You're not in the same room with people. I have played games. Sauti has caught me playing games before. And yeah, I'd say a Sauti meeting. I've played the fifth. What's your favorite thing to do when you're not gaming? Of all things, snowboard with my family. You have a lot of gaming fans. Who do you fan over? One of the things I'd love to go do is find a game I've never heard of and go spend time with it and then talk to the creators about it. I think creating something, putting it out there is such a brave thing to do. If you could see any band in their prime, who would it be? Wow. So I'm a punk rock fan. So I'd probably go back and say like the Ramones. Best piece of advice for your 20s. When I think about these my career, not the only lens I have, there have been a number of times when others have made bets on me that I probably didn't think I was ready for, including the job I'm in now. And to listen to the others around you when they are making a bet on you, when they're pulling you to go do things, at least for me, who was probably reticent, maybe a little imposter syndrome kicking in on was I really ready for something. But understand that others around you when.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,728,2022-10-08 04:57:40
12503," Things, at least for me, who was probably reticent, maybe a little imposter syndrome kicking in on was I really ready for something. But understand that others around you when they're encouraging you, that they're probably doing it for good reason. How do you balance work life and play? My little 15 minute commute back and forth is my transition zone of I'm now at work, I'm now at home. I don't even have a home office, because when I'm home, I'm not at work. Like it's just always been my thing, is that segmentation with my family and what I do. It doesn't mean I've never responded to a mail when I'm at home. But I'm very regimented that way. When COVID happened, it didn't work, and it didn't work emotionally, it didn't work, output-wise, like motivation. And I was pretty transparent about that with the people around me and how I had to change things. Does that mean you want everyone else to come back to the office? No, people have to work in the way that works for them. What is the gaming industry look like in five years? And what does it look like in 20 years? We're going to see video games really gain their space in telling stories that really change people's perspective on others lived experience. And I think that's a pretty cool thing.

Back in 1997, I was interested in the following question, which is there are a bunch of dinosaurs called sauropod dinosaurs which had really long skinny necks. So apodosaurus is an example. Now I said really long skinny tails. The tail of these sauropod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip. The way a bull whip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. And that crack is a sonic boom.

Good! How are you? It's so great to see you. Thank you so much for doing this. What do you think about all this love getting into? I think that that I think was more last year. So I think it's kind of a way of that past. No, I don't think so, but I think it's like any time that frankly it's when a lot of other people get into crypto, right? Other audiences too. It's when it's in the news a lot. When does that happen? A lot of times when the prices are going up. She was a federal prosecutor going after gangs and the mob before being handed for next assignment, taking down Bitcoin. Katie Han soon realized this new technology was much more than a tool used by criminals. She dove deep and became a crypto convert, swapping her prosecutor hat for a board seat at Coinbase and became the first female general partner at Venture Firm and Recent Horrorways. Han, now a prolific crypto investor, recently launched her own fund with one and a half billion dollars to deploy. It's the largest fund ever raised by a single investor. Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0 CEO and founder of Han Ventures, Katie Han. Katie, it's so great to have you. Great to be back here in the studio with you, Emily. I want to start with a vibe check. Okay. What state of the crypto cycle are we in right now? It was hot. Yep. And then it got pretty cold. Well, look, Emily, zooming back because I've been in crypto for a decade, if you can believe it. We've seen crypto be really hot and then all of a sudden not. And so we've seen this before. However, I think one of the things that's a little bit different now is with each new crypto cycle, more and more people come into it. And so it's more and more pronounced each cycle. And I would push back on it's not. I think it depends on what area of the ecosystem you're looking at. We think developers think crypto and Web3 is still really hot. I am seeing a lot less of those. We're all going to make it hashtags. I am seeing a lot less of them too, although I am spending less time on Twitter. So maybe that's why. But with each cycle, there are new acronyms. What hasn't happened is a crypto winter in the midst of really serious global macro conditions. So we have inflation, kind of at record highs for our generation, not our lifetime. And then we have also a war that's broken out in the Ukraine. And we have a number of other factors going on here. So that's very different. There was some serious carnage out there. Socius, Luna, three-houros. What's been your takeaways from all of that? I don't want to sit here and tell you that algorithmic stablecoins are bad because I actually think they're really interesting. However, I think what happened is you had, in this case you mentioned Luna and Tara, you know, that was an algorithmic stablecoin that was getting pretty widespread adoption and relative to what the tech could do. I didn't realize you spent your teenage years living in Egypt and learning Arabic. Tell me about your upbringing. I was always uprooted. My dad worked for a large company and we were always moving just when I would get comfortable in one space. And I think actually that's pretty important. If you fast-tored and look at my career, I'm comfortable being in uncomfortable situations. You know, I was because I didn't know a lot about venture when I got into it initially. I didn't know a lot about crypto when I got into it initially. And I was okay asking questions. I was okay not knowing the local acronyms or the Namanclature of a particular field. And I'm, you know, I'm taken right back to my teenage years in Cairo, moving from Houston, Texas one day to downtown Maddie in Cairo the next day. You studied law? I did. You clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. That's right. You became a federal prosecutor. You were taking on prison gangs and the mafia. That must have taken a really...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,730,2022-10-08 05:06:34
12505," or Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. That's right. You became a federal prosecutor. You were taking on prison gangs and the mafia. That must have taken a really thick skin. I was doing it at each 25. And now if I kind of take a step back in you, I think that happens at different points in your career. Like, whoa, if I would have analyzed that a little more at the time, and I'm kind of in some ways glad I didn't, I just dove right in, because I felt it fascinating. There was a human aspect to it and people's stories. And I felt like those stories mattered. So I was drawn to criminal law and became a federal prosecutor. And I did cases involving violent crime, but then really mistriing cases, being back in the courtroom, being before the grand jury. Like the prosecutor you would see on TV, going to try those murder cases. Doing those two-hour closing arguments. That's right. And so moved out here to California. I died at the largest prison gang in the world at the time. Outlaw motorcycle gangs, hostage taking, bank robberies, armed bank robberies, there was really not a kind of criminal case by that point in my career. I hadn't done it. It was right around that time, 2012. One of my bosses came in and said, let's have that same energy that you brought to those gang cases, to those murder cases. And let's go ahead and have you investigate this new criminal technology that we really need to look into and possibly shut this down. So you created the first cryptocurrency task force. How would you describe it? Fortunately, several of us in the government realized at the time. It's not possible, also not desirable, because Bitcoin is not an entity. It's not a person. It's a protocol. And it would be like saying, let's go shut down cash. Let's go shut down the internet. It's not possible. Probably wouldn't be a good idea, either. I was using crypto and technologies like the Bitcoin blockchain, because that's all it existed then. This is 2012, 2013, to actually uncover criminal activity. So I didn't think that that technology was bad. Frankly, it was a tool that helped me uncover the various activity. And by the way, it was a step-level function improvement better than compliance by banks. I'll just go ahead and say it. That's a little bit controversial. But I had spent a decade subpoenaing large financial institutions and five times out of 10 didn't get back what I needed. One case I worked on, and people always say, oh, you shut down the Silk Road. What actually happened? I was looking into something completely, not having to do with anything at all of the Silk Road and came across some, what looked to be some kind of odd activity. And it turns out that a couple of federal agents on the Silk Road Task Force out of Washington, DC were croaked. And that is the case that I ended up in dining and I ended up prosecuting those agents and they both went to prison. So that's the aspect of what the Silk Road case that I worked on. I would never, never have been able to uncover that criminal activity by those agents because they were federal agents. They knew how to cover their tracks. Had they not used Bitcoin blockchain. Right? So that technology right there, if they had just used wires or cash or bank wires, we would never have uncovered that. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund from scratch? Big, expensive cities have a lot going for them. But if you live in one, you've probably noticed that these big, expensive cities keep getting more, well, expensive. You could always move away. You might have just started working remotely so there's really nothing keeping you there. But then again, moving is a hassle. Well, what if someone paid you 10 grand to do it? What if they threw in free office space, a bicycle, or a gym membership? Programs and cities and states around the US are doing exactly that. And they're getting a lot of interest. We've had over 50,000 applications. About 90,000 applications.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,731,2022-10-08 05:10:38
12506," of interest. We've had over 50,000 applications. About 90,000 applications. We had over 1800 applicants from all over North America. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them? Or are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns for places looking for an injection of fresh talent? So you became kind of a crypto convert after this. You joined the Board of Coinbase very early on. How did you and Coinbase and Brian Armstrong come together? I hosted an event here in San Francisco at the Federal Reserve Bank and believe it was there that it wasn't just Brian. It was a lot of what I'll call legitimate actors and crypto who wanted to usher in this new wave, this new ecosystem. And then we brought together the heads of all kinds of agencies really in an effort to kind of talk about building bridges. You know the government and the crypto industry we're never going to see eye to eye on a lot of things but we did think there were some commonalities. Coinbase is a company that has suffered. They've been losing share. The valuation of the public markets has plummeted. Why do you think that is and how do you think it can be fixed? Yeah well I think again a few things it's tied to. One a large aspect of Coinbase's business now of course is trading revenue and that's down when prices are down and you know the company's been very transparent about that long before going public. I mean also if you look at its S1 it specifically identifies that and just how volatile crypto cycles are. So I think that's part of it. It's judged you know by public markets as a technology stock or as a financial services company. By the way I think it's both. I think it's not just a financial services company. I think it's so much more. I think it's really a portal to this whole new ecosystem. You were also on the board of OpenC until recently there's an insider trading situation or accusation going on there. Coinbase has also had employees accused of insider trading. How much is this happening within crypto companies and within the industry and how big a problem is yeah. I think crypto is under the microscope. So where you have a case two cases, three cases in crypto ecosystem which now is a trillion dollar industry. I think multi-billion approaching trillion dollar industry you're always going to be able to find examples like that. So I don't want to make too much out of a handful of cases. That said the company Coinbase OpenC take these things incredibly seriously. Along with your position at Coinbase you became a partner at one of the most storied venture capital for instance Silicon Valley in the East and East and Harwitz. What was your experience at A16Z? There I met Chris Dixon and I met Ben Horowitz and I met Mark and Dreson and I had worked with them for just about a year maybe a little bit over when they asked me to come and co-run their crypto funds at Andres and Harwitz. Again I jumped at that chance and I think really that speaks to the fact that as I said before things are a hell yes or there are no and it was a hell yes for me. So Andres and Harwitz is the kind of place where if you make partner you don't leave. Yeah. How did Mark and Ben respond when you said yeah. I want to leave to start a crypto fund of my own. As you might know Emily, they're an anchor. They're an anchor check into my fund and I'm very grateful for that. You know Mark and Chris and folks like them are also personal LPs. So I felt very supported when I shared that decision and I will say that it was not running away from Andres and Harwitz. It was running to another opportunity and you know crypto is not what do they say it's not a spectator sport or it's like you're in it. It's excuse very young. It's 24-7. It's global and it's hustle and at this and that's a trade-off. It's a life trade-off and at this point in my career and in my life if I was going to continue to make that trade-off I just wanted to do it and do it in a way that was really true to me. So you struck out on your own. Yes. To launch on Ventures. What gave you the courage to do that? What was the spark that lit the fire? Yeah. That got you to say I need to do this and do this now. Sure. What I set out to do was to continue to invest in this ecosystem that I think is so broad that decision was very purposeful and the timing was very purposeful. We have an early stage fund that does seed stage, series A, even series B and then we have what we call an acceleration fund. Which...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,732,2022-10-08 05:15:08
12507," It was very purposeful and the timing was very purposeful. We have an early stage fund that does seed stage, series A, even series B, and then we have what we call an acceleration fund, which is, it's not a growth fund, it's a crypto growth fund, and I think those are different things, but it's later stage, it might be crypto publics, certain kinds of public tokens were set up to hold tokens and participate in the token ecosystem, or later stage companies. I mean, there are now several crypto, many crypto unicorns. The space has become really competitive, even though you say, you know, crypto's had its kind of ups and downs. The thing is, a lot of people in some of those last cycles have seen the kind of venture style returns that can be having crypto. And so you've had a lot of new funds enter the space, and that's driven up competition. So what differentiates on ventures then? From, you know, all of these other crypto funds, or even the more traditional venture capitalists, like entries in Harowitz or Sequoia, you also have crypto funds now. Well, I think a lot of traditional venture capital funds now have crypto funds. It used to just be like a regulatory designation. It was like, are you an RIA, which is registered investment advisor? I would say for crypto founders today, it's not enough to just be an RIA, right? They, frankly, I don't even know if a lot of them care. That's a regulatory designation. What crypto founders today want to know is, do you live and breathe crypto? Do you inhale the discourse? Are you part of the community? Do you participate in governance? Are you going to be staking these kind of crypto verbs out there? And if you're not really in this space full time, I think it's very hard to run a successful crypto fund. We don't have a hedge fund component. So we're not sitting here buying and trading and selling, that's a hedge fund structure. And there are crypto hedge funds. We're not one. We're making seven to 10 year bets. Does it how hard is it to launch a crypto fund from scratch? You know, it's hard, but it's not impossible. We don't have a crystal ball. I don't know. I can't predict cycles, but I knew that we were in a cycle, where you saw so much further an excitement around the space. And I already talked about what makes this different. But I think one thing also is, we are a nimble strike force. We don't fish in the same pond. We have the crypto natives. We have a fish and execution. We have operators, seasoned operators, who really know how to stick the landing. And I think that's reflected on our culture. I would say the only thing that's changed in our strategy as a result of the market correction is really more of a focus on early stage, but we still have our late stage fund. And when we see valuations, which I think will still see correct, spoiler, I think we'll continue to see some corrections. And so we might deploy our later stage fund a little bit more slowly. It might not be on an even 50-50 cadence. And that's OK. Long-term, our strategy hasn't changed. Long-term, we're committed to this space. How much do you think valuations are going to correct? You know, I can't give you a one-size-fits-all answer because crypto is not a monolith. You have some crypto companies that really follow more of an enterprise SaaS business model. You have others that are layer one protocols. You have still others that are consumer-facing applications. And I think one of the things we're seeing right now is the infrastructure layer. And that's where we're spending a lot of our time, by the way. And we think more and more use cases will come about when the infrastructure layers in place. So my own view is we are not rushing to deploy. We're certainly not getting caught up. You do get VC FOMO. I try not to. I'm not to. You know, look, I think it's very easy to get into that mindset. It's because it's a competitive sport. It's a competitive space. And I think I'd be lying if I said that that doesn't influence anyone. I try to, what I do, and I think I do differently, is I try to take stock of that. Oh, that's the FOMO mentality kicking in. That's bad. Again, you don't want to over-correct, though. What we look for is we look for amazing founders. It doesn't matter if I think valuations will correct. If there are amazing founders, there's a huge tam. We also look for what's your regulatory plan? If you're launching a token, what's your plan to comply with the law? What's your plan for security, by the way? We've seen a lot of hacks in the space. We want to really dive in there and make sure that the founders have been thoughtful about, especially if they're custodian customer funds, keeping those funds secure. If it's a cross-chain bridge, what are the exploits? Have you changed your strategy at all, given the downturn? What? Have you backed out of any deals or decided not to do certain deals? Because the conditions have changed. Don't you raise the phone? We have decided not to do certain deals. We've never backed out of any deals.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,733,2022-10-08 05:19:44
12508," Turn what? Have you backed out of any deals or decided not to do certain deals? Because the conditions have changed. Don't you raise the phone? We have decided not to do certain deals. We've never backed out of a deal. We have decided not to do a few deals because we think that pricing was ahead of progress candidly. And we might have been wrong about that, Emily. We might have been wrong about that. But I think if we were wrong not to do a couple of deals better that we might have been right because if we were wrong about that, I think we can find a way to still invest in those projects later. Well, one thing I'm hearing is that a lot of dry powder has just sacked up because all these funds raised a lot of money raised. What was the biggest fund ever for a single person, not just a woman? Anyone? Are you confident you're going to have a place to put all that money? I am, but if I don't have a place to put it, I'm not just going to go willing, nearly to deploy it. One of the things that we told our LPs even during that period when we raised our fund, which was when crypto was undeniably still on a bull run, we said that we are going to be pretty steadfast sticking to a tier deployment cycle. And I think one thing that's changed is that might have lengthened. It certainly hasn't shortened. But we will, again, we feel very good that we have the capital to back great teams when we see them. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind. You will shed light on dark matter.

Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world recalibrates. After decades of stagnation, Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation. Corporate giants, policymakers and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that. We are going to increasingly live in a digital world. And I happen to think that if you live in a digital world, you're going to want to own digital goods in that world. You're not just going to be satisfied to rent them, which is what we do now. We buy our content from walled gardens without digital scarcity, which is what NFTs unlock. You don't really own anything. You're subject to the whims of a platform. And I think NFTs and digitally scarce goods fundamentally change that. I think you'll see NFTs back again. But we are spending a lot of time in the infrastructure layer. Like I tell you, zero knowledge, technology, scalability. We think of that as like the plumbing. If you think of the fiber-hubbed cables. Remember, you couldn't have had YouTube and Netflix with dial up. You couldn't have streamed content. The same is true of crypto use cases. We think that there will be a lot of new use cases unlocked when the infrastructure is there, when it's more efficient, when it's more user friendly. And so we're spending a lot of our time there. President Biden issues this crypto executive order. There are a number of ports that are coming due. What do you want to see from the administration when it comes to regulation? Are you optimistic that we will get there? Yeah, we were so delighted to see that executive order. This is not something you should normally be delighted about. But why we were is because it was to us a real recognition that this is a US government saying this field isn't going anywhere. This field is growing. It's growing so much that we are going to direct every single agency in the federal government to come up with a plan here. I think we take a step forward, but then you see we're a big government. We're a big system. We have states. We have local entities. We are, you know, is this human right, animals?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,734,2022-10-08 05:24:09
12509," government to come up with a plan here. I think, you know, we take a step forward, but then you see, you know, we're a big government, we're a big system. We have states, we have local entities, so we take a step forward with the EO, and then we take some steps back sometimes too. And I think what I see as crypto founders are confused by that. They're starting to think, well, I could go to this jurisdiction where there's a single regulator and you don't have 50 states with different rules. It's the US government that needs to start taking stock of the fact that right now, Emily in China, there's a quarter of a billion ECNY wallets, a quarter of a billion. We're still talking about whether there should be a government central bank digital currency. We're still studying that. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States. I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind China. We're falling behind. What are the dangers of falling behind China and the rest of the world? This is years ahead, so I don't want people to take a headline and say, oh, I think the US dollar will be no longer the global currency, reserve global currency. I'm not saying that now, but fast forward decades. And if you no longer need to use the dollar because you have an alternative, I think that's a real problem. What would we use instead? Well, I think that there are going to be stable coins out there that people who have access to a smartphone will use. There is a demand for it. We see a 285 percent year-over-year growth of stable coins. So people are clearly liking the idea of this. Now, again, there have been some spectacular failures, too, but not all stable coins are created the same. But I think the important thing is that we really do need to not just quash innovation. What do you think of how Gary Gensler, the chair of the SEC, and how he's approaching it? One of the things that I hear from founders is that they're very confused because they get told, come in, register, just come in and talk to us. But you have the one company who's done the ultimate act of going in and registering coinbase, filed an S1. And still, there's a lot of saber rattling still going on, I think. And again, I don't want to single out the SEC. And I don't want to suggest that anything they're doing is bad. I do think, though, that right now there's a lot of confusion. And one of the pieces of confusion stems from the fact that, and it started with the ICO mania back in what 2016, 2017, I can't even remember which year now, where the SEC was very loud about securities. A lot of them were securities, but the space has changed. And so to still view it through the ICO lens, when so much has happened over the last five years in the space, I think is a mistake. What do you have to say to the skeptics out there who just don't believe in the future of Web3? And don't see where this is going. I would say don't judge the current state of innovation by the end state of innovation. I hear from a lot of these skeptics. And by the way, I'm friends with a lot of these skeptics too. I don't only want to live in a crypto bubble. They want to see the use cases, especially if they're not technical. Well, when am I going to use it? What will I use it for? And I think one of the things that's not appreciated is how quickly the infrastructure here is catching up. And once you have kind of a, once you have really scalable blockchains that can handle a lot of thorough put and are very efficient, I think that unlocks a whole lot of use cases. People are spending more time on screens. That curve is up and to the right. Whether we like it or not, that is the future. I mean, those who have kids know that kids spend more time online. They want digital things too. And I think to dismiss it, it is a bit generational. I do find not always, but it is a bit generational. If you talk to kids about being able to have money online, they instantly get that concept. They're comfortable not having to hold something in their hand to think it has value. Take us to the end state. Do Google and Amazon and Facebook and Apple still exist? I believe they will still exist. I mean, it depends what you talk about when you talk about the end state. I mean, I think that, you know, I think for decades, those companies will still be around. But the important thing is, I think this new ecosystem is going to represent a challenge to them. I do think that those entities, decentralized forces are coming and will cut into those entities, profits and revenues. So we have a little rapid fire section.

Yeah. Do a job where you know 50% of the job. And where you're going to learn 50% of the job. Again, that goes back to no growth in the comfort zone. No comfort in the growth zone. You live in great interest. One-yeah-one-seven. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. We have to get interest rates higher and bring inflation back to our targets. It's better to pass this become a scarce. We are running on thin ice. No one deliberately wants to go into the batter but we sneak walk into conflict. Unmatched reach and resources from more than 120 countries. The moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. It is crucially important and I think we've moved from this attitude, from its indulgence a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mystery surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s and so it makes it a really exciting field because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harness to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts but if you want to be wise, you really want wisdom, you got to know when and how and why to use that information and that's what you bring figures out while you're sleeping.

12511," Welcome to the Earthshot Prize Innovation Summit. I'm Francing Lackwai here at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. This event powered by Bloomberg featured finalists selected by the Earthshot Council, launched by Prince William, is a global initiative that drives innovation on solutions to climate change and environmental issues in the following categories. Protect and restore nature. Clean our air, revive our oceans, build our waste-free world, fix our climates. The over the next half an hour will bring you all the highlights from this most important gathering. This is Bloomberg. Protecting the environment was of course close to my grandmother's heart. And I know you should have been delighted to hear about this event and the support you're all giving our Earthshot finalists the next generation of environmental pioneers. Together in this room are the people and organisations who will help us to achieve the Earthshot mission to repair, restore and rejuvenate our planet within this current decade. That mission is not simple. Just as President John F. Kennedy so famously said, as he challenged the United States for America to unite behind the goal of putting man on the moon, we choose to do these things not because they are easy but because they are hard. I know that the world is an uncertain place right now that many families and communities across the globe are facing unimaginable challenges, from conflicts to energy crisis and food shortages. While addressing these in the short term, we must also remain resolutely focused on tackling the greatest challenges that threaten our tomorrow. Because if we don't, the changing climate will only serve to entrench these immediate challenges into fundamental global issues, severely impacting the lives of each and every one of us. That is why our collective mission is so urgent. But there is huge reason to be optimistic. The 2021 cohort of Earthshot winners and finalists is evidence that we can succeed. That we can protect our world for our children, our grandchildren and the generations that will follow them. These pioneers exemplify the leadership needed in this decade of change. They include inspiring activists, brilliant innovators, a forward-thinking city and even an entire country making a real difference. But they cannot do it alone. This must be a team effort. We must come together behind the innovative solutions to ensure they reach their full potential with peace and scale. While my message today is one of gratitude and encouragement, I also acknowledge that you cannot succeed in isolation. As governments, we have a responsibility to create the incentives and the space for you to flourish, a receptive environment for change and the accountability that comes with guardianship. In many nations, the foundation for this approach has been flayed for us long ago if we choose to listen. Where I come from, I'll tear our New Zealand a beautiful place we must visit. Our indigenous people hold a world view that every single living and non-living thing is connected. Our people, our plants, our animals, descendants of Ranganoi, the sky father of Papatu Tuanuku, the earth's mother and their children. And so it follows that people and nature are kin, are family. And we must care for one another in the spirit of Kaitiaki Tanga, which translates into guardianship by the people of the land for the next generation. In short, koha ho te tayao, koha ho, I am the environment and the environment is me. Our life source, our economy, our future. Now I've seen this in action first hand many times, not least in my own backyard, the Pacific, where the ocean is a source of protein, income, culture and connection. Now it is a source of challenge as it rises up and begins to inundate small island nations. It can be confronting to hear and see the stories of just how real these challenges are, but none of us are here because we have given up, but because we believe there is a way to change the future. We are not only part of the nature, but we are...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,737,2022-10-08 05:36:35
12512," They've given up, but because we believe there is a way to change the future. We are not only part of the nature, but we are nature. Nature is living element. For indigenous people, nature is whole. Our planet is alive. The rivers are her blood. The trees are her hair. The soil, her skin. The wind, her breeze. And indigenous peoples, our planet they know, they are the doctor. We are protecting 80% of the world's biodiversity. Because our way of life do not harm nature at the opposite. We are strengthening ecosystems. We improve biodiversity by cooperating with the birds and trees, listening to the winds, observing the cloud, learning from even the little insect. We protect nature by setting up our own limits. We don't take more that mother earth can give and we give back. We protect the sacred trees. We don't destroy the field of the medicinal plants. We choose, precisely, the animal that we can kill to just keep the balance of the ecosystem. As all of us know in this fight, no one can afford to sit on the sidelines. No one can claim that climate change is somebody else's problem, or to forget of for future generations to address. We are all affected by a warming planet. We see that every day. And decisions being made right now will determine our shared tomorrow. So we must choose and we must act as united nations ourselves. Our progress depends on collective action, on collective ingenuity. If we stick together, we can make fixing the climate the greatest project and greatest achievement of our lifetimes. We have the science, we have the solutions. Now all the world needs is political will. Together we can create a future where rampant carbon is removed from the atmosphere. Where green buildings and green business transform the levability of communities. Where easy access to renewable energy enables greater equity. Where sustainable agriculture feeds a growing global population. The needs are urgent and the costs of inaction are worse than any nightmare. But let us not be driven by hope, not fear, by optimism, not despair. Because hope is not passive. Hope is the ultimate source of renewable energy, pushing us forward every day to try and try again. Today, the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit in partnership with Mike Bloomberg and Bloomberg Philanthropies will ask each and every one of us what we can do to accelerate progress to repair our planet this decade. And offer solutions on how to collaborate to drive this ambitious but essential climate agenda. We will continue to drive impact around system changing climate solutions and amplify the Earth Shop Prize's call to accelerate progress to repair our planet through collaboration and innovation. But most importantly, we will remind ourselves what can be achieved when we turn pessimism to optimism and optimism into action. Coming up, but more from the panelists and finalists here at the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit. This is Bloomberg. We will never break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,738,2022-10-08 05:40:40

You need top analysts to bring you exclusive global insight into cross-asset markets. The Neenibon market is a really big focus. Bitcoin ain't running along today. It's going to be short term. Bloomberg markets to close weekdays on Bloomberg. Welcome back to the best of the earth's shop prize innovation summit. The guest featured ranged from heads of state to leaders of grassroots environmental organizations. Well amongst them was philanthropist and Microsoft founder Bill Gates. Yeah, it's too bad you can't do things overnight in either mitigation adaptation. You know, when I last went through Europe, people were the leaders were all saying, hey, give me technologies so I can tell Putin to get lost. And I said, hey, in five years, you're going to be able to call him up. And they were like, no, we'd like it. No, it's a year alone. Okay, that, how's your planning permission regime and all the, you know, planning for that future grid? Seeds typically between the timing start and they get out in the farmers fields is about eight years. Now we have a pipeline of innovations. You know, we've been funding the CG system for 20 years now. It's funded about a billion year. It's if people care at all about adaptation, that thing will be funded at two billion a year. I mean, there won't be anything close to the impact of climate related seeds, climate related maze, and goodness, because of human genetics, we know how to do the editing, thank goodness, because of AI, we know how to find the alleles, because of drones, we can measure stuff in the field. So there's huge advance in terms of how the whole seed ecosystem moves at, at full speed. The timing is very tricky here. So it doesn't stop the day you get to zero emissions. There's a leg in this system. It's about a 20 year leg. So you haven't seen that earth temperatures not equilibrated to the atmospheric CO2 content. So when you get to zero, that's not, it's not like 2051. Take my air conditioner away. No, it starts quite a bit later. You have to look at what the peak is, and you can't just plan for, okay, 2030, 2030 is where your maze production in central Africa is down 25%. By 2050, it's down 70%. And you will have switched in most of those areas from a fairly heat sensitive crop to sorghum. Now sorghum productivity is super low. We'll get people to do better maze for these next 15 years, and then they are going to have to switch to sorghum. It is tough when you see the floods impact us down. I mean, nobody expected that. If the goal of climate was to make us pay attention, wow, that is way beyond expectations.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,739,2022-10-08 05:45:09
12514," that floods impact us down. I mean, nobody expected that. If the goal of climate was to make us pay attention, wow, that is way beyond expectation. So some adaptation money literally will just be disaffirmary recovery money. The boundary of what's also pretty confusing. I mean, what is food aid? If climate's causing some food production losses, all world-proof program money is that all climate that adaptation money, it's certainly the need for it's going on. That's a system that's about 6.5 billion a year. So relative to the systemic solution, which is the research piece, it's relatively larger. But the demand for that piece, which is the acute half a Pakistani rice got flushed away. And so you're going to have malnutrition problems, if you don't go in for that. That's also a type of adaptation. And so I do think we're going to bring some rigor to this because the pressure now, the goal of doubling the adaptation money from, they say, 20 billion here, to 40 billion here. The pressure on that is a problem. Still peanuts. No, it's very small. I mean, yeah, if you start sticking food aid in there, you can use it up very quickly, rebuilding after hurricanes. I mean, we had hurricanes before, but the costs there are absolutely gigantic. There are ways of stopping wildfires. There are ways of dealing with sea level rise. So the innovation agenda, not just on seeds, the innovation agenda is going full speed on mitigation. That's where there's 100 companies break through energy funded. By mitigation, you mean mostly energy. You mean everything to do with energy. You mean generation of energy. You mean batteries. You mean transport. You mean all of the new. And there's some renewables that are already traditional, but more that need to come on. So that's the package that you're talking about mitigation. Or are you also talking about agriculture as mitigation? Yeah. So every area of emissions, you know, the world tends to focus on past near cars and electricity. That's not a third of emissions. And so the focus on the easiest third, you know, now 4% of new cars are electric. You know, so that's the field that we're furthest along. About 4% of energy generation is wind and solar. And as you triple the size of your grid, you want that to be say, you know, some people would say 100%. Other people might say 70 to 80%. You know, the amount you have to build, we're not within a factor of 5 of the build rate of those. But those are the easy sectors. cement, you know, clean cement costs over twice as much as the way we make cement today. And it's not, it's partly the heating energy. It's partly the basic thing, you know, remember in chemistry when you take calcium carbonate and heat it, you get calcium. That's what makes cement. But the thing that goes away, that's CO2. And so we have to have a way of making cement, which a number of these innovative. And steel and iron. Yep. There's a whole family of hard to obeyed sectors. That's true. If you get a dead industrial sector, if you get green hydrogen that's cheap enough, it actually solves quite a large number of those. Some of the industrial processes you go straight to electricity and some you go through, you do your reduction using the hydrogen, where you would have used some hydrocarbon concept before. For steel, we actually have companies doing both. We have electricity steel and others doing electricity is the way of replacing the blast furnace. And then we have others that take hydrogen. And if you get the hydrogen cheap enough, you get the super magic thing, which is that the green product doesn't cost more. That's called green premium equals zero. And then your adoption scale is utterly different. If we try to subsidize steel and cement.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,740,2022-10-08 05:49:46
12515," and equals zero. And then your adoption scale is utterly different. If we tried to subsidize steel and cement, say rich countries say, okay, we wanna get rid of that, which those two are 15% of emissions, that's greater than all foreign aid budgets put together. It's over 200 billion foreign aid, you know, never will pass that number. It's just not politically possible. It's a number that's at about 170 and going down today. Coming up, but more from the panelists and finalists here at the earth's sharp prize innovation side. This is Bloomberg. Hydrogen has a very special place in the universe. It's the first element on the periodic table. It is the most abandoned element in the universe. And when clean energy advocates think about what can we find, which would be as easy to use as fossil fuels, they think about hydrogen. The fuel that will, when burned, only produce water. We like to imagine that if we just built enough of these and these, we could ditch fossil fuels and save the planet. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. There are some things where you just need a good old-fashioned combustible fuel. Now startups around the world are betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century. Welcome back to the earth's sharp prize innovation summit. Finalists of the annual award appeared alongside special guests, including worldwide business leaders, philanthropists, and non-governmental activists. Now, while the 2022 finalists have been announced, we will be able to find out what the world's best and best of the world's best and best of the world's best and best of the world's best and best of the world's best. Welcome back to the earth's sharp prize innovation summit. Now, while the 2022 finalists have been announced, our panelists have their eyes on the future and hear what they have to say. This is the earth's sharp decade. We are in a race to repair and regenerate the planet. Some will focus on policy, some will focus on activism. We are focused on supporting the game changers, the innovators, the entrepreneurs and the problem solvers. We believe in the power of human ingenuity, grit and determination to create solutions that if scaled could repair the planet. We have only 8% of the ocean protected today. And our earth's sharp is, as Pati said, 30 by 30. 30% of the ocean at least, 30% of the ocean protected by 2030. And we know that if we protect the right 30%, not only will we prevent the extinction of many marine species, but also we will produce more fish. There's going to be these protected areas are going to produce a spillover that will exceed the forgon catch. So we're going to have more fish that we invest in a protected area in a marine reserve that produces 10 dollars in economic output and creates more jobs. So it's a triple win for marine life, for food security, and for climate and of course for the economy. So that's the goal, the mission to in the next 8 years, and that's where the air shot is pretty crazy. In the next 8 years, we need to quadruple all the ocean protection that has ever happened in human history. Are you optimistic that I can be done? I am optimistic there's no choice.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,741,2022-10-08 05:54:18
12516," so that that has ever happened in human history. Are you optimistic that I can be done? I am optimistic there's no choice. I've seen firsthand the potential that a breakthrough idea can hold. And if we start seeing more of these transformative solutions across all the challenges facing our planet and suddenly our earth shot won't seem so improbable. The work will be difficult. It'll take extraordinary resources, determination, partnership. But we've got all the essentials right here in this room. So what is the challenge? It's the speed, scale, and cost of making these green hydrogen generators. Well, that's exactly what we are working on. Because to make green hydrogen the fuel source of the future, it needs to be cheaper than fossil fuels. And that means electrolyzers are going to need to be really, really cheap. If you want to take a solution around the globe as quickly as possible, you need to make it standardized, mass-produced commodity. A product that is easy to make and quick to build and cheap as well. And so while some believe electrolyzers need to be large machines, we believe the electrolyzer should be a standardized, mass-producible product that can make green hydrogen anywhere for anyone. In 2030, we imagine millions and millions of projects on restore and not just places on earth where we see nature being brought back, but all of the other nodes that are key to ensuring success. So the technology providers, the nurseries, the seed banks, the funders, the government incentive programs so that we have an ecosystem that really allows us to leverage the many, many connections within the nature-based solution space. And in 2030, we have been focused on another key area which is cities and cities require data and insights to take action on climate and to preserve nature, to create more nature and tree canopy. So we've set a goal that we want to- We want more nature in cities, exactly, exactly, right. And so we've been partnering with cities like Los Angeles to give them insights utilizing AI and geomapping on where all the places that you can create more tree canopy which reduces urban heat islands, improves air quality sequesters carbon. So we want to bring data and solutions to bringing nature into cities as well as of course preserving and restoring nature. And so one of the goals that we've set is we want to enable over 500 cities around the world, and we're going to hear from the mayor of Paris after this to reduce a gigaton of carbon emissions by 2030. And so that's through data, tools, and sites, whether that's evolving transportation systems or planting new tree canopy. So that's a big bold target that we want to see achieve by 2030. Anyway, I guess I'm in the wrong place. I came here to invite all of you to the Grouch Convention. But it turns out you're all about my least favorite thing, helping. Oh. You've got me, Oscar. I do like helping people learn how to reuse repurpose and recycle. Together, everyone in this room can build a world where nothing goes to waste. And that includes even you. Me. Sorry, Mike. I got to get going to that convention. But just between us. Yes. I do have a recycling bin right next to my can. But no, let that get out OK. It'll ruin my image. But my father believed in the power of the idea. And over time, the vision, the purpose, the courage, it embodied has inspired each generation to take on its own challenges, not because they're easy, but because they're hard. President Kennedy understood that the effort to land on the moon would bring out the best in us that everyone would have to contribute, that it would require innovation, creativity, teamwork, commitment, and faith. And that world would be better because of it.

Especially, you know, we are a small company in a way, and we have to fight people who have those huge companies who put you 27 lawyers on your back for something which is very stressful. I wish it didn't happen. Everything which happened to me is a lesson in a way that are good. Once it's done, it's done, and you're sort of happy. I'm happy about it. It's that thing I could have definitely been avoided, but it's done. Did you realize at the time when you started the company that you would become so successful? And actually so big. No, no. You know, when I started the company, I wanted to have a shop in Paris, which is my hometown, and I wanted to do pretty shoes for pretty girls. That was my goal. Now you look back and you say, actually, I still make pretty shoes, but for many more women. Yeah, absolutely. Do you think you would have been so successful without the red soul? I think the red soul definitely, of course, participates to my work, but also to the fame of my shoes because it's instantly recognizable. But then, you know, the design is very important. But definitely when you have such a strong sign of recognition, it participates to... Yeah. Watch Bloomberg's surveillance early edition for the news you need when you need it.

12518," likely to be remembered by those statistics or by who he is or isn't dating. Record suspension tonight for baseball star Alex Rodriguez over his use of performance enhancing drugs. You say you did not do these PDs that they are choosing you with your correct mic. OK. This dude is unbelievable. A phony to the end. Well, it was the most painful time of my life. It may cost me the whole thing. And that's on me. Nobody else. I think in a weird way, I'm going to look back and say that's one of the, also one of the best things that happened. Five years after his retirement, Alex Rodriguez, this CEO is getting back into sports this time as an owner of a pro basketball team. And he wants to build more than just a franchise, but a legacy, maybe, with a dose of redemption. The mistakes made in baseball are done. And I can't go back and fix them. I want to keep a clean record of the father as a friend or the business person. And because of those mistakes, I think I have an opportunity. And I'm having a time of my life doing it. Arod. Alex Rodriguez is buying the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Minnesota links. The purchase price is expected to be in the range of $1.5 billion. And for me, I think making the transition from player to owner, something that's very exciting to me, I'm really excited to bring my experience both in business, and in sports, and in a locker room, and do really, really exciting things and bring a world championship to the city. In April 2021, Alex Rodriguez joined one of the most exclusive clubs around, folks who own a pro sports team. And while his name and his fame made the headlines, it was his business empire that allowed him to actually close the deal. The easy to remember name Arod Corp, it's grown into a diversified investor and operator, taking a cue from mega firms like Blackstone and KKR. Arod Corp has taken a real estate portfolio and expanded into venture capital and private equity and media. And like any business in 2021, it's on SPAC. I was more lucky than smart. I started investing very smart in real estate. Simply as a hedge to, as my earning power would close, my real estate would not only appreciate what would create more cash flow. And then I would say that cash flow, and I would buy more real estate and other private equity type investments were generated more cash flow. So as my Yankee income went to zero, hopefully my real estate and my businesses would grow over time. And while players nowadays are becoming better and better business brands, few are able to achieve this scale as Arod Corp has in such a relatively short amount of time. But understanding how that growth happened in business, just like baseball, has to start at home. Part of what I love about business is you get to build things from nothing, right? Like nothing. So I had two hip surgeries. And I never wanted to be the old guy that couldn't get up, but I can't get up the steps because it be sips. You know, I walk around here, I mean, first of all, the arts are beautiful, but tons of pictures of you and the girls. And I mean, you've really made a family life for yourself here. Tell me about that. Well, tell you what I'm not at home. I'm not a cleanup hitter and I'm not a CEO. It's a very good one. I remind me every day that I work for them. Yeah. I can see why you play baseball. People always ask me, what are you doing your life? And I say the three Bs, I do baseball, not basketball, two business and my babies. And that's kind of, that's my happy zone. It's funny through pandemic. We spent so much time here. And in my 46 years, the toughest time in the world that I've witnessed.

12519," In my 46 years, the toughest time in the world that I've witnessed. On the other side of that, we were in here and we felt safe and we felt loved. And it was like 90 days of breakfast, lunch, and dinner. With my girls, it was a dream come true. They got so sick of my dad jokes. So sick of my dancing. And it's actually really sick to have been begging, trying to bribe, I let you do one with me. She was daddy, you have no swag, no drip. I'm not doing anything with you. A. R. R. D. Dancing may not get his daughter's approval, but his following on social media is huge with nearly 4 million followers on Instagram alone. That number is larger than his new basketball team, the Yankees or the Red Sox, not to mention any other single baseball player, current or former. Who has better taste in music? Whose room is decorated nicer? What is it that makes you engage the way you do in social? Jason, a lot of that came through my time during my suspension. I spent a whole year serving a suspension. And in that time, I had an opportunity to turn the lens inward. And understand why I was making some of the good choices, the poor choices, the bad choices. And understand kind of conversation, understand storytelling. And it's something that I'm enjoying is still fairly new. We're not experts by any means. But every time we look at companies or opportunities or partnerships, it's data driven and social driven and it's been quite a tool for us. That's a suspension which obviously people will forever associate you with. And there's an interesting choice you make there at that moment and then in subsequent moments to not lean out, to not retreat, but to lean in to some extent. And especially in the last couple of years, tell me about that. If you think about my career, sure I've hit home runs and been part of a world championship team. But I'm also, I'm fifth all time in the history of strikeouts. I mean, that means that only four people in the history of mankind have failed more than me. But I think as a result, I've been, you know, PhD in Phalian, but also an MBA of getting back up. Looking around at his house and his selection of cars, it's hard to say that A-Rod has ever really failed, but it's striking what he has built considering where he came from. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the road today went electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total US greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building to crowds America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels. We want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of US greenhouse gas emissions.

12520," Blueberg Technology with Emily Chang. Weekdays at 5 p.m. in New York and 2 p.m. in San Francisco. I was born in New York, raised in Miami. So when I got to Miami, I was around 8 and a half, 9 years old. My father left when I was around 10. And at home, it was mom, my brother Joe and my sister Shouzi. They took the role of like my brother became like the secretary of sports. My sister became the secretary of education. And my mom just had to, you know, make enough money to pay her bills. I think, you know, my father leaving us at 10 kind of left a huge vacant spot. Right. And I think I needed to then kind of fill that void by having a collection of mentors. One of those earliest mentors was his baseball coach, Rich Hoffman, right here at Westminster High School. See vlogs through this area a few times. Oh yeah. This brings back some pretty cool memories. If you hit a home run here, it goes to the basketball courts and the pool. Right. And I kind of like it. It's kind of like got this Fenway, you kind of wriggly. Yeah, exactly. The set of the Green Monster, you have the Green Palms. Yes, exactly. Well, it's really where I really started to understand the power of mentorship and dreaming big. And if you think about it, I have one of the most important conversations with Coach Rich Hoffman. And that happened at 15, the first day I walked on campus. He goes, look, Alex, you're going to come in this year. You're going to have a good year. And then you're going to the junior Olympics to represent the US. You'll do well there. You get much stronger. By that time, you'll be like the top junior in the country. And then your senior year, you're going to be the number one pick in the country. And then you're going to be off to the big leagues. Coach, you're talking to me. He goes, yeah, I'm talking to you, Alex. And Jason, I went home that night. And I believe them. It just like, it changed my complete vision on me and my future. And then I did everything in my power, and that's how they coached out. So the leader today, when I have young people, it's my job to not only give them the opportunity, but to push them. And push them to a level where they now see the world in a different way about themselves. That prediction came true. In the 1993 MLB draft, Rodriguez was selected first overall by the Seattle Mariners. And while his playing career was just getting started, by the age of 22, he'd invest in his first piece of real estate. It was what I knew best. My mother, she was in a homeowner. We were renters, right? We were tenants. And every 18 months, we would move because the landlord would always raise the rent. And I remember as a young kid saying, boy, if I can ever trade places with the landlord, and they can be the tenant, that would be amazing. I bought my first duplex. And then I owned that for a few years. I sold it for double by four plaques, eight plaques, 60 units, and an off we went. When it came to those first investments, you know, whenever he does something, he's going in at 100%. This is Jose Gomez. Everyone calls him Pepe. Along with Jose More, he's the co-CEO of Newport Property Construction, and also a childhood friend of Rodriguez. From 2004 to 2007, we ended up acquiring 5,100 units between Florida and Texas. We renovated him. He would buy him. I would renovate them. And, you know, the rest was history. Being a real estate investor, especially in high growth markets like Florida, well, it hasn't been a straight line up for the past two decades. Miami's high-rise condos are monuments to a burst property bubble, while most half of Florida mortgages are underwater. We had this run-up to 2007. Prices were going up like this, and then it just fell off a cliff. The Great Recession crushed owners and developers alike. Few were immune.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,746,2022-10-08 06:15:53
12521," 2007 prices were going up like this and then it just fell off a cliff. The great recession crushed owners and developers alike. Few were immune except those that had other sources of income to take advantage of falling prices. Income like say one of the richest baseball contracts in history. Our huge advantage was that Alex had W2 income coming in from playing and we had that staying power so we were able even when things started going south for some people we were able to grow within those difficult times. Monument capital management has done within 60 deals since 2012 worth more than $900 million. The extent of that ambition in real estate is evident here at Grand Station in downtown Miami. The 30 story residential tower complete with a sprawling amenity floor in pool has sweeping views of downtown. Debet on Miami's growth and it's a bet that's looking smarter as Wall Street firms and other companies look southward. People always question Miami why do people live there? There's not any great jobs. You know we don't have a lot of financial services here we don't have anybody manufacturing anything but that's changing. You'll see this is a very cool place to live and work. Now before it was always a cool place to live but we're going to work. Now it's okay the jobs are here first. Cool place to visit in the past. And now each pocket is being built out. I think our Basel years and years ago started that and then there have been a course of events that have followed that continue to enrich Miami and I would say we're still early as a city. But while Miami may be home base Rodriguez is most aggressive current real estate project is buying renovating and renting out single family homes in markets across the country. And in this case he's not just emulating some of the world's biggest investors but also getting into business with them including real estate legend Barry Sternley. Just as behemoths like Blackstone who the mass single family homes Rodriguez through the cyber capital group has snapped up 5,000 homes so far. We think we're still in the early endings of single family housing rents are going up about 18 to 19 percent once we find something then you know this I learned from from Warren Buffett is you know be disciplined but when you find your pitch you know don't go for a single double you know going and going big and that's exactly what we've done multi-family and now with single family house. Going big has required Rodriguez to build a team around him and he's opted for a delicate balance of homegrown and outside hires. On the one side friends dating back to childhood and adolescence including Aaron Pepe and Jose on the other newer additions such as Kelly Laferrier Stewart-Zook David Becker and Lisa Pire. Managing the chemistry among the small and growing team is akin to the elusive intantibles Rodriguez saw in club houses when he was a player getting it right well that's the difference between being a champion and an also ran. Lisa take it away. So I think next we're going to have David on table from Kelly and we did he has a relationship with the world so I'm glad. So teams 11 11 and one exciting development is the 12 17 games the Lakers is going to use him so we were not on the Asian table there we are. At the A-Word Corp offices you'll notice the memorabilia the pictures of famous athletes the real time social data being displayed on a TV wall. But you'll also see pictures of Rodriguez with some of the biggest businessmen in the world. Alex has become a sponge and he started that as an active player when he was on the road he would go and visit the Jerry Ryan's Dress of the world in his uniform and ask them business questions and he's surrounded himself with really good smart people. The wide network is critical and sourcing deals including in venture world where the A-Word portfolio has included more than 60 companies brands like him's and hers gopuff and UFC gems. But having the best team doesn't mean you win every at bat. Their SPAC slam corp was recently negotiating a roughly $3 billion deal to merge with collectible company Pinedi that didn't materialize after Pinedi stumbled. Slam's still in search of a target.

12522," That didn't materialize after Penny and he stumbled. Slam's still in search of a target. But Rodriguez's belief in taking swings, striking out and hitting big, is also the same way he would end up with his own sports franchise. You will put a woman on Mars.

JLo and A-Rod are angling to buy the New York Mets. They're not just angling. I mean, they are in the process of putting the money together. Rodriguez along with a group that included his then-girlfriend Jennifer Lopez, entrepreneur Mark Lurian several others, mounted a bid against frontrunner and hedge fund billionaire Stephen A. Cohen. These guys are all rich, you know, as far as we go, they've made millions and millions of dollars, but we're talking about billions here. The very public process ultimately landed A-Rod and JLo's consortium as the runner-up, with Cohen buying the team for $2.4 billion. We have a little bit depressed about it. We don't like to lose and, you know, we really started getting really excited and thinking about what could be. And so when it just sort of came to a complete halt, it was sort of like the shock to the system, we were sort of depressed and down. Mark Lurian is a New York-born businessman who most recently had been a senior executive at Walmart. He got in there by selling his company, Jet.com, to the mega retailer and stayed on to run that division. And while A-Rod's partnership with JLo would come undone, he formed a close business and personal connection with Laurie that's lasted. How rules, man, I told you, no, high is man. You can't be a favorite tie. We grew up in a sort of very similar way and from very, very humble beginnings. I love Mark. I love him like a brother and he's a great partner and a great friend. And, you know, he's slipped to my plow, I sleep at his house. And we both have this drive and this mission that I want him to win in the worst way and I think he does the same for me. I want to show you this clip because it spoke to me a lot about the depth of your relationship. Yeah, I think this is getting a little bit deeper now, but I think it comes down to our dads. You know, we both felt like we had something to prove in order to sort of feel love really. When you did something spectacular, you felt, oh, maybe, maybe, you know, like, and I think he similarly had felt that too where if you wanted to feel love, you had to do big things. What do you make of that? I never thought about it that way, but I know that when my father left at 10, it left a huge hole in my heart and my stomach and I knew that I had to do better. And I think before therapy, it was probably better for the wrong things.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,748,2022-10-08 06:24:21
12523," And I knew that I had to do better. And I think before therapy, it was probably better for the wrong things. I think post and current, I look at it as just my purpose. But I also know that I'm enough now and probably before that I thought it wasn't. The deep connection with Lori led to a new $400 million venture fund called VCP. And notably allowed them to quickly pivot to a successful deal in sports ownership. They're pursued at the Minnesota Timberwolves and Minnesota links. He called me and he said, Hey, are you serious about this? He said, I won't do it unless you're serious about it. And I said, I'm serious about it. Are you serious about it? And again, a minute conversation were both in and we probably got the deal done in six or seven days. NBA ownership has radically transformed into the past decade. As tech executives like Steve Balmer and Joe Sy and Wall Street investors like Mark Lazare, Josh Harris and Tony Restler have snapped up teams. There's a supply demand imbalance where most people, if they could, would own a professional sports team and there's very high barriers to entry and very limited supply. In the case of the Timberwolves, Glenn Taylor bought the team in 1994 for $88 million. The sale to Rodriguez's group values the franchise. Heard with the four time WNBA champion links at $1.5 billion. And that's relatively affordable. A Rod's old team, the Yankees, is worth more than $5 billion, according to several estimates. And while ownership is changing, so too are the players. I think players today want more in every sport. They're into fashion. They want to be good investors. They want to learn about venture. The NBA players today that I've been around, some of them are more prepped at 20 than some of the guys that I played with at, were 50. And meeting with our athletes and talking about business and them reaching out to me, it's great, it's humbling, and it's really impressive. And if anything, their ownership has maybe gotten too close to the players. The team being fined $250,000 for violating league rules with an off-season workout in A Rod's hometown of Miami. But buying a basketball team instead of the Met's might accomplish a goal he thought was unreachable, actually making him cool to his daughters. I recently went to a Sixers game. And my little one Ella, who's 13, she closed that, I really like this basketball thing. Like one day, maybe I get to run the business here one day. Really? And I was like, oh my God, that's like the greatest thing I've ever heard. And she goes, you know, it's like, you know, base was a little slower, but this stuff, I can really get into it. I said, whoa, baseball's great too. It's just, you know, it's more of a thinking man's game. It's like chess, not checkers. And she goes, yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever. I don't like chess either, but she says, this basketball thing, I have like real passion is like the entertainment and I have thoughts and I have ideas and I, and she thinks much more, like a producer, she likes dancing. And I mean, to me, that's just like, boy, that's the great thing about sports and music. It brings people together. And it's only that that for us that night. You have built this, this amazing business. You know, there are people who are watching this, just like, this guy, you know, it's like, that they'll always remember you for your baseball career. And a baseball career that was controversial to say the least. You could be a little bit on an island somewhere. You don't have to do this. I thought about tapping out a bunch of times. I would wake up in the middle of the night and be in tears going like, how in the world do I get pocket aces and figure out a way to screw this up? That was a very painful time for me. And I think the year's suspension allowed me to not only put lipstick on the house and paint it and fix the windows, it allowed me to tear the entire house down and start building it one brick at a time. And in that process, I became even closer to my daughters. And when I think about those mistakes and the lessons learned, I think about, okay, but you know what?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,749,2022-10-08 06:28:56
12524," I became even closer to my daughters. And when I think about those mistakes and the lessons learned, I think about, okay, but you know what, that was baseball. And I had good moments and I had very tough moments. But clean slate when it comes to being a father, to being a partner, to being a businessman, to being a friend. So I draw some incredible motivation through something that sucked, something that I did to myself. I say to myself in the darkest hour, boy, if I ever get another opportunity, I'm not gonna screw that up again. And I'm trying my best not to do that.

Water represents one of the biggest threats posed by climate change. That's because rising seas, stronger storms and heavier rainfall could massively increase flooding by the end of the century. It's already starting to happen, and it's very likely to get worse. How does traffic flooding in Western Europe after violent storms and powerful flood waters are showing entire towns? It's easy to feel overwhelmed looking at footage like this. It seems like no one has any idea what to do about this problem. So we're just going to see more and more damaging floods year after year. But there is one place where it's possible to imagine a very different future. When you look at the city of Rosadam, the water is in our genes, you could say, we are already working for a thousand years on this topic.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,750,2022-10-08 06:33:15
12525," When you look at the city of Rosadam, the water is in our genes, you could say, we are already working for a thousand years on this topic. Keeping the water out isn't a new challenge for the Netherlands. It's a battle they've been fighting for centuries. So when the effects of climate change started to crop up, they were like, yeah, let's do this. We're ready. We traveled to Rosadam to find out how this city is getting ready for the future and whether the ingenious stuff they've come up with will ultimately be enough to save them. And hopefully the rest of us too. When you look at Holland or the Netherlands, the name the Netherlands already says that we are a low-lying country. One third of this country is below sea level and two thirds is vulnerable to flooding. Back in the day, the only things keeping the water at bay were the dicks, which are basically just raised mounds of earth. Once every few decades, the water would overwhelm the dicks and cause catastrophic flooding, and that was just the way things were. Until one day in 1953, all that suddenly changed. It's a three year, it was a disaster. That was five years ago, and I lived on the farm. There was no radio, so people didn't know. They weren't born. A powerful storm struck the southern coast, overwhelming dicks that had been badly damaged in the Second World War. On the morning of February 1st, 1953, Koso's father and brother woke him up and told him what had happened. They say, well, everything was water, and your mother and sister, I doubt, I just see. In 1953, almost 2,000 people died, and that was the moment for us we said this can have happened again. This is the time we started making our first barrier. The flood galvanized the Dutch government to build the world's most powerful flood defense system, the Delta Works. It was a series of modernized dams and storm surge barriers that took more than 40 years to complete. And the final act of the Delta Works is the barrier over here, the Maaslan barrier, made to protect Rotterdam. We're looking at the biggest movable storm surge barrier in the world. This is the same size as the Eiffel Tower, so you're looking in an Eiffel Tower laying on its side. Most of the time, the barrier stays open so ships can pass through. When a storm comes along, it snaps shut, preventing the storm surge from traveling up river and flooding Rotterdam. The movable design was radical when it was completed in 1997, and it's inspired similar structures in flood-prone cities around the world. Did you look at St. Petersburg on Russia? A small version of this barrier has been made over there. And maybe in the future, in front of Manhattan, you're thinking about a way to protect that also. So this was the first one, and now smaller versions are coming all over the world. But the barrier on its own isn't enough to keep Rotterdam from flooding. Talking about climate change, we see an increase of more intensive rainfall. We already are facing now intense, more skilled flooding, so we need more places where we can store this water. Our nowed Molinar is also working to keep Rotterdam dry, not by keeping the water out, but by giving it a place to go.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,751,2022-10-08 06:37:23
12526," Not by keeping the water out, but by giving it a place to go. This is the water square, and it is actually, you could say, a symbol for our approach, how to become climate adaptive. So under normal circumstances, this square can be used as, for example, a Velzkobal field. But on days like this, its storage excess rain water and keeps it from flooding the streets. So it's a multifunctional solution. We want to add quality to the urban space, but in this way we are also adding water storage. This is the first water square that we have been developing, but it's part of a bigger package of measures. An interesting one close by here is what we call the Duck Park, or the Roof Top Park, which is a kind of a long levy of one kilometer, and on top of it a huge green park. It's storing excessive rain water because of the green roof. Looking at the challenges related to climate change, a lot of people think it's going to cost us a lot of space and money. And we try to show that we can also use it to work on a better city. In some ways, the Dutch are just as baffled as the rest of us about climate change. For one thing, there's the question of what happens when sea levels rise beyond a certain point. The Maslecht barrier was built to withstand one meter of sea level rise, and a redesigned barrier could potentially handle even more than that. But there's only so much that even Dutch engineering can do. Beyond two meters, it's difficult. You are working on new scenarios. Supposed it will be more than two meters, four meters, five meters. Then what people ask me, will you be moving on a certain moment and time to the higher grounds in the Netherlands? I can't imagine that that will be a decision. For survivors like coasts on the other hand, it's not so hard to imagine the worst. Nobody will realize that there will be end of a nice life here. I think they all will be refugees. I think in 300 years, rather than we'll still be here. But when sea level rise four or five meters, we all have to find additional solutions. Any idea what those would be? Maybe on a larger scale, investing in floating districts, floating cities. And that brings us to our final and most radical solution. My name is Kuhn Oldtius. I'm an water architect. For the last 15 years, we've been building floating homes in cities that face climate change and sea level rise. So we have the floating home, which has a floating foundation, and it can move up and down with the fluctuation of the river. But to keep it on one spot, we have these kind of stilts. The water will come up. You will see it at the house. We'll move up, up, up, up. And if the water goes down, it just guides us back. 100 years ago, you see cities start to grow up with high-rise buildings because they saw the space in the air. Well, we see the city has to grow on the water. It's not only about houses, it's about floating apartment buildings, floating roads, floating parks, all the kind of urban components you need to make your city more waterproof. Who knows? Maybe someday we'll all live in floating houses. Or maybe something entirely new will come along. Preparing for climate change is a tough challenge. But for the innovators of Rotterdam, it's a process of adaptation that never ends. It's not finished our project. It keeps on going. It's an ongoing process. I feel safe. My children will feel safe. And my grandchildren will also feel safe. But after that, you have to think again.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,752,2022-10-08 06:41:47

Brown and the ship. 32 million people here in Tokyo braced themselves for the worst. 3.9 magnitude. Now we know that's a big number. It was the fifth largest earthquake in history. But the real damage comes from the ferocious tsunami that was unleashed. In some areas the waves reached 40 meters in height. Sweeping up everything in its path including cars and ships. Unable to withstand the strength and the power of the surging water. Japan is located in the Pacific earthquake belt. This means the country is struck by some of the strongest earthquakes and tsunamis in the world. In the past decade about 30 tropical storms have also hit the country each year. These natural disasters kill on average 100 to 200 people per year and take a huge toll on the country's economy. But learning from painful experience, Japan has built one of the world's best natural disaster response systems, which includes regular disaster preparedness drills and early warning alerts. Japanese engineers and architects have also pushed the boundaries of technology and design to create resilient disaster proof buildings. This is Tokyo Skytree. At 634 meters it's the world's tallest tower.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,753,2022-10-08 06:46:07
12528," This is Tokyo Skytree. At 634 meters, it's the world's tallest tower. Designed for broadcasting and observation, the base of Skytree occupies a relatively small plot of land that isn't ideal for such a tall structure. It's a very narrow area, so it's a very strong wind. Atsookonishi and his colleagues designed a steel-trust tower, so instead of fighting against the wind, it can simply pass through the gaps between the trusses. It's a very narrow area, so it's a very narrow area. The skytree, the team designed a 375 meter tall concrete core column, connected to the tower's steel outer frame by a series of flexible oil dampers, devices that control unwanted vibrations. The swaying of the core column and outer frame in opposite directions reduce the vibration of the entire tower by up to 50% during an earthquake and 30% during strong winds. This is the concrete core column, and this is the top tower of the iron structure. This space is used to put the core column and make the entire movement of the entire tower. The core column is set on six seismic isolators made of rubber. These absorb unwanted movement and work together with the oil dampers at various heights. This is the top tower of the core column. To give you this linkage cloth, you need to save extra space for two repetitions then install several grips to protect the stable grip and temper. The top part of SkyTree is a broadcasting antenna. To ensure high quality the antenna needs to stay as stable as possible. So two tuned mass damper systems when stored to reduce some water vibrations. One is set at an altitude of 625 meters and weighs 25 tons and the other is at an altitude of 620 meters and weighs 40 tons. When the tower shakes these two damper",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,754,2022-10-08 06:50:17
12529," meters and weighs 25 tonnes and the other is at an altitude of 620 meters and weighs 40 tonnes. When the tower shakes, these two dampers act together as reverse pendulums, reducing vibrations caused by wind or an earthquake. When SkyToo was designed in the late 2000s, architects and engineers flew weather balloons to collect data on wind speeds and build models which they tested in a wind tunnel. But for some building designs, this expensive and time-consuming process has been replaced by faster and cheaper software powered by artificial intelligence. After a decade of research, architectural engineering company Takinaka has developed a typhoon simulation software called Kazamidori. For a three kilometer square urban area, it usually takes three months to build a model, conduct a wind tunnel test and get the results. But with Takinaka's software, the entire process can happen in just two or three days and its engineers are trying to reduce that down to half a day.

Japanese architects are also experimenting with unconventional building materials for high rises. Skiescrapers are usually built from concrete or steel because they're strong and cost effective. But building from wood is more environmentally friendly. Compared with the production of steel and concrete, production of timber consumes less energy and releases less carbon dioxide. New trees can also be planted to absorb emissions. But building tall structures with wood offers up its own engineering and financial challenges. That didn't stop Japanese construction company shameda from trying it. Myader is going to construct a 13-story wood and steel hybrid office building in Tokyo Shibuya District. To make the building earthquake proof, designers came up with a hybrid lattice structure that will support the walls and create a more user-friendly experience. These designs and technologies have helped to hire high-rise buildings to withstand typhoons in earthquakes, and now many low-rise buildings in Japan are starting to adopt them as well. Some vulnerabilities still exist, like older buildings constructed before regulations were tightened in 1981. With natural disasters becoming more and more frequent, these innovative designs and technologies could be key to protecting the economy and lives both in Japan and around the world.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,756,2022-10-08 06:59:32

From business's most influential and instrumental. It's mocking it at the bullpen. It's a challenging dynamic. This is a level of uncertainty that we haven't had to deal with.

When you think of cutting edge technology at sea, you might be thinking of stuff like this. But there's an incoming revolution on the high seas that isn't quite as sexy but could be significantly more impactful. Consignation thing is the key component of global trade. About 80% and 90% of all the world's goods are transported to sea at some point. But there's a significant unseen cost to the modern era of global commerce. About 3% of all the world's CO2 emissions come from shipping. 3% may not sound like a lot, but that's roughly comparable to the entire CO2 output of Germany. Since reducing trade isn't a likely option, what about a technological improvement? To help reduce the emissions from these well-stocked maritime behemoths? As fall sets in, a decided turn in the air for the new British government's designs for the economy for Elon Musk's designs on Twitter and most decidedly for Mr. Putin's designs on Ukraine. This is Bloomberg Wall Street week. I'm David Weston. This week's Special Contributor Larry Summers on whether the jobs market is starting to show some signs of loosening. I think we are headed for a collision of some kind or other and we just got to manage that collision carefully.

12532," And British Prime Minister Liz trusts giving up at least part of her economic program. It was becoming a distraction, so that's why we immediately changed that policy, and that's the kind of government we are. But as ugly as the situation was in UK markets, it was nothing compared with the setbacks for Russian forces in eastern and southern Ukraine, with President Putin's efforts to quote Annex territory that his forces didn't even control. Which Admiral John Kirby at the NSC looks at as an indication that Mr. Putin just may be coming to understand how difficult his situation really is. The annexation announcements as well as his announcement of partial mobilization certainly shows the degree to which Mr. Putin knows how much he's struggling inside Ukraine. And OPEC plus weighed in with its own changes. Cutting production caps by 2 million barrels a day or about 7%, putting even more pressure on Europe and the rest of the world already worried about energy. Well we were disappointed that OPEC made this decision, as the President mentioned, but think it's unnecessary if you look at the global environment where supply continues to be the predominant challenge. Then there's Elon Musk. He offered $44 billion for Twitter back in April, then decided to reneg, got sued, and on the eve of his deposition, returned to his original offer. Even it looks like he's going to be way overpaying. In many ways, this is almost the most expected outcome of all, which is settling on the eve of trial just before deposition of the main players, Elon Musk himself. He doesn't want to be deposed. He has probably some embarrassing text messages and conflicting statements, and all of that would make for a very unpleasant deposition. But after all the back and forth this week, U.S. jobs numbers actually came in surprisingly on course, adding 263,000 new jobs just slightly more than expected, with workers paid 5% more than they were last year. In a reduction in the unemployment rate, to 3.5%, which made for a rough day in equities on Friday, but actually a pretty good week overall for equities, for the S&P 500 adding 1.5% to end the week at 3639, and the NASDAQ, eaked out a gain of 3.4%. Bonds also had a topsy-turvy week, but ended up with the 10-year yield of a relatively modest 5 basis points to 3.88. Here to walk us through this week and what got us here are Aaron Brown, portfolio manager at PIMCO, and Chris Ellman, chief investment officer at CalSTRS. So Chris, let me start with you. Boy, given what we're seeing right now, are we looking at a long cold winter, would you say? Unfortunately, David, I think we are. I think the Fed, you know, with these employment numbers, the Fed knows that they have to continue this pace of aggressive tightening, and they're going to do so the next meeting and the next meeting after that, and I think, which is the street is pricing in, but I think after that, they're going to have to keep it up, and that's going to be into the winter, and it's going to be a tough time. So, what do you say, Aaron? Is it going to be a rough winter? I think it is going to be a rough winter. I think that there are bands of uncertainty are quite wide for next year. The Fed is tightening into an economic slowdown, and we haven't even seen the real impact of that slowdown yet. We're just starting to see signs of a gradual slowing, but likely we'll continue to see that into next year, and we think that we're heading into a recession in to early 2023. And at that same point, just given the level of inflation, the Federal Reserve is now really challenged to be able to arrest that inflation, get it under control, despite what happens to the economy. So, I think that really poses a challenge for the Fed, and we'll likely see something that's fairly unprecedented, which is continued financial conditions tightening, and Fed tightening into an economic slowdown, even if it really leads to a harder landing than what the Fed's anticipating. And Aaron, I push back a little bit. I actually think we're in a recession right now. It's not a very strong one, and it doesn't hurt a lot. I was with employment growing. You know, but we did have a negative GDP in the second quarter. Third quarter is mild, to me, anything below 1% in the USA feels like a recession. But so what you're saying is, you think it's going to be a really, we'll actually have a good traditional hard negative recession with rising unemployment, which is exactly what Powell has said. I mean, that's his forecast. Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, my view at PIMCO is that we'll likely see unemployment rise.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,758,2022-10-08 07:08:19
12533," which is exactly what Powell has said. I mean, that's his forecast. Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, my, our view at PIMCO is that we'll likely see unemployment rise to about 5% by the end of 2023. And so right now, we're sort of seeing some of those early signs, but we really haven't seen the full brunt of financial condition tightening yet. That's more to come. So we are going to continue to see us slow down. And I think that's really gonna hit in the first quarter of next year and into the second quarter of 2023. Chris, given where we're at with inflation right now, the concern is about inflation, if we are heading an intersection or even are already in one, no matter how long it is or how short it is, what are the tools the Fed has to use? Because typically you turn to the Fed and say, OK, start cutting interest rates. Doesn't look like they're going to do that in a likelihood. No, they're going to raise interest rates. They only have one tool. They have, well, they have their mouth. They can jawbone the market, which is what they're doing. They have the dot plot, which is going to indicate or direct the market. But the only tool they have is short term interest rates and the Fed funds rate. And that's what they're using aggressively. I mean, good grief. 75 basis points. Those are big bounces. You know through history, you've got to go way back before you have that aggressive tightening of monetary policy. And they have to shrink the balance sheet. So as they move through that, you know, he's already said, he's going to hurt employment. Yet we have stronger numbers. I think the numbers, there's something strange in the numbers this week, just like last month. But we'll see how that balances out. We're going to have a tougher time. And, you know, I think the question is going to be about corporate earnings. You got CPI next week. And then you got the bank starting to roll out with their earnings. Aaron, has the market priced in the diminishment of earnings at this point, corporate earnings? No, I don't think that they have. What you've seen since the beginning of the year is equities have de-graded, largely driven by the market multiple. So you've seen the market multiple for the S and P 500, de-grade from about 21 and a half times to about 16 times today. Keep in mind that traditionally in recessions, the market multiple is somewhere between 14 and 16 times. So we're just at the upper end of where we typically are in recessions. And we think that you could see a little bit more de-grading from there. That's not really the challenge for the market. The challenge for the market is that when you look at corporate earnings for next year, the market's pricing them to be up 7.5% for consensus. Our forward-looking models are expecting them to be down about 9%. So that's north of a 15% differential versus what the market's pricing for next year and what we think it's likely to be. Also, historically, during recessions, earnings fall about 27% on average. So there's real downside risks to our forecast and certainly to the market's forecast. And I think that's where you're going to see the real pressure point for the market in early next year. What's driving that is margins. We're at record high margins right now. The street is expecting that margins are going to expand further from here. So even higher than and hit new record highs, we've never seen that in a recession before. So I think the market's really mispriced and that's where the pain's going to come from. Aaron, I've got to ask you if we're already down 23% so far this year, how much lower do you think we can go? Do you see a support level on the S&P? I think that in a moderate recession, the market probably bottoms out about 30 to 50. There is downside risk if we see further a more severe or harder landing from there. But 30 to 50 is still down about 14%, 15%. So I do think that there's still room for the market to fall further. Where are you looking for in terms of your estimates? Yeah, no, I agree 32, 50. But I mean, that's a negative 36 on the year, which is you're like me. We have asset allocation portfolios. Where do you hide in that kind of a negative market? You've got bonds with the rates rising. So you're going to have continued negative returns out of bonds and then a negative 30 out of stocks. That's a rough calendar year. Where do you hide? Well, I think that, I think there have been actually market opportunities that have arisen since the start of this year. Cash rate right now, two-year bonds are yielding north of 4%. Now that's not a sexy return by any sort of a stretch of the imagined.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,759,2022-10-08 07:12:37
12534," It's the start of this year. Cash rate right now, two-year bonds are yielding north of 4%. Now that's not a sexy return by any sort of stretch of the imagination, but if you can lock in 4%, you know, add a little bit of spread on top of that, you know, an IG corporates that give you an additional, you know, 2% or so. That's about a 6% return over the next couple of years. That's high quality paper that you can invest in. So I wouldn't, you know, sort of rule cash out as an option. I think that that's somewhere where you can hide and really not expect that much volatility and really consistent returns and sort of hide out there until we see the markets bottom and you can start incrementally moving back into risk. But we can't, I think you need to keep in mind as an investor that if the core of your allocation of your portfolio, which is sort of cash and poor fixed income, is unstable, and you really can invest in the outer ring asset. So you, you know, we really have to stabilize rates in order to move out the risk curve into other asset classes. Right now, cash is a pretty good option. Okay, we're going to pick up exactly that question. We're already at high in this environment. Chris Aylman and Aaron Brown will be staying with us. We're going to ask for them, for some investment advice we could use it, that's for sure. That's next on Wall Street Week here on Bloomberg. Okay, so you're moving in on me. Rick, just trying to be with your fancy hands. I'm going to deal with your knight, because his really bothering me. My knight? Yeah. He is a troublemaker. Yeah? What did you get up to this weekend? You know, just robot stuff, a lot of chest. A lot of chest. I was practicing for you. I know you're pretty good. Oh, I don't like that. I will take this. Uh, put it over here here. Not cool. Not cool. All right. I will, I will concede. I can see. You've got me, Bid. Very good game. Well played. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Good play. The facts on unemployment seem clear enough, or at least as clear as that changing social definition ever can be, the situation is getting a little better, but not much. The government announced today that the overall unemployment rate last month was 6.9 percent. The official unemployment rate has been stuck within a tenth of 7 percent for six months, and that scarcely represents the massive reduction of unemployment, but at least some folks thought they heard Jimmy Carter promise a year ago. That was Louis Royce-Huyes on Wall Street Week back in October of 1977, when the unemployment rate was twice what it is today, and we were trying to get it down rather than focusing on inflation, whatever that ends up meaning for employment. And if that seems like a galaxy far, far away, well maybe that's no accident. The top movie this week back in 1977 was Star Wars, and the top song on the charts was You got it-'TH THE STO-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,760,2022-10-08 07:16:49
12535," A galaxy far, far away. Well, maybe that's no accident. The top movie this week back in 1977 was Star Wars. And the top song on the charts was, you got it, the Star Wars theme. Still with us, our Aaron Brown at Pimco, in Chris ailment of Calstere. So Aaron, let me turn to you and pick up on where we were talking just now with Chris, but where you hide, if you're really an asset allocator, you said cash is one alternative. Are there things though that involve at least some risk that you go to, and how much it depends on what you think the recovery is gonna look like whenever it comes? So I'm gonna flip that sort of question and answer the second question first, which is unlike prior recessions that we've seen in very recent history, so think of the global financial crisis or even the pandemic of 2020. I don't think this is gonna be a V-shaped recovery. I think this is going to be more of a prolonged, sort of stalling of the economy and more of an L-shaped recovery than what we've seen in the past. And the reason for that is because inflation is high and it's likely to persist at high levels, you're not going to come in and see the Fed start cutting as the unemployment rises, like we've seen in the past. Instead, because the Fed has moved from a dual mandate Fed to a single mandate Fed, really just focus on getting the inflation rate down, you'll likely see, you won't see this sort of immediate relief that we've seen in recent history. And so that does change a little bit the landscape of how you think about investing. Historically, as we start to get closer, to what we expect the bottom level of the S&P 500 to be, we start to, you know, scale risk back up, start to move back into equity investments to catch that recovery to the upside. And this time around, I think you have to be a little bit more patient. So instead, what we're really looking at is, if it's income investments that we think are going to be able to sort of stand at the test of time, be able to sort of hide out in a safe haven assets. So beyond just looking at cash, we're looking at high quality investment-grade corporates, we're looking at municipalities, municipal bonds, you know, particularly for those who are, can take advantage of the tax advantages, tax-advantaged bonds, we think offer good value there, at a sort of after-tax yield of six and a half percent. You know, in addition, we also like some mortgage agency bonds and structured credit bonds as well. And then sort of high quality equities that are defensive equities, high-freak cash flow, dividend growth, strong balance sheets, we also think do well in this environment. But you know, it is a sort of challenging time for investors where you have to skew more towards fixed income in order to have stability of return as opposed to looking for a quick snapback in equities. But you know, I posed a question to Chris because I know he also manages a diversified portfolio. Chris, where are you looking at what type of sort of diversification that are you looking at in order to sort of hide out over the next couple of quarters? Well, Aaron, you know, I've got the benefit of being able to go into private security. So I've got a good size real estate portfolio. We have a large private equity portfolio. Sure, it's gonna have write downs, but its value is a bit more stable than we see in the public markets. We have a cash position, but the problem is for us cash is not outperforming inflation. So the old adage cash is trash is still true. We do like a private credit. You were kind of hitting on that that variable rate, that short term debt with high quality. And I think collateral is gonna be key because as you said, we're gonna have a long rough winter. So you don't wanna be loaning money to everybody after you do care about governance. But it is tough in this environment. I mean, you know, if the economy is slowing and inflation is still strong, that's stagflation. And you look back in the 70s, I gotta say, I love that suit that Lou had. I don't know where you get that back in the 70s, but I'm stunned by it. But you know, you look back in that time period, returns to the 77 were terrible. There were hard places to, it was just a very tough time to hide anywhere. Yeah, so I'm curious though, exactly about when you go into fixed income. Do you think the price is attractive now in some fixed income, Chris? Well, I agree with Aaron. I'm gonna go short. I'm not gonna go long fixed income and take duration exposure. Short term credits. I mean, you've been holding credit for two to three years and then it's money good.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,761,2022-10-08 07:21:17
12536," I'm going to go short. I'm not going to go long fixed income and take duration exposure. Short term credits. I mean, you've been holding credit for two to three years and then it's money good. And as she said, you're going to put it in a spread product. So you pick up a couple of basis points by being in a corporate, you're okay. There's still a lot of money, David, international money that wants to come into this market, non-US rather, that wants to come into the market. You saw it in this week where suddenly comes rushing in. So I would give the advice to the average investors. You've got a slowly average cost in. You're not going to be able to call the bottom. As much as Aaron, I think there's a support number, it may not hit that at all. And the market's going to just bounce along. And in Aaron's example of an L, an L goes on forever. It's just flat. I hope we don't have to live in a flat recession for years and years. But I think this is going to be a tough market to find any kind of growth opportunities. So you want to protection and return of your money rather than return on your money. Aaron, one of the big developments this week was OPEC Plus and what they did certainly seemed to stun the white hats at the time. What does that tell us about geopolitical risk generally and specifically energy? It looks like oil prices are going to stay up there for a while. I think that's one of the things that the market's really mispricing. Right now, if you look at the forward curve for oil, the risk is really in this sort of very short term where the market expects that oil is going to be elevated for the short term, but it really has an extrapolated or extended that expectation out the next one to two years. And I think that there's a real value in sort of the back end of the curve for oil because I think that these oil challenges are going to persist much longer than what the market's anticipating. One of the reasons for that is, you know, first we saw out of oil, OPEC Plus this week, their intention to keep prices elevated. But I think the other challenges is that we really haven't invested here in the U.S. or on a global basis on energy infrastructure so that capacity is really constrained over the next couple of years. Even if we wanted to expand capacity or if oil producers wanted to expand capacity, they don't have the ability to do so in the immediate term. And that's going to keep oil prices elevated. So the risk for oil, then the risk for the energy complex broadly isn't just this winter, but it's next winter as well. And next winter's challenges are going to be even more difficult, particularly on the shores of Europe than what we're experiencing this winter. And so that's what I think the challenge is and why I think this is something that's going to persist much longer than what the market's currently priced in. And David, it's running into the challenge of climate change. You know, I'm looking at decades, not a short-term trade in carbon. And I'm glad that we're having a constraint on the ability to expand hydrocarbons and burning carbon. But you're right, people want heat. And Europe heats itself, whether we like it or not, it doesn't heat itself with solar and wind. It's got to do it through fossil fuels. And that's matching and running into a desire to reduce these fossil fuels. And I agree with Aaron, I'm hearing the same thing that Europe has enough oil and natural gas for this year in their supplies. But if it's a really cold winter, they're very worried about next year. So you're going to have climate change crashing into this challenge of OPEC and inflation and energy prices, certainly over the next couple of years. Europe has a lot of challenges, Aaron, right now. Not just energy. It goes beyond that. Does that make the U.S. relative the most attractive place to be for you? I don't know if it's the most attractive place, but it's one of the more attractive places, particularly the Veeza V. Europe. And the challenge that Europe has is that they're starting from a lower productivity, a lower and weaker growth rate to start out. They also didn't fully recover in the same way that the U.S. did post-COVID. And they now have wider fiscal deficits. They're going to have to spend more money in order to insulate their economy from a harder hit because of energy. And that's going to create real challenges at the same time where the economy is rapidly slowing. And so our view is that while the U.S. is going into recession, the recession in Europe is going to hit harder and is likely to be more prolonged. Thank you so much, Aaron Brown and Chris Aelman. When we come back, we're going to take a look at what's happening next week. I'm global.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,762,2022-10-08 07:25:39
12537," The recession in Europe is going to hit harder and is likely to be more prolonged. Thank you so much to Aaron Brown and Chris Aelman. When we come back, we're going to take a look at what's happening next week on Global Wall Street. And this is Bloomberg. This is really a reminder, isn't it? Just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see suppression in the U.N. We did see suppression in the future. That is now being reversed. This is Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. China stocks reopening is the big story in Asia this week. Exchanges on the mainland have been shut for the past five straight sessions to mark the gold and week holiday. We could see a pop at the open given the moves we saw in Chinese assets in offshore markets. That would be welcome news for officials in Beijing because President Xi Jinping is just a third term as Communist Party leader. Otherwise, travel restrictions or the easing of those is the major theme as well. Japan will further loosen controls from Tuesday and Taiwan from Thursday. For Europe next week, there's a big risk lingering in the markets and that's the end of the VLV short-term program to backstop bond markets. They announced that they would be purchasing long-dated bonds after concerns that a huge spike up in yields in the long end of the curve meant that there would be danger for pension funds. The B.O.E. has been doing this buying program. It's set to end on Friday, on October 14. There could be jitters in this market. What it means to no longer have a B.O.E. Backstopping a political story of the UK government, which has been doing various U-turns, so all of that will be in focus this week. All eyes next week will be on the latest batches of U.S. inflation data. Produced surprises will be released on Wednesday with the headline figure projected to have fallen year over year for a third straight month. Meanwhile, the Consumer Price Index release on Thursday is once again expected to show conflicting signals with a deceleration in the headline number from a year ago, but the core measure of CPI, which strips out food and energy, is forecast to re-accelerate its pace of growth rather than fall. Investors also will parse the release of the minutes from the Fed September meeting, and whether there was any serious discussion about slowing or even halting the tightening of monetary policy. And earning season is finally here. The latest round of quarterly reports kicks off with Pepsi, JP Morgan, City Group, Morgan Stanley, Delta Airlines, and United Health among the Notables. Coming up we'll wrap up the week with our special contributor Larry Summersville Harvard.

12538," We'll wrap up the week with our special Contributor Larry Summersville Harvard. Let's go to the next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. We'll wrap up the week on Bloomberg. We'll wrap up the week on Bloomberg. Imagine simply climbing a cable into space. The concept is known as the space elevator. Not only could it significantly change how we leave planet Earth, but it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space. And there are scientists who think we could have already built it. We have the material, we have the technology, we have the lasers, we have the climbers, we have all of them. If a private entity wants to build it or a government, they could build it. We'll change society. We have no clue how colonizing in the space, how really spreading on the space, really change our society over the next 50 to 200 years. It'll be completely different. On the world of politics to the world of business, balance of power with David Weston, views and analysis inside, from and about politics power players, weekdays, this is Bloomberg. This is Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. We have a few weeks we turn to Larry Somers of Harvard, our very special contributor here to help us sum up the major events of the week. Once again, we welcome back Larry Somers. So Larry, I think we should start with the jobs numbers out on Friday in the United States. Some say not too hot, not too cold. Some people say, isn't this good, at least it's not getting worse. I guess my real question to you is, I may not be getting worse, but is there a danger just in the inflation where many word is, we have 5% year-over-year increase in wages. I think these numbers were about what we expected, and the sensible judgment was that we've got an inflation problem. Core inflation figures look artificially good. They're better than median inflation. And yet core inflation ran at a 7% rate last month, and that was more than for the quarter. And the quarter was more than for the half year, and the half year was more than for the whole year. So we're not in a controlled place with respect to inflation. And there wasn't really anything in this report to suggest that we were coming into a controlled place. The monthly wage number was relatively favorable, but it was pretty clearly distorted by the fact that you had a lot more workers coming in and leisure and hospitality. And those are low-wage workers, the workers where wages are most flexible are going up more rapidly. So I don't think this is a number that changed the picture that we've got an economy that is too strong to be an economy where...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,764,2022-10-08 07:33:33
12539," that changed the picture that we've got an economy that is too strong to be an economy where inflation is going down, but that is maintaining its robustness. But I think we are headed for a collision of some kind or other, and we've just got to manage that collision carefully, and I think the sooner we start managing for some slowdown, the better we're going to do. I think Chairman Powell was way late to come to that recognition, but he now has that recognition, and he should be supported in that. So what do you think, Chair Powell, and the Federal Reserve will make of these numbers? How will it affect what they do in early November? I don't think these numbers are going to change what the Fed does. You know, you never know what's going to happen, and certainly there's risk of some kind of financially traumatic event, but I think the chances of something that is large enough to divert the Fed are really quite low. So I'd be expecting that the market, which is anticipating 75 basis points in November, and is anticipating 50 more in December, that would correspond to my best guess at this moment as well. And I think that kind of thing is going to be appropriate if we achieve disinflation. Larry, there's another strain of discussion. I've seen certainly this week. In fact, there was even some Fed staff work at the New York Fed suggesting that we better be careful, because in fact, the rate that we may need, you know, to get down to 2%, maybe so high, it will cause financial instability. There is a really safety and soundness issue. What do you make of that? Is it possible the Fed will have to choose between financial stability in the one hand and getting inflation down on the other? First, I think that should be the occasion for some sole searching. If we have an economy where we think there's going to be substantial financial breakage, because the Fed lifts the Fed funds rate to 4.5%. Then we have an inadequately supervised financial system and an insufficiently active financial regulator. And so if anyone believes that, along with whatever monetary policy implication they draw, they better tell us how we think, how they think we ought to be repairing the regulation of the financial system. David, my sense is that you can never rule out these kinds of risks. But the Fed has more than one instrument. It has instruments for specific guarantee lending. We've seen that used a number of times. And each time we're surprised by how much the economy retains its robustness. In retrospect, we cut interest rates too much and kept them too low when we were supporting the financial system after COVID. In retrospect, we kept interest rates too low and blew up a bubble when we were supporting the economy with low interest rates after Asia and LTCM. In retrospect, we were surprised, amazed by how rapidly the economy grew when the Fed did what was necessary after the 1987 stock market crash. So we need to regulate right to preserve financial stability. We need to have a very strong firefighting force in order to respond if and when financial accidents happen. But I think it's a real mistake to suggest that somehow we shouldn't do the monetary policies that are necessary to avoid inflation becoming entrenched because of concerns about financial stability. David, the people who are still on team transit.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,765,2022-10-08 07:37:53
12540, financial stability. You know David the people who are still on team transitory they're always saying that expectations aren't entrenched. The more it's true that expectations are not yet entrenched despite high inflation seems to me the more important it is to move vigorously now with respect to inflation so they don't become entrenched. If they were already entrenched we could discuss the right timing of a disinflation but if we have the big advantage in disinflation of expectations that are not yet entrenched surely we should be acting on inflation while we have that advantage. Larry another big development this week was the OPEC plus decision to reduce production limits by 2 million barrels a day something that I think it's fair to say set the Biden administration back a bit he'd gone over there and asked the crown prince not to do that it wasn't very pretty so apart from perhaps any embarrassment of my cause does it have larger macroeconomic effects for a globe that we are warned by WTO know maybe headed toward a global recession. There's nothing good in this certainly it's not what we wanted to see actually it's a it's a lot less than 2 million barrels because many of the countries that reduced their quota weren't hitting their quota before so the reduction in the ceiling didn't really matter and you didn't see a hugely dramatic move in oil markets in a way that was proportionate to the headlines that you saw but certainly the risks are up and it just points up the importance and we always do a scramble about the immediate when these things happen and we don't forget about the medium term look we made a mistake by canceling the keystone pipeline we made a mistake by slowing down all kinds of permitting activity we made a mistake by being hostile as a country to natural gas we made a mistake in the Congress a few weeks ago when we didn't pass the mansion program of expanding permitting we crucially need regulatory relief or we're not going to get renewables online fast and we're not going to get the transmission lines that are necessary for renewables to become a large part of our energy fast so the real lesson on this is we need a different kind of energy strategy then the one that we've had we need a strategy that is balanced rather than an unbalanced strategy of total hostility to fossil fuels or God knows the kind of total strategy of favoring fossil fuels that we had and even even egregious favoritism towards Saudi Arabia that we saw during the Trump administration we need to find a balance and I think we're making our way in that direction Larry is always so helpful to have you on each week and I'm glad to say Larry summons me staying with us as we bring in Professor Brad DeLong Professor economics from UC Berkeley on his new book Slouching Toward Utopia that's an economic history of the 20th century that's coming up next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,766,2022-10-08 07:42:15

So they can decide whether they take an order or refuse it. That's the flexibility of the shoppers to value and transparency. Are you seeing a labour shortage right now? What are you doing to combat that? It's different in different places. Or demographic of shoppers is completely different from food delivery and right sharing. Where 70% women and half of them are moms. And that's because a lot of the job at Instacart is very different than just being in a car with strangers.

Our very special contributor Larry Summers of Harvard has stayed with us because we're going to bring in now Professor of Economics from UC Berkeley. He's Brad DeLong, the author of a new book, Slouching Toward Utopia, an economic history of the 20th century. So Professor, welcome for joining us. It's really good to have you here. I've read this fascinating and really sort of protein book. It's really quite a book. Let's set it up first because it's a history of the 20th century. But you don't necessarily define the 20th century as from 1900 to 2000. You started in 1870 and you end up in 2010. Why? Well, the big thing that happens happens in 1870. Right? Before 1870, the world's poor. And there's no prospect for the world being anything other than poor. After 1870, every single generation, humanity's technical competence doubles. And then doubles again in the following generation. And such an enormous pace of technological advance raises the possibility for the first time of a world in which we can bake a sufficiently large echelon. And that was nothing that humanity had ever seen before. One of the remarkable things, Brad, that you highlight is that it really wasn't very different to live in the United Kingdom in the 19th century. And it had been to live in the ancient world 2000 years before. Say something about the acceleration of growth that you've seen. You know, I mean, it was British economist John Stuart Mill, right? He was writing in 1871 about how all the industrial revolution had done was it had created a somewhat larger middle class. And it had allowed manufacturers and the rich to earn greater fortunes. But that the overwhelming mass of humanity was still confined to the same life of drudgery and imprisonment than they had been before that they had been in before. And before all the way back into deep time. It was very clear by 1900 that things had changed. You know, John Maynard Keynes writing in 1919 looks back and says starting in 1870 we entered economic Eldorado and that now our chief task after World War I was figuring out why we tried to blow it up and try to get desperately back to what was good was going on after 1870. Fortunately, we eventually did. And so things rolled through up until our day. First of all, on business sense of what happened in 1870 to brought all this about there was some three driving forces in your book. Well, well, you know.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,767,2022-10-08 07:46:40
12542," Well, things rolled through up until our day. First of all, on Gizza's sense of what happened in 1870 that brought all this about, there was some three driving forces in your book. Yeah. Well, everyone has an idea about just what it is that's made us as a civilization so wealthy that makes our economy so productive. And the different people have different things. And they all go back. Some of them back even to say the year 1070, when it turns out that the law applies to a German emperor standing in the snow outside of the castle that elies on his tool. But instead, it could be that the law applies to everybody. But you get three things that fall into place in 1870 that set technological progress into a much higher gear than ever before. And they are the industrial research lab so that you can rationalize and routinize the discovery and development of technology. And then the corporation, as we know it, which rationalizes the development and deployment of technology, you would combine that with a globalized economy, with the telegraph and the I railroad and the iron hold ocean going steamship. And all of a sudden, the incentives to deploy technology worldwide for production are so overwhelming and people turn their minds to how to do this that everything explodes in a way it never had before. Brad, much of the academic discussion of your book has centered on this idea of a pivot point in 1870. But I want to ask about a different judgment you make, which is that there was this major era and that the major era ended in 2010. I would have thought that the world was growing. It was becoming more integrated with technology. There were important political struggles. That was the stuff of history through the 20th century, much better in the second half of the century than in the first half of the century. And the Cold War was a very different war than World War War 1 or World War 2. It was cold. But I would have thought that was a continuing process with substantial challenges. And yet you see us as now being in a quite different era. What's different about the era we're in than the era you wrote the history of other than more of the kind of progress and change that you saw is happening every generation? Well, I'm pleased you disagree here. And I'm very pleased you disagree on our historic Iod optimist here about our future. Because look, I've been losing arguments in person with you for 42 years, even when I think I'm right afterwards. And here I'm genuinely uncertain. And I actually very much hope you are really right this time. My thinking was I've been listening to our friend, John Furnald, about how the underlying pace of technological progress has more or less halved since 2005 compared to what we were used to beforehand, saving those years from 1975 to 1990 when technology was crawling toward a more energy efficient and environmentally friendly configuration rather than focusing on labor saving. But after 2000, after 2000, we seem to have a substantial loss of social and economic knowledge about how to run things. Things about financial regulation that I thought were entrenched that were known in the bones turned out to have been completely forgotten in 2008. Things about the proper tools for macroeconomic policy that I thought were ingrained in the bone were also forgotten after 2010. And I remember UNI whimpering in 2012 that no, for the more expansionary fiscal policy, was not then a thing that ran any risks whatsoever. Combine that with the fact that from 1870 on to 2010, first you had Britain in the United States.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,768,2022-10-08 07:51:02
12543," risks whatsoever. Combine that with the fact that from 1870 on to 2010, you know, first you had Britain in the United States and then the United States as the countries that people were looking to for examples, as you always Leon Trotsky liked to say as the furnace where the future is being forged. You know, but now you go to China, you go to India, you even go to Indonesia and what you find is that people say that the United States has very little to teach them, that we don't have any greater grasp on how to deploy and use these technologies to create a good society and are in fact a society, our society that is more trouble. We're more trouble than theirs are. Brad, if that is right, how much of it because of a running out of ideas and how much of it is running out of cohesion? One of the themes in your book is this sort of polls if I can put it that way between Hayek on the one hand, the market is king and Polani and the others, the market has to serve people. How much of the problems we're in right now are because we're lacking cohesion because of the dispersion in wealth and income? I think we're definitely lacking cohesion. I think dispersion and wealth and income creates work of cohesion. I am struck by comparing the United States around 1900 with the United States today, that around 1900 politics was as fierce and mean as it is today. That is, theodore Roosevelt denounced in William Jennings Bryan as the puppet of a alien European socialist, John Peter Altgel, the governor of Illinois, who had not only been born in Europe but also had dared to pardon anarchists. But there seems to be a very different flavor. That is, I think it's Ezra Klein talks about it, that somehow that our media and our communications today focuses first on establishing, who are your enemies? Do you share any enemies with me? And if you share enemies with me, I will listen to. So as I say, it's a remarkable book. It's slouching toward Utopia and economic history of the 20th century. Thank you so much for bringing with us. We only really touch upon it today. I urge everybody to read it is really worth the effort. Thank you so much. Let's Professor Brad DeLon of UC Berkeley. And of course, to our very special contributor Larry Summers of Harvard. Coming up, staying the course or turning tail, we'll reflect on some big about faces this week. This is Wall Street week on Bloomberg. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. Let's just be honest. We've had sort of a shift in, are we in some sort of sideflation fears? Moment, people were talking about that all day yesterday. You will shed light on dark matter. You will make aging optional. You will turn 5G up to 11.

12544," European polls with Guy Johnson in London and Alex Diel in New York, Realtime Numbers, Realtime Analysis, weekdays. Finally, one more thought. The fine line between being steady and being stubborn. We've all admired those leaders through the years who have stuck to their guns when times got tough. British leaders like Winston Churchill and the darkest days of World War II. We shall fight in the hills. We shall never surrender. And Churchill's successor, Margaret Thatcher, who was known for sticking to her guns, no matter what. He wanted the Council of Ministers to be the Senate. No. No. And American leaders, like President Reagan at the Brennan-Burgate, demanding that the Soviet Union tear down the Berlin Wall when it seemed that that was the farthest thing for Mr. Gorbachev's mind. Mr. Gorbachev opened this gate. Mr. Gorbachev teared down this wall. But those were the times when the steadfast were ultimately proven right by history. What happens when bold proclamations don't hold up quite as well, such as George Herbert Walker Bush's insistence, he would never, ever raise taxes. And I'll push again and I'll say to them, read my lips. And then there are those bold pronouncements that have yet to be proven out one way or the other. Like President Xi's insistence that his zero COVID policy is the right one for his country. And if you just look at the COVID-zero protocols, it requires all people returning from abroad to have 10 days of quarantine. Or President Putin insisting that he will ultimately still prevail in Ukraine. If he thinks he's losing and may lose his office and even life, then he could become completely unpredictable. But this week, this week we saw something a bit different. Big bold pronouncements being completely reversed not long after they were made. A big one was, of course, Elon Musk's change of mind again on whether he'd pony up $44 billion for Twitter. We're now hearing that Elon Musk and Twitter, of course, that resolution really said to be sticking on the contingency of getting that debt financing. And that is going to be the key clause that we're focused on going forward. But at least Mr. Musk took a few months for his change of heart. Over in Great Britain, we saw a new government lay out a new budget that included big tax cuts starting with the top tax bracket. We love the tax cutting, but not at this time. This is just the absolutely the wrong time to do this. Bringing immediate and violent reaction in the markets. Just trying to get the markets behind those two bladder factors probably significantly more difficult. And the Bank of England stepping in for the rescue. So suddenly, the Bank of England finds itself in the ECB situation. So, Prime Minister Truss' newly minted Chancellor of the Checker had to admit publicly that they had been wrong, clearly and dramatically wrong, at least on those top tax rates. And it came only days after he and Prime Minister Truss had gone so big and so bold. I think it was a distraction. And I think it was the wrong thing to do. One can hardly fault a government for listening to its people, even if the listening might have come better before the deciding. But whatever the right answer, the one thing for certain is that at least in this respect, Mr. Truss is no Margaret Thatcher. To those waiting with baited breaths for that favourite media catchphrase that you turn, I have only one thing to say. You turn if you want to. The ladies not for turning. That does it for this episode of Wall Street Week. I'm David West and this is Bloomberg. See you next week.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,770,2022-10-08 07:59:48
12545," Good after. Yeah magic. Bloomberg Technology. This is Mercury. On TV, radio and the web. This is Bloomberg. Back in 1997, I was interested in the following question, which is there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called Saurapod dinosaurs, which had really long skinny necks. So Apatosaurus is an example. Now, it's had really long skinny tails. So I made a computer model that showed that in fact the tail of these Saurapod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip, a bullfip. Now, the way a bullfip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. And that crack is a sonic boom. I think the way they got a date was to impress the females by making loud booms. Hello and welcome to Emma Barnett Neet. And this week I'm meeting the space experts and physicist Professor Brian Cox. And I'm really looking forward to asking him about how he gets his head around the vastness of space and to explain it to all of us or try to anyway. How he also goes about his daily life when he knows how insignificant we really are and what he makes of NASA's new telescope and those amazing images. Welcome to the programme. Thank you so much for coming to talk to me and to all of our viewers. And I actually wanted to start with a new NASA telescope. We'll come to your particular project in a moment. It's named after the man who ran the agency in the 60s and oversaw the first man mission to the Moon, James Webb. What do you make of what we're seeing so far? Because it's pretty incredible. Yes, a remarkable instrument. You think of the predecessor, which is the Hubble Space Telescope. I think it's almost impossible to imagine a world without that. Even if you don't know, the images that we're familiar with at the universe, many of them, the spectacular galaxies and star-forming regions, they're from Hubble. But the web is a significant step forward. And technically, one of the most important things is it can see what we call longer wavelength light or infrared light. And that's important because if you think about, we want to see the first galaxies forming. So we want to understand how the first stars and galaxies formed in the universe. And so what you do is you look far out into the universe. And because light travels quite slowly across cosmic distances. Let's say you have a galaxy that's the most distant one you can see with the naked eye. It's about 2 million light years away. So that means that the light has been traveling for 2 million years to reach us. And it's a remarkable thing actually, to think when you look, it's called the Andromeda Galaxy. And if you know where you're looking, you can just catch you out of the corner of your eye. And you think about it, you're seeing that as it was 2 million years ago.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,771,2022-10-08 08:04:06
12546," to think when you look, it's called the Andromeda Galaxy. And if you know where you're looking, you can just catch you out of the corner of your eye. If you think about it, you're seeing that as it was two million years ago. Yes, although I don't. Because it takes a light two million years to travel. I don't like being late to information, so that makes me feel very out of date. Well, it's remarkable. I mean, it began its journey before we had evolved on Earth. So in its time, it took, and that's the nearest neighbouring Galaxy. The web looks so far out that it's capturing light that's been traveling for over 13 billion years. But the universe has been expanding, and so the light has been stretching. And so for the most distant galaxies, we're looking back in time almost to the big bang. Then the Hubble was not sensitive to that light, so that the web can see the formation of the first galaxies. It's essentially looking all the way back to very close to the beginning of time. And that's very important, because we're not entirely sure exactly how those first galaxies form. The idea of what you just talked about in terms of how much time this has taken and what it's covering. Do you think we will ever be able to see the big bang? Well, we almost can. It's not the web telescope. There's something called the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation, which is light that was emitted in the universe. And it's a very precise number. It's 380,000 years after the big bang. We should not very long at all about the universe is 13.8 billion years old. So we can see that. It's microwaves, because it's been stretched so much by the expansion of the universe. Going back that the problem with light is that in those earliest times, the universe was so hot and so dense that light couldn't travel through it. So it was opaque. So you can't use light to go back earlier than that. But what we can potentially do, not yet. We're not good enough yet. But the technology we use to now to detect colliding black holes, which is another remarkable thing, but I'll leave that one aside for now. But we have the technology to do that. And that technology possibly could allow us to probe right back to this thing, the big bang. And again, whether or not that's the origin of time, we can talk about as well. Brian, you've dedicated your life to explaining the scale of the universe to people. You have a new world tour and show called Horizons. What's the goal? Are you trying to teach people new things and understand the world they're living in better? Or what are you aiming for? Well, actually, all those things. So it works, I hope, on different levels. So I talk about cosmology. As we've spoken about, you know, that what we call the large scale structure of the universe, so the galaxies and how they formed, how the universe has evolved since the big bang. But also, I've got very interested in my academic work in black holes. And black holes and they're really evocacy things. I think everyone's heard of these strange things, these totally collapsed stars from which nothing apparently can escape. But in the past few years, past few decades, really, beginning work that Stephen Hawking really began back in the 1970s and many others. And we've begun to suspect there's a lot more to them. And they've started forcing us to reassess our understanding of what space and time are. And that's a really weird sentence you might think, well, space is the arena in which we live and time just ticks. But it really isn't. It looks like, from studying these things, there are building blocks of space and building blocks of time. And what I say in the show is, that's a mind-blowing idea. And I talk about that. But the key point is, there's a great quote from Einstein, a beautiful story that Einstein told about when he was a little boy, he was six or seven years old. And his dad gave him a compass. And so he looked at the compass and he saw, well, this thing, this needle, and it always points north, points in this direction. So there's something invisible that I can't see that underlies our reality that's making this needle point north. And he said, later in life, it was my first encounter with an idea, which is, if you look at nature carefully and really pay attention, and you're lucky, you can catch a glimpse of something deeply hidden. Which is a beautiful phrase. Something deeply hidden, which is the deep structure of reality. That's what our reality is. And so black holes, they're kind of a metaphor in a way. I talk about them as,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,772,2022-10-08 08:08:36
12547," something deeply hidden, which is the deep structure of reality. That's what our reality is. And so black holes, they're kind of a metaphor in a way. I talk about them as rosetta stones in the sky. They're the things that, by studying them, and you say, why would we study these things? Well, in studying these things, we're beginning to get a deep, a deep picture of what our reality actually is. That's a remarkable idea, but it's a beautiful idea that runs through all of science. How do you define a black hole? Well, it's in Einstein's theory, which, again, is a remarkable thing. It's published in 1950, you know, over 100 years old. But it's just a region of space, from which even light can't escape. Bloomberg has enhanced search on the terminal to deliver what you need when you need it.

The week is crucial, important. And I think we've moved from this attitude from its indulgence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s and so it makes it a really exciting field because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there and what's happening in the world. And we can find out how sleep and what happens there can be harnessed to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart. If you can spit back a lot of facts. But if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what you bring figures out while you're sleeping. And by understanding what they are and knowing more about them, what do we then learn? Well, Stephen Hawking back in the 70s published a paper. The initial one was called Black Hole Explosions. It's just a great title for a paper. And he calculated. He found out that black holes in his language. He said black holes ain't so black. They glow in the sky, like holes in the sky. And they radiate. And so over time, they lose energy and mass and ultimately disappear of a huge time scales. And that's so important. I show this picture in the show that if you go into Westminster Abbey and look on the floor of Westminster Abbey on Stephen's memorial stone, then you find his equation for the temperature of a black hole literally chiseled in stone on the floor of an Abbey. So you might say why? Why is it so important? This was the key. This was this Rosetta Stone idea. In trying to understand what happens. What happens to the stuff that fell in? When you thought these things existed forever, it was pre-hawking. Then you think, well, it's okay. It gets locked up inside. It can never get out. We don't care. But the thing evaporates away. One day it will be gone. So then suddenly you have to be faced with this question, what happened to everything then? If I throw a book into a black hole, is it somehow possible in the far future if you collect all this so-called hawking radiation that comes off? Is it possible to reconstruct the information?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,773,2022-10-08 08:12:49
12548," Is it somehow possible in the far future of you collect all this so-called Hawking Radiation that comes off? Is it possible to reconstruct the information in the book? And that's been a question, simple question that's driven, this tremendous amount of research for 50 years and it was pretty much sold in 2019 actually in 2020. Pretty much, I mean, there's still a huge number of questions, but roughly, well, the statement is everything comes out, again, all the information comes out. So everything that fell in, in principle, in the far future, you could reconstruct the information of everything that fell in. It's just an astonishing idea because actually the last thing I'll say is that before that, before the Hawking papers and before this modern understanding, inside a black hole, just according to Einstein, sits the end of time, which is an astonishing thing to say because we can see them. We have a photograph of one of these things in the center of galaxy two actually, and you're looking, when you look at that photograph, you're looking at the end of time in space. So then you think, well, if things go to the end of time, how does everything get out again? And that's the content of this tremendous work in theoretical physics. And this work is still being black holes, which is probably one of those things that a certain kind of person says is useless, right? He said, why? Who cares? It turns out that the techniques that have been developed and the understanding that's being gained from looking at these things has got a very strong crossover with building quantum computers, right? Which is the quantum computers are in laboratories now. They have a tremendous potential to revolutionize our civilization, incredibly powerful computing devices. Yes, and also that's sometimes the defense given isn't it about, you know, what's going into man going back to the moon or woman going back to the moon? The other things I discovered in the pursuit of those missions. Yeah, I mean, it's always a cliche, but it's true. A friend of mine, an astronomer always says, when people criticize these spacecraft and they say, you know, let's say the James Webb Space Telescope, what's six billion dollars or so, but it's appropriate to point out that nobody put six billion dollars in a suitcase and launched it on the Roth kit. The six million dollars didn't go into space. It was spent on earth. And what is often the case, it put inside the glorium wonder of the discoveries that are made, that basically you were paying people to do high tech jobs and do research and build machines that operate at the edge of the possible. And history tells us that that tends to be extremely useful. You're inventing things and trying to do things that are difficult. And that expertise never stays in one place. It then spreads out across our civilization in ways that you can't really predict or even quantify. Indeed, and you did sound very excited early. I mean, you sound excited the whole time about all of this, which is infectious, even if you know, people are trying to keep up, including myself. But when you talked about the golden possibility of there being, you know, life out there. And that question of, are we alone? Where are you with that? What do you say to people right now with the latest information? Well, so this again, it's, I think there's a in cosmology, I say this in the show as well. It's one of the most challenging subjects because at one level it makes us feel very, very small and insignificant. And it's true, you know, physically, I mean, the earth is one planet around one star amongst 400 billion stars in one galaxy amongst two trillion galaxies in the part of the universe we can see. So we're definitely small. You can't argue that. Yes, you clarified that. But, but, but, you're right. If you have the question about life, the answer is we don't know. We found nothing, but nothing alive beyond the earth. But I've missed it that we haven't been very far or looked tremendously hard, although we are looking hard now on Mars because we suspect there might have been microbes on Mars because there was one's water on Mars and it was geologically active. And all the things that we think led to the origin of life on Earth were present on Mars around the same time, about three and a half to four billion years ago. So we wouldn't be surprised.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,774,2022-10-08 08:17:13
12549," around the same time, about three and a half to four billion years ago. So we wouldn't be surprised if we find that microbes existed, probably subsurface on Mars, or maybe on some of the moons of Jupiter or Saturn, where there's water today. However, nobody expects anything more complicated than the microbe. And it's interesting. So if you look at the history of life on Earth, you have microbes around 3.8 billion years ago, pretty much, not long after the Earth formed in geological time. But if you look for evidence of complex life on Earth, then really there isn't any in the fossil record until about 600 million years ago or so. So on this planet, for most of the history of the planet, there was slime, basically, single-celled things, doing interesting stuff, photosynthesis and things. But nothing more complicated than a single cell. And it's only in the last half of billion years or so that you get this explosion of life on Earth. And only, as I said, it's only in the last, less than a million years that we've had home-o sapiens on Earth. And in the last few, tens of thousands of years, we've had a civilization. So here, it took pretty much four billion years to go from cell to civilization. And that's the third of the age of the universe. And so that leads many biologists that I speak to to suggest that whilst microbes might be common, civilizations might be rare. Actually, I asked a friend of mine at Great Physician Carol, how many civilizations do you think there will be in the Milky Way galaxy? Typical galaxy. How many in a typical galaxy? And he said, non. And I think he's, I tend to say one. So somewhere between zero and one, probably. But that's a guess. But what do you, do you want me to be? I think it's a good guess. Brian, is that what it is? You sound like perhaps you have an optimism for it. And I wonder what's underpinning that? I would love that to be. And actually, because he worries me, and this is the way that I end my show, actually, he worries me that let's take that position. Let's imagine that in our galaxy, 400 billion sands, there's just us that thinks, right, there may microbes all over the place. But in terms of things that think and can feel, and in a very real sense, bring meaning to the universe. All these things we've talked about, the beauty of these galaxies, they're not beautiful if there's nothing there to perceive them, right, they're just galaxies. So if that's it in this galaxy, then the decisions that we make now as a civilization have a galactic implications, right, we destroy ourselves, for example, deliberately or through inaction. Then it's possible that we eliminate meaning, perhaps forever, in a galaxy of 400 billion stars. And so that's it. I think that leads you to, it's a good work in assumption that we have a tremendous responsibility in a sense not to do that. So I would be much more comfortable with our current predicament. If the galaxy was filled with civilizations, then I'd say, well, okay, it would be rather stupid of us to eliminate all this beautiful culture and science and arts and music that we've built up, but at least there's someone else that's doing that. But I'm not actually sure there is. So I think that's the only way to get out of this space. A lot of the satellites have propulsion systems. They can kind of move to get out of the way of each other or change their orbit a little bit. It's a service that you guys offer to help these companies know how to maneuver their machines. Yeah, we offer a collision avoidance service. It's a subscription service. We'll send you an alert up to seven days in advance if your satellite's going to come dangerously close to a piece of debris or another satellite. Companies have been doing that for decades.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,775,2022-10-08 08:21:42
12550," We'll send you an alert up to seven days in advance if your satellite is going to come dangerously close to a piece of debris or another satellite. Companies have been doing that for decades moving satellites around, but it's sort of like a harder problem now. The risk of a collision is a lot higher now, just because we've installed so much more hardware into space. You have a big collision, it creates a cloud of debris, and now all the other satellites are flying through this whizzing mess of debris. As we add all of the new satellites into space, the risks of the collision, the likelihood of the collisions going up. How comfortable are you with space tourism and the pursuit of that knowledge and meaning being left largely to a very small group of rich men? You're right, the idea that technology is used, if all it was useful, it was to send a few very rich people into space on a joyride, then there will be real criticism there. But that's not all the technology is useful. So I think it's important to understand that the space industry is about operating initially in near-earth orbits. We've already industrialized that, we all use it every day. We all switch on our sat nav in the car, satellite navigation. It requires infrastructure in orbit. A lot of the stuff we know about climate change, resource use, and so on. That's coming from satellites. I think you have to look at the space industry as a whole, really, and then say, well, it's not just about... The same argument was made for intercontinental travel by aircraft. When the first aircraft were built, it was extremely expensive and the preserve of the rich. But of course, within a few decades, it had democratized travel. We all take advantage of that every day. So I think that's the right way to look at space. It's not to focus on particular bits of it that we might not like for moral reasons or whatever it is. So it's actually... I really do advocate for the facts of looking at the whole industry, which is tremendously important now. It is. I mean, I am interested, though, that you did say, and correct me if I'm wrong, that all political leaders should go to space, perhaps for some perspective. And I did say that. Do you still think that? Most of them should come back. Most of them. They're all right. That's the last part of that quote. Yeah. That was based on an idea, which is a very famous idea called the overview effect, which is well known. The astronauts change their view of the... Or always, as far as I'm aware, anyway, when they come back, they have a more positive view of the value of this planet and are very much more focused on preserving it as a beautiful place. Perhaps a unique place in a galaxy, as I said. So I felt that... And I do feel that having had the good fortune of speaking to many astronauts, that that experience... For the people who make the decisions, the big decisions about our future, could have that experience. I think it would be good investments. It's extremely hard arguments to make. We should actually spend money allowing... In our case at the moment, in our Prime Minister, right? So in the UK, you'd say, well, we've just spent money sending Boris Johnson into space and bringing him back safely to Earth again, because it would change his view. No, I don't think I win that argument. But I think there's a serious point there, which is that it does seem to change people for the better when they see our Earth as it really is, which is a fragile thing against the blackness of space. So I think it's an argument that I would try to make. I would lose it, because it's very expensive. Do you want to go? Are you willing to go? I would love to, because as I said, I'd love to share that experience of seeing our world from space.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,776,2022-10-08 08:25:49
12551," You willing to go? I would love to, because as I said, I'd love to share that experience of seeing our world from space. I think it's really unarguably. It appears to be a life-changing experience, and it seems to change individuals for the better. You won't be scared. Well, I don't know. I mean, I remember one of my great heroes, John Young, who flew on the Apollo missions, walked on the moon, test flew the first space shuttle, and he said that anyone who sits on top of, however, many thousands of tons of liquid hydrogen, helium, liquid hydrogen oxygen, and isn't a bit worried, doesn't understand the problem. LAUGHTER So, it's probably right. Do you have people come and talk to you about faith? Do they talk to you about how religion and that side of life fits into your level of knowledge? Because I know you've traveled around the world talking to people. Yeah, a lot. It comes up as a question. Because cosmology is the science of origins. And actually, with the study of black holes, I mentioned, we're even beginning now to think about what's faith and time are. So naturally, I say in the show, actually, I say when we talk about this, it's the moment of creation, if that was. So we're asking, was there a moment of creation? And that's the correct language to use, I think. Or it's the evocative language, but it's really what we're talking about. Did everything come into being? Or has it always been here? We actually don't even know the answer to that question, really. So, yeah, I can ask you a lot, because I think cosmology is a challenging science that challenges us to think about these things. We associate that with theology or philosophy. And I think that's a good thing, because something I very strongly believe in is that segmenting or making little canisters and putting different bits of human experience or different music and art and theology and philosophy and science and segmenting them all is just the wrong way to look at it. What we're doing is a deep level trying to understand what it means to be human in this tremendous, potentially infinite universe. And so, those questions get asked. And ultimately, I say, I'm quite straightforward. I say, I don't. I'm not a religious person myself. But the correct thing to say, even about the question, did the universe have a beginning in time, is we don't know. We don't know. And that's it.

The Vascasual Restaurant Chain found the perfect candidate in an unexpected place. Wall Street. I had worked at Goldman Sachs for about 16 years. I was covering the restaurant, Sector. Katie and I worked together for a long time. She was an analyst covering our stock. The day that I knew I was looking for a new CFO, the day that I announced it, I went to our recruiter and I said, what about Katie for a meeting? I remember working with her. You think she might be interested in this? That same day, she had heard about it and went to her family and said, this is the job I want. Literally that same day. It was something that I always wanted to take a more of a leadership role at a company. We hit it off. Katie Fogerny spent the first part of her career asking hard questions about corporate strategy. Now she's responsible for answers. I think that there's a number of things that a sales side research analyst can lend to a company, especially a company that is in high growth mode. One, it's just really a very firm ability to analyze strategic decisions, to really get into the numbers, into the models, and to have a firm view of different scenarios out there. When those Wall Street executives move into the company seat, they bring in understanding hopefully of the fundamentals company sector, but also what it means to be a stock. The total stakeholder perspective includes shareholders. How are we measuring the incrementality of a great offer like this? Katie's skill set, so uniquely, is able to harvest in her mind so much data and information, turn it quickly into tremendous insights that end up driving our strategic priorities. That is her sweet spot. I look at a CFO from Wall Street as someone who can bring a breath of fresh air to a business that often can become very inbred. They're extremely grounded in data. They're curious about data. They're pushing the data. They know what to do with the data and tie that into telling the story. There's a reality check that Katie brings to the business to say, you know, I know you think this, but let me tell you what the data is really telling us here. She's still looking at data to predict the future. Only now, she's taking it a step further. Before, it was a lot of kind of sitting almost in an armchair type basis and analyzing different pieces of information to see.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,778,2022-10-08 08:34:45
12553," And further before it was a lot of kind of sitting almost in an armchair type basis and and analyzing different and now you know pieces of information to see where I thought the best investment dollar would be allocated here. It is actually driving a plan of how we can best maximize shareholder returns. It is about leveraging data analytics driving real insights through you know not just your own guest data but leveraging statistical models and and really kind of figuring out where the best strategic decisions will be made over time. This is an industry that really needs that type of analysis that help the strategic vision now more than ever and so it was incredibly exciting to start to apply that here at ShakeShack. ShakeShack began as a humble hot dog card in New York's Madison Square Park. It opened its first restaurant as a kiosk in that park in 2004. A decade later there were more than 60 ShakeShack restaurants around the world and in early 2015 the company went public. At the end of 2021 ShakeShack and its license partners operated nearly 400 locations in 16 countries at least 60 more are expected to open by the end of 2022. We always feel like we're just getting started at ShakeShack somehow you know we kind of describe ourselves as a public startup. We have a huge footprint and white space out there that we can grow globally and we're going to continue to do that. The piece of expansion is nothing new for this company but maybe different is the shape. ShakeShack has thrived in high density urban locations which provided 60% of revenues before the pandemic. But returned to office patterns during COVID have been unpredictable hampering sales growth in cities. Now ShakeShack is exploring new formats as it extends its footprint in suburbs. It is not just a reaction to COVID. This is stuff that we've been working on before. What COVID did was accelerated the pace and excitement for some of the things that we've been planning before. Drive through amongst them as the most important. We were right at a pivotal moment of thinking drive-throughs were obsolete and then COVID hit and it was a saving grace. So we found that the suburban areas drive-in becomes incredibly important because that's convenience and if a significant percentage of your business is drive-up you need a smaller facility. So the investment can be smaller. This is the first time the company had ever put in a drive-through. We opened up our first one in December of last year. We have six open, very exciting stuff. We've been working on these things for a long term long term opportunities to build revenue and increase margins. But right now they carry a higher price tag. Overall we've seen a rise in our build cost. We talk about 10 to 15% higher build cost across the board. Things are just costing more. It makes site selection ever more important. It makes all of the work that we do in real estate and that whole process incredibly more important. Since Katie Fogarty became CFO of Shake Shack in June 2021, inflation has risen at a record rate making her job that much harder. Everything that enters our business, commodities, foods, cost of building restaurants is getting more expensive. I don't see that ending anytime soon and we've got to continue to plan for it. If you look at the price of beef, if you look at the price of dairy, eggs, all of these core things, even paper and packaging. It's just meaning that everything costs us more and more and more and we're not alone. This is happening to the entire industry right now. The industry is also dealing with a sea change on the labor front. Hourly wages have soared and the great resignation has hit restaurants hard. Labor costs aren't going down because of the training and turnover at the 30, 60 and 90 day mark. If someone's, you know, can even figure the job out, do they stay? And that's still not under control whatsoever. So while maybe like the actual wage inflation can taper, turnover and training costs are still elevated. We've invested more than $10 million in our employees over the past year and we're going to continue to invest more. We're testing four day work weeks to help, you know, especially our working parents kind of juggle that balance between childcare and your work. I know I deal with that all the time.

12554," We're testing four-day work weeks to help, you know, especially our working parents kind of juggle that balance between childcare and your work. I know I deal with that all the time. This is really a people first company. In even an inflationary environment, you're going to see us continue to lead with our people. Do you worry at all about a price wage spiral, not just here, but in the industry, in the economy? Yes, and I think that, you know, this is something that, you know, many business leaders are focused on. And, you know, time will tell kind of how all of this lands. I think the wage-price spiral continues for quite some time. And I think we probably have been a lot less aggressive than we can be, and then many other companies have been. In terms of raising prices. Yes, we've taken our time. If you look at a 20-year history of pricing in this company, we've taken about 2% a year on average. We've never taken what we could. We've always taken what we should. We have to pay people more. We have been, and we'll continue to do so. We'll take a little bit of a margin compression on that as we've had to. And I think that's the right thing. So that, for the long term, Shake Check continues to be what we're building, which is the next generation's burger joint. Shake Check margins have come down from pre-pandemic levels. At the same time, the company's cash position has improved. During COVID, we actually took two opportunities to raise capital. We have a fortress balance sheet like we've never had before. Good timing, good planning. So when we use that money, we're looking for a great return. The area with the highest potential return is right in Katie Fogredy's wheelhouse, advancing Shake Shack's digital transformation. It's amazing to sit here and think that this is a company that had essentially hardly any digital sales prior to the pandemic. And when the pandemic hit, we went full force on digital with the app, web, with third party delivery. And here we are now with 43% of our sales still coming from digital channels, even as our in-chat business has developed. That doesn't count the kiosks, right? That does not count the kiosk. So what kind of investment was that? Is it a home run? Is that something where you're like, Randy, this paid off big time. Well, it's something that we continue to invest in. And we continue to see opportunities to improve that guest experience, improve the ways that we're incentivizing our guests to really lean in. To really lean into our digital channels. If you simply, you know, kind of look at what the higher frequency we get from those digital guests, moving more and more of them into the channels and continuing to invest to drive frequency of that base. It's a really good recipe for strong long-term traffic growth. Coming up, digital investments have boosted Shake Shack's business. Katie Fogredy assures me they're not done innovating. We want the kiosks to be able to identify who you are and what you like to order when you come into the shack. This is Gloomer. Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world recalibrates. Often decades of stagnation, Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation. Corporate giants, policymakers and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that. Every week on Japan ahead, right here on Bloomberg Television. From its early days as a kiosk in Manhattan's Madison Square Park, Shake Shack's brand has combined simplicity and style. The menu features classic items with a creative twist while the ingredients and service are a significant step up from fast food. The concept was an instant success, but maintaining growth and staying relevant comes with a complex set of pressures. We've come out of the pandemic with a new world and where something that might have been an evolutionary change has been a revolutionary change. We've made changes to the way we eat, we've made changes to the way we operate, that might have taken years, have been compressed into months and days. The role of CFO in a company like ours that's so dynamically growing, so constantly changing and focused on digital is critical. Cainy plays such an amazing role there. She's not just moving numbers around. You know, this is not your grandfather's CFO anymore. The digital infrastructure, the way we think about things now is a...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,780,2022-10-08 08:43:16
12555," Simulian monitoring and identifying ways to be better in the kitchen. And it also goes down to the products and the types of offerings that we have. You know, we never want to have something that is going to overly complicate our team members' journey. We don't want to have something that's going to slow us down operationally. So you'll see a lot of our LTOs just really be building up for menu ingredients and allowing our teams to kind of do a little bit different with what we already have. LTO stands for limited time offer. It might be a special shake flavor or partnerships like a recent venture with the stiller Makers Mark. But Shake Shack's core offering is the burger. And it's not just any burger. The company pledges to source premium meat that's ethically raised and costs more even when inflation's not at historic levels. I've heard a lot about the importance of the quality to you guys in terms of ingredients. Doesn't that get expensive, especially right now, quality beef must be rising in terms of price? I mean, we've always used premium ingredients and those premium ingredients that come at a higher price. We always have an eye on the margin. But we know also at the end of the day, you're running a very dangerous game. If you're trying to reverse engineer into something that you know, you want from a P&L standpoint, the guests might not like it. Shake Shack's standing firm on quality and it's also practicing transparency, announcing plans to raise menu prices by 5% to 7% in the fourth quarter of 2022. Shake Shack is the best example, the definition of a fantastic value proposition. However, not all customers across this country have, you know, that change in their pocket to pay for that average ticket at lunch or dinner. And I think they're very comfortable with that. And I think it's very interesting and very different than what others are doing. I mean, it is who they are. They're not trying to escape it. They're not trying to be something they're not. And the fact of the matter is if they picked a different path and it's fine, it would be hard to pivot back. We are serving fresh, whole muscle, hormone antibiotic-free beef. That is a totally different thing than you're going to eat at nearly all other restaurants. Certainly traditional fast food. And you got to pay more for that and you should want to. And when you see things like 10 for a dollar or two for five dollars, we can't do that because our ingredients cost more than that to bring it to you. And you should want to pay more for that. And frankly, who am I to argue? It's a little crunchy, the bacon's a little crunchy. I like that. It's delicious. I might finish this. Coming up, why Shake Shack believes it's got everything to gain by going global. I mean, there's so many opportunities for us to add to our license business. We see it as a huge, white space opportunity for us. And Katie Fogarty tells me what skills she's relied on while making the transition from Wall Street analyst to CFO. I would say just a lot of grit. I never thought it was going to be easy and it's proved to be quite the learning opportunity. This is Bloomberg. Big, expensive cities have a lot going for them. But if you live in one, you probably notice that these big, expensive cities keep getting more, well, expensive. You could always move away. You might have just started working remotely, so there's really nothing keeping you there. But then again, moving is a hassle. Well, what if someone cade you 10 grand to do it? What if they threw in free office space, a bicycle, or a gym membership? Programs and cities and states around the US are doing exactly that, and they're getting a lot of interest. We've had over 50,000 applications. About 90,000 applications. We've had over 1800 applicants from all over North America. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them? Or are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns for places looking for an injection of fresh talent? No one covers the world like Bloomberg.

The thing about Shake Shack and the magic about it is this is a company that can sit here with only 200 restaurants in the US today open up one in a Tier 2 city in China. And the guest reception for that restaurant is mind blowing. These are some of the largest open that we've ever had. We have big plans for our licensed business. It's a really asset light cash accretive business for us. We love it. And we love it when our partners overseas make a ton of money because they're going to build more restaurants. So we're going to all continue to grow. I mean, there's so many opportunities for us to add to our licensed business. And certainly, I get so many text messages from people traveling the world. If there is a Shake Shack there, guess which one this one is. And if there's not one, why don't you have one here? The first Shake Shack in mainland China open in 2019. And they're now more than 20. Although the government's zero COVID policy is weighed on revenues, the company is committed to expanding its presence. China's a fascinating business for us. It's one of the most exciting and biggest opportunities Shake Shack has. Over the initial couple of years of the pandemic, they've faired much better than we did here and much better than most places around the world. Today, it has been erratic. It's been lockdowns. It's been closures. But here's what's amazing. The resiliency of the Chinese people, our team over there, is unlike anything I've witnessed. It is one of the toughest places to do business in the world. But our brand seems to be really resonating with people over there right now. And I see it as one of the biggest areas of growth we have at Shake Shack. Restaurants haven't been resonating with Wall Street recently. The sector has underperformed the S&P 500 for much of 22. But the industry is historically resilient. Restaurants are undervalued right now. As a person who has been following restaurants since I had hair, I think restaurants are probably the most flexible and most creative of businesses that we have. The routine and the social engagement happens at restaurants. And that's not changing just because we may or may not go into the recession. It just isn't going to change. And so the restaurant stocks will rebound. This industry is the third largest employer, all the population of workers in this country. This is like the fabric of the economy. And the economy will rebound. And restaurants stocks will blow up. If you want to trade in and out of Shake Shack, you just may not be the time for you. If you are a believer in the brand of Shake Shack for the long term, like we are and have been, we're going to create tremendous value for our shareholders over time. We've done that. Shareholders should measure us on are we building things for the long term? And if you want to be here for the long term, my sense is Shake Shack's going to be a good bet. One of Shake Shack's long term assets is a bright new CFO. Katie Fogarty now has a year of experience under her belt. I wanted to know what she sees when she looks ahead. What's the opportunity for Shake Shack in the next 10 years?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,782,2022-10-08 08:56:01
12557," What's the opportunity for Shake Shack in the next ten years that I have to say it is in watching our people grow and develop. I see a very strong growth roadmap here for the company in terms of units and sales potential. But what that really means at the end of the day is that our hourly team members are able to grow a career with us in a way that is unique to Shake Shack and cannot be found at many other restaurant brands. We have a number of people who start off as hourly team members and are now making six figures and have equity because they've grown up through the system and they're paying it forward by training other people to allow them to have such a great career path as well. What's the challenge over the next ten years that keeps you up at night? It also goes with people. It has been a very challenging staffing environment for the restaurant industry as a whole. It's been well telegraphed that some people have just left the industry altogether. We know when we have to have high turnover, we're not operating at our best. I do think that there's an amazing opportunity that once the world stabilizes and returns back to normal, that we have people considering the restaurant industry as more of an exciting long-term career. In terms of your role as CFO, how do you see that or your role with this company changing and developing over the next ten years? I think that it becomes ever more important to have a great grasp on the insights that are driving the business, on the factors that are driving your business. That's very important for CFO to do, but also to collaborate with other business leaders within the company to help cross-pollinate strategies. Whatever I do in a vacuum is not going to be nearly as impactful as our entire executive leadership team coming together and acting on something. I think that that is ever more apparent sitting on this side of the table than it was on the other side as a Wall Street analyst. Speaking of that, what skill or what area of knowledge do you think has helped you the most in your first year as CFO? I would say just a lot of grit. This has been a very challenging industry for sure. I never thought it was going to be easy and it's proved to be quite the learning opportunity. Coming in every day just excited to learn something new and make a difference wherever you can, knowing that I'm sitting here with a team of people growing a company that will potentially have an impact on a number of people's lives going forward. So what advice would you give someone else than who maybe is watching and gets promoted to CFO? What advice would you give to a future CFO? I guess I would just be get into the details. Super, super deep. Really understand and ask a lot of questions. Peel the onion. I think a lot of people just don't go deep enough and don't ask the questions so that you actually cannot, you know, if you're not versed on what's going on, you can't find root cause and you can't try to change. So, you know, I would say get into the details, have an open mind. It's an incredibly fun job for sure. Working with people who are coming, you know, everybody's aligned here to drive the future of Shake Shack, but everybody comes at it from a different angle. So it's very exciting to work with an amazing team of people. I'm Matt Miller. This is Bloomberg. We don't have enough women founder CEOs who are getting funding. So basically less than 2% of VC funds go to women, less than 1% go to women of color. And so in this innovation space, I said to myself, what's the best way to use capital to move things for women? And that's when I started to say, okay, I actually need to move some money into the venture capital space. And I want to do it smartly. I mean, the first goal is to make money. I'm not putting my money out as a social impact. I'm putting it out to make money. But I wanted to go behind funds like aspect ventures that's run by Theresa Gaugh and Jennifer Fonsdatt, who are looking at these opportunities and they have a thesis around my gosh. There are so many opportunities there if we go towards funding some of these women businesses. Some LPs have said to me, all we care about is returns. Some of the best investors may not be the best people, but they have the best returns. What do you have to say to those people? I have to say you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,783,2022-10-08 09:00:13
12558," be the best people, but they have the best returns. What do you have to say to those people? I have to say you're investing in what you know. And so you need to look at what trends are coming in the nation and how you're gonna dress them. Women are 85% of consumer dollars spent. Women control 70% of financial decisions in the house. So if you're not investing in products that go towards females or a women led company, you're missing an opportunity because you just don't see it. A wild man wakes up in China and make it as a warehouse administration. This is actually Why do the biggest names in business choose Bloomberg? Great question. Great question. Great question.

Thank you so much for doing this. What do you think about all this celebs getting into crypto? I think that was more last year. I think it's kind of a way of that past. No, I don't think so, but I think it's like any time that frankly it's when a lot of other people get into crypto. Right? Other audiences too. It's when it's in the news a lot. When does that happen? A lot of times when the prices are going up. She was a federal prosecutor going after gangs and the mob before being handed for next assignment. Taking down Bitcoin. Katie Hawn soon realized this new technology was much more than a tool used by criminals. She dove deep and became a crypto convert, swapping her prosecutor hat for a board seat at Coinbase, and became the first female general partner at Ventur firm and recent Horowitz. Hawn, now a prolific crypto investor, recently launched her own fund with one and a half billion dollars to deploy. It's the largest fund ever raised by a sale investor. Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0 CEO and founder of Hawn Ventures, Katie Hawn. Katie, it's so great to have you. Great to be back here in the studio with you Emily. I want to start with a vibe check. Okay. What state of the crypto cycle are we in?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,784,2022-10-08 09:05:50
12559," Katie, it's so great to have you. Great to be back here in the studio with you, Emily. I want to start with a vibe check. Okay. What state of the crypto cycle are we in right now? It was hot. Yep. And then it got pretty cold. Well, look, Emily, zooming back because I've been in crypto for a decade, if you can believe it. We've seen crypto be really hot and then all of a sudden not. And so we've seen this before. However, I think one of the things that's a little bit different now is with each new crypto cycle, more and more people come into it. And so it's more and more pronounced each cycle. And I would push back on it's not. I think it depends on what area of the ecosystem you're looking at. We think developers think crypto and Web3 is still really hot. I am seeing a lot less of those we're all going to make it hashtags. I am seeing a lot less of them too. Although I am spending less time on Twitter, so maybe that's why. But with each cycle, there are new acronyms. What hasn't happened is a crypto winter in the midst of really serious global macro conditions. So we have inflation, kind of it record highs for our generation in our lifetime. And then we have also a war that's broken out in the Ukraine. And we have a number of other factors going on here. So that's very different. There was some serious carnage out there. Socius, Luna, three-hour-os. What's been your takeaways for more of that? I don't want to sit here and tell you that algorithmic stablecoins are bad because I actually think they're really interesting. However, I think what happened is you had, in this case you mentioned Luna and Tara. That was an algorithmic stablecoin that was getting pretty widespread adoption relative to what the tech could do. I didn't realize you spent your teenage years living in Egypt and learning Arabic. Tell me about your upbringing. I was always uprooted. My dad worked for a large company and we were always moving just when I would get comfortable in one space. And I think actually that's pretty important if you fast-forward and look at my career. I'm comfortable being in uncomfortable situations. I was, didn't know a lot about venture when I got into it initially. I didn't know a lot about crypto when I got into it initially. And I was okay asking questions. I was okay not knowing the local acronyms or the Namanclature of a particular field. And I'm, you know, I'm taken right back to my teenage years in Cairo, moving from Houston, Texas one day to downtown Maddie in Cairo the next day. You studied law. I did. You clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. That's right. You became a federal prosecutor. You were taking on prison gangs and the mafia. That must have taken a really thick skin. I was doing it at 8 to 25. And now if I kind of take a step back and you know, I think that happens at different points in your career like, whoa, if I would have analyzed that a little more at the time. And I'm kind of in some ways glad I didn't. I just dove right in because I found it fascinating. There was a human aspect to it and people's stories. And I felt like those stories mattered. So I was drawn to criminal law and became a federal prosecutor and I did cases involving violent crime but then really mistrying cases, being back in the courtroom, being before the grand jury. Like the prosecutor you would see on TV going to try those murder cases. Doing those two hour closing arguments. That's right. And so moved out here to California. I indicted the largest prison gang in the world at the time, outlaw motorcycle gangs, hostage taking, bank robberies, armed bank robberies. There was really not a kind of criminal case by that point in my career. I hadn't done it. It was right around that time, 2012. One of my bosses came in and said, let's have that same energy that you brought to those gang cases, to those murder cases and let's go ahead and have you investigate this new criminal technology that we really need to look into and possibly shut this down. So you created the first cryptocurrency task force. How would you describe it? Fortunately, several of us in the government realized at the time, it's not possible, also not desirable because Bitcoin is not an entity. It's not a person, right? It's a protocol. And it would be like saying, let's go shut down cash. Let's go shut down the internet. It's not possible. Probably wouldn't be a good idea, either. I was using crypto and technologies like the Bitcoin blockchain, because that's all that existed then, this is 2012, 2013, to actually uncover criminal activity. So",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,785,2022-10-08 09:09:31
12560," Using crypto and technologies like the Bitcoin blockchain, because that's all that existed then, this is 2012, 2013, to actually uncover criminal activity. So I didn't think that that technology was bad. Frankly, it was a tool that helped me uncover the various activity. And by the way, it was a step-level function improvement better than compliance by banks. I'll just go ahead and say it. That's a little bit controversial, but I had spent a decade subpoenaing large financial institutions, and five times out of 10 didn't get back what I needed. One case I worked on, and people always say, oh, you shut down the Silk Road. What actually happened? I was looking into something completely, not having to do with anything at all of the Silk Road, and came across some, what looked to be some kind of odd activity. And it turns out that a couple of federal agents on the Silk Road Task Force out of Washington, DC were cropped. And that is the case that I ended up in dining, and I ended up prosecuting those agents, and they both went to prison. So that's the aspect of what Silk Road case that I worked on. I would never, never have been able to uncover that criminal activity by those agents, because they were federal agents, they knew how to cover their tracks, had they not use Bitcoin blockchain. So that technology right there, if they had just used wires or cash or bank wires, we would never have uncovered that. MUSIC Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund from scratch?

MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC So you became kind of a crypto convert after this. You joined the board of Coinbase very early on. How did you and Coinbase and Brian Armstrong come together? I hosted an event here in San Francisco at the Federal Reserve Bank and I believe it was there that it wasn't just Brian, it was a lot of what I'll call legitimate actors and crypto who wanted to usher in this new wave, this new ecosystem and then we brought together the heads of all kinds of agencies. Really in an effort to kind of talk about building bridges, you know, the government and the crypto industry. We're never going to see eye to eye on a lot of things but we did think there were some commonalities. Coinbase is a company that has suffered, they've been losing share, the valuation of public markets has plummeted. Why do you think that is and how do you think it can be fixed? Yeah, well I think again a few things it's tied to. One, a large aspect of Coinbase's business now of course is trading revenue and that's down when prices are down and you know the company's been very transparent about that long before going public. I mean also if you look at its S1 it specifically identifies that and just how volatile crypto cycles are. So I think that's part of it. It's judged by public markets as a technology stock or as a financial services company. By the way I think it's both, I think it's not just.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,786,2022-10-08 09:13:23
12561," So I think that's part of it. It's judged by public markets as a technology stock or as a financial services company. By the way, I think it's both. I think it's not just a financial services company. I think it's so much more. I think it's really a portal to this whole new ecosystem. You were also on the board of OpenC until recently there's an insider trading situation or accusation going on there. Coinbase has also had employees accused of insider trading. How much is this happening within crypto companies and within the industry and how big a problem is? Yeah, I think crypto is under the microscope. So where you have a case, two cases, three cases in crypto ecosystem, which now is a trillion dollar industry. I think multi-billion approaching trillion dollar industry, you're always going to be able to find examples like that. So I don't want to make too much out of a handful of cases. That said, the company Coinbase OpenC take these things incredibly seriously. Along with your position at Coinbase, you became a partner at one of the most storied venture capital firms in Silicon Valley. That is Andrews and Horowitz. What was your experience at A16Z-like? I met Chris Dixon and I met Ben Horowitz and I met Mark Andreessen. I had worked with them for just about a year, maybe a little bit over when they asked me to come and co-run their crypto funds at AndreessenHorowitz. Again, I jumped at that chance and I think really that speaks to the fact that as I said before, things are a hell yes or there are no. And it was a hell yes for me. So Andreessen Horowitz is the kind of place where if you make a partner you don't leave. How did Mark and Ben respond when you said, yeah, I want to leave to start a crypto fund of my own. As you might know, Emily, they're an anchor. They're an anchor check into my fund and I'm very grateful for that. Mark and Chris and folks like them are also personal LPs. So I felt very supported when I shared that decision. And I will say that it was not running away from AndreessenHorowitz. It was running to another opportunity. And you know, crypto is not, what do they say? It's not a spectator sport. It's like, you're in it. It's excuse very young. It's 24-7. It's global. And it's hustle. And at this, and that's a trade-off. It's a life trade-off. And at this point in my career and in my life, if I was going to continue to make that trade-off, I just wanted to do it and do it in a way that was really true to me. So you struck out on your own to launch on ventures. What gave you the courage to do that? What was the spark that lit the fire? Yeah. That got you to say, I need to do this and do this now. Sure. What I set out to do was to continue to invest in this ecosystem that I think is so broad that decision was very purposeful and the timing was very purposeful. We have an early stage fund that does seed stage, series A, even series B. And then we have what we call an acceleration fund, which is not a growth fund. It's a crypto growth fund. And I think those are different things. But it's later stage. It might be crypto-publics. Certain kinds of public tokens were set up to hold tokens and participate in the token ecosystem. Or later stage companies. There are now several crypto, many crypto unicorns. The space has become really competitive. Even though you say, you know, crypto has had its ups and downs, the thing is, a lot of people in some of those last cycles have seen the kind of venture style returns that can be having crypto. And so you've had a lot of new funds enter the space. And that's driven up competition. So what differentiates on ventures then from all of these other crypto funds or even the more traditional venture capitalists like entries in Harrow, it's a Sequoia. They also have crypto funds now. Sure. Well, I think a lot of traditional venture capital funds now have crypto funds. It used to just be like a regulatory designation. It was like, are you an RIA, which is registered investment advisor? I would say for crypto founders today, it's not enough to just be an RIA, right? They, frankly, I don't even know if a lot of them care. That's a regulatory designation. What crypto founders today want to know is, do you live and breathe crypto? Do you inhale the discord? Are you part of the community? Do you participate in governance? Are you going to be staking these kind of crypto verbs out there? And if you're not really in this space full time, I think it's very hard to run a successful crypto fund. We don't have a hedge fund component. So we're not sitting here buying and trading and selling that's a hedge fund structure. And there are crypto hedge funds. We're not one.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,787,2022-10-08 09:17:45
12562," We don't have a hedge fund component. So we're not sitting here buying and trading and selling. That's a hedge fund structure and there are crypto hedge funds. We're not one. We're making seven to ten year bets. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund from scratch? You know it's hard but it's not impossible. We don't have a crystal ball. I don't know. I can't predict cycles but I knew that we were in a cycle where you saw so much for an excitement around the space. And I already talked about what makes this different. But I think one thing also is we are a nimble strike force. We don't fish in the same pond. We have the crypto natives. We have efficient execution. We have operators, seasoned operators who really know how to stick the landing. And I think that's reflected on our culture. I would say the only thing that's changed in our strategy as a result of the market correction is really more of a focus on early stage. But we still have our late stage fund. And when we see valuations, which I think we'll still see correct, spoiler. I think we'll continue to see some corrections. And so we might deploy our later stage fund a little bit more slowly. It might not be on an even 50-50 cadence and that's okay. Long term, our strategy hasn't changed. Long term, we're committed to this space. How much do you think valuations are going to correct? You know it's just I can't give you a one-size-fits-all answer because crypto is not a monolith. You have some crypto companies that really follow more of an enterprise SaaS business model. You have others that are layer one protocols. You have still others that are consumer-facing applications. And I think one of the things we're seeing right now is the infrastructure layer. And that's where we're spending a lot of our time, by the way. And we think more and more use cases will come about when the infrastructure layers in place. So my own view is we are not rushing to deploy. We're certainly not getting caught up. You do get VC FOMO and have you not to avoid that. You know look, I think it's very easy to get into that mindset. Right? It's because it's a competitive sport. It's a competitive space. And I think I'd be lying if I said that that doesn't influence anyone. I try to what I do. And I think I do differently. Is I try to take stock of that. Oh, that's the FOMO mentality kicking in. That's bad. Again, you don't want to over-correct though. What we look for is we look for amazing founders. It doesn't matter if I think valuations will correct if they're amazing founders. There's a huge tam. We also look for what's your regulatory plan? If you're launching a token, what's your plan to comply with the law? What's your plan for security, by the way? We've seen a lot of hacks in the space. We want to really dive in there and make sure that the founders have been thoughtful about, especially if they're custodian customer funds, keeping those funds secure. If it's a cross-chain bridge, what are the exploits? Have you changed your strategy at all, given the downturn? What? Have you backed out of any deals or decided not to do certain deals? Because the conditions have changed. Don't you raise the phone? We have decided not to do certain deals. We've never backed out of a deal. We have decided not to do a few deals. Because we think that pricing was ahead of progress candidly. And we might have been wrong about that, Emily. We might have been wrong about that. But I think if we were wrong not to do a couple of deals, better that we might have been right. Because if we were wrong about that, I think we can find a way to still invest in those projects later. Well, one thing I'm hearing is that a lot of dry powder has just sucked up. Yeah. Because all these funds raised a lot of money. Yeah. Raised, what was the biggest fund ever for a single person, not just a woman? Yeah. Anyone? Are you confident you're going to have a place to put all that money? I am, but if I don't have a place to put it, I'm not just going to go willing, nearly deploy it. And one of the things that we told our LPs even during that period when we raised our fund, which was when crypto was undeniably still on a bull run, we said that we are going to be pretty steadfast, sticking to a tier deployment cycle. And I think one thing that's changed is that might have lengthened. It certainly hasn't shortened. But we will, again, we have, we feel very good that we have the capital to back great teams when we see them. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States. I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind. And we're falling behind. Watch Bloomberg surveillance early edition for the news you need when you need it.

What about NFTs? NFTs, are you concerned about the declining demand? We are increasingly living in a digital world. I happen to think that if you live in a digital world, you're going to want to own digital goods in that world. You're not just going to be satisfied to rent them, which is what we do now. We buy our content from Walg Gardens without digital scarcity, which is what? NFTs unlock. You don't really own anything. You're subject to the whims of a platform. I think NFTs and digitally scarce goods fundamentally change that. I think you'll see NFTs back again, but we are spending a lot of time in the infrastructure layer. I tell you zero-knowledge, technology, scalability. We think of that as the plumbing, if you think of the fiber-hubbic cables. Remember, you couldn't have had YouTube and Netflix with dial-up. You couldn't have streamed content. The same is true of crypto use cases. We think that there will be a lot of new use cases unlocked when the infrastructure is there, when it's more efficient, when it's more user-friendly. So we're spending a lot of our time there. President Biden issues this crypto executive order. There are a number of ports that are coming due. What do you want to see from the administration when it comes to regulation and are you optimistic that we will get there? Yeah. We were so delighted to see that executive order. It's not something you should normally be delighted about. But why we were is because it was to us a real recognition that this is a US government saying this field isn't going anywhere. This field is growing so much that we are going to direct every single agency in the federal government to come up with a plan here. I think we take a step forward, but then you see we're a big government. We're a big system. We have states. We have local entities. So we take a step forward with the EO and then we take some steps back sometimes too. And I think what I see is crypto founders are confused by that. They're starting to think, well, I could go to this jurisdiction where there's a single regulator. And you don't have 50 states with different rules. It's the US government that needs to start taking stock of the fact that right now, Emily in China, there's a quarter of a billion ECNY wallets, a quarter of a billion. We're still talking about whether there should be a government central bank digital currency. We're still studying that. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind China. And we're falling behind. What are the dangers of falling behind China and the rest of the world? This is years ahead. So I don't want people to take a headline and say, oh, I think the US dollar will be no longer the global currency, reserve global currency. I'm not saying that now. But fast forward decades. And if you no longer need to use the dollar because you have an alternative, I think that's a real problem. What would we use instead? Well, I think that there are going to be stable coins out there that people who have access to a smartphone will use. There is a demand for it. You see, 285% year over your growth with stable coins. So people are clearly liking the idea of this. Now, again, there have been some spectacular failures, too, but not all stable coins are created the same. But I think the important thing is that we really do need to not just quash innovation. What do you think of how Gary Gensler, the chair of the SEC, and how he's approaching it? One of the things that I hear from founders is that they're very confused because they get told, come in, register, just come in and talk to us. You have the one.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,789,2022-10-08 09:26:23
12564," the SEC and how he's approaching it. One of the things that I hear from founders is that they're very confused because they get told, come in, register, just come in and talk to us. But you have the one company who's done the ultimate act of going in and registering coinbase, file the S1. And still, there's a lot of saber rattling still going on, I think. And again, I don't want to single out the SEC. And I don't want to suggest that anything they're doing is bad, I do think that right now there's a lot of confusion. And one of the pieces of confusion stems from the fact that, you know, and it started with the ICO mania back in what 2016, 2017, I can't even remember which year now, where the SEC was very loud about securities. A lot of them were securities, but the space has changed. And so to still view it through the ICO lens when so much has happened over the last five years in the space, I think is a mistake. What do you have to say to the skeptics out there who just don't believe in the future of Web3? And don't see where this is going. Yeah. I would say don't judge the current state of innovation by the end state of innovation. I hear from a lot of these skeptics. And by the way, I'm friends with a lot of these skeptics, too. I don't only want to live in a crypto bubble, they want to see the use cases, especially if they're not technical. Well, when am I going to use it? What will I use it for? And I think one of the things that's not appreciated is how quickly the infrastructure here is catching up. And once you have really scalable blockchains that can handle a lot of thorough put and are very efficient, I think that unlocks a whole lot of use cases. People are spending more time on screens. That curve is up and to the right. Whether we like it or not, that is the future. I mean, those who have kids know that kids spend more time online. They want digital things, too. And I think to dismiss it, it is a bit generational. I do find not always, but it is a bit generational. If you talk to kids about being able to have money online, they instantly get that concept. They're comfortable not having to hold something in their hand to think it has value. Take us to the end state. Do Google and Amazon and Facebook and Apple still exist? I believe they will still exist. I mean, it depends what you talk about when you talk about the end state. I mean, I think that I think for decades, those companies will still be around. But the important thing is, I think this new ecosystem is going to represent a challenge to them. I do think that those entities, decentralized forces, are coming. And we'll cut into those entities, profits, and revenues. So we have a little rapid fire section. If you could belong to any altcoin tribe, the 20p. Gosh. There is no way I'm answering that, because I will get trolls on Twitter by every other altcoin tribe. I'm a crypto maximalist. I'm a crypto maximalist. All right. I'm not taking one. Booker podcast.

Hydrogen has a very special place in the universe. It's the first element on the periodic table. It is the most abundant element in the universe. And when clean energy advocates think about what can we find which would be as easy to use as fossil fuels they think about hydrogen. The fuel that will, when burned, only produce water. We like to imagine that if we just built enough of these and these, we could ditch fossil fuels and save the planet. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. There are some things where you just need a good old-fashioned combustible fuel. Now startups around the world are betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century. Innovation, money and power collide in Silicon Valley and beyond. Bloomberg Technology with Emily Chan. Weak days at 5 p.m. in New York and 2 p.m. in San Francisco. Indonesia's economy is rising fast with massive factories like these ones dominating the outskirts of Jakarta. I last met President Joko Widodo or Jikoey as he's more often known in his home town of Solo but that was almost three years ago and a lot has changed. You've dealt with Elon Musk? Yeah. We left Jakarta's presidential palace by convoy for a huge Hyundai factory built during COVID on three-quarters of a million square meters of land. Jakoey, who once ran a furniture business, has equally large ambitions for his country's economy. He's banned the export of raw nickel in favor of downstream products and will instead produce refined nickel that will be used in the batteries to power electric vehicles. An equally impressive factory is being built nearby for just that purpose. If you work in a factory, it's a salary much higher. Compiring with the other industry. In the automatic industry, higher. Much higher. Higher than furniture. Of course, yes. If Jakoey has his way, other raw materials will follow. Cole, Boxite, Tin, Golden Copper, even Palm Oil. This November, Indonesia will host the G20. Jakoey is one of the few leaders to have met both China's Eugene Ping and Russia's Vladimir Putin since the invasion of Ukraine. This is a conversation with President Jakoey of Indonesia. President Jakoey, thank you for talking to Bloomberg again. When I was last here in 2019, you had just been re-elected. Now, you're halfway through your final term as President of Indonesia. You are the biggest country in Southeast Asia. You are right in the middle of the United States and China and their arguments. You...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,791,2022-10-08 09:34:27
12566," You know, you are the biggest country in Southeast Asia. You are right in the middle of the United States and China and their arguments. You recently said the world was in dire need of responsibility and wisdom. I suppose my first question for you was Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan. Was it wise? Was it even responsible? Yes, the rivalry between the country and the country is very... The rivalry of the big countries is indeed worrying. What we want is for this region to be stable, peaceful, so that we can build economic growth. And I think not only Indonesia, Asian countries also want the same thing. We can't help but think about the economy. I think you're being very diplomatic, President. There was word that Nancy Pelosi was going to come to Indonesia and then you decided to change that plan. Is that true? No, no. We will openly receive, but there was no visit. There now seems to be a more serious danger of a Chinese invasion in Taiwan. And there is a concern that if there is a conflict in Taiwan, it would spill over into the South China Sea, where you have territory, territory that China can test. Is Indonesia ready to defend itself or defend its land and waters in that case? So you're ready for that conflict militarily if it happens? We do want the region to be peaceful. It shouldn't come to the point that tensions rise until it affects economic growth and then later on affects the well-being of our people. In my opinion, it is very important that there is a space for dialogue between leaders, especially leaders of big countries. The global situation is extremely difficult and there shouldn't be further unnecessary issues. We are going through a food crisis and an energy crisis that hasn't been resolved. The pandemic still exists in some countries. So what is the situation that you are facing? Is that going to be a big theme for you at the G20 that you want to turn the debate away from these rivalries between superpowers and focus on issues like food security, inflation? Yes, it is better than having open conflict. It is better to have a forum for dialogue like G20. If there is space for discussion, we can discuss and have debates and hopefully come up with solutions. This is what we want. This is why we have a space for dialogue. I know that you have invited President Xi Jinping to come to the G20. Has he said he will come here in November? Yes, President Xi Jinping will come. And President Putin. President Putin has also told me he will come. Do you worry at all about the G20 being this conflict where you have the democracies coming forward with plans? And you have Putin sitting there in one room like this and you have Xi Jinping with his own agenda. It will be a very difficult house party to run. At the G20, we do not want to add to conflict or problems but to resolve the problems. How we can resolve all these problems, not to add problems and conflict. You know, you've been to Xi Putin, you've been to C. Zaletsky, you've been to Xi Jinping. Do you think that by bringing people together, that that is a way to solve conflict? Sometimes it can increase it. There must be communication. Even if it doesn't necessarily resolve the problem, it is better to have dialogue than to have open conflict. When we started this interview, I said that you know, you were in the middle between China and America. But having looked at Indonesia, I looked at the numbers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,792,2022-10-08 09:39:07
12567," When we started this interview, I said that you were in the middle between China and America, but having looked at Indonesia, I looked at the numbers. American investment in Indonesia over the past five years is $9 billion. China has invested $40 billion. You look around here, we have a Chinese car factory around the corner. China is buying up a lot of the refineries and make precious metals. America at the moment is losing the battle for hearts and minds in Indonesia, but also in Southeast Asia. Do you think that is fair? This is an approach that needs to be renewed because what is needed by countries in Asia, including Indonesia, is investment. What investment? If it comes from China, we welcome it. If it comes from America, we welcome it. We are not going to be choosy. You are not choosy, but one side is coming and saying, I want to invest, I want to trade, and the other one is saying, no trade packs. And I want to come and talk about other things. That is why I said previously they need to renew their approach. You have dealt with Donald Trump, who famously insulted his allies and promoted America first. Joe Biden was supposed to be different, but rhetoric aside, is there any change? Surely Joe Biden is still saying America first? He just isn't insulting you at the same time. Yes, I will give it to my family. Indonesia wants to be friends with everyone. With any country, we don't have problems with any country. Each country will have their own approach. Each leader has their own style and approach, so there shouldn't be a problem. But now what's needed by Indonesia is investment, technology that will change our society. Yang Ita, I just wanted to ask you about ASEAN since you mentioned it. You have a group of countries, but it is one where you look at the countries. It includes Myanmar, which seems to have all these problems with human rights and so on. Why do you keep Myanmar in ASEAN? We already had a meeting in Jakarta with all members of ASEAN. All the leaders came, including Myanmar's junta. And there's a consensus, five point consensus. The implementation hasn't taken place, and the approach we have taken hasn't worked. That's the complication we're facing. There are several ASEAN meetings after that, which we did not include Myanmar participation. One very last thing on foreign policy, you've been to Go and see Vladimir Putin and tried to talk to him and you saw President Zelensky in Ukraine. I think you've focused on food security and issues like that. Do you see any sign of peace or progress there as the president of the G20? Yes. Sayag gave Dan Burpich al-Addingan, Putin and Zelensky. I went to Kiev and talked to President Zelensky, one and a half hours. Then went to Moscow, Russia, to meet with President Putin and talk with him almost two and a half hours. I want to see a space for dialogue after the meeting so we can discuss. Anywhere is no problem, but I see the chances are small. So I turned to issues like food crisis, and President Zelensky said they can't export because there were no guarantees for security to ship goods from Odessa port to Istanbul. That was the message I conveyed to President Putin. And President Putin said he will guarantee security for ships to enter Odessa. Those are what I told the media.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,793,2022-10-08 09:43:13
12568,". While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today won't be electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building across America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels, we want to do that with our buildings. If we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Indonesia is an extremely resource rich country and the economy's potential is enormous. It has a third of the world's nickel reserves used in the lithium batteries of electric vehicles. It's the world's biggest grow of palm oil, the second largest miner of tin, the third biggest producer of coal and ranks fifth for boxite. Its grassberg mine has won the largest reserves of gold and copper. This nationalism is nothing new, but Indonesia's two-term president is doubling down. After banning the export of raw nickel, he's now planning the same path for all the others. Jikowi is moving downstream, creating higher-value products that will be used in everything from aircraft to semiconductors to touch screens and the batteries in electric vehicles. We want the added value to be in Indonesia, so there will be state income in form of tax, provide jobs in Indonesia. And the most important thing is that we can enjoy the added value. In Indonesia, John, I'll give you nickel as an example. When we exported raw materials four to five, six years ago, the value was only $1.1 billion. Since we went downstream in 2021, our exports were valued at $20.8 billion, that's nearly 18 times. That's what we want to do with boxite, copper, tin, crude, palm oil and others. We are not being closed, we are being open indeed. U.S., China, Europe, want to come and cooperate, we are open. The messages you want people to come here and use these raw materials to make things. And so just to be clear, ferronical and pig iron, they will be the next ones to be stopped exported. So they people have to use them here. When we, the industry here, are ready, exports automatically will stop. We want us to build a large ecosystem to produce electric cars as many as we can here in Indonesia. And boxite and tin will also be in this list of materials to use inside Indonesia. Geology was represented in overcoming increased costs of labor development稣",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,794,2022-10-08 09:47:53
12569," And Boxite and Tin will also be in this list of materials to use inside Indonesia. Yes, that is correct. Not only Nickel, Boxite, for example, is used to produce alumina. And then be used to make cars body or cars chassis. You've talked about putting a tax on Nickel products. The next stage up is that going to happen this year? And export tax on Nickel products. Yes, come on, Ginnon. It is possible to impose it this year. I can see around here you have had a lot of success. You and I went around a rather nice car factory and you have the electric vehicle, the electric battery construction, Hyundai, LG, Volkswagen and Toyota, Seamkin. The person who everyone talks about is Tesla. And you have a $5 billion contract to supply Nickel ore. But you wanted to have a Tesla car factory. It now looks as if you hope to get a Tesla battery facility. And I wondered if you could give us any news on that. Is that any closer? Yes, we want to have a Tesla car factory. If it is Tesla, we want them to build electric cars in Indonesia. From Ford as well, we want them to build electric cars here. From Hyundai, electric cars, from car makers in Japan, Toyota and Suzuki. We want a huge ecosystem of electric cars for the world. We don't just want to reach batteries only because this is just half of them. You made a very eloquent case and Elon Musk is a famously reasonable man. Why is he said no to the car factory then? It's still in discussion. Let's see later the final result. You have negotiated with Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin. Either of them is difficult to deal with as Elon Musk. Everything needs time. I don't want to go quick with no result. It needs an intense communication and the result will show. Do you think there has been an element, though? Looking around here, that it has been......tens to be the Asian countries which have been first into trying to build electric battery facilities here. Yes, I have to go to Bang. I have to go to Bang in Mumbai. In the future, we want to build a large ecosystem for electric cars that is truly environmentally friendly. Although the energy will come from green energy, such as hydro power plants, geothermal, wind, sea waves, solar panels. The famous case of the palm oil, I think people back in April, you suddenly imposed an export ban on palm oil. The price shot up to $1,600. The flooded the domestic market, then you changed your mind. And partly because the domestic market was so full of palm oil, you let it export, the prices come down. Some people would say that Indonesia is now a very honestly run country, but it can be capricious. You change between these things. Do you think the palm oil ban was a mistake in retrospect? Yes, the price was a mistake. At that time, the domestic market situation was a price spike of almost double. So we made a policy. There were several policies, but it didn't solve the problems for months on. So we stopped exporting crude palm oil and the domestic price fell. That's what, yeah. Then we resumed exports. I think it's okay. No problem. Will you remove the obligation to serve the domestic market first? The fake...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,795,2022-10-08 09:51:51
12570," We resumed exports. I think it's okay. No problem. Will you remove the obligation to serve the domestic market first, the famous DMO, this idea that you, Parmoyle, has to be offered to the domestic market first? Do you now want to get rid of that? Yeah. If going forward, the price is stable. We can remove the DMO policy. We prioritize our national interests. It's a good idea to have a national interest. I'm here at the Delhi Airport and behind me you can see Spice Jet 737 Max aircraft. Spice Jet 737 is going to compensate Spice Jet in form of cash and aircraft. There's a big celebration happening at the Goliere Airport. As you can see, they've literally rolled down the red carpet for Spice Jet 737. There are balloons, there are flowers. This is a big deal for Spice Jet because it is the only Indian operator of Boeing 737 Max plane starting may be the obvious thing to say, we don't want the planes to be tight as the look of two planes for the biggest aircraft… Before you change the world, Bloomberg.

Every Friday with 30 minutes dedicated to fixed income, I'm Jonathan Farrow, this is Bloomberg Real Yield. A consistent thing you've been talking about is green industries in the environment. You have a goal to make Indonesia carbon neutral by 2060. As you know, most of your energy now comes from coal, coal prices have gone up. Will you stick to your pledge that you would build no new coal fired plants? That is gone forever. Our target is very ambitious. 41% 2030 and 2060 we should be at zero, but this requires technology and funding. Money, the potential is clear. We have potential of renewable energy to produce 434,000 megawatts. But to shift from coal to renewable is not an easy thing. Because the price to produce energy from coal is still cheaper than geothermal. Yes, it's being done. It's just that there are still some that are still in the process of being completed. Not new ones. Indonesia has an oversupply of electricity. Half of the emissions from Indonesia come from land use and forest clearing. 51% of Indonesia is forest, and you have committed to keep to that level.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,796,2022-10-08 09:56:08
12571," from land use and forest clearing, and 51% of Indonesia is forest, and you have committed to keep to that level. But you are still letting people cut down rainforest, which is the really most useful bit. They're building other forests, farm forests. Isn't that the wrong thing? You should be protecting the rainforest first and then thinking about the other kinds of forests next. John, the forest fire happened more than 20 years ago. Since 2016, it has been reduced by 85%. We also do restoration on more than 2 million hectares of peatlands. Within the next three years, we will also do restoration for 660,000 hectares of mangrove's forest. In the past five years, we also imposed a moratorium on new palm oil plantation. Does it make you cross when people from the rich world like me appear, and countries that have already taken down their forests, used their coal, and you have a country of 270 million much poorer people who have not done this yet. And we come and lecture you about this. Massive forest clearing is in the past. No more today, what we have now is restoration, revitalizing, taking care of the environment. I have required all mining companies to build a nursery for reclamation of their mining areas. We are working to improve the environment. I can take you to the nearest nursery center in Bagoor that produce about 2 million seedlings a year, and we will have 30 of those nurseries, then you will believe that we are serious. Can I ask you very quickly about Newcentara, this capital that you are building, $34 billion. The aim is to finish it by 2045. This would be the new capital of Jakarta in Borneo. I wonder, will you finish the first stage in August 2024? Are you on time in terms of that? The shift to a new capital is a long-term plan since the first president, Sukarno. It's my responsibility to put the policy in place, but we still check the feasibility studies. It will need funding of $33 billion, and we will use state budget to cover for 20%, while the rest 80% from private sector from investment. And this isn't just for two years, it's for 20 years. I'm confident with a good concept and with good returns for the investments, I am sure many investors will come in. You know that many people in Indonesia look at problems, look at challenges like building Newcentara that will happen long after you are supposed to give up. You are currently very popular. You have a 68% approval rating, and some people, some of your allies in the legislature have suggested you could amend the constitution so that you could do a third term, keep building this capital, keep building car factories. I wonder if you said before you will follow the constitution, but can you rule this out? Regardless of the constitution? Let's talk about the new capital, Newcentara first. There is law on this that is supported by 93% of the parliament. What's there to be afraid of with that much support? Secondly, an amendment of constitution, I have said repeatedly, I will abide by the constitution, although support from the parliament is at 84%. Once more, I will abide to the constitution and wishes of the people. Sayat bhaad bhaad dhaakon se tussi. President Jikari, I'd like to say that you are still looking forward.

12572,"! Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world recalibrates. The decades of stagnation Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation. Corporate giants, policymakers and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that. Every week on Japan ahead, right here on Bloomberg Television. As Fall sets in, a decided turn in the air for the new British Government's designs for the economy for Elon Musk's designs on Twitter and most decidedly for Mr. Putin's designs on Ukraine. This is Bloomberg Wall Street week. I'm David Weston. This week's Special Contributor Larry Summers on whether the jobs market is starting to show some signs of loosening. I think we are headed for a collision of some kind or other and we've just got to manage that collision carefully. And Brad DeLong of Berkeley on what the broad sweep of economic history may be telling us about where we are headed next. People say that the United States has very little to teach them that we don't have any greater grasp on how to deploy and use these technologies to create a good society. We had our fair share of about faces this week with the Bank of England's quick intervention to save the guilt market as explained by former MPC member Kristen Forbes of MIT. It's a very important thing to do. Because of the big market moves, there could be some margin calls, some pressures for force selling that could cause the guilt market to freeze up. And British Prime Minister Liz Truss giving up at least part of her economic program. It was becoming a distraction. That's why we immediately changed that policy and that's the kind of government we are. But as ugly as the situation was in UK markets, it was nothing compared with the setbacks for Russian forces in eastern and southern Ukraine, with President Putin's efforts to quote Annex territory that his forces didn't even control. Which Admiral John Kirby at the NSC looks at as an indication that Mr. Putin just may be coming to understand how difficult his situation really is. The Annexation announcements as well as his announcement of partial mobilization certainly shows the degree to which Mr. Putin knows how much he's struggling inside Ukraine. The OPEC plus weighed in with its own changes. Cutting production caps by 2 million barrels a day or about 7 percent, putting even more pressure on Europe and the rest of the world already worried about energy. Well, we were disappointed that OPEC made this decision. As the President mentioned, we think it's unnecessary if you look at the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,798,2022-10-08 10:05:30
12573," This decision as the president mentioned but think it's unnecessary if you look at the global environment where supply continues to be the Predominant challenge then there's Elon Musk He offered 44 billion dollars for Twitter back in April then decided to renegade got sued and on the eve of his Deposition returned to his original offer even it looks like he's going to be way overpaying In many ways this is almost the most expected outcome of all which is settling on the eve of trial Just before deposition of the main players Elon Musk himself He doesn't want to be deposed he has you know probably some embarrassing text messages and conflicting statements and all of that would make for a very unpleasant But after all the back and forth this week US jobs numbers actually came in surprisingly on course adding 263 thousand new jobs Just slightly more than expected with workers paid 5% more than they were last year and a reduction in the unemployment rate to 3.5% Which made for a rough day in equities on Friday, but actually a pretty good week overall for equities The S&P 500 adding 1.5% to end the week at 3639 and the NASDAQ Eaked out a gain of 3.4% Bonds also had a topsy-turvy week, but ended up with the 10-year yield of a relatively modest five basis points to 3.88 Here to walk us through this week and what got us here are Aaron Brown portfolio manager at Pimco and Chris Ellman chief Investment officer Ed Calster. So Chris let me start with you Boy, given what we're seeing right now. Are we looking at a long cold winter? Would you say? Unfortunately, David. I think we are I think the Fed you know with these employment numbers the Fed knows that they have to continue this pace of Aggressive tightening and they're going to do so the next meeting and the next running after that And I think which the street is pricing in but I think after that they're going to have to keep it up And that's going to be into the winter and it's going to be a tough time So what do you say Aaron? Is it going to be a rough winter? I think it is going to be a rough winter I think that their bands of uncertainty are quite wide for next year The Fed is tightening into an economic slowdown and we haven't even seen the real impact of that slowdown yet We're just starting to see signs of a gradual slowing But likely we'll continue to see that into next year and we think that we're heading into a recession into early 2023 and at that same point just given the level of inflation the federal reserve is now really challenged to be able to Arrest that inflation get it under control despite what happens to the economy So I think that really poses a challenge for the Fed and we'll likely see something that's fairly unprecedented Which is continued financial conditions tightening and Fed tightening into an economic slowdown Even if it really leads to a harder landing than what the Fed's anticipating And Aaron I push back a little bit. I actually think we're in a recession right now It's not a very strong one and it doesn't hurt a lot. I was so with employment growing You know, but we did have a negative GDP in the second quarter third quarter is mild To me anything below 1% in the USA feels like a recession But so what you're saying is you think it's going to be a really will actually have a good traditional hard Negative recession with rising unemployment, which is exactly what Powell has said. I mean, that's his forecast. Yeah, I think that's right I mean my our view at PIMCO is that we'll likely see unemployment rise to about 5% by the end of 2023 And so right now we're sort of seeing some of those early signs But we really haven't seen the full brunt of financial condition tightening yet. That's more to come So we are going to continue to see us slow down and I think that's really going to hit in the first quarter of next year And into the second quarter of 2023 Chris given where we're out of inflation right now the concern is about inflation If we are heading an intersection or even are already in one No matter how long it is or how short it is One of the tools the Fed has to use because typically you turn to the Fed and say okay start cutting interest rates Doesn't look like they're going to do that in a likelihood No, they're going to raise interest rates that they only have one tool they have well they have their mouth They can jawbone the market, which is what they're doing they have the dot plot which is going to indicate or direct the market But they're really the only tool they have is short term interest rates in the Fed funds rate And that's what they're using aggressively. I mean good grief 75 basis points those are big bounces. Do you know?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,799,2022-10-08 10:09:53
12574," They have a short term interest rates in the Fed funds rate. And that's what they're using aggressively. I mean, good grief. 75 basis points. Those are big bounces. Do you know through history? You've got to go way back before you have that aggressive tightening of monetary policy. And they have to shrink the balance sheet. So as they move through that, you know, he's already said, he's getting a hurt employment. Yet we have stronger numbers. I think the numbers, there's something strange in the numbers this week. Just like last month, but we'll see how that balances out. We're going to have a tougher time. And, you know, I think the question's going to be about corporate earnings. You got CPI next week. And then you got the bank starting to roll out with their earnings. Aaron, has the market price in the diminishment of earnings at this point, corporate earnings? No, I don't think that they have. What you've seen since the beginning of the year is equities have de-graded, largely driven by the market multiple. So you've seen the market multiple for the S&P 500, de-grade from about 21 and a half times to about 16 times today. Keep in mind that traditionally in recessions, the market multiple is somewhere between 14 and 16 times. So we're just at the upper end of where we typically are in recessions. And we think that you could see a little bit more de-grading from there. That's not really the challenge for the market. The challenge for the market is that when you look at corporate earnings for next year, the market's pricing them to be up 7.5% for consensus. Our forward-looking models are expecting them to be down about 9%. So that's north of a 15% differential versus what the market's pricing for next year and what we think it's likely to be. Also, historically, during recessions, earnings fall about 27% on average. So there's real downside risks to our forecast and certainly to the market's forecast. And I think that's where you're going to see the real pressure point for the market in early next year. What's driving that is margins. We're at record high margins right now. The street is expecting that margins are going to expand further from here. So even higher than and hit new record highs, we've never seen that in a recession before. So I think the market's really mispriced and that's where the pain's going to come from. Aaron, I've got to ask you if we're already down 23% so far this year. How much lower do you think we can go? Do you see a support level on the S&P? I think that in a moderate recession, the market probably bottoms out about 3250. There is downside risk if we see further sort of a more severe or harder landing from there. But 3250 is still down about 14%, 15%. So I do think that there's still room for the market to fall further. Where are you looking for in terms of your estimates? Yeah, no, I agree 3250. But I mean, that's a negative 36 on the year, which is you're like me. We have asset allocation portfolios. Where do you hide in that kind of a negative market? You've got bonds with the rates rising. So you're going to have continued negative returns out of bonds and then a negative 30 out of stocks. That's a rough calendar year. Where do you hide? Well, I think that I think there have been actually market opportunities that have arisen since the start of this year. Cash rate right now, two-year bonds are yielding north of 4%. Now that's not a sexy return by any sort of stretch of the imagination. But if you can lock in 4%, add a little bit of spread on top of that, an IG corporates that give you an additional 2% or so. That's about a 6% return over the next couple of years. That's high quality paper that you can invest in. So I wouldn't rule cash out as an option. I think that that's somewhere where you can hide and really not expect that much volatility and really consistent returns and hide out there until we see the markets bottom and you can start incrementally moving back into risk. But I think you need to keep in mind as an investor that if the core of your allocation of your portfolio, which is cash and core fixed income, is unstable, then you really can invest in the outer ring asset. So we really have to stabilize rates in order to move out the risk curve into other asset classes. Right now, cash is a pretty good option. OK, we're going to pick up exactly that question. Where do you hide in this environment?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,800,2022-10-08 10:14:21
12575," In order to move out the risk curve into other ASSA classes, right now cash is a pretty good option. OK, we're going to pick up exactly that question. Where do you hide in this environment? When Chris Aillem and Aaron Brown will be staying with us, we're going to ask for them, then for some investment advice we could use it, that's for sure. That's next on Wall Street Week here on Bloomberg. So, what's the best investment advice you've ever put in? You haven't done anybody. The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance, and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day, and if you keep at it and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's not just interest. It was always said about compound interest returns, compound business returns, compound human returns. They're all very additive because you'll learn every day, and if you keep at it, it's very, very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make? Selling it the wrong time. And they sell when the prices go down? Yes. Or, yes. Not keeping. They have conviction if they invest for the right reasons, just keep at it. The facts on unemployment seem clear enough, or at least as clear as that changing social definition ever can be, the situation is getting a little better, but not much. The government announced today that the overall unemployment rate last month was 6.9%. The official unemployment rate has been stuck within a tenth of 7% for six months, and that scarcely represents the massive reduction of unemployment, that at least some folks thought they heard Jimmy Carter promise a year ago. That was Louis Royce-Royce, on Wall Street Week back in October of 1977, when the unemployment rate was twice what it is today, and we were trying to get it down rather than focusing on inflation, whatever that ends up meaning for employment. And if that seems like a galaxy far, far away, well, maybe that's no accident. The top movie this week back in 1977 was Star Wars, and the top song on the charts was, you got it, the Star Wars theme. Still with us, our Aaron Brown of Pimco and Chris ailment of Calcester. So Aaron, let me turn to you and pick up on where we were talking just now with Chris, but where you hide, if you're really an asset allocator, you said cash is one alternative. Are there things though that involve at least some risk that you go to, and how much it depends on what you think the recovery is going to look like whenever it comes? So I'm going to flip that sort of question and answer the second question first, which is unlike prior recessions that we've seen in very recent history, so think of the global financial crisis or even the pandemic of 2020, I don't think this is going to be a V-shaped recovery. I think this is going to be more of a prolonged sort of stalling of the economy and more of an L-shaped recovery than what we've seen in the past. And the reason for that is because inflation is high and is likely to persist at high levels, you're not going to come in and see the fed start cutting as the unemployment rises like we've seen in the past. Instead, because the fed is moved from...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,801,2022-10-08 10:18:04
12576," going to come in and see the fed start cutting, you know, as the unemployment rises, like we've seen in the past. Instead, because the fed is, you know, moved from a dual mandate fed to a single mandate fed, really just focus on getting the inflation rate down, you'll likely see, you won't see this sort of immediate relief that we've seen in recent history. And so that does change a little bit the landscape of how you think about investing. You know, historically, as we start to get closer to what we expect the bottom level of the S&P 500 to be, we start to, you know, scale risk back up, start to move back into equity investments to catch that recovery to the upside. And this time around, I think you have to be a little bit more patient. So instead, what we're really looking at is fixed income investments that we think are going to be able to sort of stand at the test of time, be able to sort of hide out in a safe haven assets. So beyond just looking at cash, we're looking at high quality investment-grade corporates, we're looking at municipalities, municipal bonds, you know, particularly for those who are, can take advantage of the tax advantages, tax advantage bonds, we think offer good value there at a sort of after-tax yield of 6.5%. You know, in addition, we also like some mortgage agency bonds and structured credit bonds as well. And then sort of high quality equities that are defensive equities, high free cash flow, dividend growth, strong balance sheets. We also think do well in this environment. But you know, it is a sort of challenging time for investors where you have to see more towards fixed income in order to have stability of return as opposed to looking for a quick snapback in equities. But you know, I posed a question to Chris because I know he also manages a diversified portfolio. Chris, where are you looking at what type of sort of diversification that are you looking at in order to sort of hide out over the next couple of quarters? Well, Aaron, you know, I've got the benefit of being able to go into private security. So I've got a good size real estate portfolio. We have a large private equity portfolio. Sure, it's going to have write downs, but its value is a bit more stable than we see in the public markets. We have a cash position, but the problem is for us cash is not outperforming inflation. So the old adage cash is trash is still true. We do like a private credit. You were kind of hitting on that that, you know, variable rate debt, short term debt with high quality. And I think collateral is going to be key because as you said, we're going to have a long rough winter. So you don't want to be loaning money to everybody after you do care about governance. But it is tough in this environment. I mean, you know, if the economy is slowing and inflation is still strong, that's stagflation. And you look back in the 70s, I got to say, I love that suit that that Lou had. I don't know where you get that back in the 70s, but I'm stunned by it. But you know, you look back in that time period, returns in 77 were terrible. We're hard places to it was just a very tough time to hide anywhere. Yeah. So I'm curious though, exactly, but when you go into fixed income, do you think the price is attractive now in some fixed income, Chris? Well, I agree with Aaron. I'm going to go short. I'm not going to go long fixed income and take duration exposure, short term credits. I mean, you've been holding credit for two to three years and then it's money good. And as she said, you're going to put it in a spread product. So you pick up a couple of basis points by being in a corporate, you're okay. There's still a lot of money, David, international money that wants to come into this market, non-US rather that wants to come into the market. You saw it in the this week where suddenly comes rushing in. So I would give the advice to the average investors. You've got a slowly average cost in. You're not going to be able to call the bottom. As much as Aaron, I think there's a support number, it may not hit that at all. And the market's going to just bounce along. And in Aaron's example of an L, an L goes on forever. It's just flat. I hope we don't have to live in a flat recession for years and years. But I think this is going to be a tough market to find any kind of growth opportunities. So you want to protection in a return of your money rather than return on your money. Aaron, one of the big developments this week was OPEC Plus and what they did. It certainly seemed to stun the whiteheads at the time. What does that tell us about geopolitical risk generally and specifically?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,802,2022-10-08 10:22:52
12577," Turn on your money. Aaron, one of the big developments this week was OPEC Plus and what they did. It certainly seemed to stun the white hats at the time. What does that tell us about geopolitical risk generally and specifically energy? It looks like oil prices are going to stay up there for a while. I think that's one of the things that the market is really miss pricing. Right now, if you look at the forward curve for oil, the risk is really in this very short term where the market expects that oil is going to be elevated for the short term, but it really has an extrapolated or extended that expectation out the next one to two years. I think that there's real value in the back end of the curve for oil because I think that these oil challenges are going to persist much longer than what the market's anticipating. One of the reasons for that is first we saw out of oil OPEC Plus this week their intention to keep prices elevated. But I think the other challenges is that we really haven't invested here in the US or on a global basis on energy infrastructure. So that capacity is really constrained over the next couple of years. Even if we wanted to expand capacity or oil producers wanted to expand capacity, they don't have the ability to do so in the immediate term. And that's going to keep oil prices elevated. So the risk for oil, then the risk for the energy complex broadly isn't just this winter, but it's next winter as well. And next winter's challenges are going to be even more difficult, particularly on the shores of Europe than what we're experiencing this winter. And so that's what I think the challenge is and why I think this is something that's going to persist much longer than what the market's currently priced in. And David, it's running into the challenge of climate change. I'm looking at decades, not a short-term trade in carbon. And I'm glad that we're having a constraint on the ability to expand hydrocarbons and burning carbon. But you're right, people want heat. And Europe heats itself, whether we like it or not, it doesn't heat itself a solar and wind. It's got to do it through fossil fuels. And that's matching and running into it as I had to reduce these fossil fuels. And I agree with Aaron, I'm hearing the same thing that Europe has enough oil and natural gas for this year in their supplies. But if it's a really cold winter, they're very worried about next year. So you're going to have climate change crashing into this challenge of OPEC and inflation and energy prices, certainly over the next couple of years. Europe has a lot of challenges, Aaron, right now. Not just energy, it goes beyond that. Does that make the U.S. relative the most attractive place to be for you? I don't know if it's the most attractive place, but it's one of the more attractive places, particularly the V-CIVE Europe. And the challenge that Europe has is that they're starting from a lower productivity, a lower and weaker growth rate to start out. They also didn't fully recover in the same way that the U.S. did post-COVID. And they now have wider fiscal deficits. They're going to have to spend more money in order to insulate their economy from a harder hit because of energy. And that's going to create real challenges at the same time where the economy is rapidly slowing. And so our view is that while the U.S. is going into recession, the recession in Europe is going to hit harder and is likely to be more prolonged. Thank you so much, Aaron Brown and Chris Aelman. When we come back, we're going to take a look at what's happening next week on Global Wall Street. Lewis, who's blue blood.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,803,2022-10-08 10:27:58

No one deliberately wants to go into battle, but we sneak walk into conflict. No one matches reach and resources from more than 120 countries. The moment news breaks 24 hours a day. You are global business authority. This is Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. I'm going to take a look ahead next week on Global Wall Street. China stocks reopening is the big story in Asia this week. Exchanges on the mainland have been shut for the past five straight sessions. We could see a pop at the open, given the moves we saw in Chinese assets in offshore markets. Welcome news for officials in Beijing. The first time in Beijing, because President Xi Jinping is just days away from securing a third term as Communist Party leader. That's at the 20th party Congress starting October 16th. Otherwise travel restrictions or the easing of those is the major theme as well. Japan will further loosen controls from Tuesday and Taiwan from Thursday. For Europe next week there's a big risk lingering in the markets. The end of the VioE short term program to backstop bond markets. They would be purchasing long dated bonds after concerns that a huge spike up in yields in the long end of the curve meant that there would be danger for pension funds. The VioE has been doing this buying program. It's set to end on Friday on October 14th. There could be jitters in this market. What it means to no longer have a VioE backstopping a political story really of the UK government, which has been doing various U-turns. So all of that will be in focus this week. All eyes next week will be on the latest batches of US inflation data. Produced surprises will be released on Wednesday with the headline figure projected to have fallen year over year for a third straight month. Meanwhile, the Consumer Price Index release on Thursday is once again expected to show conflicting signals with a deceleration in the headline number from a year ago. But the core measure of CPI, which strips out food and energy, is forecast to re-accelerate its pace of growth rather than fall. Investors also will parse the release of the minutes from the Fed September meeting and whether there was any serious discussion about slowing or even halting the tightening of monetary policy. And earning season is finally here. The latest round of quarterly reports kicks off with Pepsi, JP Morgan, City Group, Morgan Stanley, Delta Airlines, and United Health among the Notables. David?

12579," This is Bloomberg Daybreak with Lake. I'm Bloomberg. Welcome to DevBreak Australia. This is Bloomberg Technology. This is me. On TV, radio and the web. This is Bloomberg. Okay, so you're moving in on me quick. Just stradzing me with your fancy hands. I'm going to deal with your night because it's really bothering me. Ah, my night. Yeah. He's a troublemaker. Yeah. What did you get up to this weekend? You know, just robot stuff. A lot of chess. I was practicing for you. I know you're pretty good. Ooh, I don't like that. I will take this. Put it over here here. Not cool. Not cool. All right. I will. I will concede. I can see. You've got me, Bid. Very good game. Well played. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. From the world of politics to the world of business. Balance of power with David Weston, views and analysis inside from and about politics power players. Weekdays, this is Bloomberg. This is Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. Every week we turn to Larry Summers of Harvard, our very special contributor here on Wall Street Week, to help us sum up the major events of the weekend. Once again, we welcome back Larry Summers. So Larry, I think we should start with the jobs numbers out on Friday in the United States. I mean, some say not too hot, not too cold. Some people say, isn't this good, at least it's not getting worse? I guess my real question to you is, I may not be getting worse, but is there a danger just in the inflation where many where it is? We have 5% year-over-year increase in wages. I think these numbers were about what we expected. And the sensible judgment was that we've got an inflation problem. Core inflation figures look artificially good. They're better than median inflation. And yet, core inflation ran at a 7% rate last month. And that was more than for the quarter. And the quarter was more than for the half year. And the half year was more than for the whole year. So we're not in a controlled place with respect to inflation. And there wasn't really anything in this report to suggest that we were coming into a controlled place. The monthly wage number was relatively favorable, but it was pretty clearly distorted by the fact that you had a lot more workers coming in in leisure and hospitality. And those are low-wage workers. The workers where wages are most flexible are going up more rapidly. So I don't think this is a number that changed the picture that we've got an economy that is too strong to be an economy where inflation is going down. But that is maintaining its robustness. But I think we are headed for a collision of some kind or other. And we've just got to manage that collision carefully. And I think the sooner we start managing for a slope, managing for some slowdown, the better we're going to do. I think Chairman Powell was way late to come to that recognition. But he now has that recognition, and he should be supported in that. So what do you think, Chair Powell, and the Federal Reserve will make of these numbers? How will it affect what they do in early November? I don't think these numbers are going to change what the Fed does. You never know what's going to happen. And certainly there's risk of some kind of financially traumatic event. But I think the chances of something that is large enough to divert the Fed are really quite low.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,805,2022-10-08 10:35:36
12580," Traumatic event, but I think the chances of something that is large enough to divert the Fed are really quite low. So I'd be expecting that the market, which is anticipating 75 basis points in November and is anticipating 50 more in December, that would correspond to my best guess at this moment as well. And I think that kind of thing is going to be appropriate if we achieve disinflation. Larry, there's another strain of discussion. I've seen certainly this week, in fact there was even some Fed staff work at the New York Fed suggesting that we better be careful because in fact, the rate that we may need, in order to get down to 2%, maybe so high it will cause financial instability. There is really a safety and soundness issue. What do you make of that? Is it possible the Fed will have to choose between financial stability in the one hand and getting inflation down on the other? First, I think that should be the occasion for some soul searching. If we have an economy where we think there's going to be substantial financial breakage because the Fed lifts the Fed funds rate to 4.5%. Then we have an in adequately supervised financial system and an insufficiently active financial regulator. And so if anyone believes that along with whatever monetary policy implication they draw, they better tell us how we think how they think we ought to be repairing the regulation of the financial system. David, my sense is that you can never rule out these kinds of risks. But the Fed has more than one instrument. It has instruments for specific guaranteed lending. We've seen that used a number of times and each time we're surprised by how much the economy retains its robustness. In retrospect, we cut interest rates too much and kept them too low when we were supporting the financial system after COVID. In retrospect, we kept interest rates too low and blew up a bubble when we were supporting the economy with low interest rates after Asia and LTCM. In retrospect, we were surprised and amazed by how rapidly the economy grew when the Fed did what was necessary after the 1987 stock market crash. So we need to regulate right to preserve financial stability. We need to have a very strong firefighting force in order to respond if and when financial accidents happen. But I think it's a real mistake to suggest that somehow we shouldn't do the monetary policies that are necessary to avoid inflation becoming entrenched because of concerns about financial stability. David, the people who are still on team transitory, they're always saying that expectations aren't entrenched. The more it's true that expectations are not yet entrenched despite high inflation, seems to me the more important it is to move vigorously now with respect to inflation so they don't become entrenched. If they were already entrenched, we could discuss the right timing of a disinflation. But if we have the big advantage in disinflation of expectations that are not yet entrenched, surely we should be acting on inflation while we have that advantage. Larry, another big development this week was the OPEC plus decision to reduce production limits by 2 million barrels a day. Something that I think it's fair to say was set the Biden administration back a bit. He'd gone over there and asked the Crown Prince not to do that. It wasn't very pretty. So apart from...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,806,2022-10-08 10:39:35
12581," by 2 million barrels a day. Something that I think it's fair to say was set the Biden administration back a bit. He'd gone over there and asked the crown prince not to do that. It wasn't very pretty. So apart from perhaps any embarrassment of my cause, does it have larger macroeconomic effects for a globe that we are warned by WTO? No, maybe headed toward a global recession. There's nothing good in this. Certainly it's not what we wanted to see. Actually, it's a lot less than 2 million barrels because many of the countries that reduced their quota weren't hitting their quota before. So the reduction in the ceiling didn't really matter. And you didn't see a hugely dramatic move in oil markets in a way that was proportionate to the headlines that you saw. But certainly the risks are up. And it just points up the importance. And we always do a scramble about the immediate when these things happen. And we don't forget about the medium term. Look, we made a mistake by canceling the Keystone pipeline. We made a mistake by slowing down all kinds of permitting activity. We made a mistake by being hostile as a country to natural gas. We made a mistake in the Congress a few weeks ago when we didn't pass the mansion program of expanding permitting. We crucially need regulatory relief, where we're not going to get renewables online fast. And we're not going to get the transmission lines that are necessary for renewables to become a large part of our energy fast. So the real lesson on this is we need a different kind of energy strategy than the one that we've had. We need a strategy that is balanced rather than an unbalanced strategy of total hostility to fossil fuels. Or God knows the kind of total strategy of favoring fossil fuels that we had, even egregious favoritism towards Saudi Arabia that we saw during the Trump administration. We need to find a balance. And I think we're making our way in that direction. Larry is always so helpful to have you on each week. And I would like to say, Larry, some of us are staying with us.

Our very special contributor, Larry Summers, of Harvard has stayed with us because we're going to bring in now Professor of Economics from UC Berkeley. He's Brad DeLong. The author of a new book, Slouching Toward Utopia, an economic history of the 20th century. So Professor, welcome for joining us. It's really good to have you here. I've read this fascinating and really sort of protein book. It's really quite a book. Let's set it up first because it's a history of the 20th century. But you don't necessarily define the 20th century as from 1900 to 2000. You start in 1870 and end up in 2010. Why? Well, the big thing that happens happens in 1870, right? Before 1870, the world's poor. And there's no prospect for the world being anything other than poor. After 1870, every single generation, humanity's technical competence doubles. And then doubles again in the following generation. And such an enormous pace of technological advance raises the possibility for the first time of a world in which we can bake a sufficiently large economic pie for everyone to have enough. And that was nothing that humanity had ever seen before. One of the remarkable things, Brad, that you highlight is that it really wasn't very different to live in the United Kingdom in the 19th century than it had been to live in the ancient world 2,000 years before. Say something about the acceleration of growth that you see is happening in the 20th century. You know, I mean, it was British economist John Stuart Mill, right? He was writing in 1871 about how all the industrial revolution had done was it had created a somewhat larger middle class. And it had allowed manufacturers and the rich to earn greater fortunes, but that the overwhelming mass of humanity was still confined to the same life of drudgery and imprisonment than they had been before, that they had been in before. And before all the way back into deep time. It was very clear by 1900 that things had changed. John Maynard Keynes writing in 1919 looks back and says, starting in 1870, we entered economic Eldorado and that now our chief task after World War I was figuring out why we tried to blow it up and try to get desperately back to what was good was going on after 1870. Fortunately, we eventually did. And so things rolled through up until our day. First of all, it gives us a sense of what happened in 1870 that brought all this about. There were some three driving forces in your book. Well, you know, everyone has an idea about just what it is that's made us as a civilization so wealthy that makes our economy so productive. And the different people have different things and they all go back. Some of them back even to say the year 1070, when it turns out that the law applies to a German emperor standing in the snow outside of the castle that elies on his tool, but instead it could be that the law applies to everybody. But you get three things that fall into place in 1870 that set technological progress into a much higher gear than ever before. And they are the industrial research lab so that you can rationalize and routinize the discovery and development of technology. And then the corporation, as we know it, which rationalizes the development and deployment of technology, you know, to combine that with the globalized economy, with the telegraph and the I railroad and the iron hold ocean going steamship.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,808,2022-10-08 10:48:38
12583," is the development and deployment of technology. You know, to combine that with the globalized economy, with the telegraph and the I railroad and the iron hold ocean going steamship. And all of a sudden, the incentives to deploy technology worldwide for production are so overwhelming and people turn their minds to how to do this that everything explodes in a way it never had before. Brad, much of the academic discussion of your book has centered on this idea of a pivot point in 1870. But I want to ask about a different judgment you make, which is that there was this major era and that the major era ended in 2010. I would have thought that the world was growing. It was becoming more integrated with technology. There were important political struggles. That was the stuff of history through the 20th century, much better in the second half of the century than in the first half of the century. And the Cold War was a very different war than World War War 1 or World War 2. It was cold. But I would have thought that was a continuing process with substantial challenges. And yet you see us as now being in a quite different era. What's different about the era we're in than the era you wrote the history of other than more of the kind of progress and change that you saw is happening every generation? Well, I'm pleased you disagree here. And I'm very pleased you disagree on our historic Iodoptomist here about our future. Because look, I've been losing arguments in person with you for 42 years, even when I think I'm right afterwards. And here I'm genuinely uncertain. And I actually very much hope you are really right this time. My thinking was I've been listening to our friend, John Fernald, about how the underlying pace of technological progress has more or less halved since 2005, compared to what we were used to beforehand, saving those years from 1975 to 1990, when technology was crawling toward a more energy efficient and environmentally friendly configuration rather than focusing on labor saving. But after 2000, we seem to have a substantial loss of social and economic knowledge about how to run things. Things about financial regulation that I thought were entrenched that were known in the bones turned out to have been completely forgotten in 2008. Things about the proper tools for macroeconomic policy that I thought were ingrained in the bone were also forgotten after 2010. And I remember you and I whimpering in 2012 that no, for the more expansionary fiscal policy, was not then a thing that ran any risks whatsoever. Combined that with the fact that from 1870 on to 2010, first you had Britain in the United States, and then the United States as the countries that people were looking to, for example, as you always Leon Trotsky liked to say, as the furnace where the future is being forged. But now you go to China, you go to India, you even go to Indonesia, and what you find is that people say that the United States has very little to teach them, that we don't have any greater grasp on how to deploy and use these technologies to create a good society, and are in fact the society, our society that is more trouble. We're more trouble than theirs are. Brad, if that is right, how much of this because of a running out of ideas and how much of it is running out of cohesion? One of the themes in your book is this sort of polls if I can put it that way between Hayek on the one hand, the market is king, and Pallani and the others, the market has to serve people. How much of the problems we're in right now are because we're lacking cohesion because of the dispersion in wealth and income? I think we're dead.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,809,2022-10-08 10:52:48
12584," Alonni and the others, the market has to serve people. How much of the problems we're in right now are because we're lacking cohesion because of the dispersion in wealth and income? I think we're definitely lacking cohesion. I think dispersion and wealth and income creates work of cohesion. I am struck by comparing the United States around 1900 with the United States today, right? That around in 1900 politics was as fierce and mean as it is today. That is, theodore Roosevelt denounced in William Jennings Bryan as the puppet of a alien European socialist, John Peter Altgill, the governor of Illinois, who had not only been born in Europe, but also had dared to pardon anarchists. But there seems to be a very different flavor. That is, I think it's Ezra Klein talks about it, that somehow that our media and our communications today focuses first on establishing, who are your enemies? Do you share any enemies with me? And if you share enemies with me, I will listen to. So as I say, it's a remarkable book. It's slouching toward Utopia, an economic history of the 20th century. Thank you so much for bringing it. We only really touch upon it today. I urge everybody to read it. It's really worth the effort. Thank you so much. That's Professor Brad DeLon of UC Berkeley. And of course, to our very special contributor, Larry Summers of Harvard. Coming up, staying the course or turning tail, we'll reflect on some big about faces this week. This is Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. What do you get your news on TV? On the radio. On the radio. On Bloomberg Radio. On the web. On the Bloomberg Terminal. Or the Bloomberg apps. The news that affect your business. Here's what I'm watching. You do not want to miss this story. I'm thinking about those things on it. Is our business. Bloomberg TV on radio. The world is listening. MUSIC This is really a reminder isn't it just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see pressure on the U.A. and we did see some pressure on the future. This is now being reversed. Finally, one more thought. The fine line between being steady and being stubborn. We've all admired those leaders through the years who have stuck to their guns when times got tough. British leaders like Winston Churchill and the darkest days of World War II. And Churchill's successor Margaret Thatcher, who was known for sticking to her guns no matter what. He wanted the Council of Ministers to be the Senate. No! No! No! And American leaders like President Reagan at the Brennan Bird Gate demanding that the Soviet Union tear down the Berlin Wall when it seemed that that was the farthest thing for Mr. Gorbachev's mind. Mr. Gorbachev opened this gate. Mr. Gorbachev teared down this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,810,2022-10-08 10:57:01
12585," Skate. Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall. But those were the times when the steadfast were ultimately proven right by history. What happens when bold proclamations don't hold up quite as well, such as George Herbert Walker Bush's insistence he would never, ever raise taxes. And I'll push again and I'll say to them, read my lips. And then there are those bold pronouncements that have yet to be proven out one way or the other. Like President Xi's insistence that his zero COVID policy is the right one for his country. If you just look at the COVID zero protocols, it requires all people returning from abroad to have 10 days of quarantine. But President Putin insisting that he will ultimately still prevail in Ukraine. If he thinks he's losing and may lose his office and even life, then he could become completely unpredictable. But this week, this week we saw something a bit different. Big bold pronouncements being completely reversed, not long after they were made. A big one was, of course, Elon Musk's change of mind again on whether he'd pony up $44 billion for Twitter. We're now hearing that Elon Musk and Twitter, of course, that resolution really said to be sticking on the contingency of getting that debt financing. And that is going to be the key clause that we're focused on going forward. But at least Mr. Moss took a few months for his change of heart. Over in Great Britain, we saw a new government lay out a new budget that included big tax cuts starting with the top tax bracket. We love the tax cutting, but not for this time. This is just absolutely the wrong time to do this. Bringing immediate and violent reaction in the markets. She's trying to get the markets behind those two latter factors, probably significantly more difficult. And the Bank of England stepping in for the rescue. So suddenly, the Bank of England finds itself in the ECB situation. So Prime Minister Truss' newly minted Chancellor of the Checker had to admit publicly that they had been wrong, clearly and dramatically wrong, at least on those top tax rates. And it came only days after he and Prime Minister Truss had gone so big and so bold. I think it was a distraction, and I think it was the wrong thing to do. One can hardly fault a government for listening to its people, even if the listening might have come better before the deciding. But whatever the right answer, the one thing for certain is that, at least in this respect, Mr. Truss is no Margaret Thatcher. For those waiting with baited breaths for that favourite media catchphrase that you turn, I have only one thing to say. You turn if you want to. The ladies not for turning. That does it for this episode of Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. This is Bloomberg. See you next week. We make it very transparent. We make it very lifvollable.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,811,2022-10-08 11:01:31
12586," We make it very transparent to the shopper before they accept an order. What the order is going to look like. How much work on it pays them and how much the consumer is paying them. And so they can decide whether they take an order or whether they refuse it. And that's the kind of flexibility that our shoppers really value and the kind of transparency that they want. Are you seeing a labor shortage right now? What are you doing to combat that? It's different in different places. Our demographic of shoppers is completely different from food delivery and our right sharing, where 70% women and half of them are moms. And that's because a lot of the job at Instacart is very different than just being in a car with strangers. It's about like going to the store, doing a good job of customer service of really picking the right products for the consumer. And we are seeing that being very appealing to women. Hello and welcome to Emma Barnett Meet. And this week I'm meeting the space experts and physicist Professor Brian Cox. And I'm really looking forward to asking him about how he gets his head around the vastness of space and to explain it to all of us or try to anyway. How he also goes about his daily life when he knows how insignificant we really are and what he makes of NASA's new telescope and those amazing images. Welcome to the programme. Thank you so much for coming to talk to me and to all of our viewers. And I actually wanted to start with a new NASA telescope. We'll come to your particular project in a moment. But it's named after the man who ran the agency in the 60s and oversaw the first man mission to the Moon, James Webb. What do you make of what we're seeing so far? Because it's pretty incredible. Yeah, it's a remarkable instrument. I mean, you think of the predecessor, which is the Hubble Space Telescope. I think it's almost impossible to imagine a world without that. Even if you don't know, the images that we're familiar with at the universe, many of them, the spectacular galaxies and star-forming regions, they're from Hubble. But the web is a significant step forward. And technically, one of the most important things is it can see what we call longer wavelength light, or infrared light. And that's important because if you think about, we want to see the first galaxies forming. So we want to understand how the first stars and galaxies formed in the universe. And so what you do is you look far out into the universe and because light travels quite slowly across cosmic distances. Let's say you have a galaxy that's the most distant one you can see with the naked eye, it's about 2 million light years away. So that means that the light has been traveling for 2 million years to reach us. And it's a remarkable thing actually, to think when you look, it's called the Andromeda Galaxy. And if you know where you're looking, you can just catch you out of the corner of your eye. If you think about it, you're seeing that as it was 2 million years ago. Yes, although I don't. Because it takes a light 2 million years to travel. I don't like being late to information, so that makes me feel very out of date. It's remarkable. I mean, it began its journey before we had evolved on Earth. So in its time, it took... And that's the nearest neighboring galaxy. The web looks so far out that it's capturing light that's been traveling for over 13 billion years. But the universe has been expanding. And so the light has been stretching. And so for the most distant galaxies, we're looking back in time, almost to the big bang. The Hubble was not sensitive to that light, so that the web can see the formation of the first galaxies. It's essentially looking all the way back to very close to the beginning of time. And that's very important, because we're not entirely sure exactly how those first galaxies form. The idea of what you just talked about in terms of how much time this has taken and what it's covering, do you think we will ever be able to see the big bang?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,812,2022-10-08 11:06:01
12587," The idea of what you just talked about in terms of how much time this has taken and what it's covering, do you think we will ever be able to see the Big Bang? Well, we almost can. It's not the web telescope. There's something called the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation, which is light that was emitted in the universe. It's a very precise number. It's 380,000 years after the Big Bang, which is not very long at all, right? The universe is 13.8 billion years old. So we can see that. It's microwaves because it's been stretched so much by the expansion of the universe. Going back that the problem with light is that in those earliest times, the universe was so hot and so dense that light couldn't travel through it. So it was opaque. So you can't use light to go back earlier than that. But what we can potentially do, not yet. We're not good enough yet. But the technology we use to now to detect colliding black holes, which is another remarkable thing, but I'll leave that one aside for now. But we have the technology to do that. And that technology possibly could allow us to probe right back to this thing, the Big Bang. And again, whether or not that's the origin of time, we can talk about as well. Brian, you've dedicated your life to explaining the scale of the universe to people. You have a new world tour and show called Horizons. What's the goal? Are you trying to teach people new things and understand the world they're living in better or what are you aiming for? Well, actually, all those things. So it works. I hope on different levels. So I talk about cosmology. We've spoken about what we call the large scale structure of the universe, the galaxies and how they formed, how the universe has evolved since the Big Bang. But also, I've got very interested in my academic work in black holes. And black holes, and they're really vocacy things. I think everyone's heard of these strange things, these totally collapsed stars from which nothing apparently can escape. But in the past few years, past few decades really, beginning work that Stephen Hawking really began back in the 1970s and many others. And we've begun to suspect there's a lot more to them. And they've started forcing us to reassess our understanding of what space and time are. And that's a really weird sentence. You might think, well, space is the arena in which we live in time just ticks. But it really isn't, it looks like, from studying these things, there are building blocks of space and building blocks of time. And what I say in the show is, that's a mind-blowing idea. And I talk about that. But the key point is, is a great quote from Einstein, a beautiful story that Einstein told about when he was a little boy, he was six or seven years old. And his dad gave him a compass. And so he looked at the compass and he saw, well, there's this thing, this needle, and it always points north, points in this direction. So there's something invisible that I can't see that underlies our reality that's making this needle point known. And he said later in life, it was my first encounter with an idea, which is, if you look at nature carefully and really pay attention and you're lucky, you can catch a glimpse of something deeply hidden. Which is a beautiful phrase, something deeply hidden, which is the deep structure of reality. That's what our reality is. And so black holes, they're kind of a metaphor in a way. I talk about them as resettistones in the sky, that they're the things that, by studying them, and you say, why would we study these things? Well, in studying these things, we're beginning to get a deep, a deep picture of what our reality actually is. That's a remarkable idea. But it's a beautiful idea that runs through all of science. How do you define a black hole? Well, it's in Einstein's theory, which again, is a remarkable thing. It's probably in 1915, over 100 years old. But it's just a region of space from which even light can't escape. Bloomberg has enhanced search on the terminal to deliver what you need when you need it.

Alpha Beth Sundart Pichai, Microsoft Sacha Nadella, IBM's Arvind Krishna, Micron Technologies Sanjay Mayhotra, and that's just the start. Add in the chief executives of Adobe, Deloitte, Gap, VMware. And that doesn't count Indians running companies all over the world. Why have so many Indians risen to the top? But no coastal appoints to India's incredibly competitive education system. If you can survive the pressure it takes to get into one of the Indian institutes of technology, it gives you confidence to handle American universities and later the business world. Meanwhile, the belief in India's ability to produce so many tech wizards is reinforced every year. Indians make up about three-fourths of the immigrants receiving coveted H1B visas for the US. And it's a safe bet that some of them will eventually find their way to the seasweet. And by understanding what they are and knowing more about them, what do we then learn? Well, Stephen Hawking back in the 70s published a paper. The initial one was called Black Hole Explosions, which is a great title for a paper. And he calculated, he found out that Black holes in his language, he said, Black holes ain't so black. They glow in the sky, like holes in the sky, and they radiate. And so over time, they lose energy and mass and ultimately disappear of a huge time scales. And that's so important. And I show this picture in the show that if you go into Westminster Abbey and look on the floor of Westminster Abbey on Stephen's memorial stone, then you find his equation for the temperature of a Black hole literally chiseled in stone on the floor of an abbey. So you might say, why? Why is it so important? This was the key. This was this Rosetta Stone idea. In trying to understand what happens to the stuff that fell in. When you thought these things existed forever, which is pre-hawking, then you think, well, it's okay, it gets locked up inside, it can never get out, we don't care. But the thing evaporates away, one day it will be gone. So then suddenly you have to be faced with this question, what happened to everything then? If I throw a book into a Black hole, is it somehow possible in the far future of you collect all this so-called hawking radiation that comes off? Is it possible to reconstruct the information in the book? And that's been a question, simple question that's driven, this tremendous amount of research for 50 years. And it was pretty much sold in 2019, actually, in 2020. Pretty much, I mean, there's still a huge number of questions. But roughly, well, the statement is, everything comes out again, all the information comes out. So everything that fell in, in principle, in the far future you could reconstruct the information of everything that fell in. This is an astonishing idea, because the last thing I'll say is that before that, before the hawking papers and before this modern understanding, inside a Black hole, just according to Einstein, sits the end of time, which is an astonishing thing to say, because we can see them. We have a photograph of one of these things in the center of a galaxy, too, actually, now. And you're looking, when you look at that photograph, you're looking at the end of time in space. So then you think, well, you're looking at the end of time.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,814,2022-10-08 11:14:38
12589," You're looking at the end of time in space. So then you think, well, if things go to the end of time, how does everything get out again? And that's the content of this tremendous work in theoretical physics. This work, studying black holes, which is probably, it's one of those things that a certain kind of person says, is useless, right? He said, why? Who cares? It turns out that the techniques that have been developed and the understanding that's been gained from looking at these things, has got a very strong crossover with building quantum computers, which is the quantum computers are in laboratories now. They have a tremendous potential to revolutionise our civilization, incredibly powerful computing devices. Well, yes, and also that's sometimes the defence given isn't it about what's going into man going back to the moon or woman going back to the moon, that other things are discovered in the pursuit of those missions? Yeah, I mean, it's always a cliche, but it's true. A friend of mine, an astronomer always says, when people criticise these spacecraft and they say, let's say the James Webb Space Telescope, it was what, $6 billion or so. But it's appropriate to point out that nobody put $6 billion in a suitcase and launched it on the rocket. And the $6 billion didn't go into space. It was spent on Earth. And what is often the case, it put inside the glory and wonder of the discoveries that are made, that basically you were paying people to do high tech jobs and do research and build machines that operate at the edge of the possible. And history tells us that that tends to be extremely useful. You're inventing things and trying to do things that are difficult. And that expertise never stays in one place. It then spreads out across our civilization in ways that you can't really predict or even quantify. Indeed. And you did sound very excited early. I mean, you sound excited the whole time about all of this, which is infectious, even if people are trying to keep up, including myself. But when you talk about the golden possibility of there being a life out there and that question of, are we alone? Where are you with that? What do you say to people right now with the latest information? Well, so again, I think there's a cosmology, I say this in the show as well. It's one of the most challenging subjects, because at one level it makes us feel very, very small and insignificant. And it's true, you know, physically. I mean, the Earth is one planet around one star amongst 400 billion stars in one galaxy amongst two trillion galaxies in the part of the universe we can see. So we're definitely small, right? You can't argue that. It's a clarified box. But, but, but, you're right. If you ask the question about life, the answer is we don't know. We've found nothing, nothing alive beyond the Earth. But I've missed it that we haven't been very far or looked tremendously hard, although we are looking hard now on Mars, because we suspect there might have been microbes on Mars, because there was one's water on Mars, and it was geologically active. And all the things that we think led to the origin of life on Earth were present on Mars around the same time, about three and a half to four billion years ago. So we wouldn't be surprised if we find that microbes existed, probably subsurface on Mars, or maybe on some of the moons of Jupiter or Saturn, where there's water today. However, nobody expects anything more complicated than a microbe. And it's interesting. So if you look at the history of life on Earth, you have microbes around 3.8 billion years ago, pretty much not long after the Earth formed in geological time. But if you look for evidence of complex life on Earth, then really there isn't any in the fossil record until about 600 million years ago or so. So on this planet, for most of the history of the planet, there was slime, basically, single-celled things, doing interesting stuff, photosynthesis and things, but nothing more complicated than a single cell. And it's only in the last half of billion years or so, that you get this explosion of life on Earth. And only, as I said, it's only in the last, less than a million years that we've had home sapiens on Earth. And it's only in the last half of the Earth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,815,2022-10-08 11:19:20
12590," so that you get this explosion of life on Earth. And only, as I said, it's only in the last, less than a million years that we've had home sapiens on Earth. And in the last 10 to 1000s of years, we've had a civilization. So here, it took pretty much four billion years to go from cell to civilization. And that's the third of the age of the universe. And so that leads many biologists that I speak to to suggest that whilst microbes might be common, civilizations might be rare. Actually, I asked a friend of mine, great physicist Sean Carroll, how many civilizations do you think there would be in the Milky Way galaxy, a typical galaxy? How many in a typical galaxy? And he said, non. Right, non. And I think he's, I tend to say one. So somewhere between zero and one, probably. But that's a guess. But what do you, do you want me to say? I think it's a good guess. Brian, is that what it is? You sound like perhaps you have an optimism for it. And I wonder what's underpinning that? I would love that to be. And actually, because it worries me, and this is the way that I end my show, actually, it worries me that let's take that position. Let's imagine that in our galaxy, 400 billion Suns, there's just us that thinks. Right, the microbes are over the place. But in terms of things that think and can feel, and in a very real sense, bring meaning to the universe. All these things we've talked about, the beauty of these galaxies, they're not beautiful. If there's nothing there to perceive them, right, they're just galaxies. So if that's it in this galaxy, then the decisions that we make now as a civilization have a galactic implications. If we destroy ourselves, for example, deliberately or through inaction, then it's possible that we eliminate meaning, perhaps forever, in a galaxy of 400 billion stars. And so that's it. I think that leads you to, it's a good work in assumption that we have a tremendous responsibility, in a sense, not to do that. So I would be much more comfortable with our current predicament. If the galaxy was filled with civilizations, then I'd say, well, okay, it would be rather stupid of us to eliminate all this beautiful culture and science and art and music that we build up, but at least there's someone else that's doing that. But I'm not actually sure there is. That sharing on another galaxy is more political, When you think of cutting edge technology at sea, you might be thinking of stuff like this. But there's an incoming revolution on the high seas that isn't quite as sexy but could be significantly more impactful. Transition shipping is the key component of global trade. About 80% and 90% of all the world's goods are transported at sea at some point. But there's a significant unseen cost to the modern era of global commerce. About 3% of all the world's CO2 emissions come from shipping. 3% may not sound like a lot, but that's roughly comparable to the entire CO2 output of Germany. This reducing trade isn't a likely option. What about a technological improvement? To help reduce the emissions from these well stock maritime behemoths? How comfortable are you with space tourism and the pursuit of that knowledge and meaning? Being largely to a very small group of rich men? You're right. The idea that technology is used. If all it was useful, it was to send a few very rich people into space on a joyride.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,816,2022-10-08 11:23:26
12591," The idea that the technology is used, if all it was useful, if it was to send a few very, very rich people into space on a joyride, then there will be a real criticism there. But that's not all the technology is useful. So I think it's important to understand that the space industry is about operating initially in near-earth orbits. And we've already industrialized that. We all use it every day. I mean, we all switch on our sat nav in the car, satellite navigation. It requires infrastructure in orbit. A lot of the stuff we know about climate change, resource use, and so on. That's coming from satellites. So I think you have to look at the space industry as a whole, really, and then say, well, it's not just about... The same argument was made for intercontinental travel by aircraft. And when the first... It's true. When the first aircraft were built, it was extremely expensive in the preserve of the rich. But of course, within a few decades, it had democratized travel. And we all take advantage of that every day. So I think that's the right way to look at space. It's not to focus on particular bits of it that we might not like for moral reasons or whatever it is. So it's actually... I really do advocate for the facts of looking at the whole industry, which is tremendously important now. It is. I mean, I am interested, though, that you did say, and correct me if I'm wrong, that all political leaders should go to space, perhaps for some perspective. And I did say that. Most of them should come back. Most of them. They're the last part of that quote. Yeah, it was... It was based on an idea, which is a very famous idea called the overview effect, which is well known. The astronauts change their view of the... Always, as far as I'm aware, anyway, when they come back, they have a more positive view of the value of this planet, and are very much more focused on preserving it as a beautiful place, perhaps a unique place in a galaxy, as I said. So I felt that... And I do feel that having had the good fortune of speaking to many astronauts, that their experience... the people who make the decisions, the big decisions of our future, could have their experience. I think it would be good investments. It's extremely hard arguments to make. We should actually spend money allowing, you know, in our case at the moment, in our Prime Minister, right? So in the UK, you'd say, well, we just spend money sending Boris Johnson into space and bringing him back safely to Earth again, because it would change his view. No, I don't think I win that argument. But I think there's a serious point there, which is that it does seem to change people for the better when they see our Earth as it really is, which is a fragile thing against the blackness of space. So I think it's an argument that I would try to make. I would lose it, because it's very expensive. Do you want to go? Are you willing to go? I would love to, because as I said, I'd love to share that experience of seeing our world from space. I think it's really unarguably. It appears to be a life-changing experience, and it seems to change individuals for the better. You won't be scared. Well, I don't know. I mean, I remember one of my great heroes, John Young, who flew on the Apollo missions, walked on the moon, test flew the first space shuttle, and he said that anyone who sits on top of however many thousands of tons of liquid hydrogen, helium, liquid hydrogen oxygen, and isn't a bit worried, doesn't understand the problem. So he's probably right. Do you have people come and talk to you about faith? Do they talk to you about how religion and that side of life fits into your level of knowledge? Because I know you've travelled around the world talking to people. Yeah, a lot. It comes up as a question. Because cosmology is the, it's a science of origins. And actually with the study of black holes, I mentioned...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,817,2022-10-08 11:27:52
12592," There's a question, because cosmology is the, it's a science of origins. And actually with the study of black holes, I mentioned, we're even beginning now to think about what's face and time are. So naturally, I say it in the show actually, I say when we're talking about this, it's the moment of creation. So we're asking, was there a moment of creation? And that's the correct language to use, I think. Or it's the evocative language, but it's really what we're talking about. Did everything come into being or has it always been here? We actually don't even know the answer to that question really. And so yeah, I can ask you a lot, because I think cosmology is a challenging science that challenges us to think about these things. We often associate that with theology or philosophy. And I think that's a good thing, because something I very strongly believe in is that segmenting or making little canisters and putting different bits of human experience or different music and art and theology and philosophy and science and segmenting them all is just the wrong way to look at it. What we're doing is a deep level trying to understand what it means to be human in this tremendous potentially infinite universe. And so I, those questions get asked. And ultimately, I say, I'm quite straightforward. I say, I don't, I'm not a religious person myself. But the correct thing to say, even about the question, did the universe have a beginning in time, is we don't know. We don't know. And that's it.

12593," Um, it's an indulgence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s, and so it makes that a really exciting field, because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happened there can be harnessed to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts, but if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what you bring figures out while you're sleeping. Welcome everybody to the inaugural NIL Summit and NIL Awards. In July 2022, Atlanta hosted what might sound like a boring legal seminar, a conference on the new rules around name, image, and likeness in sports. But far from dry and academic, the first annual NIL Summit was in fact a flashy star-studded event put on at the College Football Hall of Fame. And Mingling amid the biggest current and former names in sports and media, there was a crucial cohort. The player is poised to redefine what it means to be a modern college athlete. And the winner of male athlete of the year goes to Chase Griffin. Among those up-and-comers, UCLA's Chase Griffin. The UCLA quarterback is among the students becoming as well known for making deals as making plays. And even in that group, Chase stands out. My name is Chase Griffin. What's up everyone? It's Chase Griffin. It's your favorite quarterbacks, favorite quarterback, Chase Griffin. When you look at it as an empowerment equity opportunity, it's really been unmatched in the sports world for any point in time since Title IX. After hardly a full year of name, image, and likeness deals being a reality, he already has more than 20 deals with major brands, venture, and charitable groups. All the while balancing graduating undergrad in just two years and fighting for playing time on the field. Chase Griffin out of the gun. We are joined by UCLA quarterback Chase Griffin, not just UCLA quarterback, but name image likeness superstar. I am sacked for this one. This kid could actually be the president of the United States someday. Chase isn't the starting quarterback for UCLA. He's not even the backup quarterback. But back on campus in LA, his nickname is President Chase. And after spending a couple days talking about his approach to business, sports, and equality, it's not shocking to think he might someday hold that office. His level of focus and maturity at the stage, I only wish I had. When it comes to building generational wealth, it's not about the money that you make in college. I'm very excited that I made the amount of money that I made last year. I am even 10 times more excited that I know how to make that money. Summer on any college campuses, mostly for the athletes, who are on lighter, but still regimented schedules. Attending classes working out, a little bit of hanging out, and then more working out on their own time. Chase is no exception. The 21 year old is a backup, albeit an impatient one. In the topsy-turvy past couple of seasons, dotted with families, games, and COVID protocols, he's been able to start three games for the brilliance. Griffin, gonna throw to the end zone. Wide open again, touchdown, UCLA. Eating Arizona and narrowly losing to both Stanford and Oregon. That was inches away from Chase Griffin and UCLA being in full pledge comeback mode.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,819,2022-10-08 11:36:15
12594," narrowly losing to both Stanford and Oregon. That was inches away from Chase Griffin and UCLA being in cold fledged comeback mode. For Chase, UCLA felt like destiny. He was born just a few miles away before his family moved to Texas when he was a toddler. But beyond being a sort of homecoming, the school's history of athlete activism was a massive draw. I always expected from myself to have some sort of impact that was beneficial for more people than I interact with on a daily basis. And choosing UCLA, a lot of that went into me seeing myself as someone who reflected the same want to make things better, that so many of the people that UCLA prides itself upon being the home for have done in the past. The legacies of former UCLA greats like Arthur Asch, Jackie Robinson, Karim Abdul Jbar, and Jackie Joyner Kursi have had a wide ranging impact on society well beyond the Westwood campus. Chase reveres these people, but he's perhaps most keenly aware of the activism of a more recent ruin alum, the basketball player at Obanon. At Obanon, who was an ace-meth player of the year National champ, UCLA Sports Legend is also a legal hero. I think NIO could be the next installment where we look back in 30, 40, 50 years and God willing, if we give him the roses, he deserves. We add an Oman into that list of UCLA greats. Obanon, who played at UCLA from 91 to 95, initiated a lawsuit that's widely credited for finally opening up the possibility of college athletes being paid for use of their name, image, and likeness. He sued the NCAA in video game publisher EA for anti-trust violations, arguing that athletes should be entitled to financial compensation when schools used their likeness for game. In 2014, a judge ruled in his favor. I don't think he was congratulating. What was your call? And then, on an episode of the shop, surrounded by Obanon, Diana Tarrassi, and LeBron James, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed the first ultimately successful legislation to allow athletes to receive endorsement deals. The fair pay to play act led other states to follow suit and ultimately led the NCAA in 2021 to relent, seemingly reluctantly. NIL payments were officially allowed as of July 1, 2021. Today is the last day where name, image, and likeness laws will not be on the books. And kids will not be, if you will, not allowed to make money off of their name, image, and likeness. Making money from Jersey sales and endorsement deals is a way for players to share in the massively lucrative world of college athletics. This NIL thing is the wild, wild west. The NIL change felt like many things that happened very slowly and then it happened very fast. And I wonder for you, having contemplated that maybe this was coming at some point, how prepared were you, what was your mindset when the switch flipped? Right. I mean, I still think everyone's trying to get prepared for the industry. It's still sort of like a wild, wild west. I wasn't really expecting anything. I was more just thinking about honestly getting ready for that season and capitalizing on everything that was happening. When NIL hit, and it turned out I had action, I was like, oh, OK, well, after this degree deal, which was fantastic, I was like, OK, I see how I can be a staple in this game, and I see how I can get better over time. That's why I teamed up with my friends at Shell. And then Shell deal hit, and then boost my whole deal hit. And then you keep on building clear cover. You keep on building, and you get better in the meetings. And most of all, you start seeing where your value can be best placed in these new opportunities. The headlines and storylines in the aftermath of the NIL change introduced visions of instant millionaire strolling campuses across the nation. You might.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,820,2022-10-08 11:40:49
12595," The headlines and storylines in the aftermath of the NIL change introduced visions of instant millionaire strolling campuses across the nation. You might think the NIL athlete of the year lives in Splendor, or at least in one of those athletic palaces that put most of our coach dorms to shame. Well, it's all relative to chase. All right Jason, so. So here we are, World Headquarters. Yep. This is where it all happens. The kitchen right here actually really enjoyed cooking. Oh yeah. Yeah, this gas oven gets really hot really fast. I make pizzas in there. This is the best appliance since the iPhone. But if I already put anything in there, I need to do these dishes right here. So no trappings of success yet, more a pretty average college dorm room. The fridge filled with leftovers, a well-used PS4 and of course, the requisite Godfather poster. It's a far cry from the lifestyle seen in some local news reports for NIL athletes during this first year. These are Robinson made headlines with an NIL deal with Lamborghini Austin. Lamborghini's tend to make more headlines than Muhammad Ali are Bruce Lee pictures. Some athletes are living in mansions driving Lamborghinis. As far as I know, you're doing either of those things. I see where you're living right here. It is with all the respect not a mansion. How much of that is a conscious choice and what does it say about your approach to this? Right. I mean, first off, I look at this. It's my own room. I got everything I need. I'm cool with that. I'm cool with living below my means. I think it's important to remember that the volume of financial gain is completely overstated. That's what it y'all is for in the media. And someone hears about a 5 million or 10 million dollar deal. You've got to report it. Like, oh my goodness, people are going to read this. They, I count two things. How many kids are even getting these deals? And then for the kids that do get it, how much of that is in liquor cash? How much of it is in assets? If you pay for a $2 million house out here in LA for a kid to stay in the college, that's great. But as soon as they're graduated, they're not going to have that $2 million house. I say the same thing, you know, for the kids who are driving around in Lamborghinis and stuff like that. That's awesome. Like, that's super dope. And I know some of those kids. But, you know, someone paying for your lease is different than someone actually giving you the value of that lease every single month. You're investing in it, saving it for a 1K, etc. I say all that just to mention that product deals and stuff like that are overhyped by the media. And they also can land kids in some trouble if they're not paying taxes on it. That's one of the distinctly unsexy and easy to overlook elements of the new rules. Even if an athlete's not getting cold hard cash from a deal, so suddenly what a player sees as free gear in return for some social media posts actually equals taxable income. And that requires the same forms you'd fill out as an independent contractor getting a check. I made a fair amount in NIO deals and I invested all of it. In my opinion, NIO is great. Doing all this is great. Making money now is great. But the most valuable thing I've gotten from all of this is, in fact, I'll always know how to make money off of myself. All told, Chase has done more than 20 deals with major brands like Degree, Shell, and Boost Mobile, along with venture-stage companies including Discord, Duffel, and Creative Juice. He's also made a point to work with charities like the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, where he's already raised funds for almost 60,000 meals. Back in 1997, I was interested in the following question, which is there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called Sorapod dinosaurs, which had really long skinny necks. So Apodosaurus is an example. Now, it's had really long skinny tails. So I made a computer model that showed that in fact the tail of these Sorapod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip, a bullfip. Now, the way a bullfip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. Well done, sized screws. I was thinking since a while over, they'veутствed and not fully understood the sound compression spec. We're all in context.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,821,2022-10-08 11:45:39
12596," The way a bull whip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. Okay. And that crack is a sonic boom. Yep. I think the way they got a date was to impress the females by making loud booms. Markets are preparing to close, but the day is not over yet. It's talked about about 45%. A lot of volatility, right?

Weekdays at 5 p.m. in New York and 2 p.m. in San Francisco. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. Let's just be honest. We've had sort of a shift in, are we in some sort of circulation fears? Moment, people were talking about that all day, yesterday. This is a song by Julian. I heard the opening. I like it. I just took that opening, and I pitched it slow, or I think I sped it. At his desk when he's not making music, another side project, he's either networking with CEOs or investors he seeks out or who seek him out, or negotiating new deals. Hey, Mallory. I'm sure he's how you doing. I'm doing well. I'm turning on my camera right now. You're no worries. This is an average NIL deal, a brand approaches an athlete who can help spread their message to a demographic they believe the athlete can help reach. In this case, direct TV is looking to market their NFL Sunday ticket to college students. If he two posts, one post late August, and one post on the first week of September, and the compensation would be 1200 per post, so it would be 400 total. Right. Are they video posts, or are they picking captions? They can be either. It's up to you guys. That was pretty good. 400 above, but they had originally S. So that's a win. So yeah, I mean, at this point, after I do a Zoom or something like that, I get to chill out, go back to land down if I was watching a movie or something, or go to YouTube, just start looking for more samples. This is presidential change. It's a pretty simple interaction for Chase and for direct TV, negotiated over a couple of emails and Zoom calls, and papered with a contract Chase will have his dad look over before he signs. And Chase, who's made himself as much of a student of the new NIL marketplace as he has a public policy at UCLA, says he understands why it's working. A brand ambassador with an athlete is more attractive to these brands now as well as a terminal investment than even a post by a famous actor. If there's any place to learn.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,822,2022-10-08 11:49:25
12597," Now as far as the terminal investment, then even a post by a famous actor. If there's any place to learn that sports are deep in the hearts of Americans, it's on a high school football field in Texas. Friday night lights in the Lone Star State might be the great iron equivalent of Frank Sinatra's New York City, making it there means you're something special. Chase Griffin quarterback class 19, Hato Texas. And Chase didn't just make it, he excelled. Let's talk about some of the top quarterbacks in the state and when you look at that list at the top of it, you got to talk about Chase Griffin. I was lucky to play three years as a quarterback for Hato High School, which is a one horse town. We have great success. And so the town really shut down and came out and supported us every Friday night. Chase one word to describe that finish that game. God, that's it. Coming from a town like that where football is so prioritized, it has its pros and cons, but I think on the pros side, I learned how to win, how to get better and most importantly, what it's like to build a team where everyone gets better. Emulating his UCLA alumni like Robinson, Joyner Cursey and Abdelger Barr, Chase is looking at the impact NIL will have not just for him, but the athletes that will follow. When the predecessors who have come before you have changed the world and made life better for everyone today, you can't help but ask yourself how the actions that you're taking now and the companies and brands and the NIL space that you work with are all cumulatively building something greater than any of us could foresee. I've actually I've never moderated so this will be my first time. It should be fun. I know my hand right is terrible. The last day the conference chase was asked to co-moderate a panel with Monique Nelson, the CEO for Univ world group. All right, I'm excited to be here. Univ world group is one of the longest standing multicultural advertising and marketing agencies in the United States. The firm works with brands like Ford, Home Depot, and Johnson and Johnson to help reach the black and brown communities. And they have big ambitions in NIL. For Univ world group the idea of this was pretty epic in that because we serve the undervalued overlooked and the underserved, we knew that this particular group of people would fall into that category. And we plan on being the premier practice for NIL athletes that are looking to do purpose-driven media advertising, community level engagement work. UWG launched a program called The NIL to help black student athletes partner with major brands. But to help them understand how to do that they brought on chase to serve as a student athlete executive in residence. For me I do nothing without tremendous amounts of data for all of our clients. I really wanted to be thoughtful about this practice being very athlete-centric. If I were to build it or anyone on my team were to build it it would not have the athlete at the core. When you're 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, the best way to have credibility is confidence and the only way for confidence to be authentic. I'm actually learning on the job. I'm learning about the brand side of NIL but I'm also trying to make sure that empowerment equity is built in especially for black student athletes in the NIL world. ROI, return on investment. Both chase and UWG see NIL deals as something much more than making money for students. It's also a potential investment in a community long overlooked.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,823,2022-10-08 11:53:32
12598," It's also a potential investment in a community long overlooked. I think we're getting ready to stop boxes, trying to feed the people of LA. A piece of each of Chase's NIL deals go to his belief brand campaign, which has raised more than $13,000 for meals for the LA Food Bank backpack program. But athletes giving back is only one side. I'm here with legal zoom to give you five tips on the NIL game plan. UWG and Chase believe having brands investing in the athletes, especially athletes of color, can be a force multiplier for these historically marginalized communities. When you look at the revenue, JIT and rating sports for the ball and basketball, 88% of those athletes are black. So when you're doing stuff to empower student athletes in the NIL space, you're also helping to deliver on your promise. Now student athletes are not the only ones who should receive this help by any means. But statistically, by doing that, you're going to be delivering on your mission. Additionally, student athletes on average come from lower levels of income. So you're also delivering on that promise. And a lot of these student athletes are first generation, their first gen college students. Some of them first gen high school diploma. Some of them first time receiving the amount of money that they receive in their families. This has been a wild first year in NIL. We all knew that there would be bags of cash around, right? There's always been bags of cash. There's cash everywhere. What we know is that that's not sustainable. We know that athletics has an expiration date on it. So for us, inclusion ultimately means this is just a part of you. It is a tremendous part of you and we're going to celebrate that part of you. But we also know that you're bigger than that. So we want to empower you to live past your expiration date for this part of your life. And quite honestly, have equity in everything that you have poured yourself into as an NIL athlete. It may still be the Wild West days for the NIL industry. But in the first year, about a billion dollars in business was done with NCAA athletes. With the early leaders in the NIL space like Chase, they are striking a precedent for athletes that follow them. And that's important because collegiate athletes don't have that much time to profit. Only an estimated 2% of NCAA athletes go on to the pros. Even the hardest working are often limited by things they can't control. For Chase, it's been his height. I'm 5'10 now in high school after my sophomore year went out through for 3,000 yards. I was probably like 5'6"", 5'5"". I mean, I could arguably say I'm one of the best in the history of Texas high school football. But I've gone through the height test where they'll call you out of class, shake your hand, look at you up and down. And be like, nice to meet you. You go back to class. It's a sad but timeless story for student athletes. And for Chase, his story is something he's not shyed away from, but embraced when it comes to his NIL deals. I'm frequently the smallest person on the football field, but I always strive to be the most impactful. My middle school coach taught me that I would never play in high school. Chase's deals with degrees breaking limits team and clear covers inspired underdogs allowed him to capitalize financially from football. Even the last season, he never saw the field for UCLA. I play football because I love the game. I play the football because I'm a good competitor. I love to compete and I play football because I'm good at it. At the end of the day, I don't play football for my livelihood, which is important to remember when it comes down to identity. I myself changed Griffin as long as I'm that. I got something in this world. As he moves into the new season and focuses more on football than business, Chase doesn't see much of a differentiation between the two in terms of his mindset. I wouldn't be surprised if I wasn't playing football in five years and it was running in Fortune 500 company, but I also wouldn't be surprised if I was winning a Superbowl 510 years from now.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,824,2022-10-08 11:58:06
12599," I wasn't playing football in five years and was running an unfortunate 500 company, but I also want to be surprised if I was winning a Super Bowl of five-ten years from now. And either way, I'm going to keep on working at the tools that would align myself and my future with both. At the end of the day, you're always going to have yourself. If you can make profit off of yourself and know where you add value, in any world you're in, you'll be able to adapt and find ways to generate wealth for yourself. Music Music Music Part of what I love about business is you get to build things from nothing. I don't have any investors. All this is all money in. This is me just building it. It's pretty much full service shadow banking with nobody in charge. Music Music When the price of anything goes up, the consequences reach far beyond what you'd expect. But perhaps most of all, when it comes to food. In 2010, surging food prices helped spark the Arab Spring. Lives were lost, regimes fell and the consequences are still with us. Once again, food prices are rising and fast. Energy costs, broken supply chains and surging demand were just some of the factors that have driven food prices to their first record high since the Arab Spring. And that's all before a war between two of the world's biggest food producers. Ukraine is called the Bread Basket of Europe and taken with Russia the two account for about a quarter of global wheat trade. They produce more than half of the world's sunflower seeds in oil, nearly 20% of the barley. Now throwing rising energy prices and processing, transporting, even refrigerating food gets more expensive. Plus, fertilizer production is extremely energy intensive. Less fertilizer means lower crop yield and prices rise even more. The pandemic revealed how complicated and fragile global trade systems are. Global agriculture, perhaps even more so. Unlike metals, for example, food goes bad. And crops take months to grow and are vulnerable to unpredictabilities like the weather. Rising food prices will be felt everywhere, but the poorest countries in the world will be hit the hardest. And as all these factors compound, the real fear is that record high will lead to record high and ultimately to a global food crisis with vast consequence.

So it was funny when I started growing up playing video games. Most of it was going to the arcades. Now most people won't remember these days of like going to a store where you put quarters and play. Robatron was one of my favorites in the arcades. I would go play that. And then probably more in the 70s and the 80s. I remember my dad bringing a video game, the Atari 2600 with the cartridges home. And that was kind of the beginning of it. And it just kept playing. And it's still with me. You started out at Microsoft as an intern. I did. In 1988. How would you compare Microsoft's history on games under Bill Gates versus Steve Balmer versus Sachin Adela? Yeah, I think like many things at Microsoft back in the 80s, we started in video games as much out of kind of a defensive. We were worried that other companies might be putting the home PC in place. And the avenue to get there was through video games and game consoles. So we said, okay, we're going to go start our own game console because if anybody is going to build a computer for the home, we wanted it to be Microsoft. I think through Steve's years, it was more about growing the business and how do we bring kind of business leadership into this group of Ragtag people who are out there just having fun building video games as part of Xbox. I think with Satya, when I first took this job, and I got this job as head of Xbox, about two months after Satya, Adela became the CEO of Microsoft. Well, and when Satya started, there were activist investors targeting the company. Yeah. If the stock hadn't been doing well, they were targeting Xbox. Absolutely. Yeah. At the time, absolutely right, that there was a question of why are we in video games? In fact, one of his first questions to me was because he had come from the cloud part of the business being in the cloud, was he didn't actually understand why we're in video games. Not as a negative, just as literally, why is Microsoft at the time what $1 trillion market cap company? Why are we in the video game business? He challenged us. Let's go figure out why we're in the video game space and see if it makes sense. If it does, let's be all in. If it doesn't, we'd make other decisions. Early in that journey is when...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,826,2022-10-08 12:06:52
12601," I were in the video game space and see if it makes sense. And if it does, let's be all in. And if it doesn't, we'd make other decisions. Early in that journey is when this game, which I know you know about, is Minecraft. And the opportunity to acquire Minecraft came about like months after this moment. So I might have a kid or two that plays Minecraft, yes. And it really caused us as a team to think about, okay, if you're going to go spend $2.5 billion on this blocky Java-based game, how does this fit into the mission of this company? Let's talk about that strategy. Was the idea to tie gaming to the cloud? Was that the clincher? If you think about a game like Minecraft or Fortnite or Roblox, these are games that play on iPads, they play on Xboxes, PlayStation's, PC's. The games were going from per device to per user. And Cloud would be an enabler for that. But we didn't start with how do we fit Cloud into video games. We were just kind of watching the trends of creators and where they were building. And saw this transformation of games being ubiquitous. How does this all, as you see it, connect to Microsoft's future? The cool thing I see going on now, and it does fit with the investments Microsoft's making in Azure and other places, is today the world, anybody's a creator. And video games are going through that same transformation, where if I rewind to my childhood and playing video games, I walked into an egghead software, and there was a line of boxes. We might go create the best game in the world, but there was no way for us to get it in front of an actual person who might want to go play, because we couldn't get shelf space, all these things. Today, we see gamers on our creators on our platform from all over the globe, who can create a game that can literally reach billions of people through our distribution capability to a player a game is a game. And you can deliver that game through the cloud to anybody who has a device that's capable of reaching the internet. I hear you're still an avid gamer. How often do you play games? Like how many hours? I go to bed early, so I go to bed at 10, at Seattle at 10 o'clock. People who play with me online, they tease me about how militant I am at 10 o'clock. I'm out. I probably play 15 hours a week. As I understand it, you do your own deals. You don't necessarily need permission from Sasha to do a deal. Is that true? No, there's definitely, it depends on the amount of the money and the deal. But when we think about some of our bigger deals, we go to the board. And so, Satin Adela, Amy Hood, the CFO, have been incredibly supportive. As Xbox, we're one of the biggest consumer businesses in the company. We're a brand that makes Microsoft relevant to a whole generation that probably doesn't think about a lot of other Microsoft products in their day to day light. Activision specifically is facing a lot of challenges here. There have been lawsuits, there have been employee walkouts. How much did that concern you when you're thinking about this deal? Access the financial world on demand. Here from leading economists, policy makers, and industry experts, be alive and on demand webinars, only from Bloomberg. Start exploring to see what's moving the markets. Visit bloomberg.com webinars. It is crucially important. And I think we've moved from this attitude, from its indulgence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s. And so it makes that a really exciting field, because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harnessed to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts. But if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what you bring to use out while you're sleeping.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,827,2022-10-08 12:11:16
12602," Use out while you're sleeping. Well, in the process of a potentially monster deal, $70 billion acquisition of Activision, talked to us about how this deal came together. When we were thinking about on that idea of what are we capable of doing today And where do we need to go? The biggest gaming platform on the planet is mobile phones. One and a half billion people play on mobile phones. And I guess, regretfully, as Microsoft, it's not a place where we have a native platform. As gaming coming from console and PC, we don't have a lot of creative capability that has built hit mobile games. One thing about the video game space is, if you've been around maybe too long, you know most of the creators out there. So you kind of know teams that could be a good fit in terms of what we were trying to do. But we really started the discussions internally at least on Activision Blizzard around the capability they had on mobile and then PC with Blizzard. Those are the two things that we're really driving our interest. Big Tech is under a lot of regulatory scrutiny. Big Tech deals our under scrutiny, what's the status of the deal? What are your conversations with regulators been like? I kind of come at this that big deals should be scrutinized. I think that's the role of regulators why they're in place. I feel good about the progress that we've been making, asking good hard questions about, okay, what is our intent? What does this mean? If you play it out over five years, is this constricting a market? I feel good about it. Microsoft had its time in the Antitrust spotlight. Now the spotlight's on Google and Mada and Apple and Amazon. How is it that Microsoft has skirted the spotlight? Your competitors might say it's unfair. Well, I think your point about us having grown through that time. I might call that the adolescent years for us as we were kind of learning. I think it's an important consideration that we did learn a lot as a company through that time and what it meant. And I think that sticks with us today. You've been a really big advocate of cross-platform play and this idea that gamer should be allowed to play whatever games they want on whatever platform they want. Why is that so important to you? Maybe you happen in your household to buy an Xbox and I buy a PlayStation and our kids want to play together and they can't because we bought the wrong piece of plastic to plug into our television. It's just seems that these artificial constraints that the industry might put up for near-term kind of business dynamics in the long run. If you take a business that is at three billion people growing to four billion people over the next decade and saying, how do we continue to grow this business? Reducing friction for our customers has, as an industry, has to be at the top. So how far does this go? Does this mean that Activision games that call of duty you'll be able to play on any platform and perpetuity? I don't know what that means and forever. Like when you think about how long and it's not for any kind of nefarious business reason, it's just like what do we even platforms mean 10 years ago? Like I think the definition of some of these things might change over time. But our expectation is we want more people to play. So I know you're working with Sony on some things for the benefit of gamers. Can you talk to us about that a little bit? We have a pretty big publishing footprint on PlayStation as well as Nintendo, which means we have good relationships with those platforms because we're they're a big part of our business and we're a big part of their business. I think our long-term ambition of where we see this industry growing is also shared. I think the area where things get stuck a little bit, it's in the kind of near mid-term competition. If somebody walks into a store and they have $500 bill, they're either going to walk out with a switch, which is what most people buy. Or they're going to walk out with a PlayStation 5 or they're going to walk out with an Xbox or maybe somebody will go buy a Windows PC. But in that world of somebody's got to make a decision for one platform over another in the beginning, that is where I think we get stuck in some of the kind of near-term competition. I don't think that's bad. It's just the dynamic of each of us pushing each other to build the best product for our customers. Now, while you've been working to make the gaming industry more collaborative, the gaming industry has his story.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,828,2022-10-08 12:15:51
12603," It's just the dynamic of each of us pushing each other to build the best product for our customers. Now, while you've been working to make the gaming industry more collaborative, the gaming industry has historically been tough for women, for diverse voices. When you look back on gamer gate, do you think you did enough? I can always look back at any incident for me and think about things that in hindsight I should have done more, I should have done better. I'm proud of how our team evolves, how our leadership team evolves. Now, there's societal issues around us. The gaming industry is not immune to those. People in my position sitting here as kind of old white guys, head of gaming platforms, not in a more than norm than I should be. And I talk about 3 billion people who play video games. And if you say your audience is 3 billion people, the demographic is the planet's demographic. I want our team to reflect the customer that we aspire to earn. I know that our teams ship their culture with every product they ship. Well, Activision specifically is facing a lot of challenges here. There have been lawsuits, there have been employee walkouts, there have been accusations of sexual harassment, sexual assault. How much did that concern you when you were thinking about this deal? We had access to data from the company before we announced the acquisition to see what the actual numbers were in terms of reports. We definitely as a team signed up to say, just like we're on our own journey with Xbox, that we're going to expand that journey if this deal closes. It's a lot of people and a lot of people that will feel very dedicated to and committed to building a great workplace environment for them. That's true of any of our studios, right? But it's obviously a conversation that you're going to have. You think about the board of Microsoft. And when they're thinking about the deal and they're typing into their search engine, Activision, what are the headlines that they're coming back? And there were questions that we had. We've learned from this. We will continue to learn. And we're committed to that journey, not only for the betterment of our teams, but our customers, the creators on our platform. We think it's critical to our business success that we make progress here. Is Bobby Codic going to stay on? Yeah, I'm not in a position to make comments about their leadership team. We're in the regulatory phase and how that will close. When the deal closes, then we have say in how they're managed and how it goes. But until that point, I'm not really in position to say. There have been very specific allegations of Bobby being aware of things. That happened and not reporting it to the board. What has he communicated to you about what he knew, what he didn't know? The discussions we've had were about the teams where they're at. Can they make the progress they need to make? Because the closing is a long process. Are they putting in the work that they need to put in to move along their journey? And I believe they're committed to that. When I look at the work that they're doing now, there's always more that can be done. Activision has divisions that are unionizing. I don't know, Microsoft has said they'll recognize those unions. What does that look like? I've never run an organization that has unions in it. But what I can say in working through this is we recognize workers needs to feel safe and heard and compensated fairly in order to do great work. So we thought it was important to make a public statement on that front for workers that are there that are making decisions about their employment and what that relationship looks like to understand what it would mean if Microsoft was able to close the deal. When I think about the environment on any of our teams, I build from a perspective of people, of building a workplace where people feel like they can do their best work in a sustainable way and they could see this as a long-term career for themselves. So if Xbox employees decided to unionize with Microsoft support that? We knew we made the public statement that it wasn't that it would have a broader impact than just the impact at what would potentially happen on the close of Activision Blizzard.

12604," You will put a woman on Mars. You will bring forth global cooling. You will be the first Chief Crypto Officer. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer, disrupt. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. So let's talk about some of the broader trends. You and I talked a lot during the pandemic, gameplay surge. During the pandemic, we were all stuck at home. Has that changed? It has changed. We've seen gameplay hours come down a bit, which I will say I think is a good thing. People should get outside, people should moderate. Long-term growth trajectory for the business is incredibly durable and strong. You have adults now that have grown up playing like myself. And it's become a more normal part of how people entertain and how families spend time. Economy has tightened for consumers as gas prices are higher. People are worried about what their home economic situation looks like. We're seeing gameplay hours kind of stay strong. I think from a value perspective, gaming's a good value for people at a time of kind of economic constriction. If people bought Minecraft, they can continue to go play Minecraft. What about supply chain? What challenges are you still seeing? Are all the consoles that you want to have made in time for the holidays going to be here? I still think demand will outstrip supply for us this holiday. We will see when we get into 2023. You'll start to see more that supply is catching up with demand. And maybe actually see one in the store when you walk in. And what's the future of the console? I mean, our console is going to be around in 10 years. If even Microsoft is sort of de-emphasizing. I equate in my head gaming on console to gaming on a television. But absolutely, people are playing on more screens. And I think for us as a platform, if we don't adopt that as part of our strategy, we're kind of pushing against what our customers are asking for. We talked a bit about kids earlier. And, you know, as a mom, I'm always slightly terrified that my kids are playing too much. Video games are ruining their brains. They're going to be exposed to all this bad stuff. That's all the positive things. You're a very pro game for kids. And I wonder how do you support that? As a parent, you know what's best for your kid first. Like, I'm not going to say what's best for any individual's kids. What we can say, and the research backs this up, that gaming can be a great on-ramp for kids into STEM education, as they think about, well, how are these games built? I also think the community power of gaming is something that doesn't get talked about enough. Last night, I was playing Escape Room on Xbox with one of my friends. And while the conversation might start about how are we going to escape from this room, then we're talking about his daughter who's looking at colleges. And we just talk about life, like people will when they're in the same place. And I think that ability for gaming, whether it's with kids or adults, to bring people from different backgrounds, different geographies, different socioeconomic, different religion, different genders together, and shared experiences, is pretty unique out there. And I think building those connections that video games can enable, maybe this is too altruistic, but there aren't enough of those things in the world today. Which brings me to the metaverse. You know, obviously, Sasha came on my show. I hope that this is the next big thing that happens after the mobile internet. Facebook changed its name, to meta. Some gamers don't even want this whole metaverse thing. My view on metaverse is gamers have been in the metaverse.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,830,2022-10-08 12:24:03
12605," Facebook changed its name, to meta. Some gamers don't even want this whole metaverse thing. My view on metaverse is gamers have been in the metaverse for 30 years. When you're playing games, if you're playing a world of warcraft game, you're playing in road blocks. You're playing in a racing game where everybody's in a shared world. These 3D shared worlds that gamers have been playing in for years and years, I think what we found is there's more connection as I was talking about before, because we have shared purpose. It's not at all surprising to me that gamers might look at metaverse and think, well, I don't really get it, because we've already have an avatar of myself, and I can already go into a shared world, and I can already sit there and have voice conversations with people anywhere. But I do think the skills that we have as game designers and game creators make a ton of sense in a lot of enterprise experiences, and this is why Satti gets excited about it. What about crypto? Play to earn is all the rage right now. Play to earn specifically is something I'm cautious about. It creates a worker force out of players for certain players to kind of monetize. Now, to be fair for us in the game industry, this has existed for years and years. There have been gold farmers of people who literally just spend their time doing some menial task in a game to accrue some currency that they could sell to some other rich player and for real money so that that person doesn't have to spend their time. But now you find games that are starting to build that into the economy of the game itself. We made some comments in Minecraft about how we view NFTs in this space, because we saw people doing things that we thought were exploitive in our product, and we said we don't want that. I think sometimes it's hammer looking for a nail when these technologies come up. But the actual human use or player use, in our case of these technologies, I think there could be some interesting things. So let's talk about your priorities looking forward. You're in the middle of trying to do this really big deal. Are we going to see you keep doing deals? Are you still on the look out for new studios or new geographic locations where you want to build out Microsoft's gaming presence? Definitely on the second part, geographic expansion is critically important. We've hired our first people in Nigeria now as part of our team. We have teams in India, teams in South America. Again, when I talk about 3 billion gamers, I'll just use Africa for a second. Like 1.2 billion people in the continent. Average age is what, 20 or 21. I think it's very, very likely that the next big hit games that we're going to see are not from the traditional locations, not from the traditional people. And I think that's fantastic. So geographic expansion is critical. Cloud is important to that as we put our data centers in places. And we can not only distribute the games, but allow creators to use our cloud development platforms to build games without having to have the local hardware right there in their house or in their office to go build. I think that is important. So we're going to do a little rapid fire. OK. What video games are you playing now? Cult of the Lamb. Most important meeting you've ever played a game in? You're trying to give me trouble, trust games. Have you ever just played a game in a meeting with Sacha? It's easier on teams calls, because they can't see your screen. You're not in the same room with people. I have played games. Satya's caught me playing games before. And yeah, I'd say a satya meeting. I plead the fifth. What's your favorite thing to do when you're not gaming? Of all things, snowboard with my family. You have a lot of gaming fans. Who do you fan over? You know, one of the things I love to go do is find a game I've never heard of and go spend time with it and then talk to the creators about it. I think creating something, putting it out there, is such a brave thing to do. If you could see any band in their prime, who would it be? Wow. So I'm a punk rock fan. So I'd probably go back and say like the Ramones. Best piece of advice for your 20s. When I think about these my career, and that's the only lens I have, there have been a number of times when others have made bets on me that I probably didn't think I was ready for, including the job I'm in now. And to listen to the others around you, when they are making a bet on you, when they're pulling you to go do things, at least for me, who was probably reticent, maybe a little imposter syndrome kicking in on was I really ready for something. But understand that others around you, when...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,831,2022-10-08 12:28:48
12606," Things, at least for me, who was probably reticent, maybe a little imposter syndrome kicking in on was I really ready for something. But understand that others around you, when they're encouraging you, that they're probably doing it for good reason. How do you balance work life and play? My little 15 minute commute back and forth is my transition zone of I'm now at work, I'm now at home. I don't even have a home office, because when I'm home, I'm not at work. Like it's just always been my thing, is that segmentation with my family and what I do. It doesn't mean I've never responded to a mail when I'm at home, but I'm very regimented that way. When COVID happened, it didn't work, and it didn't work emotionally, it didn't work, output-wise, like motivation. And I was pretty transparent about that with the people around me and how I had to change things. Does that mean you want everyone else to come back to the office? No, people have to work in the way that works for them. What is the gaming industry look like in five years? And what does it look like in 20 years? We're going to see video games really gain their space in telling stories that really change people's perspective on others lived experience. And I think that's a pretty cool thing. All right, thank you. I like you. For joining us. Music plays. You will shed light on dark matter. You will make aging optional. You will turn 5G up to 11.

The global appetite for data is growing faster than ever. And no matter what statistics you use to describe it, big data is big business. We believe 150 billion devices would be connected by 2025. And more than 175 zetabytes of data will be created. Every 18 month, the data that is produced by the world is doubled. We started talking about petabytes and exabytes. And now we're talking about zetabytes. It's a near unimaginable explosion in data and companies just don't know how to manage and secure all this new information. There's also a growth in the nature and location of data as well, you know, it's standing beyond structure data to unstructured data. We're looking at 500 plus billion in revenue, in market that several years ago or a decade ago didn't really exist. And that's going to three acts through 1.5 trillion in 2030. Are there room for more players in what has been on already pretty competitive space? What you see right now is that the big players are the biggest names in tech. You have the chemist like Microsoft, Google, Amazon is the big three. But the great thing about cloud and the public clouds, the private clouds is that it allows a lot of innovation to happen. HPE is a big name tech company with a mission to innovate and compete in the cloud. CEO Antonio Neri told remainbostic why he chose Tariq Robyade, a CFO to drive this transformation. When you play sports, you want different type of skills and capacities in many ways that they all together can deliver a better performance. And it starts by will to win. And when I became CEO, I realized I needed a different type of CFO. Somewhat is way more strategic, not just on the accounting side, but really think about how we can deliver that value in a different way. Gone are the days where the CFO is just a scorekeeper. I think our role as CFO is to be the person who assisted CEO change the score. Well, he had that attracted me was about the transformation experience. Obviously, it has more than two decades as a global leader. We both Italians, by the way, look at the core, which I think is a benefit. We can communicate the same language. And we can argue against each other, but always in a constructive way. Yeah, I think about it. As CFO, I would assume that you're always in a position where sometimes you have to say no to him. Do you say no to him? Ultimately, decision-making ownership is here. It sees the CEO of the company. Here's the boss, he's my boss. At the same time, I want to make sure that I watch his back. Tarek Robiyade is HPE's chief financial officer and also overseas the company's strategic function. Being the head of strategy, he does a lot of the market scanning, looking at the trends, whether it's three or five, ten years. And that's why we combine both the CFO with the head of strategy, because in the end, it has to deliver to all the value. And then we hone into what are the big trends, where to play and how to win. Think about it this way. We are like biologists. We need to deeply understand the financial DNA of our company. And we need to take the proactive steps that prevented it from aging. Finance is the lifeblood of any organization, just like for a human being, you have to have your heart functioning. We have to be there providing the information that allows us to continue to create value for our shareholders and making sure that our customers get what they want. In 2015, the HULIP Packard Corporation split into two separate companies. HP Inc primarily makes devices from desktop and laptop computers to printers, tablets, and point-of-sale systems.

12608," to printers, tablets, and point-of-sale systems. Hewlett Packard Enterprise, or HPE, provides information technology solutions. In 2019, CEO Antonio Mary announced that the company would pivot from a focus on servers and on-site storage systems to its cloud software as a service platform, GreenLake. HPE calls it a hybrid cloud platform, not just storing data in the cloud, but managing it across murid locations. When I became CEO in 2018, I said that the enterprise of the future would be edge-centric, meaning where we live, where we work, cloud-enabled and data-driven. And one of the things that we saw through the pandemic is that the enterprise became way more distributed, people working everywhere. And at the same time, data became the most important asset that customers have. Explain for a second the difference between the edge there. Why that is more useful, and the idea of a more centralized cloud system that I thought a lot of companies, at least at one point, were embracing. Well, if you think about, we live now in a hyper-connected world, everything is connected. To digitize your enterprise, you need to be connected. It's cheaper to move the cloud to the data, and by the way, more secure, then moving data to the cloud. And that's where we, as a company, we are creating the capability to consume cloud services at the edge in your data center on a bigger cloud. There was a view, and there still is that view, that the whole world is going to move to the public cloud. We think the world is fundamentally going to be hybrid. The edge is where everything happens. It's where people generate data or companies generate data. Think about, for example, logistics companies. How much data is being generated in harbours, in railroads, in warehouses? And the world we're living will be a world which will be much more automated than ever before. So warehouses are going to fundamentally change. They're going to be powered by robots. Those robots will be very quickly picking up the items in the warehouse that are required, and then reshuffle what's in the warehouse. That actual processing requires data analysis locally where the option happens, transmission of that data over a secured network onto a central point, or multiple central points for that matter, and made sense off, right? So that is the whole idea that we're after. With more data to organize in more places, businesses are moving swiftly to digitize their information infrastructure. Corporate spending on IT soared in 2021, and even if global growth slows, that trend is not likely to reverse. How do you operate that environment? If we are facing recessionary headwinds. What we're seeing with IT spending is we're expecting flattening to single digit growth, but cloud computing will largely be unaffected by that given the explosive nature of data organizations simply need cloud. Companies that once invested heavily in devices and data center servers may now seek more flexibility from software that can be upgraded as new needs arise. That's the bet HPE is making as it pivots to software as a service. When you hear the word as a service, so many companies throw that out, something as a service, is that just a buzz word? At the core, it's a different business model. At the heart of it, there is this contract with a service level agreement that ties the two parties for a specific solution. The solution allows the customer to manage the infrastructure and secure a specific business outcome under certain performance conditions. We manage the infrastructure on your behalf. We grow and expand the infrastructure as you need to grow and expand in turn. And so the degree of customer intimacy is a quantum leap above the transactional world. With a different business model comes a different metric for measuring success. Annualized run rate or ARR has become the focus for Tariq Robyati and his finance team. The ARR is critically important. The ARR is actually measuring the amount of our revenue that is locked in and recurring with our customer base. And to the extent that our ARR is going fast.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,834,2022-10-08 12:41:29
12609," is actually measuring the amount of our revenue that is locked in and recurring with our customer base. And to the extent that our ARR is going fast, the more robust the future of the company is. And on GreenLake we have to grow customers, we have to grow the revenue we make from those customers, and the ARR is the annualized run rate of revenue that you have from one period to the next. If your offer has a perennial future, it translates into a growing ARR. This is the way for us to truly understand that we remain relevant for our customers over the long term. What about margins? When you hear from some of these analysts, these investors here, there's still dialed in on Gross Margin, some of the more traditional metrics. Gross Margin for me is the most important metric in our sector, right? It's fundamentally, if you think about our business which comes from a hardware heritage moving into as a service, with hardware commoditizing, you have to have a focus on Gross Margin. And as you can see from our results over the past nine, ten quarters, our Gross Margin has been expanding very, very solidly. That actually tells you that your customers are willing to pay a premium for what you have to offer. And so what you want to see is a combination of ARR with Gross Margin expansion and the ARR composition becoming richer and richer with more differentiation thanks to software, that's the journey that we are all. You need to remind people that 75% of our profits are deferred, which means we don't need the impregnid profit to deliver. So that's an opportunity because we have an amazing profit pool called HP.Next now being supplemented with HP Green Lake, which we already have more than six billion dollars in the balance sheet growing at the hundred plus percent of record. Supply chain challenges and geopolitical turmoil have weighed on earnings in 2022. But with demand for its software continuing to grow and a record breaking backlog of orders, HPE has caused for optimism. Meanwhile, surging inflation remains a wild part as the company tries to attract subscribers and maintain margins. We have had to think about inflation permeating across what we do. In what we purchase and whether it's goods or services, we've seen rising costs. We had to therefore be much more disciplined on pricing than ever before. This is not easy and this is also something that has to adjust because you cannot keep pricing, increasing all the time. So you've got to be very dynamic in the way you think about pricing moving forward. Coming up, why a company with deep roots in Silicon Valley just opened a new headquarters in Houston and how it designed its campus for a more flexible future. It's really incumbent on us employers to make sure that we create an environment where our employees feel at ease to come to work if you're supported. This is Bloomberg. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. We have to get interest rates higher and bring inflation back to our target. It's better to pass these becoming scarce. We are running on thin ice. No one deliberately wants to go into battle but we still walk into conflict with unmatched reach and resources from more than 120 countries. The moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. HPE Chief Financial Officer, Tarek Robyade, originally trained as a scientist, earning a master's degree in nuclear physics and electronics. He told Romaine Bostic how those studies set him on his professional path. It did prepare me in terms of my analytical capabilities but there was a moment in my career where I felt it was really important that I home my financial skills and then eventually I had to do an MBA majoring in finance and strategic analysis and entrepreneurship. I discovered finance as a discipline. I loved it and ever since then I became a finance person. Highlights from Robyade's resume include a stint with Lehman Brothers in London and later experiences CEO, first with the telecommunications firm CSL in Hong Kong and then with Australian",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,835,2022-10-08 12:45:38
12610," He would extend with Lehman Brothers in London and later experience his CEO first with the telecommunications firm CSL in Hong Kong and then with Australian financial services company Flexi Group. He came to the U.S. to serve a CFO at Sprint leading the company's turnaround efforts. I was very lucky I had the opportunity to work in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Asia and the United States. So I'm truly a global citizen. People ask me, where is home? My answer to that question is, home is where I'm not. Home for HPE is now just outside Houston, Texas, where the company opened its new global headquarters this spring. For CEO Antonium Neri, the campus is a passion project. I love design, I love art, and I felt this was an unique opportunity for me to start with a blank sheet of paper. This was a piece of land, nothing. There was nothing here. And it's remarkable in two years we're able to build this 500,000 square feet side with a unique experience digitally enabled in everything we do. HPE has an abandoned Silicon Valley, a number of employees and business units remain based in the Bay Area. But Neri and Robiotti believe the expanded presence in Texas strengthens the company, operationally, financially and culturally. We felt that we have a lot of opportunity to streamline and make the company way more efficient. The reason to move here is to get the best of both worlds. Having a presence here in Texas allows us to recruit and retain talent, particularly on the diverse side of the house. People don't realize that Houston, Texas is the most diverse city in the United States. In this side, we have a 25 megawatt data center where a lot of the development gets done from all over the world. That energy costs a significant cheaper here than California. I will now be able to sustain that in California. What we're seeing in a more macro environment is that corporations are looking at locations that have a healthier business environment from taxation and regulation. They're looking for places that they can find new talent. IKTellen is scarce. What we're finding is that access to talent is still the biggest bottleneck to productivity. And so companies on an increasing basis, whether it's Texas or other places in the United States or even globally, are working more towards this hub and spoke model, where they might have a center of excellence or a hub in one individual city outside of the main headquarters, and increasingly we're finding that is happening outside of Silicon Valley. It was a big decision, but it actually, if you put it in the context as to why we made the decision, it actually made sense. So we had a longstanding presence here in Houston for the past, I would say, 20 some years since the compact merger. We bought a piece of land, we started building this building. And in doing so, we had to also recalibrate how we were building it because the pandemic hit us. And we thought about recreating a work environment that is very, very different, that is skated for this new structural way of working, which we call edge to office, where people don't always come to the office to work, can work remotely from their homes, their edges. But have to come back to the office for specific reasons such as team meetings, customer meetings, and in general collaboration. With regards to the hybrid work model, do you see that as something that will persist longer term when the pandemic has long gone? Yes, no question, this will persist. And I think we are witnessing right now as a societal change in the way we work. You're no longer going to measure productivity in the same way as in the past. You're going to be focusing on outputs. Never mind what people do in their private times. It doesn't really matter to a company as long as the output is there. HPE launched its edge to office hybrid work initiative in the fall of 2020. The new campus is designed without flexible model in mind. We have to admit that the pandemic has had its toll on mental health in the workforce across the world. And so it's reading comment on us, employers, to make sure that we create an environment where our employees feel at ease to come to work, they feel supported, and that's why we created the environment that you see. Between this indoor with two amazing buildings and outdoor amenities, we have a truly, you know, experience for that employees that they can host.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,836,2022-10-08 12:50:11
12611," between this indoor with two amazing buildings and outdoor amenities. We have a truly, you know, experience for their employees that they can host customers, they can innovate, they can collaborate, they can socialize. And we have so many events. And I will say the one difference between here and California, this is way more community-driven, so we have a lot of events here. I like the famous Chile Cook event. H.P.'s annual Chile Cook Off allows TARC Robyotti to indulge in one of his favorite hobbies. The finance chief is also an avid chef. Cooking has a lot of parallels with finance and being a CFR. There's a lot of indirect satisfaction. You know, you only know that you're doing a good job when you see others people recognizing it. And there's nothing better than when you serve a nice meal to your friends or family who come over. I love to do that. It's hard work, but it's nice. Still ahead, how H.P.E.'s CFO is taking steps to relieve the company's supply chain pain. We have to rethink our network of manufacturing plants. We have to rethink our network of our suppliers. And he outlines the mindset that makes the chief future officer successful. If you start with a view that the world is in constant change and you have to adapt, you have to anticipate on what comes next. The strategic thinking is very key for that purpose. This is Bloomberg. Hydrogen has a very special place in the universe. It's the first element on the periodic table. It is the most abandoned element in the universe. And when clean energy advocates think about what can we find which would be as easy to use as fossil fuels they think about hydrogen. The fuel that will, when burned, only produce water. We like to imagine that if we just built enough of these and these, we could ditch fossil fuels and save the planet. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. But some things we just need a good old-fashioned combustible fuel. Now start at around the world of betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century. This is a market that over the past few weeks has made it clear it wants to go higher. It got a little spooked by the idea that geolipotent will rise. As HPE moves forward with its strategy to deliver software as a service and gain subscribers on the GreenLake platform, its growth and customer demand is encouraging. But supply chain disruptions have slowed the company's ability to fulfill those orders. It's a problem that's plagued many industries since the onset of the pandemic compounded by the war in Ukraine. Nobody including HPE is going to have an easy time with the supply chain. We started the just in time concept in the 70s and it's taking years for organizations to back their way out of that and find a more distributed supplier base, a more local supplier. Tarek Robyade can't wave a wand and clear the backlog all at once. He told Remain Bostic, he's focused on long-term solutions. The world is a longer flat and that's a practical reality we have to record. And in that context therefore, it's really important that we get close to where our customers are. And so we have to rethink our network of manufacturing plants, we have to rethink our network of our suppliers. And I think the whole world and the whole IT industry has to find a new equilibrium with supply chains that are designed for speed, resiliency and cost.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,837,2022-10-08 12:54:22
12612," With supply chains that are designed for speed, resiliency and cost, as opposed to just be inefficient and designed around cost. Our goal is to create a supply chain that is very much designed for optimal visibility at every point in time of where components are, where the working progress products are, and have the ability to shift production and materials in different continents where we operate. For example, we invested in a manufacturing plant in the Czech Republic because it made a lot of sense for us to have a presence in Europe. This is a really a new reality that we have to navigate. It's not like we went backwards on capacity. In fact, capacity has been added. The issues that the man has always had any capacity that we ever imagined. So now we need to add capacity. Also, we need to transition some of the technologies to the newer nodes, and that takes time. The historic Robiode will play a key role for HPE as it retools to face new challenges. Romain Bostic asked him what skills the CFO needs to truly succeed as a Chief Future Officer. The first quality you need to look for is CFO. It's almost stable stakes. It's integrity. And it's not about being honest or dishonest. Of course, we're all honest. But it's integrity of thought in the way you present the fact base, which is the data. If you don't have that in a CFO, stop looking. Move on. That's the first and foremost thing. The second most important thing is the ability to do it strategically agile. It's absolutely critical to be injecting in the work that a CFO performs a strategic thinking. The third, I would say, if you think about it in these terms, we are a little bit distorts of the resources of the company for the company and for the CEO. We've got to make sure that resource allocation is up to scratch and that we are allocating resources where there is the biggest return possible. And finally, we also have to be coaches. We have to coach our colleagues and team members and my job, the way I think about it is we have to shine the spotlight on their strength. But also, at the same time, make sure that we understand our weaknesses and are clear about the areas that we need to improve. So a lot of the CFO job is to distill what I simply would say is tough love. It's about being tough, right matters and also being encouraging in other circumstances. What's the opportunity here for HPE over the next 10 years? The opportunity for HPE over the next 10 years is to redefine the industry. And because we firmly believe with Antonio that the future of the industry is edge to cloud. And I think that there will be a growing acceptance and it starts already, you have evidence of it that the future is hybrid and that the future of an enterprise is to become essentially a digital service provider. The pandemic has taught us that the enterprises who perform the best during that period were the ones who had digitized their business models. And for an enterprise to digitize their business models, they have to think about it edge to cloud and where the company to help them do so. What do you think is going to be the main challenge for HPE over the next 10 years? Well, I would say the main challenge is ourselves. We have to really be recognizing that the opportunity is there for the taking and we have to go after it resolutely and fast. We can't really wait, be complacent and not execute aggressively to capture the opportunity. So it's not too us really and we think with the right focus and with the right team, we can get there. How do you expect your role as CFO to change over the next 10 years? My role is constantly in change mode. If you start with a view that the world is in constant change and you have to adapt, you have to anticipate on what comes next. Strategic thinking is very key for that purpose. You also have to make sure that your team is geared towards it, that you understand the demands that this constant change puts on the team. And then you also have to continue to polish your stamina, build a grid that you need to continue to navigate the journey. For someone who maybe got promoted to CFO today, what would you tell them? To just for the first day on the job, what's the best advice you can give them? Enjoy it, it's wonderful. You have a unique vantage point in any company to truly understand what's going on. No one else in the company has access to the data that tells you what's going on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,838,2022-10-08 12:58:54
12613," You can't just point in any company to truly understand what's going on. No one else in the company has access to the data that tells you what's going on. Have fun. For Romain Bostic, I'm Taylor Reggs. This is Bloomberg. What are the moon shots at Amazon that are capturing most of your time and attention? Well, you know, we have a unique way that we look at big new investments. And I'm not sure it's right or wrong. It just happens to be our way. And we ask ourselves when we're considering something for questions. We ask if it's successful, can it be big and move the needle in Amazon? Is it being well served today? Do we have a differentiated approach? And do we have confidence there? And if not, can we acquire quickly? If we like the answer to those questions, we'll go pursue it with a single threaded team that isn't distracted by the rest of the business. When it comes to the stock, it has fallen significantly. Do you think investors are missing something or has tech just been overvalued? I have never tried to predict what stocks might do. In any time, I've tried to a little bit. I've been wrong. I do really believe that in the short term, the stock market tends to be a voting machine and the long term it tends to be a weighing machine. We have a concept we talk about a lot of Amazon inputs and outputs. You know, in the ultimate output for a company, a share price. You know, and then other big outputs are free cash flow or profit or revenue. You can't really manage the outputs. You have to manage at the input level. And that's where we spend all our time. And so if you do the right things for the business long term, things tend to work out. I think we've had very good returns for investors. And I expect that to be true again. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71% building across America burned fossil fuels to operate? What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels. We want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Markets are preparing to close, but the day is not over yet. It's a stock that is now up about 45% of volatility right now.

12614," And also my filing system. Over much of the past three decades, I've been an investor. The highest calling of me in time, I've often thought was private equity. And then I started interviewing. Oh, well, I watch your interviews, because I know how to do some interviews. I've learned in doing my interviews how leaders make it to the top. I asked him how much he wanted. He said 250. I said fine. I didn't negotiate with him. I did no due diligence. I have something I'd like to sell and how they stay there. You don't feel inadequate now because being only the second wealthiest man in the world, is that right? One of the most successful entrepreneurs in the world of cryptocurrency is Sam Bankman-Free. He's created the FTX platform, and after platform has been so successful in the cryptocurrency world, that Sam has become one of the wealthiest men in the world. As a result of this, he's now focusing a lot of his energy on philanthropy. I sat down with him at the Bloomberg headquarters in New York recently to talk about the future of crypto and his desire to change the world and make it a better place. So is crypto down for the count or is it coming back? I think it's coming back. And obviously a lot of this is just going to have to do with the macro environment. If we see markets crash again, we're going to see crypto crash along with it. If we see a market recovery, we're going to see a crypto recovery along with it. But I think this is, you know, it's flushed out a lot of the things that needed to be flushed out from the crypto space anyway. When May of 2022 began, I think, a meltdown in tech values and also crypto. Did you get nervous that all of a sudden the world was going to fall apart? Not super nervous. It was definitely going to be a rocky road for the industry. And you saw some businesses blow up when Bitcoin hit $20K. I think if we saw things melt down much further than they did. Right. If we saw, you know, NAS Act dropped 30, 40% from here and Bitcoin go down to 10K, Protoken. I think you would see another round of pain for the industry that would potentially be more of a medium to long term problem. So it didn't give you any gray hair. I can see. Oh, a little bit, but you know, I pluck those out to keep up appearances. So let me ask you this. When the Bitcoin world was kind of going down a bit, I think at Bitcoin peak that 61,000 or something. Now it's a 23,000, but it went as low as 1718. 17, 18,000. I did a lot of other cryptocurrencies went down as well. You bailed out some companies. Yeah. What money did you use to do that? So there were a few different versions of it. And, you know, one piece of this was basically FTX balance sheet. Like we keep our corporate cash just in dollars. So we'd raised a few billion dollars over the course of last couple of years and we're profitable business. Now we'd also done some acquisitions, which partially balances that out. But we had some cash left. And with the BlockFi deal, for instance, that was on FTX. I think FTX US's balance sheet. Well, Wall Street had its problems early in the 20th century. Mr. JP Morgan himself used to go out and say, I'm going to bail out certain companies. And you were called the JP Morgan crypto. Yeah. Is that bother you or not? It doesn't bother me too much. I mean, I think it's something I thought was the right thing for the industry. And, you know, our very explicit mandate that we sort of gave to the team of people working on this was, your goal is not to make a fortune for us doing this. Like your goal is to do okay deals. Your goal is for us to knock it our faces ripped off. But contingent on that, you know, do as much as we can to bail out the industry. And that was the higher goal was trying to backstop places rather than maximizing on these deals. No, I would have loved other people to do it. Like I think it would have been great. So you went in, you bought some companies where those investments profitable? I mixed is basically the answer. I think some are going to turn out to be profitable. Some won't be. Like one of them certainly, I mean, with Voyager, I think, you know, there's $70 million there. That we put in that I'm not sure ever seeing that 70 million again. And so, you know, we had to make snap judgment calls and we made them such that if things turned out well, they'd be good investments. And if they turned out badly, they'd be bad investments. But we sort of limited the amount that we could lose from it. Why do so many young people seem so attracted to crypto? I mean, I know there are people from all over the world of all ages, but it seems like young people, particularly are very interested. Why is that? Yeah, I mean, partially it's a new thing that's going to appeal to younger people. But I think another aspect of this is if you're, you know, 21 years old and you're trying to get it,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,840,2022-10-08 13:07:45
12615," And they sell when the prices go down? Yes, or yes. Not keeping, but people have conviction or they invest for the, if they invest for the right reasons, just keep at it. So let's go back to your youth, not that you're old now. Your how old? 30 years old. 30 years old. So let's go back to, let's say, when you were growing up, you grew up in California? Yep, on Stanford campus. And your parents were both professors at Stanford Law School. Yeah. And one's name was Professor Fried. Yep. And one is Professor Bankman. So whose idea was it to combine the two into one name? I think they kind of both had the idea. I think there's a little bit hashing out of exactly what that would look like. Would it be Bankman Fried? Would it be Fried Bankman? But I think they kind of mutually came to that decision. So if you got married someday, you would have to have two hyphens. Right. Well, especially if I married someone with a hyphenated last name, right, then you've got four names. I think at that point we just have to roll a die and choose one. Oh, wow. Okay. So you've thought about that? Yeah. I mean, you could also just use a totally new name. But would it be a particularly attractive to find somebody had a hyphenated name or not really? Oh, I think it would be worth one good story. That's what I get out of it on the scale of life partners, not the most important criteria. Okay. So you're growing up. Your parents are distinguished professors at Stanford Law School. Were you interested in the law at any point or not? Not at all growing up. I think I've become more interested in it recently. But, you know, I mean, when I was growing up, my parents told me, look, you can do whatever you want with your life. We don't particularly recommend that you become a lawyer, but, you know, you're welcome to do whatever you want. So you were a bit of a math prodigy when you were younger? I was certainly better at math than I was at reading or literature. So you went to MIT? Yep. And when you got there, did you find that people were smarter than you thought or not as smarter as you thought? I think smarter than I thought, I think maybe some part of me had hoped that I would, you know, be able to live a life where I, you know, was always clearly sort of like, you know, an outlier on that. And I think MIT taught me that wasn't true. But there were a lot of other really smart people in the world, and, you know, was really interesting and cool getting to know them. So when you get to MIT, did you say, look, I'm going to go out and become a multi-billionaire before I'm 30? No, I had no idea what I was going to do. I mean, I, I weekly thought I was going to become a professor, not for any particular reason. I realized I didn't really like academia when I was there, and that left me kind of a little bit lost about what I would actually do with my life. So what did you major in? Physics, technically, I took about the bare minimum that you could imagine. It took maybe seven or eight physics classes my whole time there. So what did you really take courses in math or? I took some I minored in math, but I took a kind of popery of classes, you know, some polypsi classes, some econ, some psychology, but really I also didn't take that many classes and sort of got a little burnt out of academia. Right. So when you graduated, what did your parents say to you about what you should do upon graduation? I mean, mostly they said, actually, do what I wanted and what like I thought was whatever I thought would be exciting. And you know, they're going to support me with whatever, but I, you know, going to like junior year of college, I had no idea what that was going to be. I always sort of had just ruled out or soft rolled out academia and didn't know what was going to replace it. I ended up interning at Jane Street, a finance firm after my junior year and and really liked it there. And was starting to chart a path forward of donating money. Okay. So what did you do upon graduation? You took a job and finance? Yep. Went back to Jane Street work there full time. And what did they do? They're a quant trading firm. So I was on the internationally TF desk. Basically, that means you have a U.S. listed fund that owns a lot of foreign stocks. So you know, you could look at EEM, U.S. listed ETF that owns a bunch of emerging market companies, you know, across Asia, across Lodam and, you know, a few places in Europe. And it's basically a combination of like modeling, computer trading and real time intuition kind of jumbled together.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,841,2022-10-08 13:15:09
12616," slot M and you know, a few places in Europe. And it's basically a combination of like modeling, computer trading and real time intuition kind of jumbled together. And how many years were you doing that? About three, three and a half years. All right. Then after that, you said I'm going to go start something in the crypto world. Not quite. So I left in late, in let's say, fall 2017 roughly, not sure what it was actually going to do. Next, what I'd really done was sort of written down like 12 things I could do with my life and felt like a lot of them were compelling. And I didn't know what was going to be best. But that, you know, the only way to try would be to, to, to leave and just dive into some of them. Right. So you started your own company. What was it called? So I'll meet a research. It's the first company I started up. And it was a crypto-quant trading firm. And you know, the, the sort of founding if it was basically, well, you know, Bitcoin was trading on a lot of different crypto exchanges and it was not trading at the same price on all of them. So you might see it trading for $10,000 on Coinbase and $10,100 on Bet Stamp. And you know, in theory, there's a 1% arbitrage to do their trading those against each other. All right. So you just started to, nevertheless, trade Bitcoin or other cryptos who take some arbitrage advantage. And it was a profit of Y. Presum. Yep. It was. It was a huge amount of logistical work. Like finding the trade to the easy part, the hard part was getting the account sending wire transfers, opening up entities and all of the other sort of operational work that went into actually being able to execute. And normally, then people start companies to get venture capital money. And those venture capitalists own a piece of it. Did you get venture capital money? I did not for Alameda. And part of this was, you know, we talked with some VC firms and our petri is basically, hey, guys, good news. Bunch of 25 year olds. We don't really know what a Bitcoin is, but we're trading it. Also, this is all crypto. And, you know, we got to start up together. None of us has run a company before and we'd like $100 million by next Tuesday, ideally. It was not a very compelling pitch. Okay. So you got to turn down. Oh, yeah. I mean, no one, you know, people were like, oh, that's so cool. Like, I hope you find success. And, you know, no one was, and it's what we ended up doing was basically cobbling together lines of credit and other things from various sources, trying to sort of snowball and be able to build on ourselves. Okay. So after that, you started another company, FTX. Yeah. What does FTX do that your first company didn't do? So Alameda is buying and selling. Like, it's trading for its own book and, you know, trying to do profitable trades. FTX, you can think of it as infrastructure. It's markets infrastructure. So everything that sits between a buyer and a seller. So FTX doesn't buy and sell itself, but it's a venue where people can go to trade crypto. And, you know, that aims to solve sort of every piece in between those two parties from, you know, the clearing and settlement and custody, the, you know, anti-money laundering, you know, your customer policies, the compliance, you know, the match engine, the risk engine, the front end and everything else. Right. So why does somebody come to FTX and use you as opposed to one of the other similar exchanges? Yeah. I mean, you know, Twitch is owned, but the things that I think we've particularly specialized in and been good at, you know, one, we've been pretty, you know, fast-moving and innovative. You know, we're a relatively new venue, but we've put a lot of thought into exactly how our products are designed. Where's the company based? So we have, we have a lot of offices for regulatory reasons. So as an example, we have a new Tokyo office with a bunch of people in it, because we now have a, um, JFSA type one financial services license there. So we have like little bases in a number of the jurisdictions that we are licensed and regulated in, but our biggest office is in the United States, it's Chicago and outside the United States is NASA on the Bahamas. All right. So you live in NASA? That's right. And is that a tough place to live? It's really tough. It's a hard life. And so how do you put up with the pleasure of going to the beach or not versus working? I'm, you know, for better or for worse, not the person most tempted in the world to go to the beach. I enjoy it being there. I like going there once every couple months, but I don't, I don't spend a lot of time outside. I'm, I'm pretty much just in the office. So you don't look like you have a tan or anything? No. No, not so much. In the case of cryptocurrencies today, I think it's now's a time to get in. It's good or now is a time to wait to see where the market's going. The biggest thing I would say is don't put in more than your, you know, fine losing. Okay, so you're moving in on me quick.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,842,2022-10-08 13:19:36
12617," You know, fine boozing. Okay, so you're moving in on me quick. Just stradzing me with your fancy hands. I'm going to deal with your night because it's really bothering me. Ah, my night. Yeah, he's a troublemaker. Yeah. What did you get up to this weekend? Uh, you know, just robot stuff. A lot of chess. I was practicing for, uh, for you. I know you're pretty good. Ooh, I don't like that. I will take this. Uh, put it over here. Not cool. Not cool. All right, I will, I will concede. I can see. Ah, got me, Bid. Very good game. Well played. Thank you, sir. Thank you. You get away with not raising rates. Can it sustain its normal at a time when everybody else is facing a very different reality? Bloomberg surveillance. Be informed. Be prepared. Be ahead of the game. Every Friday with 30 minutes dedicated to fixed income, I'm Jonathan Farrow this. Here's Bloomberg real yield. So very often when people get wealthy, they buy fancy shoots and so forth, you haven't gone to that phase yet, right? Not so much. Your output is pretty much standard. It's some kind of t-shirt shorts, tennis shoes. Is that what you wear all the time? Uh, when I go to Washington, DC, I have a suit there because I have to wear it on the help. But outside of that, yeah. So, are you thinking of buying a house to live in or where do you live? I so I live in, uh, uh, nine, nine colleagues and I bought a large apartment together on near office at that that that we live in. Um, and I don't, I mean, you know, I'm sort of really fortunate to be able to have a, a really comfortable life and not have to worry ever about, you know, money for myself. But I'm not particularly excited to, you know, to dive into luxury. I'm not excited about yachts. Um, and I both think it's not what I should do with my money. I think I should be thinking about how I can help the world with it. And I also just isn't who I am. So, do you go to Washington, much to lobby with members of Congress and or regulators? And is that an uplifting experience for you? It's, so I go a lot. I, I'm there probably every few weeks. And it's been a surprisingly uplifting experience. I was not expecting that. I was expecting it to be a real slog. And I think it could have been in a slightly different universe where you saw continued boards going on between regulators and the industry. What we've tried really hard to do over the last year was get the industry to a place where it is happy to accept sensible regulation. And I think that's, that's helped turn down the volume a little bit on the arguments. And did to a place where most people are honestly trying to engage on what's the important federal oversight that we need to give to the industry. How can we do that in a way that makes sense given how the industry operates? The crypto industry seems to want to be regulated by the CFTC. And some people want the SEC to be the principal regulator. Do you have a view on this? So, in the end, both are going to be regulators. And, you know, the CFTC is going to regulate commodity futures. So, it's going to regulate very likely futures on tokens that are not securities. The SEC is very likely going to end up regulating spot security token markets. And there's some territory in between there when you look at spot commodity markets when you look at what a security token futures regime might look like. Those may end up as joint regimes. They may end up in one place or the other.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,843,2022-10-08 13:23:32
12618, mean there when you look at spot commodity markets when you look at what a security token futures regime might look like those may end up as joint regimes they may end up in one place or the other in in principle I'm fine with either a regulator or any combination of them. You know I think that the non security token aspect of this is a nice fit for the CFTC regime. Now in our country when you want to have some influence with government very often people make campaign contributions as they're called and you've become a large donor to political candidates is it because you want some influence on the policy of crypto or is it just you think these candidates are good public servants. It's mostly just looking for good public servants like that is by far the most important thing to me and look there are a lot of issues that matter but there's also just this correlate aspect of like are they going to be fighting to what they think is right for the country in general. And you know the the single issue that I have sort of spent the most time you know thinking about the most money you know doing to on the political side is pandemic prevention which is nothing to do with crypto but it's you know ultimately what I think is you know one of the most important issues for the world over the next you know. So how do you find political fundraisers they come to you directly as it is easy to get to you and say we need this money for this candidate and what type of candidates do you tend to support. Oh yeah well if you if I you know pulled out my phone here and just looked at my last 10 text messages you know about half of them are going to be people asking for you know politicians asking for for contributions but those those you have a political expert advisor. Yeah so I obviously ignore the text messages. I've I've I've I've got a few people on the ground in DC who are sort of actually running the operations. So when you give money to a candidate and he or she gets elected do they respond to you when you call them later or not really. Some do some don't and it's you know always super happy to talk but it's not generally the primary goal like the primary goal is generally that I thought they would be a good legislator. Do you get involved with presidential campaigns are going to be involved in this campaign that's coming up in a couple years. It's a good question the answers maybe it totally depends on who's running on what the race looks like. I'll give a couple thoughts the first is you know I might be very involved I might not be involved at all I might be involved on either side or both and in general my sense is that primaries are really important and I think this is true for the presidency as well. I think this is something a lot of people miss is that if your goal is partisan then you basically have to operate in general elections that's when you know partisan splits are determined but if your goal is getting like good public servants and people who are really fighting for its right for the country there are people who don't get that description on both sides of the aisle and you know you have these contests which are way lower stakes from a partisan perspective it gets rid of a lot of the noise and competition and you know they're great opportunities to support people who would just be good public servants. So you support people of both parties yeah okay and today you would not consider running for office yourself right. I would be an insane thing for me to do is a fourth job to tack on to you know the other things I'm doing. And can you see doing this for another 10 years 20 years 30 years like this. I think so I don't 10 I mean when I get burnt out I get burnt out because I'm out of useful things to do on a topic I don't tend to get burnt out from worker stress. Well crypto came along relatively recently I guess Bitcoin was invented in 2009 but yeah but relatively recently it's become a big phenomenon. You see any other phenomenon like that that you might get involved with as well. Potentially I mean look eventually AI I think you know right now we're at the stage of AI being mediocre chatbots instead of really bad chatbots but that's going to change over time and you mark to 10 20 years from now we may be having a very different conversation. So I have not bought any cryptocurrencies I have invested in companies that service the industry but I haven't bought crypto myself. Let's suppose I said I wanted to buy some crypto currencies. What would you recommend to me or anybody else? Well first thing is I try not to give an investment advice and you know what I would say is the most effective and you know useful thing you can do is just try everything out. Take $10 feed it through every protocol feed it through every exchange see what it's like get a first-hand experience of using a blockchain using a blockchain explorer doing trade and that will teach you a lot about how the industry functions. You know I think I've been really interested in a few different areas of the space I think it been interested in scalable blockchains have been interested in obviously in the exchange and platform space especially on the regulated side and then I'm super excited about the potential for blockchain based social media.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,844,2022-10-08 13:28:03
12619," Scalable blockchains have been interested in obviously in the exchange and platform space, especially on the regulated side. And then I'm super excited about the potential for blockchain-based social media to be sent that there are projects coming out in that area around remittances and payments and around market structure. Those are the places that I'm looking at the most right now. So in the case of crypto currencies today, would you say it's now as a time to get in? It's good or now as a time to wait to see where the market's going? So I think what I would say is there's potentially a lot of profit you could make. You could also lose though. Things can go up, things can go down. There is a lot of upside potential. The biggest thing I would say is don't put in more than you're fine losing. Don't put in money that you would be really, really sad to lose into crypto right now. Think of it more as an upside play. When you leave this interview and you go outside, can you walk down the streets of New York without anybody bothering you? It's borderline. I think probably a half a percent or a third of a percent or something of a people recognize me here. So the real answer is like every 10 minutes that I'm walking on the streets, someone will recognize me roughly, it's a little bit in between. What you can do is get a comb, comb your hair, get a suit and then people will be your disguise. It's true. I could just look normal and that would, yeah. Like do you have any thought of that? No, that's beyond me. So is there more pressure when you're trying to win a basketball championship than when you're trying to please investors? Where's the greater pressure? Oh, I think it's definitely trying to win a championship. It's hard because when you invest and you know this, when you're investing, you can control a lot more things when you know in a basketball court, you can't control whether somebody's going to make a shot, you've got to get lucky. And what's the greater pleasure making five times your money on a Distress Dead investment or winning the NBA championship? They're both fabulous. I wish I could do one each year. That would be great. But I think there's a great feeling in being right on an investment that you've done a tremendous amount of work and you've made money for your clients, which I think is great. I think winning a championship is, it's a very surreal feeling because there's a whole city or state that is actually behind you. We had 70,000 people at the finals and we had them all outside. It's 17,000 in stands and then literally like 60,000 people outside. And when we won, like just the joy that you had brought to the city was phenomenal. Access the financial world on demand.

12620," Hello! How are you? It's so great to see you. Thank you so much for doing this. What do you think about all this love's getting into? I'm sure you've crept in a big little arm. I think that that I think was more last year. So I think it's kind of a way of that past. No, I don't think so, but I think it's like any time that frankly it went a lot of other people get into crypto, right? I think it's like a lot of audiences too. It's one of the things that the news is a lot. And when does that happen? A lot of times when the prices are going up. She was a federal prosecutor going after gangs and the mob before being handed for next assignment, taking down Bitcoin. Katie Hawn soon realized this new technology was much more than a tool used by criminals. She dove deep and became a crypto convert, swapping her prosecutor hat for a board seat at Coinbase, and became the first female general partner at Venture Firm and Recent Horowitz. Hawn, now a prolific crypto investor, recently launched her own fund with one and a half billion dollars to deploy. It's the largest fund ever raised by a single investor. Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0 CEO and founder of Hawn Ventures, Katie Hawn. Katie, it's so great to have you. Great to be back here in the studio with you, Emily. I want to start with a vibe check. Okay. What state of the crypto cycle are we in right now? It was hot. Yep. And then it got pretty cold. Well, look, Emily, zooming back because I've been in crypto for a decade if you can believe it. We've seen crypto be really hot and then all of a sudden not. And so we've seen this before, however, I think one of the things that's a little bit different now is with each new crypto cycle, more and more people come into it. And so it's more and more pronounced each cycle. And I would push back on it's not. I think it depends on what area of the ecosystem you're looking at. We think developers think crypto and Web3 is still really hot. I am seeing a lot less of those. We're all going to make it hashtags. I am seeing a lot less of them too, although I am spending less time on Twitter, so maybe that's why. But with each cycle, there are new acronyms. What hasn't happened is a crypto winter in the midst of really serious global macro conditions. So we have inflation, kind of at record highs for our generation, in our lifetime. And then we have also a war that's broken out in the Ukraine. And we have a number of other factors going on here. So that's very different. There was some serious carnage out there. So, what's been your takeaways from that? I don't want to sit here and tell you that algorithmic stablecoins are bad. Because I actually think they're really interesting. However, I think what happened is you had, in this case you mentioned, Luna and Tara. That was an algorithmic stablecoin that was getting pretty widespread adoption relative to what the tech could do. I didn't realize you spent your teenage years living in Egypt and learning Arabic. Tell me about your upbringing. I was always uprooted. My dad worked for a large company and we were always moving just when I would get comfortable in one space. And I think actually that's pretty important if you fast-forward and look at my career. I'm comfortable being in uncomfortable situations. I didn't know a lot about venture when I got into it initially. I didn't know a lot about crypto when I got into it initially. And I was okay asking questions. I was okay not knowing the local acronyms or the Namanclature of a particular field. And I'm, you know, I'm taken right back to my teenage years in Cairo, moving from Houston, Texas one day to downtown Maddie in Cairo the next day. You studied law? I did. You clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. That's right. You became a federal prosecutor. You were taking on prison gangs and the mafia. That must have taken a really thick skin. I was doing it at each 25. And now if I kind of take a step back and you know, I think that happens at different points in your career. Like, whoa, if I would have analyzed that a little more at the time. And I'm kind of in some ways glad I didn't. I just don't write.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,846,2022-10-08 13:36:43
12621," If I kind of take a step back and you know, I think that happens at different points in your career. Like, whoa, if I would have analyzed that a little more at the time, and I'm kind of in some ways glad I didn't. I just dove right in because I felt it fascinating. There was a human aspect to it and people's stories. And I felt like those stories mattered. So I was drawn to criminal law and became a federal prosecutor and I did cases involving violent crime, but then really mistriing cases, being back in the courtroom, being before the grand jury. Like the prosecutor you would see on TV going to try those murder cases. Doing those two hour closing arguments. That's right. And so moved out here to California. I died at the largest prison gang in the world at the time. At law motorcycle gangs, hostage taking, bank robberies, arm bank robberies. There was really not a kind of criminal case by that point in my career. I hadn't done it. It was right around that time, 2012. One of my bosses came in and said, let's have that same energy that you brought to those gang cases, to those murder cases. And let's go ahead and have you investigate this new criminal technology that we really need to look into and possibly shut this down. So you created the first cryptocurrency task force. How would you describe it? Fortunately, several of us in the government realized at the time. It's not possible. Also not desirable because Bitcoin is not an entity. It's not a person. Right, it's a protocol. And it would be like saying, let's go shut down cash. Let's go shut down the internet. It's not possible. Probably wouldn't be a good idea either. I was using crypto and technologies like the Bitcoin blockchain, because that's all it existed then. This is 2012, 2013, to actually uncover criminal activity. So I didn't think that that technology was bad. Frankly, it was a tool that helped me uncover the various activity. And by the way, it was a step level function improvement better than compliance by banks. I'll just go ahead and say it. That's a little bit controversial. But I had spent a decade subpoenaing large financial institutions. And five times out of 10 didn't get back what I needed. One case I worked on and people always say, oh, you shut down the Silk Road. What actually happened? I was looking into something completely, not having to do with anything at all of the Silk Road and came across some, what looked to be some kind of odd activity. And it turns out that a couple of federal agents on the Silk Road Task Force out of Washington, DC were cropped. And that is the case that I ended up in dining and I ended up prosecuting those agents and they both went to prison. So that's the aspect of what Silk Road case that I worked on. I would never, never have been able to uncover that criminal activity by those agents, because they were federal agents, they knew how to cover their tracks. Had they not used Bitcoin blockchain. Right? So that technology right there, if they had just used wires or cash or even bank wires, we would never have uncovered that. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund from scratch? Imagine simply climbing a cable into space. The concept is known as the space elevator. Not only could it significantly change how we leave planet Earth, but it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space. And they're a scientist who think we could have already built it. We have the material, we have the technology, we have the lasers, we have the climbers, we have all of them. If a private entity wants to build it or a government, they can build it. It'll change society. We have no clue how colonizing in the space, how really spreading on this space, really change our society over the next 50 to 200 years. It'll be completely different.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,847,2022-10-08 13:40:48
12622," in the space, how really spreading out in space, really changed our society over the next 50 to 200 years. It'll be completely different. So you became kind of a crypto convert after this. You joined the board of Coinbase very early on. How did you and Coinbase and Brian Armstrong come together? I hosted an event here in San Francisco at the Federal Reserve Bank and believe it was there that it wasn't just Brian, it was a lot of what I'll call legitimate actors and crypto who wanted to usher in this new wave, this new ecosystem. And then we brought together the heads of all kinds of agencies. Really in an effort to kind of talk about building bridges, you know, the government and the crypto industry. We're never going to see eye to eye on a lot of things, but we did think there were some commonalities. Coinbase is a company that has suffered. They've been losing share. The valuation of the public markets has plummeted. Why do you think that is and how do you think it can be fixed? Yeah, well, I think again, a few things it's tied to. One, a large aspect of Coinbase's business now, of course, is trading revenue. And that's down when prices are down. And you know, the company's been very transparent about that long before going public. I mean, also, if you look at its S1, it specifically identifies that. And just how volatile crypto cycles are. So I think that's part of it. It's judged by public markets as a technology stock or as a financial services company. By the way, I think it's both. I think it's not just a financial services company. I think it's so much more. I think it's really a portal to this whole new ecosystem. You were also on the board of OpenC until recently, there's an insider trading situation or accusation going on there. Coinbase has also had employees accused of insider trading. How much is this happening within crypto companies and within the industry and how big a problem is it? So, crypto is under the microscope. So where you have a case, two cases, three cases in crypto ecosystem, which now is a trillion dollar industry. I think multi-billion approaching trillion dollar industry, you're always going to be able to find examples like that. So I don't want to make too much out of a handful of cases. That said, the company, Coinbase, OpenC, take these things incredibly seriously. Along with your position at Coinbase, you became a partner at one of the most story venture capital for American Silicon Valley. That was Andrewson Harwitz. What was your experience at A16Z-like? There I met Chris Dixon and I met Ben Horwitz and I met Mark Andrewson and I had worked with them for just about a year, maybe a little bit over when they asked me to come and co-run their crypto funds at Andrewson Harwitz. Again, I jumped at that chance and I think really that speaks to the fact that, as I said before, things are a hell yes or there are no and it was a hell yes for me. So Andrewson Harwitz is the kind of place where if you make a partner, you don't leave. Yeah. How did Mark and Ben respond when you said, yeah, I want to leave to start a crypto fund of my own. As you might know, Emily, they're an anchor. They're an anchor check into my fund and I'm very grateful for that. Mark and Chris and folks like them are also personal LPs. So I felt very supported when I shared that decision and I will say that it was not running away from Andrewson Harwitz, it was running to another opportunity. And you know, crypto is not, what do they say? It's not a spectator sport. It's like, you're in it. It's very young. It's 24-7. It's global and it's hustle. And that's a trade-off. It's a life trade-off. And at this point in my career and in my life, if I was going to continue to make that trade-off, I just wanted to do it and do it in a way that was really true to me. So you struck out on your own. Yes. And I was very grateful to the financial venture. What gave you the courage to do that? What was the spark that lit the fire? Yeah. That got you to say, I need to do this and do this now. Sure. What I set out to do was to continue to invest in this ecosystem that I think is so broad that decision was very purposeful and the timing was very purposeful. We have an early stage fund that does seed stage, series A, even series B. And then we have what we call an acceleration fund, which is, it's not a growth fund. It's a crypto growth fund and I think those are different things. It's later stage. It might be crypto publics. Some kind of public tokens were set.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,848,2022-10-08 13:45:51
12623," It's not a growth fund, it's a crypto growth fund, and I think those are different things. But it's later stage. It might be crypto-publics, certain kinds of public tokens were set up to hold tokens, to participate in the token ecosystem, or later stage companies. I mean, you know, there are now several crypto, many crypto unicorns. Space has become really competitive. Even though you say, you know, crypto's had its kind of ups and downs, the thing is, a lot of people in some of those last cycles have seen the kind of venture style returns that can be had in crypto. And so you've had a lot of new funds enter the space, and that's driven up competition. So what differentiates on ventures then from, you know, all of these other crypto funds or even more traditional venture capitalists like entries in Harowitz or Sequoia? They also have crypto funds now. Well, I think a lot of traditional venture capital funds now have crypto funds. It used to just be like a regulatory designation. I was like, are you an RIA, which is registered investment advisor? I would say for crypto founders today, it's not enough to just be an RIA, right? They, frankly, I don't even know if a lot of them care. That's a regulatory designation. What crypto founders today want to know is, do you live in Brith crypto? Do you inhale the discourse? Are you part of the community? Do you participate in governance? Are you going to be staking these kind of crypto verbs out there? And if you're not really in this space full time, I think it's very hard to run a successful crypto fund. We don't have a hedge fund component. So we're not sitting here buying and trading and selling. That's a hedge fund structure. And there are crypto hedge funds. We're not one. We're making seven to ten year bets. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund from scratch? You know, it's hard, but it's not impossible. We don't have a crystal ball. I don't know. I can't predict cycles, but I knew that we were in a cycle where you saw so much for ever an excitement around the space. And I already talked about what makes this different. But I think one thing also is we are a nimble strike force. We don't fish in the same pond. We have the crypto natives. We have a fishing execution. We have operators, seasoned operators who really know how to stick the landing. And I think that's reflected on our culture. I would say the only thing that's changed in our strategy as a result of the market correction is really more of a focus on early stage, but we still have our late stage fund. And when we see valuations, which I think will still see correct, spoiler, I think we'll continue to see some corrections. And so we might deploy our later stage fund a little bit more slowly. It might not be on an even 50-50 cadence. And that's okay. Long-term, our strategy hasn't changed. Long-term, we're committed to the space. How much do you think valuations are going to correct? You know, it's just, I can't give you a one-size-fits-all answer because crypto is not a monolith. We have some crypto companies that really follow more of an enterprise-sass business model. You have others that are layer one protocols. You have still others that are consumer-facing applications. And I think one of the things we're seeing right now is the infrastructure layer. And that's where we're spending a lot of our time, by the way. And we think more and more use cases will come about when the infrastructure layers in place. So my own view is we are not rushing to deploy. We're certainly not getting caught up. You do get VC FOMO. I try not to. I try not to. You know, look, I think it's very easy to get into that mindset, right? It's because it's a competitive sport. It's a competitive space. And I think I'd be lying if I said that that doesn't influence anyone. I try to, what I do, and I think I do differently, is I try to take stock of that. Oh, that's the FOMO mentality kicking in. That's bad. Again, you don't want to over-correct, though. What we look for is we look for amazing founders. It doesn't matter if I think valuations will correct if there are amazing founders. There's a huge tam. We also look for what's your regulatory plan. If you're launching a token, what's your plan to comply with the law? What's your plan for security, by the way? We've seen a lot of hacks in the space. We want to really dive in there and make sure that the founders have been thoughtful about, especially if they're custodian customer funds, keeping those funds secure. If it's a cross-chain bridge, what are the exploits? Have you changed your strategy at all, given the downturn? What? Have you backed out of any deals? We've decided not to do certain deals because the conditions have changed. Don't you raise the fund? We have decided not to do certain deals. We've never backed out of a deal. We have decided not to do a few deals because we think that pricing was ahead of progress candidly. And we might have been wrong about that, Emily. We might have been wrong about that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,849,2022-10-08 13:49:49
12624," We have decided not to do a few deals because we think that pricing was ahead of progress candidly. And we might have been wrong about that, Emily. We might have been wrong about that. But I think if we were wrong not to do a couple of deals better that we might have been right, because if we were wrong about that, I think we can find a way to still invest in those projects later. Well, one thing I'm hearing is that a lot of dry powder has just sucked up because... Yeah. All these funds raised a lot of money raised...what was the biggest fund ever for a single person, not just a woman. Yeah. Anyone. Are you confident you're going to have a place to put all that money? I am, but if I don't have a place to put it, I'm not just going to go willing, nearly deploy it. One of the things that we told our LPs even during the period when we raised our fund, which was when crypto was undeniably still on a bull run, we said that we are going to be pretty steadfast sticking to a tier deployment cycle. And I think one thing that's changed is that might have lengthened. It certainly hasn't shortened, but we will, again, we feel very good that we have the capital to back great teams when we see them. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. I think we're falling behind. The world, Bloomberg. From the world of politics to the world of business, balance of power with David Weston, views and analysis inside, from and above, politics power players, weekdays, this is Bloomberg. Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world we calibrate. After decades of stagnation, Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation. Corporate giants, policymakers and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that. Every week on Japan ahead, right here on Bloomberg Television. What about NFTs? Are you concerned about the declining demand? We are going to increasingly live in a digital world. And I happen to think that if you live in a digital world, you're going to want to own digital goods in that world. You're not just going to be satisfied to rent them, which is what we do now. We buy our content from walled gardens without digital scarcity, which is what? NFTs unlock. You don't really own anything. I think NFTs and digital scarce goods fundamentally change that. I think you'll see NFTs back again. But we are spending a lot of time in the infrastructure layer. Like I tell you, zero knowledge, technology, scalability. We think of that as the plumbing. If you think of the fiber-hubbic cables. Remember, you couldn't have had YouTube and Netflix with dial-up. You couldn't have streamed content. The same is true of crypto use cases. I think that there will be a lot of new use cases unlocked when the infrastructure is there, when it's more efficient, when it's more user-friendly. And so we're spending a lot of our time there. President Biden issues this crypto executive order. There are a number of ports that are coming due. What do you want to see from the administration when it comes to regulation? Are you optimistic that we will get there? Yeah. We were so delighted to see that executive order. It's not something you should normally be delighted about. The thing that we were is because it was to us a real recognition that this is a US government saying this field isn't going anywhere. This field is growing. It's growing so much that we are going to direct every single agency in the federal government to come up with a plan here. I think we take a step forward, but then you see we're a big government. We're a big system. We have states. We have local entities. So we take a step forward with the EO. And then we take some steps back sometimes too. And I think what I see is crypto founders are confused by that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,850,2022-10-08 13:53:53
12625," Take a step forward with the EO, and then we take some steps back sometimes too. And I think what I see as crypto founders are confused by that. They're starting to think, well, I could go to this jurisdiction where there's a single regulator, and you don't have 50 states with different rules. It's the US government that needs to start taking stock of the fact that right now, Emily in China, there's a quarter of a billion, ECNY wallets, a quarter of a billion. We're still talking about whether there should be a government central bank digital currency. We're still studying that. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind China. And we're falling behind. What are the dangers of falling behind China and the rest of the world? This is years ahead, so I don't want people to take a headline and say, oh, I think the US dollar will be no longer the global currency, reserve global currency. I'm not saying that now, but fast forward decades. If you no longer need to use the dollar because you have an alternative, I think that's a real problem. What would we use instead? Well, I think that there are going to be stable coins out there that people who have access to a smartphone will use. There is a demand for it. We see 285% year over year growth as stable coins. So people are clearly liking the idea of this. Now, again, there have been some spectacular failures, too, but not all stable coins are created the same. But I think the important thing is that we really do need to not just quash innovation. What do you think of how Gary Gensler, the chair of the SEC, and how he's approaching it? One of the things that I hear from founders is that they're very confused because they get told, come in, register. Just come in and talk to us. But you have the one company who's done the ultimate act of going in and registering. Coinbase, file the S1. And still, you know, there's a lot of saber rattling still going on, I think. Again, I don't want to single out the SEC. And I don't want to suggest that anything they're doing is bad. I do think, though, that right now there's a lot of confusion. And one of the pieces of confusion stems from the fact that, you know, and it started with the ICO, Mania back in what 2016, 2017. I can't even remember which year now, where the SEC was very loud about securities. A lot of them were securities. But the space has changed, and so to still view it through the ICO lens when so much has happened over the last five years in the space, I think is a mistake. What do you have to say to the skeptics out there who just don't believe in the future of Web 3? And don't see where this is going. Yeah. I would say don't judge the current state of innovation by the end state of innovation. I hear from a lot of these skeptics. And by the way, I'm friends with a lot of these skeptics, too. I don't only want to live in a crypto bubble. They want to see the use cases, especially if they're not technical. Well, when am I going to use it? What will I use it for? And I think one of the things that's not appreciated is how quickly the infrastructure here is catching up. And once you have kind of a, once you have really scalable blockchains that can handle a lot of thorough put and are very efficient, I think that unlocks a whole lot of use cases. People are spending more time on screens. That curve is up and to the right. Whether we like it or not, that is the future. I mean, those who have kids know that kids spend more time online. They want digital things, too. And I think to dismiss it, it is a bit generational. I do find not always, but it is a bit generational. If you talk to kids about being able to have money online, they instantly get that concept. They're comfortable not having to hold something in their hand to think it has value. Take us to the end state. Do Google and Amazon and Facebook and Apple still exist? I believe they will still exist. I mean, it depends what you talk about when you talk about the end state. I mean, I think that, you know, I think for decades, those companies will still be around. But the important thing is I think this new ecosystem is going to represent a challenge to them. I do think that those entities, decentralized forces are coming and will cut into those entities, profits and revenues. So we have a little rapid fire section.

As Fall sets in, a decided turn in the air for the new British government's designs for the economy for Elon Musk designs on Twitter and most decidedly for Mr. Putin's designs on Ukraine. This is Bloomberg Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. This week's Special Contributor Larry Summers on whether the jobs market is starting to show some signs of loosening. I think we are headed for a collision of some kind or other and we just got to manage that collision carefully. And theio",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,852,2022-10-08 14:03:01
12627," of loosening. I think we are headed for a collision of some kind or other, and we just got to manage that collision carefully. And Brad DeLonga Berkeley on what the broad suite of economic history may be telling us about where we are headed next. People say that the United States has very little to teach them, that we don't have any greater grasp on how to deploy and use these technologies to create a good society. We had our fair share of about faces this week with the Bank of England's quick intervention to save the guilt market as explained by former MPC member Kristen Forbes of MIT. It's that they are worried that because of the big market moves, there could be some margin calls, some pressures for force selling that could cause the guilt market to freeze up. And British Prime Minister Liz Truss giving up at least part of her economic program. It was becoming a distraction, so that's why we immediately changed that policy and that's the kind of government we are. But as ugly as the situation was in UK markets, it was nothing compared with the setbacks for Russian forces in eastern and southern Ukraine, with President Putin's efforts to quote Annex territory that his forces didn't even control. Which Admiral John Kirby of the NSC looks at as an indication that Mr. Putin just may be coming to understand how difficult his situation really is. The annexation announcements as well as his announcement of partial mobilization certainly shows the degree to which Mr. Putin knows how much he's struggling inside Ukraine. And OPEC plus weighed in with its own changes. Cutting production caps by 2 million barrels a day or about 7 percent, putting even more pressure on Europe and the rest of the world already worried about energy. Well, we were disappointed that OPEC made this decision. As the president mentioned, we think it's unnecessary if you look at the global environment where supply continues to be the predominant challenge. Then there's Elon Musk. He offered $44 billion for Twitter back in April, then decided to renegade, got sued, and on the eve of his deposition, returned to his original offer. Even it looks like he's going to be way overpaying. In many ways, this is almost the most expected outcome of all, which is settling on the eve of trial just before deposition of the main players, Elon Musk himself. He doesn't want to be deposed. He has probably some embarrassing text messages and conflicting statements and all of that would make for a very unpleasant decision. But after all the back and forth this week, US jobs numbers actually came in surprisingly on course, adding 263,000 new jobs just slightly more than expected, with workers paid 5 percent more than they were last year. In a reduction in the unemployment rate to 3.5 percent, which made for a rough day in equities on Friday, but actually a pretty good week overall for equities, the S&P 500 adding 1.5 percent to end the week at 3639 and the NASDAQ, eaked out a gain of 3.4 percent. Elon's also had a topsy-turvy week, but ended up with the 10-year yield of a relatively modest 5 basis points to 3.88. Here to walk us through this week and what got us here are Aaron Brown, portfolio manager at PIMCO and Chris Ellman, chief investment officer at CalSTRS. So Chris, let me start with you. Boy, given what we're seeing right now, are we looking at a long cold winter, would you say? Unfortunately, David, I think we are. I think the Fed, you know, with these employment numbers, the Fed knows that they have to continue this pace of aggressive tightening, and they're going to do so the next meeting and the next meeting after that. And I think, which is the street is pricing in, but I think after that, they're going to have to keep it up. And that's going to be into the winter and it's going to be a tough time. So, what do you say, Aaron? Is it going to be a rough winter? I think it is going to be a rough winter, I think that there are bands of uncertainty are quite wide for next year. The Fed is tightening into an economic slowdown. And we haven't even seen the real impact of that slowdown yet. We're just starting to see signs of a gradual slowing, but likely we'll continue to see that into next year. And we think that we're heading into a recession into early 2023. And at that same point, just given the level of inflation, the Federal Reserve is now really challenged to be...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,853,2022-10-08 14:06:55
12628," We're heading into a recession into early 2023. And at that same point, just given the level of inflation, the Federal Reserve is now really challenged to be able to arrest that inflation, get it under control, despite what happens to the economy. So I think that really poses a challenge for the Fed, and we'll likely see something that's fairly unprecedented, which is continued financial conditions tightening, and Fed tightening into an economic slowdown, even if it really leads to a harder landing than what the Fed's anticipating. And Aaron, I push back a little bit. I actually think we're in a recession right now. It's not a very strong one, and it doesn't hurt a lot. I was so with employment growing. You know, but we did have a negative GDP in the second quarter, third quarter is mild. To me, anything below 1% in the USA feels like a recession. But so what you're saying is, you think it's going to be a really, we'll actually have a good traditional hard, negative recession with rising unemployment, which is exactly what Powell has said. I mean, that's his forecast. Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, our view at PIMCO is that we'll likely see unemployment rise to about 5% by the end of 2023. And so right now, we're sort of seeing some of those early signs, but we really haven't seen the full brunt of financial condition tightening yet. That's more to come. So we are going to continue to see a slowdown, and I think that's really going to hit in the first quarter of next year and into the second quarter of 2023. Chris, given where we're at with inflation right now, the concern is about inflation, if we are heading an intersection or even are already in one, no matter how long it is or how short it is, what are the tools the Fed has to use? Because typically you turn to the Fed and say, okay, start cutting interest rates. Doesn't look like they're going to do that in a likelihood. No, they're going to raise interest rates. They only have one tool. They have, well, they have their mouth. They can job on the market, which is what they're doing. They have the dot plot, which is going to indicate or direct the market. But the only tool they have is short-term interest rates and the Fed funds rate. And that's what they're using aggressively. I mean, good grief. 75 basis points. Those are big bounces. You know through history, you've got to go way back before you have that aggressive tightening of monetary policy, and they have to shrink the balance sheet. So as they move through that, he's already said he's getting a hurt employment. Yet we have stronger numbers. I think the numbers, there's something strange in the numbers this week, just like last month, but we'll see how that balances out. We're going to have a tougher time. And I think the question's going to be about corporate earnings. You got CPI next week, and then you got the bank starting to roll out with their earnings. Aaron, has the market priced in the diminishment of earnings at this point, corporate earnings? No, I don't think that they have. What you've seen since the beginning of the year is equities have derated, largely driven by the market multiple. So you've seen the market multiple for the S&P 500, derade from about 21 and a half times to about 16 times today. Keep in mind that traditionally in recessions, the market multiple is somewhere between 14 and 16 times. So we're just at the upper end of where we typically are in recessions, and we think that you could see a little bit more derading from there. That's not really the challenge for the market. The challenge for the market is that when you look at corporate earnings for next year, the market's pricing them to be up 7.5% for consensus. Our forward-looking models are expecting them to be down about 9%. So that's north of a 15% differential versus what the market's pricing for next year and what we think it's likely to be. Also, historically, during recessions, earnings fall about 27% on average. So there's real downside risks to our forecast and certainly to the market's forecast. And I think that's where you're going to see the real pressure point for the market in early next year. What's driving that is margins. We're at record high margins right now. The street is expecting that margins are going to expand further from here. So even higher than and hit new record highs, we've never seen that in a recession before. So I think the market's really mispriced and that's where the pain's going to come from. Aaron, I've got to ask you if we're already down 23% so far this year, how much lower do you think we can go? Do you see a support level on the S&P? I think that in a modest or modest...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,854,2022-10-08 14:11:26
12629," You know, we're already down 23% so far this year. How much lower do you think we can go? Do you see a support level on the S&P? I think that in a moderate recession, the market probably bottoms out about 30 to 50. There is downside risk if we see further, you know, sort of a more severe or harder landing from there. But, you know, 30 to 50 is still down about 14, 15%. So I do think that there's still room for the market to fall further. Where are you looking? In terms of your estimates. Yeah, no, I agree 32 to 50. But I mean, that's a negative 36 on the year, which is you're like me. We have asset allocation portfolios. Where do you hide in that kind of a negative market? You've got bonds with the rates rising. So you're going to have continued negative returns out of bonds and then, you know, a negative 30 out of stocks. That's a rough calendar year. Where do you hide? Well, I think that, I think there have been actually market opportunities that have arisen since the start of this year. Cash right now, two-year bonds are yielding north of 4%. Now, that's not a sexy return by any sort of stretch of the imagination, but if you can lock in 4%, you know, add a little bit of spread on top of that, you know, an IG corporates that give you an additional, you know, 2% or so. That's about a 6% return over the next couple of years. That's high quality paper that you can invest in. So I wouldn't, you know, sort of rule cash out as an option. I think that that's somewhere where you can hide and really not expect that much volatility and really consistent returns and sort of hide out there until we see the markets bottom and you can start incrementally moving back into risk. But we can't, I think you need to keep in mind as an investor that if the core of your allocation of your portfolio, which is sort of cash and core fixed income, is unstable, then you really can invest in the outer ring asset. So, you know, we really have to stabilize rates in order to move out the risk curve into other asset classes. Right now, cash is a pretty good option. Okay, we're gonna pick up exactly that question. Where do you hide in this environment? When Chris Aylman and Aaron Brown will be staying with us, we're gonna ask for them for some investment advice. We could use it, that's for sure. That's next on Wall Street Week here on Bloomberg. Believe what you're on, we can compensate You a full rent for the sake of develops bets and rhythm for our venture.

Now, the way a bullfip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. And that crack is a sonic boom.

12630," for numbers real-time analysis weekdays. The facts on unemployment seem clear enough, or at least as clear as that changing social definition ever can be, the situation is getting a little better, but not much. The government announced today that the overall unemployment rate last month was 6.9%. The official unemployment rate has been stuck within a tenth of 7% for six months, and that scarcely represents the massive reduction of unemployment that at least some folks thought they heard Jimmy Carter promise a year ago. That was Louis Rockhizer on Wall Street week back in October of 1977, when the unemployment rate was twice what it is today, and we were trying to get it down rather than focusing on inflation, whatever that ends up meaning for employment. If that seems like a galaxy far far away, well maybe that's no accident. The top movie this week back in 1977 was Star Wars, and the top song on the charts was, you got it, the Star Wars theme. Still with us, our Aaron Brown and Pymco, and Chris ailment of Calcester. Aaron, let me turn to you and pick up on where we were talking just now with Chris, but where you hide, if you're really an asset allocator, you said cash is one alternative. Are there things that involve at least some risk that you go to, and how much it depends on what you think the recovery is going to look like whenever it comes? So I'm going to flip that sort of question and answer the second question first, which is unlike prior recessions that we've seen in very recent history, so think of the global financial crisis or even the pandemic of 2020, I don't think this is going to be a V-shaped recovery. I think this is going to be more of a prolonged sort of stalling of the economy and more of an L-shaped recovery than what we've seen in the past, and the reason for that is because inflation is high, and it's likely to persist at high levels, you're not going to come in and see the Fed start cutting as the unemployment rises, like we've seen in the past. Instead, because the Fed has moved from a dual mandate Fed to a single mandate Fed, really just focus on getting the inflation rate down, you'll likely see, you won't see this sort of immediate relief that we've seen in recent history. And so that does change a little bit the landscape of how you think about investing. Historically, as we start to get closer to what we expect the bottom level of the S&P 500 to be, we start to scale risk back up, start to move back into equity investments to catch that recovery to the upside. And this time around, I think you have to be a little bit more patient. So instead, what we're really looking at is fixed income investments that we think are going to be able to sort of stand at the test of time, be able to sort of hide out in a safe haven assets. So beyond just looking at cash, we're looking at high quality investment-grade corporates, we're looking at municipalities, municipal bonds, particularly for those who can take advantage of the tax advantages, tax-advantaged bonds, we think offer good value there at a sort of after-tax yield of 6.5%. In addition, we also like some mortgage agency bonds and structured credit bonds as well. And then sort of high quality equities that are defensive equities, high free cash flow, dividend growth, strong balance sheets. We also think do well in this environment. But it is a sort of challenging time for investors where you have to see more towards fixed income in order to have stability of return as opposed to looking for a quick snapback in equities. But I pose the question to Chris because I know he also manages a diversified portfolio. Chris, where are you looking at what type of sort of diversification are you looking at in order to sort of hide out over the next couple of quarters? Aaron, you know, I've got the benefit of being able to go into private security. So I've got a good size real estate portfolio. We have a large private equity portfolio. Sure, it's going to have write downs, but its value is a bit more stable than we see in the public markets. We have a cash position, but the problem is for us cash is not outperforming inflation. So the old adage cash is trash is still true. We do like a private credit. You were kind of hitting on that, that variable rate, that short term debt with high-cut.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,856,2022-10-08 14:19:51
12631," That edge cash is trash is still true. We do like a private credit. You were kind of hitting on that, that variable rate, that short term debt with high quality. And I think collateral is going to be key. Because as you said, we're going to have a long, rough winter. So you don't want to be loaning money to everybody after you do care about governance. But it is tough in this environment. I mean, if the economy is slowing and inflation is still strong, that's stagnation. And you look back in the 70s. I got to say, I love that suit that Lou had. I don't know where you get that back in the 70s. But I'm stunned by it. But you know, you look back in that time period. Returns in the 77 were terrible. There were hard places to it. It was just a very tough time to hide anywhere. Yeah, so I'm curious though, exactly about when you go into fixed income. Do you think the price is attractive now in some fixed income? Chris? Well, I agree with Aaron. I'm going to go short. I'm not going to go long fixed income and take duration exposure. Short term credits. I mean, you've been holding credit for two to three years. And then it's money good. And as she said, you're going to put it in a spread product. So you pick up a couple of basis points by being in a corporate, you're OK. There's still a lot of money, David, international money that wants to come into this market, non-US rather, that wants to come into the market. You saw it in this week where suddenly comes rushing in. So I would give the advice to the average investors. You've got a slowly average cost in. You're not going to be able to call the bottom. As much as Aaron, I think there's a support number, it may not hit that at all. And the market's going to just bounce along. And in Aaron's example of an L, an L goes on forever. It's just flat. I hope we don't have to live in a flat recession for years and years. But I think this is going to be a tough market to find any kind of growth opportunities. So you want to protection and return of your money rather than return on your money. Aaron, one of the big developments this week was OPEC Plus and what they did. It certainly seemed to stun the white hats at the time. What does that tell us about geopolitical risk generally and specifically energy? And it looks like oil prices are going to stay up there for a while. I think that's one of the things that the market's really misspricing. Right now, if you look at the forward curve for oil, the risk is really in this very short term where the market expects that oil is going to be elevated for the short term. But it really has an extrapolated or extended that expectation out the next one to two years. And I think that there's a real value in the back end of the curve for oil. Because I think that these oil challenges are going to persist much longer than what the market's anticipating. One of the reasons for that is first we saw out of oil, OPEC Plus this week, their intention to keep prices elevated. But I think the other challenges is that we really haven't invested here in the US or on a global basis on energy infrastructure. So that capacity is really constrained over the next couple of years. Even if we wanted to expand capacity or oil producers wanted to expand capacity, they don't have the ability to do so in the immediate term. And that's going to keep oil prices elevated. So the risk for oil, then the risk for the energy complex broadly isn't just this winter, but it's next winter as well. And next winter's challenges are going to be even more difficult, particularly on the shores of Europe, than what we're experiencing this winter. And so that's what I think the challenge is. And why I think this is something that's going to persist much longer than what the market's currently priced in. And David, it's running into the challenge of climate change. I'm looking at decades, not a short-term trade in carbon. And I'm glad that we're having a constraint on the ability to expand hydrocarbons and burning carbon. But you're right. People want heat. And Europe heats itself. Whether we like it or not, it doesn't heat itself with solar and wind. It's got to do it through fossil fuels. And that's matching and running into it is I are to reduce these fossil fuels. And I agree with Aaron. I'm hearing the same thing that Europe has enough oil and natural gas for this year in their supplies. But if it's a really cold winter, they're very worried about next year. So you're going to have climate change crashing into this challenge of OPEC and inflation and energy prices.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,857,2022-10-08 14:24:24
12632," very worried about next year. So you're going to have climate change crashing into this challenge of OPEC and inflation and energy prices, certainly over the next couple of years. Europe has a lot of challenges there right now. Not just energy, it goes beyond that. Does that make the U.S. relative the most attractive place to be for you? I don't know if it's the most attractive place, but it's one of the more attractive places, particularly the Veeze of E-Europe. And the challenge that Europe has is that they're starting from a lower productivity, you know, a lower and weaker growth rate to start out. They also didn't, you know, sort of fully recover in the same way that the U.S. did post-COVID. And they're now have wider fiscal deficits. They're going to have to spend more money in order to insulate their economy from a harder hit because of energy. And that's going to create real challenges at the same time where the economy is rapidly slowing. So our view is that while the U.S. is going into recession, the recession in Europe is going to hit harder and is likely to be more prolonged. Thank you so much to Aaron Brown and Chris Aelman. When we come back, we're going to take a look at what's happening next week on Global Wall Street. And this is Bloomberg. The markets are preparing to close, but the day is not over yet. It's talked about about 45% of the volatility. You need the power of the Bloomberg terminal to get you market moving data before anyone else. There's numbers much higher than expected. Operated today to overweight. You need top analysts to bring you exclusive global insight into cross-asset markets. The meaning of market economy is a really big focus. Bitcoin ain't going along today. It's going to be a short term. Bloomberg markets the close weekdays on Bloomberg. This is Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. It's time to take a look ahead at next week on Global Wall Street. China stocks reopening is the big story in Asia this week. Exchanges on the mainland. They've been shut for the past five straight sessions that's to mark the golden week holiday. So we could see a pop at the open given the moves that we saw in Chinese assets in offshore markets. And that would be of course welcome news for officials in Beijing because President Xi Jinping is just days away from securing a third term as Communist Party leader. That's at the 20th party Congress starting October 16th. Otherwise travel restrictions or the easing of those is the major theme as well. Japan will further loosen controls from Tuesday and Taiwan from Thursday. For Europe next week there's a big risk lingering in the markets and that's the end of the VLV short term program to backstop bond markets. They of course announce that they would be purchasing long dated bonds after concerns that a huge spike up in yields in the long end of the curve meant that there would be danger for pension funds. So the B.O.E. has been doing this buying program. It's set to end on Friday on October 14th. There could be jitters in this market. What it means to no longer have a B.O.E. backstopping a political story really of the UK government, which has been doing various U-turns. So all of that will be in focus this week. All eyes next week will be on the latest batches of U.S.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,858,2022-10-08 14:28:27
12633," of the UK government, which has been doing various U-turns. So all of that will be in focus this week. All eyes next week will be on the latest batches of US inflation data. Producer prices will be released on Wednesday with the headline figure projected to have fallen year over year for a third straight month. Meanwhile, the consumer price index release on Thursday is once again expected to show conflicting signals with a deceleration in the headline number from a year ago. But the core measure of CPI, which strips out food and energy, is forecast to re-accelerate its pace of growth rather than fall. Investors also will parse the release of the minutes from the Fed September meeting, and whether there was any serious discussion about slowing or even halting the tightening of monetary policy. And earning season is finally here. The latest round of quarterly reports kicks off with Pepsi, JP Morgan, city group, Morgan Stanley, Delta Airlines, and United Health among the Notables. David? Coming up, we'll wrap up the week with our special contributor Larry Summersville Harvard that's going up next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. You could always move away. You might have just started working remotely, so there's really nothing keeping you there. But then again, moving is a hassle. Well, what if someone paid you 10 grand to do it? What if they threw in free office space, a bicycle, or a gym membership? Programs and cities and states around the US are doing exactly that, and they're getting a lot of interest. We've had over 50,000 applications. About 90,000 applications. We've had over 1,800 applicants from all over North America. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them? Or are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns for places looking for an injection of fresh talent? This is Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. Every week we turn to Larry Summersville Harvard, our very special contributor here on Wall Street Week to help us sum up the major events of the week. And once again, we welcome back Larry Summers. So Larry, I think we should start with the jobs numbers out on Friday in the United States. I mean, some say not too hot, not too cold. Some people say, isn't this good? At least it's not getting worse. I guess my real question to you is, I may not be getting worse, but is there a danger just in the inflation room anywhere it is? We have 5% year-over-year increase in wages. I think these numbers were about what we expected. And the sensible judgment was that we've got an inflation problem. Core inflation figures look artificially good. They're better than me.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,859,2022-10-08 14:33:05
12634," Problem, core inflation figures look artificially good. They're better than median inflation. And yet core inflation ran at a 7% rate last month. And that was more than for the quarter. And the quarter was more than for the half year. And the half year was more than for the whole year. So we're not in a controlled place with respect to inflation. And there wasn't really anything in this report to suggest that we were coming into a controlled place. The monthly wage number was relatively favorable. But it was pretty clearly distorted by the fact that you had a lot more workers coming in in leisure and hospitality. And those are low wage workers. The workers where wages are most flexible are going up more rapidly. So I don't think this is a number that changed the picture that we've got an economy that is too strong to be an economy where inflation is going down. But that is maintaining its robustness. But I think we are headed for a collision of some kind or other. And we've just got to manage that collision carefully. And I think the sooner we start managing for a slope, managing for some slow down, the better we're going to do. I think German Powell was way late to come to that recognition. But he now has that recognition. And he should be supported in that. So what do you think, Chair Powell, and the Federal Reserve will make of these numbers? How will it affect what they do in early November? I don't think these numbers are going to change what the Fed does. You never know what's going to happen. And certainly there's risk of some kind of financially traumatic event. But I think the chances of something that is large enough to divert the Fed are really quite low. So I'd be expecting that the market, which is anticipating 75 basis points in November and is anticipating 50 more in December, that would correspond to my best guess at this moment as well. And I think that kind of thing is going to be appropriate if we achieve disinflation. Larry, there's another strain of discussion. I've seen certainly this week. In fact, there was even some Fed staff work at the New York Fed suggesting that we better be careful. Because in fact, the rate that we may need in order to get down to 2%, maybe so high, it will cause financial instability. There is a really safety and soundness issue. What do you make of that? Is it possible the Fed will have to choose between financial stability in the one hand and getting inflation down on the other? First, I think that should be the occasion for some soul searching. If we have an economy where we think there's going to be substantial financial breakage because the Fed lifts the Fed funds rate to 4.5%. Then we have an inadequately supervised financial system and an insufficiently active financial regulator. And so if anyone believes that, along with whatever monetary policy implication they draw, they better tell us how they think we ought to be repairing the regulation of the financial system. David, my sense is that you can never rule out these kinds of risks. But the Fed has more than one instrument. It has instruments for specific guarantee lending. We've seen that used a number of times. And each time we're surprised by how much the economy retains its robustness. In retrospect, we cut interest rates too much and kept them too low when we were supporting the financial system after COVID. In retrospect, we kept interest rates too low and blew up a bubble when we were supporting the economy with low interest rates after Asia and LTCM. In rectangular response rate.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,860,2022-10-08 14:37:31
12635," It's too low and blew up a bubble when we were supporting the economy with low interest rates after Asia and LTCM. In retrospect, we were surprised, amazed by how rapidly the economy grew when the Fed did what was necessary after the 1987 stock market crash. So we need to regulate right to preserve financial stability. We need to have a very strong firefighting force in order to respond if and when financial accidents happen. But I think it's a real mistake to suggest that somehow we shouldn't do the monetary policies that are necessary to avoid inflation becoming entrenched because of concerns about financial stability. You know, David, the people who are still on team transitory, they're always saying that expectations aren't entrenched. The more it's true that expectations are not yet entrenched, despite high inflation, that seems to me the more important it is to move vigorously now with respect to inflation so they don't become entrenched. If they were already entrenched, we could discuss the right timing of a disinflation. But if we have the big advantage in disinflation of expectations that are not yet entrenched, surely we should be acting on inflation while we have that advantage. Larry, another big development this week was the OPEC plus decision to reduce production limits by 2 million barrels a day. Something that I think it's fair to say was set the Biden administration back a bit. He'd gone over there and asked the Crown Prince not to do that. It wasn't very pretty. So apart from perhaps any embarrassment on my cause, does it have larger macroeconomic effects for a globe that we are warned by WTO? No, maybe headed toward a global recession. There's nothing good in this. Certainly, it's not what we wanted to see. Actually it's a lot less than 2 million barrels because many of the countries that reduced their quota weren't hitting their quota before, so the reduction in the ceiling didn't really matter. And you didn't see a hugely dramatic move in oil markets in a way that was proportionate to the headlines that you saw. But certainly the risks are up and it just points up the importance. We always do a scramble about the immediate when these things happen and we don't forget about the medium term. Look, we made a mistake by canceling the Keystone pipeline. We made a mistake by slowing down all kinds of permitting activity. We made a mistake by being hostile as a country to natural gas. We made a mistake in the Congress a few weeks ago when we didn't pass the mansion program of expanding permitting. We crucially need regulatory relief where we're not going to get renewables online fast and we're not going to get the transmission lines that are necessary for renewables to become a large part of our energy fast. So the real lesson on this is we need a different kind of energy strategy than the one that we've had. We need a strategy that is balanced rather than an unbalanced strategy of total hostility to fossil fuels or God knows the kind of total strategy of favoring fossil fuels that we had. Even egregious favoritism towards Saudi Arabia that we saw during the Trump administration. We need to find a balance and I think we're making our way.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,861,2022-10-08 14:41:20
12636," Egregious favoritism towards Saudi Arabia that we saw during the Trump administration. We need to find a balance and I think we're making our way in that direction. Larry is always so helpful to have you on each week and I would like to say, Larry summons me to stay with us as we bring in Professor Brad DeLong, Professor of Economics from UC Berkeley, on his new book, Slouching Toward Utopia. That's an economic history of the 20th century. He's coming up next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. It is crucially important and I think we've moved from this attitude from its indulgence a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s and so it makes that a really exciting field because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harness to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts. But if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information and that's what you bring to use out while you're sleeping. Innovation, money and power collide in Silicon Valley and beyond. Bloomberg Technology with Emily Chan. Weekdays at 5 p.m. in New York and 2 p.m. in San Francisco. This is Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. Our very special contributor, Larry Summers of Harvard, has stayed with us because we're going to bring in now Professor of Economics from UC Berkeley. He's Brad DeLong, the author of a new book, Slouching Toward Utopia, an economic history of the 20th century. So Professor, welcome for joining us. It's really good to have you here. I've read this fascinating and really sort of protein book. It's really quite a book. Let's set it up first because it's a history of the 20th century. But you don't necessarily define the 20th century as from 1900 to 2000. You start in 1870 and you end up in 2010. Why? Well, the big thing that happens happens in 1870. Before 1870, the world's poor and there's no prospect for the world being anything other than poor. After 1870, every single generation, humanity's technical competence doubles and then doubles again in the following generation. And such an enormous pace of technological advance raises the possibility for the first time of a world in which we can bake a sufficiently large economic pie for everyone to have enough. And that was nothing that humanity had ever seen before. One of the remarkable things, Brad, that you highlight is that it really wasn't very different to live in the United Kingdom in the 19th century than it had been to live in the ancient world 2000 years before. Say something about the acceleration of growth that you see is happening in the 20th century. Well, you know, I mean, it was British economist John Stuart Mill, right? He was writing in 1871 about how all the industrial revolution had done was it had created a somewhat larger middle class.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,862,2022-10-08 14:45:39
12637," Mill, right? He was writing in 1871 about how all the industrial revolution had done, was it had created a somewhat larger middle class, and it had allowed manufacturers and the rich to earn greater fortunes, but that the overwhelming mass of humanity was still confined to the same life of drudgery and imprisonment than they had been before, that they had been in before, and before all the way back into deep time. It was very clear by 1900 that things had changed. You know John Maynard Keynes writing in 1919 looks back and says starting in 1870 we entered economic Eldorado and that now our chief task after World War I was figuring out why we tried to blow it up and try to get desperately back to what was good was going on after 1870. Fortunately we eventually did and so things rolled through up until our day. First of all, on Gizza's sense of what happened in 1870 that brought all this about, there were some three driving forces in your book. Well, you know everyone has an idea about just what it is that's made us as a civilization so wealthy that makes our economy so productive, and the different people have different things and they all go back, some of them back even to say the year 1070 when it turns out that the law applies to a German emperor standing in the snow outside of the castle that elies on his tool, but instead it could be that the law relies to everybody. But you get three things that fall into place in 1870 that set technological progress into a much higher gear than ever before and they are the industrial research lab so that you can rationalize and routinize the discovery and development of technology and then the corporation as we know it which rationalizes the development and deployment of technology. You know, to combine that with the globalized economy, with the telegraph and the I railroad and the iron hold ocean going steamship and all of a sudden the incentives to deploy technology worldwide for production are so overwhelming and people turn their minds to how to do this that everything explodes in a way it never had before. Brad, much of the academic discussion of your book has centered on this idea of a pivot point in 1870, but I want to ask about a different judgment you make which is that there was this major era and that the major era ended in 2010. I would have thought that the world was growing, it was becoming more integrated with technology, there were important political struggles, that was the stuff of history through the 20th century, much better in the second half of the century than in the first half of the century, the end of the Cold War was a very different war than World War One or World War Two, it was cold, but I would have thought that was a continuing process with substantial challenges and yet you see us as now being in a quite different era. What's different about the era we're in than the era you wrote the history of other than more of the kind of progress and change that you saw is happening every generation? Well I'm pleased you disagree here and I'm very pleased you disagree on our historic I adopt the most here about our future because look I've been losing arguments in person with you for 42 years even when I think I'm right afterwards and here I'm genuinely uncertain and I actually very much hope you are really right this time. My thinking was I've been listening to our friend John Furnald about how the underlying pace of technological progress has more or less halved since 2005 compared to what we were used to beforehand, saving those years from 1975 to 1990 when technology was crawling toward a more energy efficient and environmentally friendly configuration rather than focusing on labor saving.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,863,2022-10-08 14:50:02
12638," any when technology was crawling toward a more energy efficient and environmentally friendly. Configuration rather than focusing on labor saving. But after 2000 and after 2000, we seem to have a substantial loss of social and economic knowledge about how to run things. Things about financial regulation that I thought were in trend that were known in the bones. It turned out to have been completely forgotten in 2008. Things about the proper tools for macroeconomic policy that I thought were ingrained in the bone were also forgotten after 2010. And I remember UNI whimpering in 2012 that no, for the more expansionary fiscal policy, was not then a thing that ran any risks whatsoever. Combined that with the fact that from 1870 on to 2010, you know, first you had Britain in the United States. And then the United States as the countries that people were looking to for examples, as you always Leon Trotsky liked to say, as the furnace where the future is being forged. But now you go to China, you go to India, we even go to Indonesia. And what you find is that people say that the United States has very little to teach them. That we don't have any greater grasp on how to deploy and use these technologies to create a good society. And are in fact a society, our society that is more trouble. We're in more trouble than theirs are. Brad, if that is right, how much of it because of a running out of ideas and how much of it is running out of cohesion? One of the themes in your book is the sort of polls if I can put it that way between Hayek on the one hand, the market is king, and Polonium and the others, the market has to serve people. How much of the problems we're in right now are because we're lacking cohesion because of the dispersion in wealth and income? I think we're definitely lacking cohesion. I think dispersion and wealth and income creates work of cohesion. I am struck by comparing the United States around 1900 with the United States today, right? That around in 1900 politics was as fierce and mean as it is today. You know, that is, theodore Roosevelt denounced William Jennings Bryan as the puppet of a alien European socialist. John Peter Altgill, the governor of Illinois, who had not only been born in Europe, but also had dared to pardon anarchists. But there seems to be a very different flavor, right? That is, I think it's Ezra Klein talks about it, that somehow that our media and our communications today focuses first on establishing, you know, who are your enemies? Do you share any enemies with me? And if you share enemies with me, I will listen to. So as I say, it's a remarkable book. It's slouching toward Utopia and economic history of the 20th century. Thank you so much for bringing it. We only really touch upon it today. I urge everybody to read it. It's really worth the effort. Thank you so much. That's Professor Brad DeLon of UC Berkeley. And of course, to our very special contributor, Larry Summers of Harvard. Coming up, staying the course or turning tail, we'll reflect on some big about faces this week. This is Wall Street Week on Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,864,2022-10-08 14:54:25
12639," This is really a reminder isn't it just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see pressure on the U.N. and we did see pressure on the futures.

Welcome to the world of decentralized finance. Bloomberg's covering all things crypto, the people, the transactions and the technology. Bloomberg crypto Tuesdays. Finally, one more thought. The fine line between being steady and being stubborn. We've all admired those leaders through the years who have stuck to their guns when times got tough. British leaders like Winston Churchill and the darkest days of World War II. And Churchill's successor Margaret Thatcher, who was known for sticking to her guns no matter what. He wanted the council of ministers to be the Senate. No. No. No. And American leaders, like President Reagan at the Brennan-Birdgate, demanding that the Soviet Union tear down the Berlin Wall when it seemed that that was the farthest thing from Mr. Gorbachev's mind. Mr. Gorbachev opened this gate. Mr. Gorbachev teared down this wall. But those were the times when the steadfast were ultimately proven right by history. What happens when bold proclamations don't hold up quite as well, such as George Herbert Walker Bush's insistence he would never, ever raise taxes. And I'll push again and I'll say to them, read my lips. And then there are those bold pronouncements that have yet to be proven out one way or the other. Like President Xi's insistence that his zero COVID policy is the right one for his country. If you just look at the COVID zero protocols, it requires all people returning from abroad to have 10 days of quarantine. Or President Putin insisting that he will ultimately still prevail in Ukraine. If he thinks he's losing and may lose his office and even life, then he could become completely unpredictable. But this week, this week we saw something a bit different. Big bold pronouncements being completely reversed, not long after they were made. A big one was, of course, Elon Musk's change of mind, again, on whether he'd pony up $44 billion for Twitter. We're now hearing that Elon Musk and Twitter, of course, that resolution really said to be sticking on the contingency of getting that debt financing. And that is going to be the key clause that we're focused on going forward. But at least, Mr. Moss took a few months for his change of heart. Over in Great Britain, we saw a new government lay out a new budget that included big tax cuts starting with the top tax bracket. We love the tax cutting, but not for this time. This is just absolutely the wrong time to do this. Being immediate and violent reaction in the markets. She's trying to get the markets behind those two latter factors, probably significantly more difficult. And the Bank of England stepping in for the rescue. So suddenly, the Bank of England finds itself in the ECB situation. So Prime Minister Truss' newly minted Chancellor of the Checker had to admit publicly that they had been wrong, clearly and dramatically wrong, at least on those top tax rates. And it came only days after he and Prime Minister Truss had gone so big and so bold. I think it was a distraction. And I think it was the wrong thing to do. One can hardly fault a government for listening to its people, even if the listening might have come better before the deciding. But whatever the right answer, the one thing for certain is that at least in this",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,865,2022-10-08 14:58:47
12640," fault of government for listening to its people, even if the listening might have come better before the deciding. But whatever the right answer, the one thing for certain is that at least in this respect, Ms. Truss, is no Margaret Thatcher. To those waiting with baited breaths for that favorite media catchphrase, the you turn, I have only one thing to say. You turn if you want to. The ladies not for turning.

12641," in my pursuit of identifying the traits and skills of a great investor, I first looked into their backgrounds. I found many were raised in blue collar or middle class families, rarely where they from fabulously wealthy families or families where there was a history of investing professionally. But their path to a career in investing varied. Some like Ron Barron, the mutual fund manager and investor with more than $50 billion on her management, started investing as a teenager. After my birth, I was interested in stock market because I had friends of mine who had been given stock from the grandparents who were prosperous. In Eastman, Kodak and Polaroid, I said, I want to do that. And my father said, we can't invest in stocks. We've never done that, you know, family. And in fact, one of the ideas behind my business is the idea was I wanted to be able to have people like my parents be able to invest in the stock market. So I saw that and then he said, well, I had $1,000 at the time. And he said, well, if you show me why you want to invest in a company and you put all your money into one company, then show me why. Then I'll let you do that and open account for you. And so I did research, I would go to this brokerage firm and it was called McDonald's Company or from Cleveland. And they were right by Asperger Park High School. So I'd go there after school, sports and girls and stocks. I would go there after school and all these guys, old guys, 40, 50 years old. They're sitting there on these green chairs and looking at the tape that hardly moved. I think the New York Stock Exchange was 25 million shares a day and maybe American was a million or two million shares a day. So look at it. I got a report on this mom of the county national bank and I start reading it. And it was around the corner where I lived in Allenhurst outside of Asperger Park. And I told my father why I want to invest in it and he let me invest. And the stock was $10 a share, 100 shares. And then the stock every day for the next six months, seven months, every day you stay the same or win up an eighth. And it was printed the 15 stocks and then Asperger Park Press. And everybody said the same. And then it got acquired at $17 a share. So my $1,000 became 1700. I said, man, there's nothing today. I want to do that. So I was interested. Hedge Fund billionaire Ken Griffin also turned an early affinity for math and computers into an early career in stock trading. Let's talk about your background before you started Sadeel. You're born in Florida? I was born in Daytona Beach. My father worked on the space program back in the 1960s. But I spent my formative years in middle school and high school in Buckertone, Florida. And you were a pretty good math student and I'm told a computer nerd as well. Is that fair or unfair? Well, I appreciate the compliment because to be a computer nerd has obviously turned out to be a pretty good place to be in life. And yes, I was very interested in both mathematics and programming in high school. And it's defined my career and it has had a very important role in my life. So you went to Harvard College. Most students there are taking courses or their athletics. But you were maybe doing that, but you were also trading securities. Is that true? That is true. I started a small partnership my second year at Harvard to engage in convertible bond arbitrage, which was a bit of an off the beaten path occupation for a kid in college. But I had a great fast nation with markets and I had an opportunity to invest capital markets in my college days. And it was an incredible opportunity. It was a really great learning experience. But in those days, it wasn't common to be able to get stock prices instantly. You had to get a special terminal or special intended to let you get the stock quotes. Is that right? So it's amazing is is you know, I love the line. People go, well, that's how we've always done it. And I get to think back into the early days of Citadel. We're always did it meant we used a fax machine, which you and I of course have memories of. And the fax machine was revolutionary in the 1980s, real time stock prices were actually difficult to receive. And I put a satellite dish on top of the dorm room. So I would have access to real time stock quotes in managing the portfolio that I manage. And what did the Harvard people say? Well, personally enough, back in the 80s, Harvard had a general prohibition on commercial activity in your dorm rooms. So I had to go to the building superintendent to get an exception to put the satellite dish on the roof of the building. And fortunately, he was willing to grant me that exception.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,867,2022-10-08 15:07:42
12642," I had to go to the building superintendent to get an exception to put this highlight dish on the roof of the building. And fortunately, he was willing to grant me that exception. But not every investor saw their future in finance early. Real estate, Titan, Sam Zell, and myself studied the law became lawyers and hated it. I was always a good enough academic to get from here to there. So when I wanted to go to law school, I got seven A's. But I didn't get very many A's before that. And I basically used the four years of being an undergraduate to build a real estate business and build other businesses. And I just had a great time. So you were doing some real estate on the side while you were in college. And then you went to University of Michigan Law School. And to please your mother or father, you said I'm going to go to law school. But you weren't that interested in being a lawyer? No. Never. No matter if I ended up graduating and becoming a lawyer, and I practiced for four days. Four days? That's, I didn't realize you practiced that long. Four days. Four days. And so in the morning of the fifth day, I went to see the senior partner. And as only a 24-year-old could do, I looked in and I said, I just don't think this is a good use of my time. He said, OK, there's the door. Well, actually, what he said is, what are you going to do? And I said, I'm just going to go back to doing deals like I did when I was in law school in the real estate business in Ann Arbor. And so he said, one of you stay here and we'll do the legal work and we'll invest in your deals. And so that's what we did for you. And then there's activist investor Nelson Peltz, who didn't see the point in studying at all. What I really wanted to do was ski. So I left Wharton and I went up to Maine and became a ski bus. What did your family say? Nelson, we really wanted you to go to Wharton and be a good student. You're one of ski. I mean, that's not what you're supposed to do. That's correct. They did say that. What did you do? You said I went skiing. My father was an amazing guy. He wasn't happy that I left Wharton. He wasn't happy that I was a ski bum. And he wasn't happy that I grew a beard. But I did all of those things. And the snow melted in late spring and came back and I had a summer job offered to me in Mount Hood, Oregon to help them and teach racing to young kids in Mount Hood, Oregon. And I needed some money to get out there. I asked him if he'd give me a job on a truck 100 bucks a week, two weeks, that was all I needed. He said, fine, shave your beard off and do it. I said, I would. It was only temporary. So I shaved my beard off. And after about a week on the job, I started telling him things that I thought that were missed opportunities. And he set me up beautifully. He said, why don't you stay here and do what you want to do instead of going out to Mount Hood, Oregon? Well, I did. And that's what happened. There are also great investors like Paul of O'Lent, one of the country's most successful endowment heads, who came to investing after a completely different career. I studied paper conservation, restoring prints and drawings. I worked at the New York Historical Society for a while there. I then went to work at the Palace of Fine Arts in their conservation lab. And then I went to Los Angeles, where I worked at the LA County Museum. I did a scientific work at the Getty. And then I set up my own conservation studio where I worked with contemporary artists, like Edward Shay, St. Francis. And I was running my own business. And I realized I needed to know a little bit about finance, because I was working with very expensive works of art. I was running a studio. And so I started taking a couple of business classes at UCLA. And through that, I got introduced to Yale School of Management. And I got into Yale School of Management at the same time I got offered a fellowship at the National Gallery of Art, where you and I both serve. The Lyscher Fellow. And I worked in the paper conservation lab there, combining paper and paintings techniques for conservation on contemporary works of art. So you did that for a while. Then you went to Yale School of Management. My husband in a-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,868,2022-10-08 15:12:09
12643," that they're combining paper and paintings techniques for conservation on contemporary works of art. So you did that for a while, then you went to Yale School of Management? My husband and I had been trying to have a child and it wasn't kind of works. It wasn't happening, so he said, okay, well let's move to New Haven. And of course that was instant. And my daughter was born after my first semester. So I took a break and while, when my daughter was probably two months old, I went to David Swenson and knocked on the door and said, hi, I want to learn about endowment because I'm going to work at a museum. And this is about David. David looked at my resume. There was no finance at all. And he took me in and I started filing and helping organize things and little by little, I got projects to do. I remember he had me do a big research on soft dollars. That was one project I worked on. And little by little I became incorporated into the investment office. Coming up, we hear about the extreme intelligence and intention to detail that it takes for success on Wall Street. One of Sam's favorite samisms is we suffer from knowing the numbers. Hydrogen has a very special place in the universe. It's the first element on the periodic table. It is the most abandoned element in the universe. And when clean energy advocates think about what can we find which would be as easy to use, as fossil fuels, they think about hydrogen. The fuel that will, when burn, only produce water. We like to imagine that if we just built enough of these and these, we could ditch fossil fuels and save the planet. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. There are some things where you just need a good old-fashioned combustible fuel. Now startups around the world are betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today won't electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Buildings across America burn fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy, the electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels, we want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Another trait of great investors that shouldn't surprise you is they all tend to have a high degree of intelligence, many excelled academically. But true success as Mary Eardos, the CEO of JP Morgan Asset and Wealth Management, points out comes from training and continuing to educate oneself. So training on Wall Street, but specifically in Wealth Management, is a very, very long process. We have 2,200 analysts starting today, and they're going to be working through the summer. We have 3,600 analysts across JP Morgan Chase that will start at the very end in the September time period for their full time role. And we work very hard to go through in-depth training and then to work through which ones actually are good at stock investing, which ones are good at M&A transactions, which ones are good at helping people understand things in a more simplistic matter. That's a 2-3-year training program. With that, it's...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,869,2022-10-08 15:16:12
12644," M&A transactions, which ones are good at helping people understand things in a more simplistic matter. That's a two to three year training program. But that's pretty fast. If you think 10,000 hours is about what you need to master any subject. If someone comes in and has a regular, you know, eight hour a day job, five days a week, it's going to take about five years to have a base level mastery. On Wall Street, it's more like 12 hours a day, six days a week, that cuts you down to about two and a half years before you become mastered in something. Once they've got that under their belt, they can then join a team. And if they've been successful going through the analyst program, joining a team, then the team will work through how that works. But it is a constant education each and every day. Every morning we start with an eight o'clock meeting and I call it like a mini university. And it's not just about what you've read in the newspapers as to what happened overnight. It's about understanding how all of those components fit together in a client's portfolio. And then what might be right for you would be different than somebody else. And you're synthesizing all that information every morning. And then you're going out and you're figuring out how to apply it to each situation. Dawn Fitzpatrick, the investment chief for George Soros, is of a similar mindset to Urdos. For her, the constant pursuit of new ideas and new voices keep her ahead of the game. So I read a lot. You know, in the morning, I'll skim through two or three different papers. During my days, I'm meeting with a lot of smart investors and smart people running companies. You learn a lot from there. I talk to peers. But I think part of the trick of this big business is being able to really aggregate and assimilate information. And one of the other tricks of this industry is trying to find sources of information that are different than the other people in the business because you don't want to get crowd thinking. I think that happens a lot in this business. Everyone's talking to the same people. And a view becomes consensus that might not be really grounded as well as it should be in facts. Attention to detail also sets great investors apart as described by two real estate legends, James L. and John Gray. You know, one of Sam's favorite Samisms is we suffer from knowing the numbers. I think we've managed to tip through the tulips for the last 50 years by never allowing ourselves to get swept up in the enthusiasm of whatever the current event might be. And I think by maintaining that level of discipline, yeah, we made mistakes and that's to be expected. But we've all been, quote, controllable. No one mistake was ever catastrophic. The first deal I worked on was a shopping center in Chesapeake, Virginia, the Great Bridge Shopping Center. It was a $6 million transaction. We borrowed four. So it was a $2 million equity check. And you would have thought I was buying the island of Manhattan. I mean, I was down there for three weeks. I met every tenant. I was counting the car traffic. I was learning the business. And it was an amazing experience because I was the chief bottle washer. I was the waiter. I was the matredee because we were this tiny little business and I was learning it firsthand. Now, one of the most famous things in the real estate world is location, location, location, meaning that the location is everything. And also you might say it's local, local, local because most people make real estate investments kind of in the area they know. You've made investments all over the world. How do you sitting in New York know about the value of real estate in Europe or in Asia and how hard has that been to build a global business? So I think the key to that is to have a global footprint, to have hundreds of people all over the world. And it took us a long time to do it. I mean, we've been at this for 30 years and you really need talented people on the ground. You need local people who know the markets. The one thing I'd say though that is advantageous about real estate is so many of the trends we're seeing, particularly driven by technology, are the same around the world. So when we started buying warehouses back in 2010 and we noticed that there were these e-commerce tenants showing up and we started buying more in the US, it wasn't a big leap of faith.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,870,2022-10-08 15:20:35
12645," He started buying warehouses back in 2010 and we noticed that there were these e-commerce tenants showing up and we started buying more in the U.S. It wasn't a big leap of faith to say the same thing is going to happen in Canada, it's going to happen in the U.K. and continental Europe and across Asia. So my view is that if you have the skill set, you can evaluate plus you travel a lot like you, I'm on planes a lot. I no longer run the real estate business day to day. My colleagues Ken Kaplan and Kathleen McCarthy have done an amazing job but they have teams around the world on the ground and we're local in those markets and I think that's really important. You cannot buy real estate and Mumbai the way we have flying in and flying out of New York. Next we look at how skilled investors evaluate risk. We are 100% confident every time we make the investment that's going to be a big company. We are wrong a lot of the time. Watch Bloomberg surveillance early edition for the news you need when you need it. I'm Matt and I'm going to look at Kaley Lines in New York and Ann Edwards in London. It's ready a central bank. Raises interest rates twice as much as bull costs. Then surveillance for in-depth analysis. Alongside Tom Kane and Lisa Brownbottes, I'm Jonathan Ferro, the API Fronts and Sensor. How does Japan get away with not raising rates? Can it sustain? It's normal at a time when everybody else is facing a very different reality. Bloomberg surveillance, be informed, be prepared, be ahead of the game. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. It's just be honest, we've had sort of a shift in our way in some sort of circulation fears moment. People were talking about that all day yesterday. One of the easiest paths in life is to accept and follow conventional wisdom. But what great investors have found is that path doesn't lead to easy returns. Often, the biggest wins come from going against the grain and taking a risk, especially if you're a leading venture capital investor like Mark Andreessen or Vinod Kostler. Each top-end venture firm has its own bar. So it has its own set of criteria for things that deals should be done or not. Then the top-tier venture firms as a group have a collective bar, which is a top-tier venture firm going to fund this company or not. It's actually easier to answer that second question than it is the first question. If you've been in the business for a while, you tend to have a sense of like, okay, this is going to get funded by a top-end venture capital firm or it's not. If it is going to get funded by a top-end venture capital firm, and if my firm doesn't think it's a good idea, you do wonder who's right, right? Because the other firms are quite smart. So this is one of the regular discussions that we have, which is like, okay, if another one of these top-end firms is interested in it, that might be a very positive substantive signal. If the other top-end firms have looked at it and all passed, that might be a substantive negative signal. That said, some of the best deals in history have been passed on by a very large number of people. One of the classic examples, Uber was passed on by a very large number of venture capital firms. Uber was actually available to be invested in on this site called Angelist, where literally anybody with a checkbook can invest. So every once in a while you get these outliers, and it's fundamentally a game of outliers. The money is made on the aberrations. So you want to be generally open-minded and humble about your conclusions about what all these different signals mean. Now a famous economist, Herb Stein, once said, if something can't keep going on forever it won't. In other words, at some point things settle down. Do you worry that because the economy might soften at some point if interest rates are raised or just because of the business cycle, the wonderful world of venture capital will slow down a bit, and is that a worry for you? So it's a cyclical business for sure. It has a history of boom-buss cycles, basically just like any other sector of the economy. That's that, I guess I would say. We do not have a great track record in our industry of predicting these cycles. And I think most of how we either perform or fail to perform is micro-not macro, which is to say it's based on the successor failure of individual companies. And if you just look at the history of venture capital and startups, many of the best companies have been formed during the hot periods, but also many of the companies have been formed during the cold.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,871,2022-10-08 15:25:02
12646," of individual companies. And if you just look at the history of venture capital and startups, many of the best companies have been formed during the hot periods, but also many of the companies have been formed during the cold periods, right? And they're pros and cons of those periods. And so look, it's possible there's another cyclical boom and bus cycle, you know, our plan for that cycle would basically be to just keep going, keep working with our existing companies, help them through it, keep investing in new companies all the way through, and basically bet on these sort of micro level fundamental technological and economic changes that continue to happen. Most of what we do is uncharted territory. I would say the one piece that works really well in art business is go for higher risk higher consequences. So most people in business reduce risk, increase the probability of success, which is reduce risk. What at the expense of making the consequences of success relatively inconsequential, you might make two times your money or something. I, for art business, what works is I don't mind the 90% probability of failure if there's a 10% chance of changing the world. And that's very much the philosophy. It also goes with it's the right way to make huge impact. It's not just venture capitalists taking risks. Columbia's endowment head Kim Lu also says gains are not without calculated risks. I think the best investment advice I've ever received is the fact that we are in the business of taking risk. And so if you want to produce return, you have to be willing to take risk and you have to be willing to analyze and mitigate that risk the best you can. And to make sure that the return potential of an investment is equal to the risk, but you can't avoid risk. Now what do you think the most common mistake investors make generally? I think the most common mistakes is following the herd and just doing what everybody else is doing and not making sure that an investment is appropriate for your institution and making sure that the analysis that someone else has done is not appropriate for you or is not congruent with the way you think about the world. I think there are million ways to make money. I think there are million strategies that can work. Not every investment is consistent with your strategy. And so I think there's a lot of herd mentality and that's a huge mistake that happens. Now sometimes risk don't pan out and mistakes are made. Now I might sit and stew over the loss for a decade or two, but a truly great investor like Kleiner Perkins chairman John Doerr has the ability to admit a mistake, cut his losses and move on. When I first came to Silicon Valley, I hung out at Stanford on the second floor of Margaret Jack's Hall. And down that hall was Andy Bucknell-Shime, who founded Sun Microsystems, John Hennessy, who became president of Stanford, founded MIPS, Jim Clark of Silicon Graphics. What I didn't do is go down into the basement where Len and Sandy were starting Cisco. So that was a miss on my part. More recently I had the opportunity to invest in an electric vehicle company. And the conventional wisdom was venture capitalists, not to invest in electric vehicle companies, not new car companies at all. There have been 400 new car companies in the nation's history. Every one of them but one has gone bankrupt. But I was still very attracted to the market. And we had the choice of backing a brilliant car designer by the name of Henry Fisker or ambitious slightly crazy entrepreneur by the name of Elon Musk and Tesla. Well, we made the wrong decision. But Tesla did very, very well and so did electric vehicles. So when I make a mistake, I only think about it for the next 10 or 20 years. How long does it take for you to get over these things? Well, I don't obsess on these, but I won't ever forget. This is a market that over the past few weeks has made it clear it wants to go higher. It got a little spooked by the idea that geocal little potential rises. I'm going to name a couple of your babies.

12647," I'm going to name a couple of your babies. I don't know if I'm asking you to choose amongst your children, but you know some of the most recognizable buildings by you, of course, the Millennium Bridge, London City Hall, the Reichstag, and the Great Court British Museum. What was your favorite project to do? The Reichstag does stand out because first of all it's an energy manifesto. So it transformed something that was dependent on fossil fuels, it uses all the technology to produce something which is essentially carbon neutral and there's a public building, that's a statement. It's a symbol of a city, it's a symbol of a nation, it incorporates works of art, it's recycling and existing building which as I mentioned earlier is the ultimate in sustainability if you can, if you can give a new life to a building. It also creates public space of the roof level, it is the most visited parliament in the world, so it puts the public above the politicians who are answerable to them and that of course was made possible by the politicians.

Indonesia's economy is rising fast with massive factories, like these ones dominating the outskirts of Jakarta. I last met President Jokko Widodo, or Jokkoi, as he's more often known, in his home town of Solo, but that was almost three years ago and a lot has changed. You dealt with Elon Musk? Yeah. We left Jakarta's presidential palace by convoy for a huge Hyundai factory built during COVID on three-quarters of a million square meters of land. Jakkoi, who once ran a furniture business, has equally large ambitions for his country's economy. He's banned the export of raw nickel in favor of downstream products, and will instead produce refined nickel that will be used in the batteries to power electric vehicles. An equally impressive factory is being built nearby for just that purpose. If you work in a factory, it's a salary much higher. Comparing with the other industry. In the automotive industry, higher. Much higher. Higher than furniture. Of course, yes. If Jakkoi has his way, other raw materials will follow. Cold, box-ite, tin, golden copper, even palm oil. This November, Indonesia will host the G20. Jakkoi is one of the few leaders to have met both China's Eugene Ping and Russia's Vladimir Putin since the invasion of Ukraine.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,873,2022-10-08 15:33:20
12648," It is one of the few leaders to have met both China's Eugene Ping and Russia's Vladimir Putin since the invasion of Ukraine. This is a conversation with President Jacoe of Indonesia. President Jacoe, thank you for talking to Bloomberg again. When I was last year in 2019, you had just been re-elected. Now you're halfway through your final term as President of Indonesia. You are the biggest country in Southeast Asia. You are right in the middle of the United States and China and their arguments. You recently said the world was in dire need of responsibility and wisdom. My first question for you was Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan. Was it wise? Was it even responsible? Yes, the rivalry of the big countries is indeed worrying. What we want is for this region to be stable, peaceful, so that we can build economic growth. And I think not only in Indonesia, Asian countries also want the same thing. There was word that Nancy Pelosi was going to come to Indonesia and then you decided to change that plan. Is that true? No, no. We will openly receive but there was no visit. There now seems to be a more serious danger of a Chinese invasion in Taiwan. And there is a concern that if there is a conflict in Taiwan, it would spill over into the South China Sea, where you have territory, territory that China can test. Is Indonesia ready to defend itself or defend its land and waters in that case? So you're ready for that conflict militarily if it happens. We do want the region to be peaceful. It shouldn't come to the point that tensions rise until it affects economic growth and then later on affects the well-being of our people. In my opinion, it is very important that there is a space for dialogue between leaders, especially leaders of big countries. The global situation is extremely difficult and there shouldn't be further unnecessary issues. We are going through a food crisis and an energy crisis that hasn't been resolved. The pandemic still exists in some countries. Is that going to be a big theme for you at the G20 that you want to turn the debate away from these rivalries between superpowers and focus on issues like food security, inflation? Yes, it is better than having open conflict. It is better to have a forum for dialogue like G20. If there is space for discussion, we can discuss and have debates and hopefully come up with solutions. This is what we want. This is why we have a space for dialogue. I know that you have invited President Xi Jinping to come to the G20. Has he said he will come here in November? Yes, President Xi Jinping will come. And President Putin. President Putin has also told me he will come. Do you worry at all about the G20 being this conflict where you have the democracies coming forward with plans and you have Putin sitting there in one room like this and you have Xi Jinping with his own agenda. It will be a very difficult house party to run. At the G20 we do not want to add to conflict or problems but to resolve the problems. How we can resolve all these problems, not to add problems and conflict. The number of conflicts, you know, being to see Putin, you being to see Zelensky, you being to see Xi Jinping. Do you think?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,874,2022-10-08 15:37:44
12649," problems, not to add problems and conflict. Pugana by conflict. You know, you've been to see Putin, you've been to see Zelensky, you've been to see Xi Jinping. Do you think that by bringing people together, that that is a way to solve conflict? Sometimes it can increase it. Yama Sinyan, galo at Komunikasi. There must be communication, even if it doesn't necessarily resolve the problem. It is better to have dialogue than to have open conflict. When we started this interview, I said that you were in the middle between China and America, but having looked at Indonesia, I looked at the numbers. American investment in Indonesia over the past five years is nine billion dollars. China has invested 40 billion dollars. You look around here. We have a Chinese car factory around the corner. China is buying up a lot of the refineries and make precious metals. America at the moment is losing the battle for hearts and minds in Indonesia, but also in Southeast Asia. Do you think that is fair? This is an approach that needs to be renewed because what is needed by countries in Asia, including Indonesia, is investment. But investment, if it comes from China, we welcome it. If it comes from America, we welcome it. We are not going to be choosy. Bukan gitarma mili mili bukan. So, by a bow, you are not choosy, but one side is coming and saying, I want to invest, I want to trade. And the other one is saying, no trade packs. And I want to come and talk about other things. You know, Lisbah, that is a sambikang. That is why I said previously they need to renew their approach. You have dealt with Donald Trump, who famously insulted his allies and promoted America first. Joe Biden was supposed to be different, but rhetoric aside, is there any change? Surely Joe Biden is still saying America first? He just isn't insulting you at the same time. Indonesia wants to be friends with everyone. With any country, we don't have problems with any country. Each country will have their own approach. Each leader has their own style and approach, so there shouldn't be a problem. But now, what's needed by Indonesia is investment, technology that will change our society. Yang i takan mo, ngupah masarkat gita. I just wanted to ask you about ASEAN since you mentioned it. You have a group of countries, but it is one where you look at the countries. It includes Myanmar, which seems to have all these problems with human rights and so on. Why do you keep Myanmar in ASEAN? We already had a meeting in Jakarta with all members of ASEAN. All the leaders came, including Myanmar's junta, and there's a consensus, five point consensus. The implementation hasn't taken place, and the approach we have taken hasn't worked. That's the complication we're facing. There are several ASEAN meetings after that, which we did not include Myanmar participation. One very last thing on foreign policy, you've been to Goenci, Vladimir Putin, and tried to talk to him and you saw President Zelensky in Ukraine. I think you've focused on food security and issues like that. Do you see any sign of peace or progress there as the president of the G20? Yeah. I went to Kiev and talked to President Zelensky, one and a half hours. Then went to Moscow, Russia, to meet with President Putin and talk with him almost two and a half hours. But I want to see a space for dialogue after the meeting so we can discuss. Anywhere is no problem, but I see the chances are small. So I turned to issues like food crisis, and President Zelensky said they can't export because there were no guarantees for security to ship goods from Odessa port to Istanbul. That was the message I conveyed to President Putin. And President Putin said he will guarantee security for ships.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,875,2022-10-08 15:42:12
12650," to Istanbul. That was the message I conveyed to President Putin. And President Putin said he will guarantee security for ships to enter Odessa. Those are what I told the media. So what's the best investment advice you've ever put in to give anybody? The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day and if you keep at it and don't quit, it's a very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make? Selling at the wrong time. And they sell when the prices go down or not keeping. But people have conviction if they invest for the right reasons, just keep at it. Indonesia is an extremely resource rich country and the economy's potential is enormous. It has a third of the world's nickel reserves used in the lithium batteries of electric vehicles. It's the world's biggest grower of palm oil, the second largest miner of tin, the third biggest producer of coal and ranks fifth for boxite. Its grassberg mine has won the largest reserves of gold and copper. Resource nationalism is nothing new, but Indonesia's two term president is doubling down. After banning the export of raw nickel, he's now planning the same path for all the others. Jikoi is moving downstream, creating higher value products that will be used in everything from aircraft to semiconductors to touch screens and the batteries in electric vehicles. We want the added value to be in Indonesia, so there will be state income in form of tax, provide jobs in Indonesia. And the most important thing is that we can enjoy the added value. John, I'll give you nickel as an example. When we exported raw materials four to five, six years ago, the value was only $1.1 billion. Once we went downstream in 2021, our exports were valued at $20.8 billion, that's nearly 18 times, that's what we want to do with boxite, copper, tin, crew, palm oil and others. We are not being closed, we are being open indeed. U.S., China, Europe, want to come and cooperate, we are open. The messages you want people to come here and use these raw materials to make things. And so just to be clear, ferronical and pig iron, they will be the next ones to be stocked exported. That they people have to use.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,876,2022-10-08 15:46:21
12651," The next ones to be stopped exported, so people have to use them here. When we, the industry here, are ready, exports automatically will stop. What we want is to build a large ecosystem to produce electric cars, as many as we can here in Indonesia. The most popular thing in Indonesia is that the box item will also be in this list of materials to use inside Indonesia. Yes, that is correct. Not only nickel, box site, for example, is used to produce alumina. And then be used to make cars body or cars chassis. Okay, is this more beer? Exactly. You've talked about putting a tax on nickel products. You know, the next stage up, is that going to happen this year? An export tax on nickel products? Yes, come on, Ginnan. You're just possible to impose it this year? I can see around here you've had a lot of success. You and I went around a rather nice car factory and you have the electric vehicle, the electric battery construction. Hyundai, LG, Volkswagen and Toyota, Seamkin. The person who everyone talks about is Tesla. And you have a $5 billion contract to supply nickel ore. But you wanted to have a Tesla car factory. It now looks as if you hope to get a Tesla battery facility. And I wondered if you could give us any news on that. Is that any closer? Yes, we can think of it. Everything is a car-strike. If it is Tesla, we want them to build electric cars in Indonesia. From Ford as well, we want them to build electric cars here. From Hyundai, electric cars, from car makers in Japan, Toyota and Suzuki. We want a huge ecosystem of electric cars for the world. We don't just want to reach batteries only because this is just half of it. You made a very eloquent case and Elon Musk is a famously reasonable man. Why is he said no to the car factory then? It's still in discussion. Let's see later the final result. You have negotiated with Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin. Either of them is difficult to deal with as Elon Musk. Everything needs time. I don't want to go quick with no result. It needs an intense communication and the result will show. Do you think there has been an element, though? We're looking around here that it has been, tends to be the Asian countries which have been first trying to build electric battery facilities here. Yes, we have to bang it in Mumbang on. So, it's a big ecosystem. In the future, we want to build a large ecosystem for electric cars that is truly environmentally friendly. So, the energy will come from green energies such as hydro power plants, geothermal. Wind, sea waves, solar panels. The famous case of the palm oil. I think people back in April, you suddenly imposed an export ban on palm oil. The price shot up to $1,600. That flooded the domestic market. Then you changed your mind. And partly because the domestic market was so full of palm oil, you let it export, the prices come down. Some people would say that Indonesia is now a very honestly run country but it can be capricious. You change between these things. Do you think the palm oil ban was a mistake in retrospect? Yes. At that time, the domestic market situation, there was a crisis.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,877,2022-10-08 15:50:50
12652," At that time, the domestic market situation, there was a price spike of almost double, so we made a policy. There were several policies, but it didn't solve the problems for Monsan. So we stopped exporting crude palm oil and the domestic price fell. Then we resumed exports. I think it's okay, no problem. Will you remove the obligation to serve the domestic market first, the famous DMO, this idea that palm oil has to be offered to the domestic market first? Do you now want to get rid of that? Yes. How can we do that? If going forward the price is stable, we can remove the DMO policy. We prioritize our national interests. We will be able to do that in the next few days. When you think space, you probably think one space agency that travels under the radar is Issa. Which is surprising considering what the European space agency has achieved and how vital it is to the global space industry. We've collaborated with pretty much everybody who is involved in space exploration. The Issa wants to be a leading force in furthering humanity's mission into space. Come underground for your coffee. If we want to have a successful human missions to Mars, we are going to have to learn to live and work off-world in a different way. The place where we are going to learn to do that is on the move. And Issa helps humanity take its next giant leap. The world of politics to the world of business. Balance of power with David Weston, News and Melisys, inside, from and above politics power players. Weekdays, this is Bloomberg. This is a market that over the past few weeks has made it clear it wants to go higher. It got a little spooked by the idea that geocolat will potentially arise. A consistent thing you've been talking about is green industries and the environment. You have a goal to make Indonesia carbon neutral by 2060. As you know, most of your energy now comes from coal, coal prices have gone up. Will you stick to your pledge that you would build no new coal-fired plants that is gone forever? Our target is very ambitious. Forty-one percent, twenty-thirty, and twenty-sixth-y, we should be at zero. But this requires technology and funding. Money, the potential is clear. We have potential of renewable energy to produce four hundred thirty-four thousand megawatts. But to shift from coal to renewable is not an easy thing because the price to produce energy from coal is still cheaper than geothermal. You're sticking to your pledge that there will be no new coal-fired power. Yes, it's being done. It's just that there are still some that are still in the process of being complete.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,878,2022-10-08 15:55:08
12653," Co-fired power. Yes, it's being done. It's just that there are still some that are still on the process of being completed. Not new ones. Indonesia has an oversupply of electricity. Half of the emissions from Indonesia come from land use and forest clearing. 51% of Indonesia is forest and you have committed to keep to that level. But you are still letting people cut down rainforest, which is the really most useful bit. They're building other forests, farm forests. Isn't that the wrong thing? You should be protecting the rainforest first and then thinking about the other kinds of forests next. John, the forest fire happened more than 20 years ago. Since 2016, it has been reduced by 85%. We also do restoration on more than 2 million hectares of peatlands. Within the next three years, we will also do restoration for 660,000 hectares of mangrove's forest. In the past five years, we also imposed a moratorium on new palm oil plantation. Does it make you cross when people from the rich world like me appear? And countries that have already taken down their forests used their coal. And you have a country of 270 million much poorer people who have not done this yet. And we come and lecture you about this. Massive forest clearing is in the past. No more today. What we have now is restoration, revitalizing, taking care of the environment. I have required all mining companies to build a nursery for reclamation of their mining areas. We are working to improve the environment. I can take you to the nearest nursery center in Bagoor that produce about 2 million seedlings a year. And we will have 30 of those nurseries. Then you will believe that we are serious. Can I ask you very quickly about New Centaurar, this capital that you are building. 34 billion dollars. The aim is to finish it by 2045. This would be the new capital of Jakarta in Borneo. I wondered, will you finish the first stage in August 2024? Or are you on time in terms of that? I am on time. I am on time. The shift to a new capital is a long-term plan since the first president, Sukarno. It is my responsibility to put the policy in place, but we still check the feasibility studies. It will need funding of 33 billion dollars. And we will use state budget to cover for 20 percent, while the rest 80 percent from private sector, from investment. And this isn't just for two years. It's for 20 years. I'm confident with a good concept and with good returns for the investments, I am sure many investors will come in. You know that many people in Indonesia look at problems, look at challenges like building New Centaurar. That will happen long after you are supposed to give up. You are currently very popular. You have a 68 percent approval rating. And some people, some of your allies in the legislature have suggested you could amend the constitution so that you could do a third term. Keep building this capital, keep building car factories. I wonder if you said before you will follow the constitution, but can you rule this out regardless of the constitution? I will go back to the constitution. Let's talk about the new capital, New Centaurar first. There is law on this that is supported by 93 percent of the parliament. What's there to be afraid of with that much support? Secondly, an amendment of constitution, I have said repeatedly, I will abide by the constitution, although support from the parliament is at 84 percent. Once more, I will abide to the constitution and wishes of the people. Sayat badaqonstituci.

12655," Why has been traveling for two million years to reach us? And it's a remarkable thing actually, to think when you look, it's called the Andromeda Galaxy. And if you know where you're looking, you can just catch you out of the corner of your eye. If you think about it, you're seeing that as it was two million years ago. Yes, although I don't. Because it takes a light two million years to travel. I don't like being late to information, so that makes me feel very out of date. Well, it's remarkable. I mean, it began its journey before we had evolved on Earth. So in the time it took, and that's the nearest neighbouring galaxy. The web looked so far out that it's capturing light that's been traveling for over 13 billion years. But the universe has been expanding, and so the light has been stretching. And so for the most distant galaxies, we're looking back in time, almost to the big bank. Then the Hubble was not sensitive to that light, so that the web can see the formation of the first galaxies. It's essentially looking all the way back to very close to the beginning of time. And that's very important, because we're not entirely sure exactly how those first galaxies form. The idea of what you just talked about in terms of how much time this has taken and what it's covering, do you think we will ever be able to see the big bank? Well, we almost can. It's not the web telescope. There's something called the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation, which is light that was emitted in the universe. And it's a very precise number. It's 380,000 years after the big bank, which is not very long at all, about the universe is 13.8 billion years old. So we can see that. It's microwaves, because it's been stretched so much by the expansion of the universe. Going back, that the problem with light is that in those earliest times, the universe was so hot and so dense that light couldn't travel through it. So it's opaque. So you can't use light to go back earlier than that. But what we can potentially do, not yet. We're not good enough yet. But the technology we use to now to detect colliding black holes, which is another remarkable thing, but I'll leave that one aside for now. But we have the technology to do that. And that technology possibly could allow us to probe right back to this thing, the big bank. And again, whether or not that's the origin of time, we can talk about as well. Brian, you've dedicated your life to explaining the scale of the universe to people. You have a new world tour and show called Horizons. What's the goal? Are you trying to teach people new things and understand the world they're living in better or what are you aiming for? Well, actually all those things. So it works, I hope, on different levels. So I talk about cosmology. So we've spoken about what we call the large scale stretch of the universe, the galaxies, and how they formed, how the universe evolves since the big bank. But also, I've got very interested in my academic work in black holes. And black holes, and they're really evocacy things. I think everyone's heard of these strange things, these totally collapsed stars, from which nothing apparently can escape. But in the past few years, past few decades really, beginning work that Stephen Hawking really began back in the 1970s and many others. And we've begun to suspect there's a lot more to them. And they've started forcing us to reassess our understanding of what space and time are. And that's a really weird sentence you might think, well, space is the arena in which we live and time just ticks. But it really isn't, it looks like, from studying these things, there are building blocks of space and building blocks of time. And what I say in the show is, that's a mind-blowing idea. And I talk about that. But the key point is, is a great quote from Einstein, a beautiful story that Einstein told about when he was a little boy, he was six or seven years old. And his dad gave him a compass. And so he looked at the compass and he saw, well, there's this thing, this needle, and it always points north, points in this direction. So there's something invisible that I can't see that underlies our reality that's making this needle point, nor, and he said later in life, it was my first encounter with an idea, which is, if you look at nature carefully, and really pay attention, and you're lucky, you can catch a glimpse of something deeply hidden. Which is a beautiful phrase, something deeply hidden, which is the deep structure of reality. That's what our reality is.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,881,2022-10-08 16:08:36
12656," you can catch a glimpse of something deeply hidden. It's a beautiful phrase, something deeply hidden, which is the deep structure of reality. That's what our reality is. And so black holes, they're kind of a metaphor in a way. I talk about them as rosetta stones in the sky. They're the things that, by studying them, and you say, why would we study these things? Well, in studying these things, we're beginning to get a deep, a deep picture of what our reality actually is. And that's a remarkable idea. But it's a beautiful idea that runs through all of science. How do you define a black hole? Well, it's in Einstein's theory, which again, is a remarkable thing. It's published in 1915 over 100 years old. But it's just a region of space, from which even light can't escape. Ask questions. What do you want to know today?

If your satellite is going to come dangerously close to a piece of debris or another satellite. Companies have been doing that for decades moving satellites around, but it's sort of like a harder problem now. The risk of a collision is a lot higher now. Just because we've installed so much more hardware in the space, you have a big collision that creates a cloud of debris, and now all the other satellites are flying through this whizzing mess of debris. As we add all of the new satellites into space, the risks of the collision, the likelihood of the collisions going up. And by understanding what they are and knowing more about them, what do we then learn? Well, Stephen Hawking back in the 70s published a paper. The initial one was called Black Hole Explosions. It's just a great title for a paper. He calculated, he found out that Black holes in his language, he said, Black holes ain't so black. They glow in the sky, like holes in the sky, and they radiate. And so over time, they lose energy and mass and ultimately disappear of a huge time scales. And that's so important. And I show this picture in the show that if you go into Westminster Abbey and look on the floor of Westminster Abbey on Stephen's memorial stone, then you find his equation for the temperature of a Black Hole, literally chiseled in stone on the floor of an abbey. So you might say, why? Why is it so important? This was the key, this was this Rosetta stone idea. In trying to understand what happens, what happens to the stuff that fell in? When you thought these things existed forever, which is pre-hawking. Then you think, well, it's okay, it gets lots off inside, it can never get out, we don't care. But the thing evaporates away, one day it will be gone. So then suddenly you have to be faced with this question, what happened to everything then? If I throw a book into a Black Hole, is it somehow possible in the far future if you collect all this?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,882,2022-10-08 16:12:34
12657," We faced with this question, what happened to everything then? If I throw a book into a black hole, is it somehow possible in the far future if you collect all this so-called Hawking Radiation that comes off? Is it possible to reconstruct the information in the book? And that's been a question, simple question that's driven tremendous amount of research for 50 years. And it was pretty much sold in 2019 actually in 2020. Pretty much, I mean, there's still a huge number of questions. But roughly, well, the statement is, everything comes out again, all the information comes out. So everything that fell in, in principle, in the far future, you could reconstruct the information of everything that fell in, it's just an astonishing idea. Because actually the last thing I'll say is that before that, before the Hawking papers and before this modern understanding, inside a black hole, just according to Einstein, sits the end of time, which is an astonishing thing to say. Because we can see them. We have a photograph of one of these things in the center of a galaxy, too, actually. And when you look at that photograph, you're looking at the end of time in space. So then you think, well, if things go to the end of time, how does everything get out again? And that's the content of this tremendous work in theoretical physics. This work is to be in black holes, which is probably one of those things that a certain kind of person says is useless, right? He said, why? Who cares? It turns out that the techniques that have been developed and the understanding that's being gained from looking at these things, has got a very strong crossover with building quantum computers, which is a quantum computers are in laboratories now. They have a tremendous potential to revolutionize our civilization, incredibly powerful computing devices. Well, yes, and also that sometimes the defense given isn't about what's going into man going back to the moon or woman going back to the moon. The other things I discovered in the pursuit of those missions. Yeah, I mean, it's always a cliche, but it's true. A friend of mine, an astronomer, always says, when people criticize these spacecraft and they say, you know, let's say the James Webb Space Telescope is what, $6 billion or so. But it's appropriate to point out that nobody puts $6 billion in a suitcase and launched it on the rocket. The $6 million didn't go into space. It was spent on Earth. And what is often the case, it put inside the glory and wonder of the discoveries that are made, that basically you're paying people to do high tech jobs and do research and build machines that operate at the edge of the possible. And history tells us that that tends to be extremely useful. You're inventing things and trying to do things that are difficult. And that expertise never stays in one place. It then spreads out across our civilization in ways that you can't really predict or even quantify. Indeed. And you did sound very excited, I mean, you sound excited the whole time about all of this, which is infectious, even if people are trying to keep up, including myself. But when you talk about the golden possibility of there being a life out there, and that question of, are we alone? Where are you with that? What do you say to people right now with the latest information? Well, so this, again, it's, I think there's a, in cosmology, I say this in the show as well, it's one of the most challenging subjects, because at one level it makes us feel very, very small and insignificant. And it's true, you know, physically. I mean, the Earth is one planet around one star amongst 400 billion stars in one galaxy amongst two trillion galaxies in the part of the universe we can see. So we're definitely small, right? You can't argue that. Yes, you clarified that. But, but, you're right, if you ask the question about life, the answer is we don't know, we found nothing, nothing alive beyond the Earth. But I've missed it that we haven't been very far or looked tremendously hard, although we are looking hard now on Mars, because we suspect there might have been microbes on Mars, because there was one's water on Mars, and it was geologically active. And all the things that we think led to the origin of life on Earth were present on Mars.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,883,2022-10-08 16:17:09
12658," microbes on Mars because there was one's water on Mars and it was geologically active. And all the things that we think led to the origin of life on Earth were present on Mars around the same time, about three and a half to four billion years ago. So we wouldn't be surprised if we find that microbes existed, probably subsurface on Mars, or maybe on some of the moons of Jupiter or Saturn, where there's water today. However, nobody expects anything more complicated than the microbes. And it's interesting. So if you look at the history of life on Earth, you have microbes around 3.8 billion years ago, pretty much not long after the Earth formed in geological time. But if you look for evidence of complex life on Earth, then really there isn't any in the fossil record until about 600 million years ago or so. So on this planet, for most of the history of the planet, there was slime, basically, single-celled things, doing interesting stuff, photosynthesis and things, but nothing more complicated than a single cell. And it's only in the last half of billion years or so that you get this explosion of life on Earth. And only, as I said, it's only in the last, less than a million years that we've had at home, asapians on Earth, and in the last 10 to 1000 years we've had a civilization. So here, it took pretty much 4 billion years to go from cell to civilization. And that's the third of the age of the universe. And so that leads many biologists that I speak to to suggest that whilst microbes might be common, civilizations might be rare. Actually, I asked a friend of mine at Great Physician's Carol, how many civilizations do you think there would be in the Milky Way galaxy? Typical galaxy. How many in a typical galaxy? And he said, none. Right. None. And I think he's, I tend to say one. So somewhere between zero and one, probably. But that's a guess. But what do you, do you want me to say? I think it's a good guess. Brian, is that what it is? You sound like perhaps you have an optimism for it and I wonder what's underpinning that? I would love that to be, and actually because it worries me, and this is the way that I end my show, actually, it worries me that let's take that position. Let's imagine that in our galaxy, 400 billion suns, there's just us that thinks. Right. The microbes are all over the place, but in terms of things that think and can feel, and in a very real sense, bring meaning to the universe. All these things we've talked about, and beauty of these galaxies, they're not beautiful if there's nothing there to perceive them, right? They're just galaxies. So if that's it in this galaxy, then the decisions that we make now as a civilization have a galactic implications, right? We destroy ourselves, for example, deliberately or through inaction. Then it's possible that we eliminate meaning, perhaps forever, in a galaxy of 400 billion stars. And so that's it. I think that leads you to it's a good work in assumption that we have a tremendous responsibility in a sense, not to do that. So I would be much more comfortable with our current predicament if the galaxy was filled with civilizations. Then I'd say, well, okay, it would be rather stupid of us to eliminate all this beautiful culture and science and art and music that we built up, but at least there's someone else that's doing that. But I'm not actually sure there is. The world is a world of science. Companies now, they're getting hundreds, maybe even thousands of applications. So software has come in to automate the process. You want to write your resume for robots, not for humans. The only job your resume has is to be comprehensible.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,884,2022-10-08 16:21:19
12659," I'm in to automate the process. You want to write your resume for robots, not for humans. The only job your resume has is to be comprehensive to the software that is reading it, because that software or robot is going to decide whether or not a human ever gets their eyes on it. These things are programmed by a certain segment of the population that might not be totally inclusive or not be fully aware. Concerns about how this technology could exacerbate discrimination. For the FTC, I think foremost, the FTC needs to be making sure that we're fully understanding this technology. We don't trust companies to self-regulate when it comes to pollution. We don't trust them to self-regulate when it comes to workplace comp. Why on earth would we trust them to self-regulate AI? How comfortable are you with space tourism and the pursuit of that knowledge and meaning being left largely to a very small group of rich men? You're right, the idea that technology is used. If all it was useful, it was to send a few very, very rich people into space on a joyride, then there'll be a real criticism there. But that's not all the technology is useful. So I think it's important to understand that the space industry is about operating initially in near-earth orbits. And we've already industrialized that. We all use it every day. We all switch on our sat nav in the car, satellite navigation. It requires infrastructure in orbit. A lot of the stuff we know about climate change, resource use, and so on. That's coming from satellites. So I think you have to look at the space industry as a whole, really, and then say, well, it's not just about. The same argument was made for intercontinental travel by aircraft, and when the first, it's true. When the first aircraft were built, it was extremely expensive and the preserve of the rich. But of course, within a few decades, it had democratized travel. And we all take advantage of that every day. So I think that's the right way to look at space. It's not to focus on particular bits of it that we might not like for moral reasons or whatever it is. So it's actually, I really do advocate for the facts of looking at the whole industry, which is tremendously important now. It is. I mean, I am interested, though, that you did say, and correct me if I'm wrong, that all political leaders should go to space, perhaps for some perspective. Do you still think that? Do you still think that? Most of them should come back. Most of them. Most of them. They're like, that's the last part of that quote. Yeah. And that was, it was based on an idea, which is a very famous idea called the overview effect, which is well known. The astronauts change their view of the, or always, as far as I'm aware of anyway, when they come back, they have a more positive view of the value of this planet and are very much more focused on preserving it as a beautiful place, perhaps a unique place in a galaxy, as I said. So I felt that, and I do feel that having had the good fortune of speaking to many astronauts, that that experience, for the people who make the decisions, the big decisions about our future, could have that experience. I think it would be good investments. It's extremely hard arguments to make that we should actually spend money allowing, you know, in our case at the moment, our Prime Minister writes. In the UK, you'd say, well, we just spend money sending Boris Johnson into space and bringing him back safely to Earth again, because he would change his view. No, I don't think I win that argument. No, but I think there's a serious point there, which is that it does seem to change people for the better when they see our Earth as it really is, which is a fragile thing against the blackness of space. So I think it's an argument that I would try to make. I would lose it. Because it's very expensive. Do you want to go with it?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,885,2022-10-08 16:25:50
12660," I would lose it because it's very expensive. Do you want to go? Are you willing to go? I would love to because as I said, I'd love to share that experience of seeing our world from space. I think it's really unarguably. It appears to be a life-changing experience and it seems to change individuals for the better. You won't be scared. Well, I don't know. I mean, I remember one of my great heroes, John Young, who flew on the Apollo missions, walked on the moon, test flew the first space shuttle. And he said that anyone who sits on top of however many thousands of tons of liquid hydrogen, helium, liquid hydrogen oxygen, and isn't a bit worried, doesn't understand the problem. LAUGHTER So, it's probably right. Do you have people come and talk to you about faith? Do they talk to you about how religion and that side of life fits into your level of knowledge? Because I know you've traveled around the world talking to people. Yeah, a lot. It comes up as a question. Because cosmology is the, it's a science of origins. And actually, with the study of black holes, I mentioned, we're even beginning now to think about what space and time are. So, naturally, I say in the show, actually, I say, when we talk about this, it's the moment of creation, if there was. So, we're asking, was there a moment of creation? And that's the correct language to use, I think. Or it's the evocative language, but it's really what we're talking about. Did everything come into being? Or has it always been here? We actually don't even know the answer to that question, really. So, yeah, I can ask you a lot, because I think cosmology is a challenging science that challenges us to think about these things. We often associate that with theology or philosophy. And I think that's a good thing, because something I very strongly believe in is that segmenting or making little canisters and putting different bits of human experience or different music and art and theology and philosophy and science and segmenting the model is just the wrong way to look at it. But what we're doing is a deep level trying to understand what it means to be human in this tremendous, potentially infinite universe. And so, I, those questions get asked. And ultimately, I say, I'm quite straightforward. I say, I don't, I'm not a religious person myself. But the correct thing to say, even about the question, did the universe have a beginning in time, is we don't know. We don't know. And that's it.

Disruption is the whole point of a strike. With unmatched reach and resources, from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks, 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. Tag on the product may read made in the USA, but the sign on the CEO's door often says made in India. AlphaBets Sundart Pichai, Microsoft Sacha Nadella, IBM's Arvind Krishna, Micron Technologies Sanjay Mayhotra, and that's just the start. Add in the chief executives of Adobe, Deloy, Gap, VMware. And that doesn't count Indians running companies all over the world. Why have so many Indians risen to the top? For no coastal points to India's incredibly competitive education system, if you can survive the pressure it takes to get into one of the Indian institutes of technology, it gives you confidence to handle American universities and later the business world. Meanwhile, the belief in India's ability to produce so many tech wizards is reinforced every year. Indians make up about three-fourths of the immigrants receiving coveted H1B visas for the US. And it's a safe bet that some of them will eventually find their way to the C-suite. Thank you, Andy, so much for coming down. It's really wonderful to have you here in person. It's my pleasure to be here. Thanks for having me. And I just found out we actually lived in the same dorm in college just a few years apart. So it's been almost a year since you took over from Jeff as CEO of Amazon. And it's been a year of first, the first Docs Blitz since the.com boom. The first vote to unionize an Amazon warehouse, your first Bloomberg technology conference. Thank you. I want to start with a quick report card. In February 2021, Jeff Bezos shocked the world by announcing plans to step down as Amazon CEO. A few months later, he passed the reins to Andy Jassy, his longtime top lieutenant, the architect of one of the company's biggest profit engines, Amazon Web Services. Bezos has stayed on as executive chair, leaving Jassy to navigate a critical inflection point in Amazon's history. How does the company manage market turmoil, rising inflation and regulatory scrutiny and a push by some warehouse workers to unionize all while keeping customers coming back? Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, Amazon's second CEO, Andy Jassy, he joined us from our flagship Bloomberg technology summit in San Francisco. I'd like you to grade your view of Amazon's performance. We've got time later to really dig in. But quickly, how would you grade Amazon's performance over the last year with customers? Well, I think we've, you know, I'm not sure I'm the right person to grade myself during the year or not, but I'll give you my take. I think with respect to customers, I think we've done a lot of good. I think if you look at during the pandemic, which really has extended till the early part of this year, you know, so much as the PPE and food and essential items and people equipping their home offices were bought from Amazon and, you know, to scale the way we needed to. Remember, in 2020, we grew 39 percent year over year on a $245 billion revenue run rate. I mean, it's unprecedented. It's never happened before. But it was really hard to do that. And we had to take the really big footprint of the film and center footprint. We built the first 25 years of Amazon and doubled it in 24 months. We built out that transportation network and just.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,887,2022-10-08 16:34:54
12662," Take the really big footprint of the fulfillment center footprint, we built the first 25 years of Amazon and Double it in 24 months. We built out that transportation network in just a couple of years. You know, we nearly doubled the size of our workforce during that time and I think you saw it in other businesses You know, AWS is a really big part of helping Companies and governments have business continuity during the pandemic and so many companies and organizations in the last year Made the strategic decision that they were going to stop running their own infrastructure technology and disproportionately chose AWS to help them move to the cloud and we spent a lot of time helping them make that transformation So what about investors? I mean the stock is down significantly from a peak last year Obviously, there's broader market turmoil Yeah, I think you know for investors are financially I'd say it's mixed, you know, I think We have some businesses are growing really strongly if you look at AWS You know in 2021 grew 37% year-over-year It's not a 74 billion dollar revenue run rate business. It's pretty unusual growth and we grew a 58% year-over-year in our advertising business You know, what's the 32 billion dollar revenue run rate business? So some businesses growing really strongly and you know We've continued to grow in our retail business despite pretty crazy Comperables during 2020, but I think the real challenge for us there is on the cost side and there have been several things that have happened Some of which are more controllable than others You know, I think the part that's less controllable is really around inflation And I think we thought that inflation would start to attenuate in 2022 and with the war in Ukraine It just went the other way and has significantly accelerated so the cost of trucking and line haul and ocean and air and fuel is just substantially gone up and I think that will attenuated some point No one knows how long that'll take I think the more controllable areas for us are really around fulfillment center capacity and productivity It was taking about 24 months to build new fulfillment centers during the pandemic And so we had to make decisions you know in mid 2020 and early 2021 On how much demand we were going to plant for it and so you know We we end up with more capacity than we need right now And and there's a number of things that we're working on we we've stopped building on properties where we don't need it yet And we've let a number of leases lapse and not a small number you know of both those things We've had a lot of occasions in our history where we've worked on productivity made improvements And we have a lot of clearly defined issues and I'm confident we're going to get back to the right level of profitability You are going to sub lease 30 million square feet of space Is there a mistake in the execution there because of the overbuilding? Again because you have to make these decisions two years in advance and again if you put yourself back in 2020 Where we were growing 39% year over year on a 245 billion dollar revenue run rate It's very hard to know what's the right amount to build and you have to make a decision And we made the decision to err on the side of our consumers and sellers Now how would you grade Amazon's performance with employees your colleagues there has been some high profile Yeah I think that when I started in this gig we had just created a new leadership principle to strive to be earth's best employer And I think we're you know we spent a lot of time trying to think through what that really means is broad And I think we've made a fair bit of progress but it's still early in my opinion But I still think there are many areas that we can keep improving you know and I think You know the first one I'd I'd mention is safety You know I think that you know in our fulfillment centers that is the top priority And you know when you get into the details and numbers and outside of all the spin of it all You know we're about average there but we're not trying to be average You know we want to be the best in the industry and the best in the world at it And that's a high priority and an area that I'm passionate about and the team is passionate about And I think we have a lot of work we can do to make our employees everyday lives easier And we have we've identified kind of a top hundred list of areas that we can be better at That we're just metronomically stepping through and so we've made a lot of progress But we've a lot of work to you still Elon Musk just came out saying he has a super bad feeling about the economy Tesla laying off 10% of his staff Jamie Dimon says he's preparing for an economic hurricane The World Bank just slashed its forecast for global growth How do you feel about the economic climate? Well I wasn't planning on giving any guidance to the government",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,888,2022-10-08 16:38:55
12663," The World Bank just slashed its forecast for global growth. How do you feel about the economic climate? Well, I wasn't planning on giving any guidance to the camera. Please. But, uh, yeah. Super bad or super super bad? I think... I think there's some things that are related to Amazon that are useful to remember. You know, I think the first piece is remember that 85% of the worldwide retail market segment share is offline. And if you believe that that equation is going to flip at some point, which we do. I think it will flip over a long period of time. If you look at different downturns, you know, should we have one at some point? And we've been through a few, obviously, in the 25 years that I've been at Amazon, customers changed their habits. And so, you know, I also think there's, you know, those two reasons, those two factors give me some optimism that even if we have a downturn that we have the potential to still grow. We have a roadmap that's, you know, probably three to five years long. And we're going to continue to invent. We're going to continue to be insurgent. And we have a lot of work to do to get to where we think we ultimately can get for customers. Now, when it comes to the stock, as I mentioned, it has fallen significantly. Do you think investors are missing something or has tech just been overvalued? And this also, of course, matters to employees who are significantly paid in stock? Well, you know, I look, I haven't been at Amazon for 25 years. I arrived at the company three weeks before we went public. I have never tried to predict what the stock is going to do. And any time I've tried to a little bit, I've been wrong. So, you know, I think it's a pretty hard to predict what's going to be in any short period of time. I do really believe that Benjamin Graham maximum that in the short term, the stock market tends to be a voting machine and the long term it tends to be a waiting machine. And I think if you, you know, we've been through a lot of points in 25 years to be in Amazon where the macro factors are off and stocks are down. Our stock is down. But you can't really control that. You know, we have a concept we talk about a lot of Amazon inputs and outputs. You know, and the ultimate output for a company is share price. You know, and then other big outputs are free cash flow or profit or revenue. You can't really manage the outputs. You have to manage at the input level. And that's where we spend all our time. And so, if you do the right things for the business long term, things tend to work out. I think we've had very good returns for investors. And I expect that to be true again.

But there's an incoming revolution on the high seas that isn't quite as sexy, but could be significantly more impactful. Container shipping is the key component of global trade. About 80% of all the world's goods are transported to sea at some point. But there's a significant unseen cost to the modern era of global commerce. About 3% of all the world's sea at sea are two emissions. I'm from shipping. 3% may not sound like a lot, but that's roughly comparable to the entire CO2 output of Germany. Since reducing trade isn't a likely option, what about a technological improvement? To help reduce the emissions from these well-stocked maritime behemoths? What are the moon shots at Amazon?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,889,2022-10-08 16:43:10
12664," What are the moon shots at Amazon that are capturing most of your time and attention? What is going to define the next era of Amazon? I mean, is it Astro the Home Row? Butter, is it something else? Well, you know, we have a unique way that we look at big new investments. And I'm not sure it's right or wrong. It just happens to be our way. And we ask ourselves when we're considering something for questions. We ask, if it's successful, can it be big and move the needle in Amazon? Is it being well served today? Do we have a differentiated approach? And do we have confidence there, and if not, can we acquire quickly? If we like the answer to those questions, we'll go pursue it with a single threaded team that isn't distracted by the rest of the business. And sometimes that leads to innovation and investments that seem pretty obvious. Like, you know, when I got to that company, it was a book's only retailer. And then we expanded to music and video and electronics and toys. This seems obvious to people. Other times that process does not lead to investments that seem obvious to people. I mean, AWS was something that people externally and internally thought was a little bit nutty at the time. But just imagine what Amazon would be today without AWS. And I think that you see the same thing here. You know, there are so many significant investments we're making that I'm excited about. I'm going to have to constrain myself to a few. But you know, I'm really excited about what we're doing in the prime video space. I think we're clearly on the right track there and building a significant business. That's interesting because Netflix also just announced some layoffs. Yeah. First subscriber loss in a decade, Disney cutting back on costs. Do you see Amazon strategy as fundamentally different from Netflix and Disney? And if so, how? Well, you know, we're very bullish on it. And remember, we, all the models are a little bit different. But for prime video, we have 200 million plus prime subscribers who are, you know, get that entertainment for free by being part of prime. And so we have a little bit different pricing model than some of the others. But I'm incredibly encouraged by what we have coming. If you look, I mean, we launched this show. Reacher earlier in the year was a huge hit. We, you know, we had the New Maisel season. We just launched a new boy season, which is a big story. Are you a baby boy's fan? I am a big boy's fan. It's Amazon Vot. It's very good. Of course, we have, what are the rings coming up, you know, in September and Thursday at football. So I'm very bullish about it. We also, you know, we're excited about what we've done with MGM. You know, I think some of the assets there will go very well with the rest of what we're doing entertainment-wise. And so if you look at Warner Brothers Discovery and Paramount and Stars and Global, they're building really significant subscription businesses. So I'm very bullish about that business. I'm optimistic that we have a chance to build a significant grocery business, which is, you know, early stages for us. I am excited about Kuiper, which is our low-earth orbit satellite that we're building. You've got to remember there are 300 to 400 million people in the world who have limited to no internet connectivity. I mean, just think about how different the world is when you don't have that type of connectivity. And so I think that's a really significant opportunity that has some AWS characteristics to it. I continue to be very optimistic about Alexa, you know, building the world's best personal assistant. We have a 200 million endpoints already that are using Alexa. We're clearly on to something there. And then you are autonomous driving, ride-hailing service and zoos that we're building, you know, here in Bay Area. I just think with the way auto consumption is evolving, I think that also is a chance to be really significant business. I don't know if all of them are going to be successful, but if any one of them becomes the fourth pillar for us on top of Marketplace and Prime and AWS, we're a completely different company, just like we were when AWS became successful. So I think they're very worthwhile investments and bets and I'm optimistic about them. We didn't mention Astro, obviously, though, powered by Alexa. You mentioned Astro, yeah. But I mean, our home robot's going to be doing where I don't yet. Where is it? It's not really widely available for sale. What's the status? I hope you get one. Thank you. Everyone's very curious about Jeff's role these days. What kind of executive chair he really is. He said when he left that he'd focus his attention and energies on initiatives that he really cares about.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,890,2022-10-08 16:47:44
12665," What kind of executive chair he really is. He said when he left that he'd focus his attention and energies on initiatives that he really cares about as at Amazon, but from the outside it looks like he's really focusing on philanthropy, he's focusing on space. What kind of executive chairmen is he? Well, Jeff is always going to be involved and he has, you know, I feel very lucky to have been at Amazon for 25 years. I feel very lucky to have worked directly for Jeff for 20 of them. And we have a really close relationship and have for a long time. And I think we share a lot of the same values about customers and how important it is to optimize for customers and how high standards they need to be, you know, given how easy it is for people to switch and the importance of invention and speed. And so, you know, I just feel very lucky to have had the chance to work so closely with him. So, is your relationship, I mean, he was your only boss for 25 years, right? Is your relationship fundamentally different than it was when you were the head of the university? Yeah, of course. Every single job you have, the relationships different. You know, remember, the first couple of years I worked for Jeff, I worked as what we call his shadow then, which is really like a teeth of staff. And that was different than when I was starting AWS, which was different from when we got AWS going and it was, you know, a business that was starting to do well. And it's different when I'm in the CEO role. But, you know, the constant has always been that we have a great relationship and we collaborate really well. Amazon has poised to become the biggest private sector employer in the world. Second only, right now Walmart is in that spot. But Amazon will probably soon surpass it. First vote to unionize at Amazon warehouse. I know you've been spending a lot of time at warehouses. When you look at someone like Chris Smalls, who I think some people look at as this modern day hero who got fired, pulled off this union vote, what's your message to someone like him? Your message to the folks who think maybe we should join a union? Well, I know I think that the first thing to be clear about is that employees get to make that choice, whether they want to have a union or not. They always have had that choice and it continues to be their choice. And, you know, we happen to think they're better off without a union for a number of reasons, including the fact that, you know, it's much harder when you have a union to have a direct relationship with your manager and to get things done quickly. So if you see something on the line that you think could be better for your team or you or your customers, you can't just go to your manager and say, let's change this. You know, there's a whole process in bureaucracy that you have to go through to be able to do that. You know, and we get, you know, when there's a union, we're going to get the feedback filtered by what the union decides is worth bringing up. And we'd much rather hear from every employee whatever is on their mind. So, you know, I think if you want to continue to have the structure that we've had for all this time, you have to have really competitive benefits. And then I think if you look at Amazon's, they're very unusual in this space. We championed the $15 minimum wage several years ago. The starting salary is now over $18 an hour, which, you know, is more than double the federal minimum wage. You get full health insurance and 401K and 20 weeks up to 20 weeks of parental leave. And if you want to get a college education, you haven't had one. We have a career choice program that lets our fulfillment center associate be able to do so. That is a very unusual and compelling set of benefits. And those were all accomplished without a union. So, you know, I think that we realize that we have to continue to work on the relationship with our employees. And we need to continue to provide the right benefits. And, you know, we need to continue to work on safety. And that's our intention. You made a huge mark on Amazon with AWS, obviously. What is the mark that you want to make still?

I think what we see during this period of time is that communicating via video is not as bad that we are using all assets to our lives. The work for regarding for communicating, for staying in touch. The FTC has revamped its antitrust inquiry into Amazon and by some accounts is accelerating it. Are you preparing for an antitrust lawsuit from the FTC? If you are a large company that's growing to a significant extent like we have, you have to be prepared to be scrutinized and we have known this for some time, you know, many years and we have tried to run the company with that in mind and knowing that if somebody looked that we would stand up to that scrutiny and I think that's what we've tried to do in running the business. We can't control what, you know, whether organizations spring different suits against us but I think if you look at our business, if you actually look at the fact, if you take out of the equation that there may not be the most objective leadership when it comes to Amazon in that organization, if you look at the facts, you know, in our retail business, we're about 1% of the worldwide retail market segment share and remember 85% of is still offline and if you look in our AWS business, we, you know, about, depending on you measure it, 95% of the worldwide global IT spend is on premises, you know, and then we have a cloud business and then we have a portion of that, you know, we are leading market segment share in the cloud part of this but we operate, you know, who we compete with, AWS is really on premises, IT in addition to the cloud. So, you know, these are relatively small percentages of the entire pie and you can kind of step through all the businesses and I think simply because you've been successful in a few different businesses, doesn't somehow mean that you have a natural market power. It just means you've been successful in a couple different customer experiences but we still have a relatively small amount of market segment share on those areas. What about the SEC or being sued by them over third party data and how you've used it? Do you think in the past Amazon made mistakes with letting employees internally see how those third party sellers were doing? Well, yeah, we have pretty good control. I mean, we, you know, we of course disagree with the premise of that but I would say that we have very good controls with respect to the data that different employees sets are able to see. And by the way, I think that we can be better for sellers. You know, I think that, you know, we can have better tools from the get started, we can have better tools from the manage what they're doing across their different Amazon units. I think we can communicate better. There's a whole bunch of things we can do better and we agonize over every single email or communication we get from sellers and we do very regularly robust surveying and a lot more sellers are happy with Amazon than unhappy with Amazon. And I think if you look at what they're able to do is, you know, as a business by virtue of selling on Amazon versus not, it completely changes what's possible. Sellers don't really long for e-commerce software. That exists in lots of places and it's not very expensive. What they love about selling on Amazon is that they get access to our hundreds and millions of customers and that completely changes what their prospects can be in terms of the businesses they're building. So we have a lot of work to do there like we do in a lot of other places but I think we have a very strong partner.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,892,2022-10-08 16:56:06
12667," And that completely changes what their prospects can be in terms of the businesses they're building. So we have a lot of work to do there, like we do in a lot of other places. But I think we have a very strong partnership with sellers. What's the view of the supply chain right now and how much pain there is going to continue to be and for how long? Well, you know, I think that there's a lot of challenges in the supply chain still. I mean, it's gotten better than it was, but there are all sorts of challenges, you know, non-parasable goods, electronics, chips, that still really, you know, a significant issue for all sorts of businesses. We have worked really hard to open a lot more points of presence and ports and increase our capacity and getting products in, but I think it's going to be something that companies battle with for some time. You made a huge mark on Amazon with AWS, obviously. What is the mark that you want to make still on Amazon? I mean, in this new role, what's going to define the Andy Jassy era? Well, I don't really think of it that way, Emily. I mean, I don't think it's really about any Andy Jassy era or any one person, you know, and by the way, AWS was not about any one person. That, you know, if you spend a time on AWS, that is an unbelievable team, not just an incredible leadership team, which it is, but just top to bottom. The number of inventors and people care about customers and operate, you know, something where it has to work almost like a dial tone. It's always teams. And so I look at every single one of our businesses and, you know, take our retail business or our consumer business, which is the oldest for our businesses, 85% of it still lives offline. I think we have a lot of upside and a lot of growth. And I think as much invention as we've seen the last 25 years, you know, the time I've been there, I think it's going to look small compared to the next 25 years. There is a lot for us to invent on behalf of customers. And so, you know, I'm excited to be part of the team that makes that happen. You know, we are continuing to, you know, to increase the amount that we give back to the communities in which we have big presence. And that really matters to me. I think we have a responsibility to do that. And so, you know, it's a long journey that we're working on. But I'm excited to be part of it. And, you know, I hope you've started for a long time. Well, thank you for joining us and telling us about the way the journey is going so far. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.ÜÜÜÜÜÜ a lot's happening on Wall Street. I think Chey Powell said things that were indefensible. Need to catch up. This is Bloomberg Wall Street week. I'm David Western. We've got the information and insights. We think that's the next secular shift from businesses most influential and instrumental. It's knocking it out the bull path. It's a challenging dynamic.

12668," music I think we've moved from this attitude from its indulgence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s, and so it makes that a really exciting field because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harness to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts, but if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what you bring figures out while you're sleeping. This is my kitchen table and also my filing system. And much of the past three decades, I've been an investor. The highest calling of man time I've often thought was private equity, and then I've started interviewing. I've learned in doing my interviews how leaders make it to the top. I asked him how much he wanted. He said 250, I said fine, it didn't negotiate with him, I did no due diligence. I have something I'd like to sell and how they stay there. You don't feel inadequate now because being only the second wealthiest man in the world is that right? One of the most successful entrepreneurs in the world of cryptocurrency is Sam Bankman Fried. He's created the FTX platform and that platform has been so successful in the cryptocurrency world that Sam has become one of the wealthiest men in the world. As a result of this, he's now focusing a lot of his energy on philanthropy. I sat down with him at the Bloomberg headquarters in New York recently that talked about the future of crypto and his desire to change the world and make it a better place. So is crypto down for the count or is it coming back? I think it's coming back and obviously a lot of this is just going to have to do with the macro environment. If we see markets crash again, we're going to see crypto crash along with it. If we see a market recovery, we're going to see a crypto recovery along with it. But I think this is, it's flushed out a lot of the things that needed to be flushed out from the crypto space anyway. And when May of 2022 began, I think a meltdown in tech values and also crypto. Did you get nervous that all of a sudden the world was going to fall apart? Not super nervous. It's like it was definitely going to be a rocky road for the industry and you saw some businesses blow up when Bitcoin hit 20K. I think if we saw things melt down much further than they did, right? If we saw NAS Act drop 30, 40% from here and Bitcoin go down to 10K per token, I think you would see another round of pain for the industry that would potentially be more of a medium to long-term problem. So it didn't give you any gray hair I can see. Oh, a little bit. But I plucked those out to keep up appearances. So let me ask you this, when the Bitcoin world was kind of going down a bit, I think it Bitcoin peaked at 61,000 or something and now it's at 23,000 but it went as low as 1718. 1718, a lot of other cryptocurrencies went down as well. You bailed out some companies. What money did you use to do that? So there were a few different versions of it and one piece of this was basically FGX balance sheet like we keep our corporate cash.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,894,2022-10-08 17:04:50
12669," So there are a few different versions of it and one piece of this was basically FTX balance sheet like we keep our corporate cash just in dollars. And so we'd raised a few billion dollars over the course of the last couple years and we're profitable business. Now we'd also done some acquisitions which partially balances that out but we had some cash left and with the block file deal for instance. That was on FTX, I think FTX US's balance sheet. Well when Wall Street had its problems early in the 20th century, Mr. JP Morgan himself used to go out and say I'm going to bail out certain companies and you were called the JP Morgan of crypto. Is that bother you or not? It doesn't bother me too much. I mean I think it's something I thought was the right thing for the industry and you know our very explicit mandate that we sort of gave to the team of people working on this was your goal is not to make a fortune. For us doing this like your goal is to do okay deals your goals for us to not get our faces ripped off but contingent on that you know do as much as we can to bail out the industry and that that was the higher goal was trying to backstop places rather than maximizing on on these deals. No I would have loved other people to do it like I think it would have been great. So you went in you bought some companies where those investments profitable. I mixed is basically the answer I think some are going to turn out to be profitable some won't be like one of them certainly I mean with Voyager I think you know there's $70 million there is that that that we put in that I'm not sure ever seeing that 70 million again and so. You know we had to make snap judgment calls and we made them such that if things turned out well they'd be good investments and if they turned out badly they'd be bad investments but we sort of limited the amount that we could lose from it. So many young people seem so attracted to crypto I mean I know there are people from all over the world of all ages but it seems like young people particularly are very interested why is that. Yeah I mean partially it's a new thing that's going to appeal to younger people but I think another aspect of this is if you're you know 21 years old and you're trying to get access to markets you want to be able to to trade to invest. You can sign up for an account on the crypto exchange and get full market access if you try and get that same love of access in equity using commodities you can't get it you're going to end up with heavily intermediate access that has like pretty limited amounts of real interactiveness limited amounts of liquidity limited amounts of size and so I think for a you know natively digital generation that's looking to take more control of their finances actually being able to do it with crypto is a big big difference. So in your own case you got involved with crypto at what age? I was boy I guess it was 25 or so. And did you ever imagine that at 25 when you got involved you would now be one of the most important people in the crypto world and have become a multi billionaire? Well no although the crypto world's lesser grown quite a bit since I got involved but I was surprised at how big how big things grew in general how big you know I was able to grow things. I thought there was a chance of it like I did see pretty high upside when I got involved I was surprised that we actually got there. So today you're running FTX you started FTX in what year? 2019. And what does it actually do? So it's a cryptocurrency exchange is what we call it but really it's a combination of a few different businesses. If you compare it to traditional finance right you have you know the New York socket changed NASDAQ I sense see me as the exchanges and that that's where bids and offers cross but you don't go to New York socket exchange. So they are primarily the sort of backend trading infrastructure separately have brokerages F.C.M.s and other businesses that sit in the front that you know consumers access and then you have different settlement and sort of custody parties sitting in the middle there. And so what's going to be a trip to all that gets squashed traditionally into one entity and so what FTX is it's sort of all of those things it's a backend you know match engine risk engine custody system say front end mobile app website API and everything in between so that you know if you want to buy or sell a Bitcoin you can go to FTX.com and you know we offer all the services necessary to that except for buying and selling. You got involved because you thought it would be a creative new area to get involved with but was making a lot of money at one of your goals. Yeah it was and in particular when I was in college I sort of want to allow charity said I really respected and said hey what can I do to help you guys out like.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,895,2022-10-08 17:09:18
12670," One of your goals? Yeah, it was. And in particular, when I was in college, I started going to a lot of charities that I really respected and said, hey, what can I do to help you guys out? Like, do you want me to work for you? And they basically said, not really. I mean, you could, but they'd be kind of mediocre. You know, what they say is they'd rather my money than my time. And so I ended up going on to Wall Street and then getting involved with Kirby with the goal of donating what I made. So you're moving in on me quick, just trying to be with your fancy hands. I'm going to deal with your night, because it's really bothering me. Ah, my night. Yeah. He's a troublemaker. Yeah. How did you get up to this weekend? You know, just robot stuff. A lot of chess. I was practicing for you. I know you're pretty good. Ooh, I don't like that. I will take this. Oh, put it over here here. Not cool. Not cool. All right. I will. I will concede. I can see. Ah. You've got me, Bid. Very good game. Well played. Thank you, sir. Thank you. So let's go back to your youth, not that you're old now. You're how old? 30 years old. 30 years old. So let's go back to, let's say, when you were growing up, you grew up in California? Yep, on Stanford campus. And your parents were both professors at Stanford Law School. Yeah. And one's name was Professor Fried. Yep. And one is Professor Bankman. So whose idea was it to combine the two into one name? I think they kind of both had the idea. I think there's a little bit hashing out of exactly what that would look like, would it be Bankman Fried, would it be Fried Bankman? But I think they kind of mutually came to that decision. So if you got married someday and you have a **** show, yeah. So you'd have two hyphens? Right. Well, especially if I married someone with a hyphenated last name, right, then you've got four names. I think at that point, we just have to roll a die and choose one. Oh, wow. Okay. So you've thought about that? Yeah. I mean, you could also just use a totally new name. But would it be particularly attractive to find somebody who had a hyphenated name or not really? Oh, I think it would be worth one good story. That's why I get out of it on the scale of life partners, not the most important criteria. Okay. So you're growing up. Your parents are distinguished professors at Stanford Law School. Were you interested in the law at any point or not? Not at all growing up. I think I've become more interested in it recently. But, you know, I mean, when it's growing up, my parents told me, look, you can do whatever you want with your life. We don't particularly recommend that you become a lawyer, but, you know, you're welcome to do whatever you want. So you were a bit of a math prodigy when you were younger? I was certainly better at math than I was at reading or literature. So you went to MIT? Yep. And when you got there, did you find that people were smarter than you thought or not as smart as you thought? I think smarter than I thought, I think maybe some part of me had hoped that I would, you know, be able to live a life where I, you know, was always clearly sort of like, you know, an outlier on that. And I think MIT taught me that wasn't true. But there were a lot of other really smart people in the world. And, you know, was really interesting and cool getting to know them. So when you get to MIT, did you say, look, I'm going to go out and become a multi-billionaire before I'm 30? No, I had no idea what I was going to do. I mean, I, I, I weekly thought I was going to become a professor, not for any particular reason. I realized I didn't really like academia when I was there, and that left me kind of a little bit lost about what I would actually do with my life. So what did you major in? Physics, technically, I, I took about the bare minimum that you could imagine. It took maybe seven or eight physics classes my whole time there. So what did you really take courses in math or? I took some of my minor in math, but I took a kind of popery of classes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,896,2022-10-08 17:13:49
12671," and math or I took some I minor in math but I took a kind of popery of classes you know some polycyclasts some econ some psychology but really I also didn't take that many classes and and sort of got a little burnt out of academia and so when you graduated what did your parents say you're to you about what you should do upon graduation. I mean mostly they said I should do what I wanted and what like I thought was whatever I thought would be exciting and you know they're going to support me with whatever but I you know going to like junior year of college I had no idea what that was going to be I sort of had just ruled out or soft rolled out academia and didn't know what was going to replace it. I ended up interning at Jane Street a finance firm after my junior year and and really liked it there and was starting to chart a path forward of donating money. Okay so what did you do upon graduation you took a job in finance. Yep went back to Jane Street worked their full time and what did they do? They're quant trading firm so I was on the internationally TFTASK basically that means you have a US listed fund that owns a lot of foreign stocks so you know you could look at EEM US listed ETF that owns a bunch of emerging market companies you know across Asia across Lodham and you know few places in Europe and it's basically a combination of like modeling computer trading and real time intuition kind of assembled together. And how many years were you doing that? About three three and a half years. Alright then after that you said I'm going to go start something in the crypto world. Not quite so I left in late in this is fall 2017 roughly not sure what it was actually going to do next what I'd really done was sort of written down like 12 things I could do with my life and felt like a lot of them were compelling and I didn't know what was going to be best but that you know the only way to try would be to to so leave and just dive into some of them. Right so you started your own company. What was it called? So I'll meet a research the first company started up and it was a crypto-quant trading firm and you know the sort of founding if it was basically well you know Bitcoin was trading on a lot of different crypto exchanges and it was not trading at the same price on all of them. So you might see it trading for $10,000 on Coinbase and $10,100 on Bet Stamp and you know in theory there's a 1% arbitrage to do their trading those against each other. Alright so you just started to mirror less trade Bitcoin or other crypto's and take some arbitrage advantage and it was a profit of why presume. Yep it was it was a huge amount of logistical work like finding the trade to the easy part the hard part was getting the account sending wire transfers opening up entities and all of the other sort of operational work that went into actually being able to execute. Normally then people start companies to get venture capital money and those venture capital's own a piece of it. Did you get venture capital money? I did not for Alameda and part of this was you know we talked with some VC firms and our petries basically hey guys good news bunch of 25 year olds. We don't really know what a Bitcoin is but we're trading it. Also this is all crypto and you know we got to start up together none of us has run a company before and we'd like $100 million by next Tuesday ideally. It was not a very compelling pitch. So you got turned down. Oh yeah I mean no one you know people like all that's so cool like I hope you find success and you know no one was and so what we ended up doing was basically cobbling together lines of credit and other things from various sources trying to sort of snowball and be able to build on ourselves. Okay so after that you started another company FTX. Yeah now what is FTX do that your first company didn't do so Alameda is buying and selling like it's trading for its own book and you know trying to to to do profitable trades FTX you can think of it as infrastructure it's markets infrastructure so everything that sits between a buyer and a seller so FTX doesn't buy and sell itself but it's a venue where people can go to trade crypto and and you know that that aims to solve sort of every piece in between those two parties from you know the clearing and settlement and custody the you know anti money laundering know your customer policy is a compliance you know the match engine the risk engine the front end and everything else. Right so why does somebody come to FTX and use you as opposed to one of the other similar exchanges. Yeah I mean you know to each his own but the things that I think we've particularly specialized in and been good at you know one we've been pretty you know fast moving and innovative you know we're a relatively new venue but we put a lot of thought into exactly how our products are are you still the only thing. For colleagues.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,897,2022-10-08 17:18:13
12672," be specialized and been good at. One, we've been pretty fast moving and innovative. We're a relatively new venue, but we've put a lot of thought into exactly how our products are designed. Where's the company based? So we have a lot of offices for regulatory reasons. So as an example, we have a new Tokyo office with a bunch of people in it because we now have a JFSA type one financial services license there. So we have little bases in a number of the jurisdictions that we are licensed and regulated in. But our biggest office is in the United States, it's Chicago, and out to the United States is NASA on the Bahamas. All right, so you live in NASA? That's right. And is that a tough place to live? It's really tough. It's a hard life. And so how do you put up with the pleasure of going to the beach or not versus working? I'm, you know, for better or for worse, not the person most tempted in the world to go to the beach. I enjoy it being there. I like going there once every couple months, but I don't spend a lot of time outside. I'm pretty much just in the office. So you don't look like you have a tan or anything? No, no, not so much. In the case of crypto currencies today, I think it's now is a time to get in. It's good, or now is a time to wait to see where the market's going. The biggest thing I would say is don't put in more than you're fine losing. Imagine simply climbing a cable into space. The concept is known as the space elevator. Not only could it significantly change how we leave planet Earth, but it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space. And there are scientists who think we could have already built it. We have the material. We have the technology. We have the lasers. We have the climbers. We have all of it. If a private entity wants to build it, or a government, they can build it. It'll change society. We have no clue how colonizing in the space, how really spreading out of space, really change our society over the next 50 to 200 years. It'll be completely different.

Your output is pretty much standard. It's some kind of T-shirt, shorts, tennis shoes. Is that what you wear all the time? When I go to Washington, DC, I have a suit there because I have to wear it on the hill, but outside of that, yeah. So are you thinking of buying a house to live in or where do you live? I so I live in nine colleagues and I bought a large apartment together on your office that we live in. And I don't, I mean, I'm sort of really fortunate to be able to have a really comfortable life and not have to worry ever about money for myself, but I'm not particularly excited to dive into luxury. I'm not excited about yachts. And I both think it's not what I should do with my money. I think I should be thinking about how I can help the world with it. And I also just isn't who I am. So do you go to Washington, much to lobby with members of Congress and or regulators? And is that an uplifting experience for you? It's, so I go a lot. I'm there probably.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,898,2022-10-08 17:22:21
12673," So, if you go to Washington, much to lobby with members of Congress and or regulators, and is that an uplifting experience for you? It's, so I go a lot. I'm there probably every few weeks. And it's been a surprisingly uplifting experience. I was not expecting that. I was expecting it to be a real slog. And I think it could have been in a slightly different universe where you saw continued boards going on between regulators and the industry. What we've tried really hard to do over the last year was get the industry to a place where it is happy to accept sensible regulation. And I think that's helped turn down the volume a little bit on the arguments and get to a place where most people are honestly trying to engage on what's the important federal oversight that we need to give to the industry. How can we do that in a way that makes sense given how the industry operates? The crypto industry seems to want to be regulated by the CFTC and some people want the SEC to be the principal regulator. Do you have a view on this? So in the end both are going to be regulators. And the CFTC is going to regulate commodity futures. So it's going to regulate very likely futures on tokens that are not securities. The SEC is very likely going to end up regulating spot security token markets. And there's some territory in between there when you look at spot commodity markets, when you look at what a security token futures regime might look like. Those may end up as joint regimes. They may end up in one place or the other. And in principle I'm fine with either regulator or any combination of them. I think that the non-security token aspect of this is a nice fit for the CFTC regime. Now in our country when you want to have some influence with government very often people make campaign contributions as they're called. And you've become a large donor to political candidates. Is it because you want some influence on the policy of crypto or is it just you think these candidates are good public servants? It's mostly just looking for good public servants like that is by far the most important thing to me and look there are a lot of issues that matter. But there's also just this correlated aspect of like are they going to be fighting to what they think is right for the country in general. And you know the single issue that I have sort of spent the most time you know thinking about the most money you know donate to on the political side is pandemic prevention. Which is nothing to do with crypto. But it's you know ultimately what I think is you know one of the most important issues for the world over the next. So how do you find political fundraisers they come to you directly? Is it easy to get to you and say we need this money for this candidate and what type of candidates do you tend to support? Oh yeah well if you if I you know pulled out my phone here and just looked at my last 10 text messages you know about half of them are going to be people asking for you know politicians are asking for for contributions but those you have a political expert advisor. Yeah so I obviously ignore the text messages. I've got a few people on the ground in DC who are sort of actually running the operations days. So when you give money to a candidate and he or she gets elected do they respond to you when you call them later or not really? Some do some don't and it's you know always super happy to talk but it's not generally the primary goal like the primary goal is generally that I thought they would be a good legislator. Do you get involved with presidential campaigns are you going to be involved in this campaign that's coming up in a couple years? It's a good question the answer is maybe it totally depends on who's running on what the race looks like. I'll give a couple thoughts the first is you know I might be very involved I might not be involved at all. I might be involved on either side or both and in general my sense is that primaries are really important and I think this is true for the presidency as well. I think this is something a lot of people miss is that if your goal is partisan then you basically have to operate in general elections that's when you know partisan splits are determined but if your goal is getting like good public servants and people who are really fighting for it's right for the country there are people who don't fit that description on both sides of the aisle and you know you have these contests which are way lower stakes from a partisan perspective it gets rid of a lot of the noise and competition and you know they're great opportunities to support people who would just be good public servants. So you support people of both parties? Yeah. Okay and today you would not consider running for office yourself right? I would be an insane thing for me to do is a fourth job to tack on to you know the other things I'm doing. And can you see doing this for another 10 years 20 years 30 years like this? I think so I don't. I mean when I get burnt out I get burnt out because I'm out of useful things to do on a topic I don't tend to get burnt out from worker's strength.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,899,2022-10-08 17:26:52
12674," years, 20 years, 30 years like this? I think so. I don't, I mean, when I get burnt out, I get burnt out because I'm out of useful things to do on a topic. I don't tend to get burnt out from worker stress. Crypto came along relatively recently. I guess Bitcoin was invented in 2009, but yeah, but relatively recently it's become a big phenomenon. Do you see any other phenomenon like that that you might get involved with as well? Potentially. I mean, look, eventually AI. I think, you know, right now we're at the stage of AI being mediocre chat bots instead of really bad chat bots, but that's going to change over time and you know, mark to 10, 20 years from now, we may be having a very different conversation. So I have not bought any cryptocurrencies. I have invested in companies that service the industry, but I haven't bought crypto at myself. Let's suppose I said I wanted to buy some cryptocurrencies. What would you recommend to me or anybody else? Well, first thing is I try not to give an investment advice and you know, what I would say is the most effective and, you know, useful thing you can do is just try everything out. You know, I think I've been really interested in a few different areas of the space. I think it's been interested in scalable blockchains. I've been interested in obviously in the exchange and platforms based especially on the regulated side. And then I'm super excited about the potential for blockchain-based social media to be sent that there are projects coming out, you know, in that area around where mittences and payments and around market structure, those are the places I'm looking at the most right now. So in the case of crypto currencies today, you think it's now as a time to get in, it's good or now as a time to wait to see where the market's going. So I think what I would say is there's potentially a lot of profit you could make. You could also lose though. Like things can go up, things can go down. There is a lot of upside potential. The biggest thing I would say is don't put in more than you're fine losing. Like don't put in money that you would be really, really sad to lose into crypto right now. Think of it more as an upside play. When you leave this interview and you go outside, can you walk down the streets of New York without anybody bothering you? It's borderline. So I think probably a half a percent or a third of a percent or something of a people recognize me here. And so the real answer is like every 10 minutes that I'm walking on the streets, someone will recognize me roughly. It's a little bit in between. What you can do is get a comb, comb your hair, get a suit and then people will be able to be your disguise. It's true. I could just look normal and that would, yeah. Like you haven't thought of that. No, that's beyond me. So as you look back on your career, what would you say is the best investment advice you've ever received? Probably the best investment advice that I never received. The best thing that I've lived my whole life around is surround yourself with really good people. I thought about it just today. Like I do many times, you know, what makes a great investor? A great investment firm is comprised of people who are optimists and pessimists and realists. Because in the intersection of the debates that go across that wide range of personalities is where you find truth. It's part of the reason I'm so focused on freedom of expression. I see it my own four walls, the robust and fulsome debates around how we commit our capital, what defines a good idea, what businesses to build or pursue. That's what drives the success at Citadel. And I've been very fortunate in life to have always had a group of friends who really push me, who make me better.

Is that going to provide some fertile ground for some revolutionary new company to emerge? One that could completely change the way that the world thinks about finance? Now that we understand how so much crypto wealth just evaporated in a few short months, let's try to understand what happens next. Who's left standing after this historic collapse? What about the lessons that we can learn from the crash? And what about the opportunities? Who are the people out there and the companies that are hunkering down right now in building? And what are they building? What's going to rise out of this? How does the industry earn back the trust of people who were scared off in the sell-off? And how will companies have to work with regulators who might not like crypto that much? I'm just saying if I had a block five backpack, I would absolutely wear it. To work? Yeah. If you saw me in the building with that backpack on, I would love. You would love. And that's all I'm trying to do. This makes things easier to laugh. But we should talk about where we're going because it's a good question. You had the block fives and some of the other big lenders and other big success stories really come to their knees this summer. And I want to talk about next summer. I want to talk about the summer after that. The next few months and years where we're going, whether the big players are still going to be the big players or who is trying to rise and rebuild right now or build. Because it's time to build. It is time to build. I've heard that. I think we've all heard that. I think one of the more interesting things or one of the more interesting questions that is going to absolutely drive the direction of that answer is what's going to happen with regulation. And if the whether it's the SEC or the CFTC in the US or political pressure from other places or whatever the EU and the UK decide they want to do, how they approach who gets to do what is not just influential, but in some cases deterministic. Well, that's the thing. You just said a lot of letters. Yes. And there's a big question over who actually regulates the industry going for. And it feels like that is one of the big hurdles here who actually has any sort of say. Our genius colleague, Mac Levine, in one of his recent columns pointed out that the answer to the question of who regulates crypto is almost like unknowable, right? Because on the one hand, you have the SEC being various sorts of about establishing its jurisdiction in certain areas, but mostly doing that through enforcement actions rather than policy. You have a very clear and very public. I wouldn't quite describe it as a dispute, but at least a dissent between folks who think the CFTC should have more power in the US. And then you go to places like India where a lot of that regulation is coming through like tax policy rather than anything else. And so even in the US, whether you're thinking about state level policy, New York New Jersey have been very aggressive on what they're allowing various bills that are trying to work themselves through the House. If one of the ones that's under consideration passes, you would have to effectively be a bank to issue stablecoins. That's going to have huge consequences for the circles and the tethers and the big stable coin issues of the world. So there are a lot of lawyers making a lot of money right now trying to shape the direction of that regulatory conversation. That's like an evergreen thing, right? Lawyers make money. Lawyers make money. No matter what happens. What about this being some sort of inflection point? If we think about... Positively or negative? Well, I don't... I think positively because if we think about what happened up till 2022, you know, it's kind of the wild, wild west, right? The idea of a lot of experimentation and really light touch regulation. And I'm not saying that by any means we've seen any sort of regulation at this point. But is this a different industry now than it was at the beginning of the year? No. No. Well, what? Yeah. It's a file for bankruptcy. So there's that. There are various folks whose tokens are effectively out of commission. I mean, if think back a year ago, there was a squid game token that turned out to be a complete scam. So... so...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,901,2022-10-08 17:38:41
12676," are effectively out of commission. I mean, if think back a year ago, there was a squid game token that turned out in a complete scam. So... Shock me. So I think there have been a lot of ways in which perhaps the less capitalized players or the ones who had insufficient risk management or due diligence have been washed out a little bit. But the biggest players are still the biggest players. And in some ways, they're even bigger than at the beginning of this year. You mean like FTX coming in and essentially by the whole industry? I love that. Rescuing everyone. That is the narrative. But I don't look at them the same way that I look at the players that went under. Why? Well, for one, it's an exchange. With many other businesses that aren't exchanges. Which haven't gone under? I feel like that's the big difference. Yeah, it doesn't seem like they had the same exposure to counterparty risk that, you know, the Celsius's Voyages and Block Fies had. All of those people that you mentioned were among their various counterparties. I think what you're seeing is who are the people who either manage that exposure better than others or are better capitalized in the event that one of those counterparties blew up? And so, you know, for me, the bigger question is like the tier two, the sort of infrastructure players, people who, you know, like maybe a couple of billion dollars in transactions at a time, mostly a retail customer base flying slightly under the radar. They're the ones that have really been popping up with, like, oh, we're seizing withdrawals. And you're like, wait, I've never heard of you. What's going on here? And I think that part of the market, while we'll continue to have shakeouts there, I don't see the big players changing anything drastically other than perhaps more land grubs. OK, so if you're talking about these tier one institutions coming in and being the white knight and sort of a process of consolidation, then I'm thinking to myself, this is totally the antithesis of the promise of crypto decentralization. But what I'm hearing right now and what I'm seeing right now is that big, well capitalized firms are coming in, they're buying up the drags, the shadows of what's left from companies. And in that sense, they're getting bigger. So what we see on the other side of this is a consolidation that actually makes a fewer number of institutions much bigger and much more powerful. That runs counter to the promise of crypto. Well, if I were a Bitcoin maximalist, which would be clear, I'm not, but if I were a Bitcoin maximalist, one of the things I would point out is none of those companies affect what happens to Bitcoin. Like there are going to be people who will say sure, but at the blockchain layer, at the protocol layer, at the level of indie developers who are still in Ukraine and trying to build interesting things, is like bombs fall around them. But it is also true that one of the things that happens when you have a crisis or a shakeup or the prospect of looming regulation is you do have consolidation and you do have concentration. Is there anyone who's building and hasn't yet been acquired? I mean, to go back to that narrative that we've discussed a few times that it's time to build a very popular on Twitter, who is building your knowledge? Just not in my backyard. Do not build in my backyard. All right, Mr. Nimmy. I think that where folks are really paying attention is some of the, say, the defy, protocol-y type things with names like UNISWAP and Sushi Swap. I think folks are looking at the potential of, they are large, but they are an interesting part of the ecosystem, like the UGLABSes of the world, which went from, hey, we have some apes in a collection, to, hey, we're gonna acquire various other NFT type collections and companies to, hey, we're signing deals with Hollywood and the music industry. And I think when you have that sort of, we were a pure play crypto, but now we're extending into mass media, lifestyle entertainment. You give opportunities for other folks who are like, oh, here's a new place for me to play that didn't necessarily exist before. And one of my favorite types of coverage is when we find actual individuals or the small, mid-size of the market who are able to be like, I am gonna make a different kind of art gallery. Or I'm somebody working in fashion who is able to do interesting things. Or I'm a designer making virtual clothes and avatars before the meta is of the world. I'm like, that's cool. And so do we have any sort of vision of the future?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,902,2022-10-08 17:43:02
12677," designer making virtual clues and avatars for the methods of the world. I'm like, that's cool. So do we have any sort of vision of the future where we see the technology that's being experimented with right now? And then we start to see that in everyday items and everyday life. If you talk to people about crypto long enough, eventually you'll hear the phrase, well, the underlying technology at that point, you just like, take a shot. I think she just said it's time to build. It's not normal. I'll not say it's time to build. We'll find. That's what we heard. We make it very transparent to the shopper before they accept an order. What's the order is going to look like? How much work on it pays them and how much consumer is paying them. And so they can decide whether they take an order or whether they refuse it. And that's the kind of flexibility that our shoppers really value and the kind of transparency that they want. Are you seeing a labor shortage right now? And what are you doing to combat that? It's different in different places. Or demographic of shoppers is completely different from food delivery and right sharing, where 70% women and half of them are moms. And that's because a lot of the job at Instacart is very different than just being in a car with strangers. It's about like going to the store, doing a good job of customer service of really picking the right products for the consumer. And we are seeing that being very appealing to women. Markets are preparing to close, but the day is not over yet. Stock that is now up about 45%. A lot of volatility right now.

Really this year? Okay, cool. So you're like the perfect guy to talk to about this stuff. I got to tell you, I feel like at this point we've been hearing about the promises of the blockchain, it seems like for the better part of a decade at this point, a part though and crypto too. But to me apart from making a few people just fabulously wealthy, I still haven't seen how this technology has actually made our lives better. Yeah, I mean, I think a lot of the promises are pretty vacuous, to be honest with you. So yeah, I can't sort of endorse things that my predecessors may have said, but the core thing, the number one thing we were endeavoring to solve as an industry was alternative monetary systems. This has been built as exist, whether or not they're going to achieve the penetrates.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,903,2022-10-08 17:47:23
12678," during the solve as an industry was alternative monetary systems. Those have been built, those exist. Whether or not they're going to achieve the penetration, the crypto-acolytes think they might. That's an open question. We'll see. I think that depends on what happens in sort of the real world with the currency crises and things like that. There is sort of the web three space, which I would say we're seeing real real world use cases, which are emerging, which are fairly interesting. And then the last thing I would point out would be stable coins. To me, that is something that a lot of early crypto people didn't understand, didn't necessarily even want. They didn't seek to build that. But those have actually proved to be the first killer app of crypto. So you use a lot of my favorite words between stable coins and web three. But I want to start with one of the first things you said, which is alternative money systems. And this is something that we actually talk about a lot. And truly we do. So I guess we hear about crypto a lot as an investment rather than a utility. And when you say that, I mean, this problem that has been trying to solve, leaving aside all the bad promises that were made by some of your predecessors, the alternative money system. I mean, does crypto have to be a utility? Does it need to be used transactually? Yeah. I think any monetary good satisfies all the qualities of money. So yeah, there should definitely be a transactional use. What we're seeing is decoupling between sort of like crypto commodities, like Bitcoin and Ether, which are they have a lower velocity and then versus stable which are used as a medium of exchange, almost as a collateral type. And empirically they have higher velocities. So it's almost like that first idea that crypto assets, like Bitcoin would be used transactually. That's not really proven to be the case. Why is that though? I mean, because if you think back to what, like 2017, 2018, every few months there was this new news item, right? Every few days actually, it was like, oh, so and so companies start is accepting crypto. And then you'd see the price of Bitcoin go up. It was actually this company's accepting Bitcoin, then the price of Bitcoin would go up. And Tesla was like, oh, we're going to start accepting Bitcoin until they didn't. Why didn't that stick? That was kind of, you know, I don't, I think it just doesn't really actually make them what's sense to use a volatile crypto asset transactually for the reason that the US asserts the primacy of the dollar from a tax perspective. So even relative to foreign currencies, if you hold a foreign currency, material amount and appreciates you are now on the hook for you have a tax liability, right? So you have to, you know, keep track of that. There's the accounting overhead. So it's the same with the crypto asset. You have to track your tax basis when you spend it. That is a considerable friction. That means that nobody's really willing to conduct commerce in crypto terms that they would rather stand dollars. And so that's just a barrier, which I don't really see, being lifted anytime soon. Why would the government give up the privileged position that the dollar enjoys? OK, I want to talk about regulators. Are you scared? No. Is this an industry that can be trusted to regulate itself? It has shown no willingness to regulate itself historically, none whatsoever. So I'm clear to me what self-regulation would look like. So then how do you as a VC, as an investor, sort of navigate and build a portfolio with that sort of huge question mark overhang, the fact that this industry hasn't shown any willingness to regulate itself. And you have regulators over here making very worried noises. Haven't yet really done anything, but made a lot of noise. From the securities regulation standpoint, the SEC has shown no willingness to engage productively with the industry, none whatsoever. What would I have expected? A alternative model for tokens to engage in disclosure, for material facts. The same way we have that in the regular public equity land. But we have seen no signs whatsoever.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,904,2022-10-08 17:51:37
12679," in disclosure for material facts the same way we have that in the regular public equity land. But we have seen no signs whatsoever of legislative moves on that front or the SEC being willing to lay that out. So what are the repercussions of that? Does that mean that we start to see crypto firms increasingly leave the United States because there's no clear regulatory framework? You know even though the US is kind of challenged from that perspective there's not that many other jurisdictions that are much better frankly. People thought Singapore was a safe haven, proved not to be. The MES is just as tough as SEC if not worse. People thought Europe might be, Europe has a new super aggressive crypto legislation. The US still maintains the most vibrant capital markets in the world, obviously the most venture capital and you know the bulk of activities still here. My view is stay and engage and fight if necessary rather than fleeing to some other you know tax haven or something like that. The UK has actually you know shown willingness to engage with the industry but you know I think American startups and crypto firms are going to have to you know do what they can with the local regulators. So if you could wave a magic wand or go to Capitol Hill and write this legislation yourself I mean what are what's a framework that you would want to say? I would codify stablecoins and give them access to the central bank directly. That would abate a lot of the questions that people have about their reliability and their ability to be liquid in times of stress. I would give issuers of tokens an ability to acknowledge that they actually are serving as a kind of pseudo equity. I would give these issuers the ability to make the salient disclosures to investors that ought to be made and you know craft a framework such that they could do that and frankly I think that the disclosure quality would be better than what we have in public markets with quarterly filings because in crypto if your business is an on-chain component you can get real-time financials right you can pull the data literally directly from the blockchain and you can get financials on a per block basis. Things are generally more transparent in crypto because the cash flows are on-chain and you know public blockchains are inherently transparent. What do you think will actually happen? I think it's likely we do get stablecoin legislation maybe this year. I think the SEC will continue to stone while us. I would like the CFTC to assert its authority maybe over spot markets that seems right. A lot of these things look like commodities so you know it would be nice if they were able to you know win some more discretion there. I think you know Ken slow is very ambitious and from his outward public statements he has not so far appeared willing to engage and so I think it's going to be really tough time the next few months and years here. I started off by asking you about the promises of crypto and the blockchain not necessarily being delivered at least what we were promised over the last decade. Let's look forward now and just think about the next decade. 10 years from now we're sitting here. What has gotten better in our lives as a result of this technology? Where are we touching it every day? I would say you are looking at an explosion of Web 3 consumer. So one I would point out would be social media communications networks where the topology the hierarchy is much flatter. So use the owner of your credentials can choose to engage with a you know particular platform you're free entry and free exit. Look I take my followers from Twitter to a new site because you own your identity right literally. What is that identity? What do I own of that identity? Like every tweet I've ever sent. I would imagine a world where basically the specific platforms become much less empowered relative to the users and we're not worried about Twitter's governance policies or their censorship policies or Facebook's because there's so many more competing platforms because the cost of eggs at an entry are much lower. And so I think that's an overall better situation because",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,905,2022-10-08 17:55:47
12680," Because there's so many more competing platforms because the cost of bags at an entry are much lower. And so I think that's an overall better situation because now you can opt in to whatever platform with whatever rules you want. Arguably that's a much better situation and we don't have you know the situation where governments are trying to use these platforms as choke points to gain informational control. They're not trying to influence the Mark Zuckerbergs of the world. And so I want to talk a little bit more about Web 3 though. Because I like that you're excited but I want to be cynical. And I mean to your point about the Mark Zuckerbergs of the world, a cynical person might say that when you think about Web 3 it's probably going to be built by the same guys who built Web 2. I know it's a the ideal is that it's going to take power away from these huge social media companies but realistically it wouldn't it be built by sort of existing companies that are already out there sort of those big players who already exist or do you do who do you see building it that was a very inelicantly phrased question. Web 3 will be built by a new set of entities for the for the same reason that large companies don't disrupt themselves. They don't have the institutional ability to make wholesale pivots. Facebook may be an exception frankly because Zuckerberg does exercise a lot of control there and you know he's pivoting hard into the metaverse so we'll see what you can do there but generally speaking large incumbents that are established they're incentive is not to experiment and disrupt themselves and so I think it would be a new set of entities that are much more open-minded and much more willing to support natively open systems which is what Web 3 or Blockchain's get you is interoperability. None of these large social internet platforms want interoperability they want to lock you in they want to create a wild garden right you cannot leave Twitter with your followers or leave Facebook I don't even know how Facebook works 70s and forever and you know I think that's just a fundamentally much better model. Nick Carter thanks for coming to New York. My pleasure thank you. What did you learn? I actually knew all of that so I didn't learn anything because I'm extremely smart. You knew all of that? We didn't even get to seed oil. I know I did get to talk a little with Nick off camera about what he eats. Yeah. One meal a day 8 p.m. That's not. He had nothing to eat yet. I know that's for longevity purposes I feel like that's not good for your metabolism. Well he's going to be laughing when we're dead. That's true. Oh boy soon. Okay that's a nice way to end the show. We have more chances. Yeah this was the only episode too. That's true. We'll get you food next time. Thank you. You're so hungry. You're one of the most fascinating entrepreneurs because you all started with young. What did you learn? Did you always think that you'd be an entrepreneur? Probably yes. I think which is a bit sad. From age what? Five? I'm not sure. I come from a family of entrepreneurs so even I probably can spell the word and still can't take it. It's sort of in my blood but it's it's really fun starting a business. It's fun growing a business. I feel it's a real privilege and I started my business officially at 18 but I think I knew I wanted to do it very differently from about 15 but I'm sure it's you know you if you're surrounded by it feels very natural. So yes it's fun. And it started how you started by making you want Florence. It was an Italy and you started handbags. Yeah so I knew I was actually given a handbag by my mother when I was about 61 of her old handbags and I remember how it made me feel and I think fashion is fascinating for the mood changing the confidence boosting aspects and the tribal aspects of what fashion does and so I went at 18 to Florence knowing that was the home of a leather girl which is what interested me. I just wanted to learn actually I'm be surrounded by craftsmen who are making things as important and that's going to be very interesting I think over the next sort of 10 years I think the on-shoring of craft and manufacturing is going to be fascinating actually. I mean I watched the off-shoring I literally saw it and I think we're going to be seeing that coming back to local we have to when we're all looking at our objectives in terms of carbon.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,906,2022-10-08 18:00:16
12681," Fascinating, actually. I mean, I watched the off-shoreing, I literally saw it, and I think we're going to be seeing that coming back to local. When we're looking at our objectives in terms of carbon, proximity is going to be key. Back in 1997, I was interested in the following question, which is, there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called Soropod dinosaurs, which had really long skinny necks, so Apodosaurus is an example. Now, I said really long skinny tails. So, I made a computer model that showed that in fact the tail of these Soropod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip, a bullfip. Now, the way a bullfip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. And that crack is a sonic boom. I think the way they got a date was to impress the females by making loud booms. Hello and welcome to Emma Barnett Neats. And this week I'm meeting the Space Experts and Physicist Professor Brian Cox. And I'm really looking forward to asking him about how he gets his head around the vastness of space and to explain it to all of us or try to anyway. How he also goes about his daily life when he knows how insignificant we really are and what he makes of NASA's new telescope and those amazing images. Welcome to the programme. Thank you so much for coming to talk to me and to all of our viewers. And I actually wanted to start with the new NASA telescope. We'll come to your particular project in a moment. But it's named after the man who ran the agency in the 60s and oversaw the first man mission to the Moon, James Webb. What do you make of what we're seeing so far? Because it's pretty incredible. Yeah, it's a remarkable instrument. I mean, you think of the predecessor, which is the Hubble Space Telescope. I think it's almost impossible to imagine a world without that. Even if you don't know, the images that we're familiar with at the universe, many of them, the spectacular galaxies and star-forming regions, they're from Hubble. But the web is a significant step forward. And technically, one of the most important things is it can see what we call longer wavelength light, or infrared light. And that's important because if you think about, we want to see the first galaxies forming. So we want to understand how the first stars and galaxies formed in the universe. And so what you do is you look far out into the universe. And because light travels quite slowly across cosmic distances. Let's say you have a galaxy that's the most distant one you can see with an naked eye, is about 2 million light years away. So that means that the light has been traveling for 2 million years to reach us. And it's a remarkable thing actually, to think when you look, it's called the Andromeda Galaxy. And if you know where you're looking, you can just catch you out of the corner of your eye. If you think about it, you're seeing that as it was 2 million years ago. Yes, although it does. Because it takes a light 2 million years to travel. I don't like being late to information. So that makes me feel very out of date. It's remarkable. I mean, it began its journey before we had evolved on Earth. So in its time, it took, and that's the nearest neighboring galaxy. The web looks so far out that it's capturing light that's been traveling for 2 million years.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,907,2022-10-08 18:04:27
12682," on earth. So in its time it took, and that's the nearest neighbouring galaxy. The web looks so far out that it's capturing light that's been travelling for over 13 billion years. But the universe has been expanding, and so the light has been stretching. And so for the most distant galaxies, we're looking back, back in time, almost to the big bang. The Hubble was not sensitive to that light, so that the web can see the formation of the first galaxies. It's essentially looking all the way back to very close to the beginning of time. And that's very important, because we're not entirely sure exactly how those first galaxies form. The idea of what you just talked about in terms of how much time this has taken and what it's covering. Do you think we will ever be able to see the big bang? Well, we almost can. It's not the web telescope. There's something called the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation, which is light that was emitted in the universe. And it's a very precise number. It's 380,000 years after the big bang. We should not very long at all, right? The universe is 13.8 billion years old. So we can see that. It's microwaves, because it's been stretched so much by the expansion of the universe. Going back, that the problem with light is that in those earliest times, the universe was so hot and so dense that light couldn't travel through it. So it was opaque. So you can't use light to go back earlier than that. But what we can potentially do, not yet. We're not good enough yet. But the technology we use to now to detect colliding black holes, which is another remarkable thing. I'll leave that one aside for now. But we have the technology to do that. And that technology possibly could allow us to probe right back to this thing, the big bang. And again, whether or not that's the origin of time, we can talk about as well. Brian, you've dedicated your life to explaining the scale of the universe to people. You have a new world tour and show called Horizons. What's the goal? Are you trying to teach people new things and understand the world they're living in better? What are you aiming for? Well, actually all those things. So it works. I hope on different levels. So I talk about cosmology. We've spoken about what we call the large scale structure of the universe, the galaxies and how they formed, how the universe evolves since the big bang. But also, I've got very interested in my academic work in black holes. And black holes, and they're really vocacy things. I think everyone's heard of these strange things, these totally collapsed stars from which nothing apparently can escape. But in the past few years, past few decades really, beginning work that Stephen Hawking really began back in the 1970s and many others. And we've begun to suspect there's a lot more to them. And they've started forcing us to reassess our understanding of what space and time are. And that's a really weird sentence you might think, well, space is the arena in which we live and time just ticks. But it really isn't, it looks like from studying these things, there are building blocks of space and building blocks of time. And what I say in the show is, that's a mind-blowing idea. And I talk about that. But the key point is, there's a great quote from Einstein, a beautiful story that Einstein told about when he was a little boy, he was six or seven years old. And his dad gave him a compass. And so he looked at the compass and he saw, well, there's this thing, this needle and it always points north, points in this direction. So there's something invisible that I can't see that underlies our reality that's making this needle point nor. And he said, later in life, it was my first encounter with an idea, which is if you look at nature carefully and really pay attention and you're lucky, you can catch your glimpse of something deeply hidden. It's a beautiful phrase, something deeply hidden, which is the deep structure of reality. It's what our reality is. And so black holes, they're kind of a metaphor in a way. I talk about them as rezectastones in the sky. They're the things that by studying them, and you say, why would we study these things? Well, in studying these things, we're beginning to get a deep, a deep picture of what our reality actually is. That's a remarkable idea. But it's a beautiful idea that runs through all of science. How do you...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,908,2022-10-08 18:08:55
12683," a deep picture of what our reality actually is. That's a remarkable idea, but it's a beautiful idea that runs through all of science. How do you define a black hole? Well, it's in Einstein's theory, which again is a remarkable thing. It's published in 1915 over 100 years old, but it's just a region of space from which even light can't escape. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. We have to get interest rates higher and bring inflation back to our target. 23 million people have been affected by this flooding and losing. Disruption is the whole point of a strike. With unmatched reach in resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. A lot of the satellites have propulsion systems they can kind of move to get out of the way of each other or change their orbit a little bit. It's a service that you guys offer to help these companies know how to maneuver their machines. Yeah, we offer a collision avoidance service. It's a subscription service. We'll send you an alert up to seven days in advance if your satellite is going to come dangerously close to a piece of debris or another satellite. Companies have been doing that for decades moving satellites around, but it's sort of like a harder problem now. The risk of a collision is a lot higher now. Just because we've installed so much more hardware into space, you have a big collision that creates a cloud of debris and now all the other satellites are flying through this whizzing mess of debris as we add all of the new satellites into space. The risks of a collision, the likelihood of the collisions going up. And by understanding what they are and knowing more about them, what do we then learn? Well, Stephen Hawking back in the 70s published a paper. The initial one was called Black Hole Explosions. It's just a great title for a paper. He calculated that Black holes in his language. He said, Black holes ain't so black. They glow in the sky, like holes in the sky, and they radiate. Over time, they lose energy and mass and ultimately disappear of a huge time scales. That's so important. I show this picture in the show that if you go into Westminster Abbey and look on the floor of Westminster Abbey on Stephen's memorial stone, then you find his equation for the temperature of a Black hole literally chiseled in stone on the floor of an abbey. So you might say, why? Why is it so important? This was the key. This was this Rosetta stone idea. In trying to understand what happens to the stuff that fell in. When you thought these things existed forever, which is pre-Hawking, then you think, well, it's okay. It gets locked up inside. It can never get out. We don't care. But the thing evaporates away. One day it will be gone. Then suddenly you have to be faced with this question, what happened to everything then? If I throw a book into a Black hole, is it somehow possible in the far future of you collect all this so-called Hawking radiation that comes off? Is it possible to reconstruct the information in the book? That's been a simple question that's driven, this tremendous amount of research for 50 years. It was pretty much sold in 2019, actually, in 2020. Pretty much, I mean, there's still a huge number of questions. But roughly, well, the statement is every-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,909,2022-10-08 18:13:01
12684," pretty much sold in 2019 actually in 2020. Pretty much, I mean, there's still a huge number of questions. But roughly, well, the statement is, everything comes out again, all the information comes out. So everything that fell in, in principle, in the far future, you could reconstruct the information of everything that fell in. It's just an astonishing idea. Because the last thing I'll say is that before that, before the Hawking papers and before this modern understanding, inside a black hole, just according to Einstein, sits the end of time, which is an astonishing thing to say. Because we can see them. We have a photograph of one of these things in the center of a galaxy, too, actually. And you're looking, when you look at that photograph, you're looking at the end of time in space. So then you think, well, if things go to the end of time, how does everything get out again? And that's the content of this tremendous work in theoretical physics. This work, studying black holes, which is probably, it's one of those things that a certain kind of person says, is useless, right? He said, why? Who cares? It turns out that the techniques that have been developed and the understanding that's been gained from looking at these things has got a very strong crossover with building quantum computers, right, which is a quantum computers are in laboratories now. They have a tremendous potential to revolutionize our civilization. Incredibly powerful computer devices. Yes, and also that's sometimes the defense given, isn't it, about what's going into man going back to the moon or woman going back to the moon? The other things are discovered in the pursuit of those missions. Yeah, I mean, it's always a cliche, but it's true. A friend of mine, an astronomer always says, when people criticize these spacecraft and they say, let's say the James Webb Space Telescope, who's what, $6 billion or so. But it's appropriate to find out that nobody put $6 billion in a suitcase and launched it on the rocket. The $6 billion didn't go into space. It was spent on Earth. And what is often the case, it's inside the glory and wonder of the discoveries that are made, that basically you are paying people to do high tech jobs and do research and build machines that operate at the edge of the possible. And history tells us that that tends to be extremely useful. You're inventing things and trying to do things that are difficult. And that expertise never stays in one place. It then spreads out across our civilization in ways that you can't really predict or even quantify. Indeed. And you did sound very excited early. I mean, you sound excited the whole time about all of this, which is infectious, even if people are trying to keep up, including myself. But when you talk about the golden possibility of there being life out there, and that question of, are we alone? Where are you with that? What do you say to people right now with the latest information? Well, so this, again, it's, I think there's a cosmology. I say this in the show as well. It's one of the most challenging subjects, because at one level it makes us feel very, very small and insignificant. And it's true, physically. I mean, the Earth is one planet around one star amongst 400 billion stars in one galaxy amongst two trillion galaxies in the part of the universe we can see. So we're definitely small, right? You can't argue that. Yes, you've clarified. But, but. You're right. If you ask the question about life, the answer is we don't know. We've found nothing, nothing alive beyond the Earth. But I've missed it that we haven't been very far or looked tremendously hard. Although we are looking hard now on Mars, because we suspect there might have been microbes on Mars, because there was one's water on Mars, and it was geologically active. And all the things that we think led to the origin of life on Earth were present on Mars around the same time, about three and a half to four billion years ago. So we wouldn't be surprised if we find that microbes existed, probably subsurface on Mars, or maybe on some of the moons of Jupiter or Saturn, where there's water today. However, nobody expects anything more complicated than the microbe. And it's interesting. So if you look at the history of life on Earth, you can find its last beings and saying a Earth about the nature that embezzles the Earth in particular. Like us.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,910,2022-10-08 18:17:47
12685," But nobody expects anything more complicated than the microbe. And it's interesting. So if you look at the history of life on Earth, you have microbes around 3.8 billion years ago, pretty much not long after the Earth formed in geological time. But if you look for evidence of complex life on Earth, then really there isn't any in the fossil record until about 600 million years ago or so. So on this planet, for most of the history of the planet, there was slime, basically, single-celled things, doing interesting stuff, photosynthesis and things. But nothing more complicated than a single cell. And it's only in the last half a billion years or so that you get this explosion of life on Earth. And only as I said, it's only in the last, less than a million years that we've had home as sapiens on Earth. And in the last few tens of thousands of years, we've had a civilization. So here, it took pretty much four billion years to go from cell to civilization. And that's the third of the age of the universe. And so that leads many biologists that I speak to to suggest that whilst microbes might be common, civilizations might be rare. Actually, I asked a friend of mine, great physicist, Sean Carroll, how many civilizations do you think there will be in a Milky Way galaxy, a typical galaxy? How many in a typical galaxy? And he said, non. Right, non. And I think he's, I tend to say one. So somewhere between zero and one probably. But that's a guess. But what do you, do you want me? I think it's a good guess. Brian, is that what it is? You sound like perhaps you have an optimism for it. And I wonder what's underpinning that? I would love that to be. And actually, because it worries me. And this is the way that I end my show, actually. It worries me that let's take that position. Let's imagine that in our galaxy, 400 billion suns, there's just us that thinks. Right, the microbes are all over the place. But in terms of things that think and can feel, and in a very real sense, bring meaning to the universe. All these things we've talked about, the beauty of these galaxies, they're not beautiful. If there's nothing there to perceive them, they're just galaxies. So if that's it in this galaxy, then the decisions that we make now, as a civilization, have a galactic implications. We destroy ourselves, for example, deliberately or through inaction. Then it's possible that we eliminate meaning, perhaps forever, in a galaxy of 400 billion stars. And so that's it. I think that leads you to, it's a good work in assumption that we have a tremendous responsibility, in a sense, not to do that. So I would be much more comfortable with our current predicament, if the galaxy was filled with civilizations, then I'd say, well, okay. It would be rather stupid of us to eliminate all this beautiful culture and science and art and music that we build up. But at least there's someone else that's doing that. But I'm not actually sure there is. Bloomberg has enhanced search on the terminal. To deliver what you need when you need it. Now, you can simply type phrases in everyday English in the command line.

For the FTC, I think foremost, the FTC needs to be making sure that we're fully understanding this technology. We don't know how specific we start.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,911,2022-10-08 18:22:04
12686," Most the FTC needs to be making sure that we're fully understanding this technology. We don't trust companies to self-regulate when it comes to pollution. We don't trust them to self-regulate when it comes to workplace comp. Why on earth would we trust them to self-regulate AI? How comfortable are you with space tourism and the pursuit of that knowledge and meaning, being left largely to a very small group of rich men? You're right, the idea that technology is used. If all it was useful, it was to send a few very rich people into space on a joyride, then there would be a real criticism there. But that's not all the technology is useful. I think it's important to understand that the space industry is about operating initially in near-earth orbits. We've already industrialized that. We all use it every day. We all switch on our sat nav in the car, satellite navigation. It requires infrastructure in orbit. A lot of the stuff we know about climate change, resource use and so on. That's coming from satellites. I think you have to look at the space industry as a whole, really, and then say, well, it's not just about... The same argument was made for intercontinental travel by aircraft. When the first aircraft were built, it was extremely expensive and the preserve of the rich. But, of course, within a few decades, it had democratized travel. We all take advantage of that every day. I think that's the right way to look at space. It's not to focus on particular bits of it that we might not like for moral reasons or whatever it is. I really do advocate for the fact of looking at the whole industry, which is tremendously important now. It is. I'm interested, though, that you did say, and correct me if I'm wrong, that all political leaders should go to space, perhaps for some perspective. Do you still think that most of them should come back? Most of them. That's the last part of that quote. That was... It was based on an idea, which is a very famous idea called the overview effect, which is well known. The astronauts change their view of the... Always, as far as I'm aware, when they come back, they have a more positive view of the value of this planet, and are very much more focused on preserving it as a beautiful place, perhaps a unique place in a galaxy, as I said. So I felt that, and I do feel that having the good fortune of speaking to many astronauts, that their experience, if the people who make the decisions, the big decisions of our future, could have that experience, I think would be good investments. It's extremely hard arguments to make, that we should actually spend money allowing, you know, in our case at the moment, our Prime Minister writes. In the UK, we'd say, well, we just spend money sending Boris Johnson into space, and bringing him back safely to Earth again, because it would change his view. No, I don't think I win that argument. But I think there's a serious point there, which is that it does seem to change people for the better when they see Earth as it really is, which is a fragile thing against the blackness of space. I think it's an argument that I would try to make, I would lose it, because it's very expensive. Do you want to go? Are you willing to go? I would love to, because as I said, I'd love to share that experience of seeing our world from space. I think it's really unarguably, it appears to be a life-changing experience, and it seems to change individuals for the better. You won't be scared. Well, I don't know. I mean, I remember one of my great heroes, John Young, who flew on the Apollo missions, walked on the moon, test flew the first space shuttle.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,912,2022-10-08 18:26:06
12687," I don't know, I mean I remember one of my great heroes, John Young, who flew on the Apollo missions, walked on the moon, test flew the first space shuttle, and he said that anyone who sits on top of however many thousands of tons of liquid hydrogen, helium, liquid hydrogen oxygen and isn't a bit worried, doesn't understand the problem. So it's probably right. Do you have people come and talk to you about faith? Do they talk to you about how religion and and that side of life fits into your level of knowledge? Because I know you've travelled around the world talking to people. Yeah a lot, it comes up as a question, because cosmology is the it's a science of origins, and actually with the study of black holes I mentioned we're even beginning now to think about what space and time are. So naturally the I say in the show actually I say when we talk about this it's the moment of creation if that what so we're asking was there a moment of creation and that's the correct language to use I think or it's the vocative language but it's really what we're talking about. Did everything come into being or has it always been here? We actually don't even know the answer to that question really. So yeah I can ask you a lot because I think cosmology is a challenging science that challenges us to think about these things that we often we associate that with theology or philosophy and I think that's that's a good thing because something I very strongly believe in is that segmenting or making little canisters and putting different bits of human experience or different you know music and art and theology and philosophy and science and segmenting them all is just the wrong way to look at it. What we're doing is a deep level trying to understand what it means to be human in this tremendous potentially infinite universe and so I those questions get asked and ultimately I say I'm quite straightforward I say I don't I'm not a religious person myself but but the correct thing to say even about the question did the universe have a beginning in time is we don't know don't know and that's it.

In July 2022, Atlanta hosted what might sound like a boring legal seminar. A conference on the new rules around name, image, and likeness in sports. But far from dry and academic, the first annual NIL Summit was in fact a flashy star-studded event put on at the college football hall of fame. And Mingling amid the biggest current and former names in sports and media, there was a crucial cohort, the players poised to redefine what it means to be a modern college athlete. And the winner of male athlete of the year goes to Chase Griffin. Among those up-and-comers, UCLA's Chase Griffin. The UCLA quarterback is among the students becoming as well known for making deals as making plays. And even in that group, Chase stands out. My name is Chase Griffin. What's up everyone? It's Chase Griffin. It's your favorite quarterback, it's favorite quarterback, Chase Griffin. When you look at it as an empowerment equity opportunity, it's really been unmatched in the sports world for any point in time since Title IX. Better a scope. After hardly a full year of name, image, and likeness deals being a reality, he already has more than 20 deals with major brands, venture, and charitable groups. All the while bouncing, graduating undergrad in just two years and fighting for playing time on the field. Chase Griffin out of the gun. We are joined by UCLA quarterback Chase Griffin. Not just UCLA quarterback, but name image likeness superstar. Why am I so excited for this one? This kid could actually be the president of the United States someday. Chase isn't the starting quarterback for UCLA. He's not even the backup quarterback. But back on campus in LA, his nickname is President Chase. And after spending a couple days talking about his approach to business, sports, and equality, it's not shocking to think he might someday hold that office. His level of focus and maturity at the stage, I only wish I had. If you want to buy stock in human being, buy stock in Chase Griffin. When it comes to building generational wealth, it's not about the money that you make in college. I'm very excited that I made the amount of money that I made last year. I am even ten times more excited that I know how to make that money. Summer on any college campuses, mostly for the athlete, tour on lighter, but still regimented schedules.

12689," for the athletes who are unlighter but still regimen its schedules. The tendon classes working out, a little bit of hanging out, and then more working out on their own time. Chase is no exception. The 21-year-old is a backup, albeit an impatient one. In the Topsy-Turvy past couple of seasons dotted with families games and COVID protocols, he's been able to start three games for the Bruins. Griffin, gonna throw to the end zone! Why open again and touch down UCLA? Eating Arizona and narrowly losing to both Stanford and Oregon. That was inches away from Chase Griffin and UCLA being in full pledge comeback mode. For Chase, UCLA felt like destiny. He was born just a few miles away before his family moved to Texas when he was a toddler. But beyond being a sort of homecoming, the school's history of athlete activism was a massive draw. I always expected from myself to have some sort of impact. It was beneficial for more people than I interact with on a daily basis. And choosing UCLA, I had a lot of that went into me seeing myself as someone who reflected the same want to make things better. That so many of the people that UCLA prides itself upon be in the home for have done in the past. The legacies of former UCLA greats like Arthur Ash, Jackie Robinson, Karim Abdul-Jabbar and Jackie Joyner Kursi have had a wide ranging impact on society well beyond the Westwood campus. Chase reveres these people, but he's perhaps most keenly aware of the activism of a more recent Bruin alum, the basketball player at O'Bannon. At O'Bannon, who was an ace-miss player of the year National Champ, UCLA Sports Legend is also a legal hero. I think NIO could be the next installment where we look back in 30, 40, 50 years and God willing, if we give him the roses he deserves, we add at O'Bannon to that list of UCLA grades. O'Bannon, who played at UCLA from 91 to 95, initiated a lawsuit that's widely credited for finally opening up the possibility of college athletes being paid for use of their name, image and lightness. He sued the NCAA in video game publisher EA for anti-trust violations, arguing that athletes should be entitled to financial compensation when schools used their lightness for game. In 2014, a judge ruled in his favor. And then on an episode of the shop, surrounded by O'Bannon, Diana Tarrassi, and LeBron James, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed the first ultimately successful legislation to allow athletes to receive endorsement deals. The fair pay to play act led other states to follow suit and ultimately led the NCAA in 2021 to relent, seemingly reluctantly. NIO payments were officially allowed as of July 1st, 2021. Today is the last day where name, image and lightness laws will not be on the books and kids will not be, if you will, not allowed to make money off of their name, image and lightness. Making money from Jersey sales and endorsement deals is a way for players to share in the massively lucrative world of college athletics. This NIO thing is the wild, wild west. The NIO change felt like many things that happened very slowly and then it happened very fast. And I wonder for you having contemplated that maybe this was coming at some point, how prepared were you, what was your mindset when the switch flipped? Right. I mean I still think everyone's trying to get prepared for that industry. It's still sort of like a wild, wild west. I wasn't really expecting anything. I was more just thinking about honestly getting ready for that season and capitalizing on everything that was happening. When NIO hit,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,915,2022-10-08 18:39:08
12690," And in capitalizing on everything that was happening. When NIO hit and it turned out I had action, I was like, oh, okay, well after this degree deal, which was fantastic. I was like, okay, I see how I can be a staple in this game and I see how I can get better over time. That's why I teamed up with my friends at Shell. And then Shell deal hit and then boost my old deal hit. And then you keep on building clear coverage. Like you keep on building and you get better in the meetings. And most of all you start seeing where your value can be best placed in these new opportunities. The headlines and storylines in the aftermath of the NIO change introduced visions of instant millionaires strolling campuses across the nation. You might think the NIO athlete of the year lives in Splendor or at least in one of those athletic palaces that put most of our coach dorms to shame. Well, it's all relative to chase. All right, Jason. So here we are, World Headquarters. Yep, this is where it all happens. There's the kitchen right here. I actually really enjoy cooking. Oh, yeah. Yeah, this gas oven gets really hot really fast. I make pizzas in there. This is the best appliance since the iPhone. If I could put anything in there, I need to do these dishes right here. So no trappings of success yet. More a pretty average college dorm room. The fridge filled with leftovers, a well-used PS4. And of course, the requisite Godfather poster. It's a far cry from the lifestyle seen in some local news reports for NIO athletes during this first year. These are Robinson made headlines with an NIO deal with Lamborghini Austin. Lamborghini's tend to make more headlines that Muhammad Ali are Bruce Lee pictures. Some athletes are living in mansions driving Lamborghinis. As far as I know, you're doing either of those things. I see where you're living right here. It is with all the respect not a mansion. Okay. How much of that is a conscious choice? And what does it say about sort of your approach to this? Right. I mean, first off, I look at this as my own room. I got everything I need. I'm cool with that. I'm cool with living below my means. I think it's important to remember that the volume of financial gain is completely overstated. And that's what it y'all is for in the media. And someone hears about a $5 million or $10 million deal. You've got to report it like, oh my goodness, people are going to read this. I'd count two things. How many kids are even getting these deals? And then for the kids that do get it, how much of that is in liquor cash? And how much of it is in assets? If you pay for a $2 million house out here in LA for a kid to stay in the college, that's great. But as soon as they're graduated, they're not going to have that $2 million house. I say the same thing, you know, for the kids who are driving around in Lamborghini's and stuff like that. That's awesome. Like, that's super dope. And I know some of those kids. But, you know, someone paying for your lease is different than someone actually giving you the value of that lease every single month. You're investing in saving it for a long pay, et cetera. I say all that just to mention that product deals and stuff like that are overhyped by the media. And they also can land kids in some trouble if they're not paying taxes on it. That's one of the distinctly unsexy and easy to overlook elements of the new rules. Even if an athlete's not getting cold hard cash from a deal, the value of any products given are subject to state and federal taxes. So suddenly, what a player sees as free gear in return for some social media posts actually equals taxable income. And that requires the same forms you'd fill out as an independent contractor getting a check. I made a fair amount in NIO deals and I invested all of it. In my opinion, NIO is great. Doing all this is great. Making money now is great. But the most valuable thing I've gotten from all of this is, in the fact, I always know how to make money off of myself. I'll told, Chase has done more than 20 deals with major brands like Degree, Shell, and Boost Mobile. Along with venture stage companies including Discord, Duffle, and Creative Juice. He's also made a point to work with charities like the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, where he's already raised funds for almost 60,000 meals.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,916,2022-10-08 18:44:06
12691," also made a point to work with charities like the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, where he's already raised funds for almost 60,000 meals. Big, expensive cities have a lot going for them, but if you live in one, you probably notice that these big, expensive cities keep getting more, well, expensive. You could always move away. You might have just started working remotely, so there's really nothing keeping you there. But then again, moving is a hassle. Well, what if someone paid you 10 grand to do it? What if they threw in free office space, a bicycle, or a gym membership? Programs and cities and states around the US are doing exactly that, and they're getting a lot of interest. We've had over 50,000 applications. About 90,000 applications. We've had over 1800 applicants from all over North America. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them? Or are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns for places looking for an injection of fresh talent? Bloomberg has enhanced search on the terminal to deliver what you need when you need it.

This is a song by Julianne. I heard the opening. I just took that opening and I pitched it slow. Or I think I sped it. At his desk when he's not making music, another side project. He's either networking with CEOs or investors he seeks out or who seek him out. Or negotiating new deals. This is an average NIL deal. A brand approaches an athlete who can help spread their message to a demographic they believe the athlete can help reach. In this case, direct TV is looking to market their NFL Sunday ticket to college students. If the two posts, one post late August and one post on the first week of September and the compensation would be 1200 per post so it would be 400 total. Right. Are they video posts or are they you know picking captions? They can be either. It's up to you guys. That was pretty good. 400 above. They had originally asked. So that's a win. So yeah, I mean at this point after I do a zoom or something like that, I had to chill out and go back to land down if I was watching a movie or something. Or you know, go to YouTube to start liking for more samples.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,917,2022-10-08 18:47:46
12692," To land down if I was watching a movie or something, or, you know, go to YouTube, just start looking for more samples. This is presidential change. It's a pretty simple interaction for Chase and for Direct TV, negotiated over a couple of emails and Zoom calls, and papered with a contract Chase will have his dad look over before he signs. And Chase, who's made himself as much of a student of the new NIL marketplace as he has a public policy at UCLA, says he understands why it's working. A brand ambassador with ship with an athlete is more attractive to these brands now as well as a terminal investment than even a post by a famous actor. If there's any place to learn that sports are deep in the hearts of Americans, it's on a high school football field in Texas. Friday night lights in the Lone Star State might be the great iron equivalent of Frank Sinatra's New York City, making it there needs your something special. Chase Griffin quarterback class 19, Hado Texas. And Chase didn't just make it, he excelled. Let's talk about some of the top quarterbacks in the state. And when you look at that list at the top of it, you got to talk about Chase Griffin. I was lucky to play three years as a quarterback for Hado High School, which is a one horse town. We have great success. And so the town really shut down and came out and supported us every Friday night. Chase, come on. Chase, one word to describe that finish that game. God, that's it. Coming from a town like that where football is so prioritized, it has its pros and cons, but I think on the pros side, I learned how to win, how to get better. And most importantly, what it's like to build a team where everyone gets better. Emulating his UCLA alumni like Robinson, Joyner Cursey and Abdul Jabbar, Chase is looking at the impact NIL will have not just for him, but the athletes that will follow. When the predecessors who have come before you have changed the world and made life better for everyone today, you can't help but ask yourself how the actions that you're taking now and the companies and brands and the NIL space that you work with are all cumulatively building something greater than any of us could foresee. I've actually I've never moderated, so this will be my first time. It should be fun. I know my hand right is terrible. The last day the conference chase was asked to co-moderate a panel with Monique Nelson, the CEO for UNI World Group. All right, I'm excited to be here. UNI World Group is one of the longest standing multicultural advertising and marketing agencies in the United States. The firm works with brands like Ford, Home Depot and Johnson & Johnson to help reach the black and brown communities, and they have big ambitions in NIL. For UNI World Group, the idea of this was pretty epic in that because we serve the undervalued, overlooked and the underserved, we knew that this particular group of people would fall into that category. And we plan on being the premier practice for NIL athletes that are looking to do purpose-driven media advertising, community level engagement work. UWG launched a program called The NIL to help black student athletes partner with major brands. But to help them understand how to do that, they brought on Chase to serve as a student athlete executive in residence. For me, I do nothing without tremendous amounts of data for all of our clients. I really wanted to be thoughtful about this practice being very athlete-centric. If I were to build it or anyone on my team were to build it, it would not have the athlete at the core. When you're 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, the best way.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,918,2022-10-08 18:52:05
12693," Build it or anyone on my team were to build it, it would not have the athlete at the core. When you're 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, the best way to have credibility is confidence and the only way for confidence to be authentic. I'm actually learning on the job. I'm learning about the brand side of NIO but I'm also trying to make sure that empowerment equity is built in especially for Black Student Athletes in the NIO world. ROI, return on investment. Both Chase and UWG see NIO deals as something much more than making money for students. It's also a potential investment in a community long overlooked. Big we're getting ready to stop boxes trying to feed the people of LA. A piece of each of Chase's NIO deals go to his belief brand campaign which has raised more than $13,000 for meals for the L.A. Food Bank backpack program. But athletes giving back is only one side. I'm here with legal zoom to give you five tips on the NIO game plan. UWG and Chase believe having brands investing in the athletes, especially athletes of color, can be a force multiplier for these historically marginalized communities. When you look at the revenue jet and rating sports for the Bombast, 88% of those athletes are Black. So when you're doing stuff to empower student athletes in the NIO space, you're also helping to deliver on your promise. Now student athletes are not the only ones who should receive this by any means. But statistically by doing that you're going to be delivering on your mission. Additionally, student athletes on average come from lower levels of income. So you're also delivering on that promise. And a lot of these student athletes are first generation, their first gen college students. Some of them first gen high school diploma. Some of them first time receiving the amount of money that they receive in their families. And some of them are in ways. This has been a wild first year in NIO. We all knew that there would be bags of cash around, right? There's always been bags of cash. There's cash everywhere. What we know is that that's not sustainable. We know that athletics has an expiration date on it. So for us inclusion ultimately means this is just a part of you. It is a tremendous part of you and we are going to celebrate that part of you. But we also know that you're bigger than that. So we want to empower you to live past your expiration date for this part of your life. And quite honestly have equity in everything that you have poured yourself into as an NIO athlete. It may still be the Wild West days for the NIO industry. But in the first year about a billion dollars in business was done with NCAA athletes. For the early leaders in the NIO space like Chase, they are striking a precedent for athletes that follow them. And that's important because collegiate athletes don't have that much time to profit. Only an estimated 2% of NCAA athletes go on to the pros. Even the hardest working are often limited by things they can't control. For Chase, it's been his height. I'm 5'10 now in high school after my sophomore year went up through for 3000 yards. I was probably like 5'6"", 5'5"". I mean I could already say I'm one of the best in the history of Texas high school football. But you know I've gone through the height test where they'll call you out of class, shake your hand, look at you up and down. And be like nice to meet you, you go back to class. It's a sad but timeless story for student athletes. And for Chase, his story is something he's not shyed away from. But embraced when it comes to his NIO deals. I'm frequently the smallest person on the football field, but I always strive to be the most impactful. My middle school coach taught me that I would never play in high school. Chase's deals with degrees breaking limits team and clear covers inspired underdogs allowed him to capitalize financially from football, even the last season he never saw the field for UCLA. I play football because I love the game. I play the football because I'm a good competitor. I love to compete and I play football.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,919,2022-10-08 18:56:34
12694," Even the last season, he never saw the field for UCLA. I play football because I love the game. I play the football because I'm a good competitor. I love to compete and I play football because I'm good at it. At the end of the day, I don't play football for my livelihood, which is important to remember when it comes down to identity. I myself changed Griffin as long as I'm that. I got something in this world. I'm a good player. As he moves into the new season and focuses more on football than business, Chase doesn't seem much of a differentiation between the two in terms of his mindset. I wouldn't be surprised if I wasn't playing football in five years and it was running in Fortune 500 company, but I also wouldn't be surprised if I was winning a Super Bowl five-teen years from now. In either way, I'm going to keep on working at the tools that would align myself and my future with both. At the end of the day, you're always going to have yourself. If you can make profit off of yourself and know where you add value, in any world you're in, you'll be able to adapt and find ways to generate wealth for yourself. Part of what I love about business is you get to build things from nothing. I don't have any investors. All this is all money and this is me just building it. It's pretty much full service shadow banking with nobody in charge. So what happens is that we create icons called tag. They have a signal within them. When you stare at that, your eye responds to it in a particular way. The way in which that eye response occurs is a signal that we pick up on the visual cortex of the brain at the back of the brain. The sensor is looking for the signals we create here that come through the eyeball, through the brain, and then onto the visual cortex. Once we've got it there as a signal, we can grab that. We understand what that signal looks like and we can turn that into a command or whatever we're trying to control. There's multiple places where we think this technology can be applied, perhaps in driving or commanding, and then we can use a command, ground vehicles or a command, naval vessels, perhaps providing a menu selection and control within a control room environment, maybe in a nuclear power station. All those kinds of things are perhaps in the value of this technology. Access the financial world on demand.

It is crucially important and I think we've moved from this attitude from its indulgence a waste of time almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s and so it makes that a really exciting field because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harnessed to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts but if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom you got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what you bring figures out while you're sleeping. Welcome to the earth shot prize innovation summit. This event powered by Bloomberg featured finalists selected by the earth shot council, launched by Prince William. A shot is a global initiative that drives innovation on solutions to climate change and environmental issues in the following categories. Protect and restore nature. Clean our air, revive our oceans, build a waste free world, fix our climate. So over the next half an hour will bring you all the highlights from this most important gathering. This is Bloomberg. Protecting the environment was of course close to my grandmother's heart. And I know you should have been delighted to hear about this event and the support you're all giving our earth shot finalists. The next generation of environmental pioneers. Together in this room are the people and organizations who will help us to achieve the earth shot mission to repair, restore and rejuvenate our planet within this current decade. That mission is not simple. Just as President John F. Kennedy so famously said, as he challenged the United States for America to unite behind the goal of putting man on the moon. We choose to do these things not because they are easy but because they are hard. I know that the world is an uncertain place right now that many families and communities across the globe are facing unimaginable challenges. From conflicts to energy crisis and food shortages. While addressing these in the short term, we must also remain resolutely focused on tackling the greatest challenges that threaten our tomorrow. Because if we don't, the changing climate will only serve to entrench these immediate challenges into fundamental global issues. So fairly impacting the lives of each and every one of us. That is why our collective mission is so urgent. But there is huge reason to be optimistic. The 2021 cohort of earth shot winners and finalists is evidence that we can succeed. That we can protect our world for our children, our grandchildren and the generations that will follow them. These pioneers exemplify the leadership needed in this decade of change. They include inspiring activists, brilliant innovators, a forward-thinking city and even an entire country making a real difference. But they cannot do it alone. This must be a team effort. We must come together behind their innovative solutions to ensure they reach their full potential with pace and scale. While my message today is one of gratitude and encouragement, I also acknowledge that you cannot succeed in isolation. As governments, we have a responsibility to create the incentives and the space for you to flourish. A receptive environment for change and the accountability that comes with guardianship. Many nations, the foundation for this approach has been flayed for us long ago if we choose to listen. We're on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,921,2022-10-08 19:05:31
12696," with guardianship. In many nations the foundation for this approach has been flayed for us long ago if we choose to listen. Where I come from, Altearoa New Zealand, a beautiful place you must visit. Our indigenous people hold a world view that every single living and non-living thing is connected. Our people, our plants, our animals, descendants of Ranganui, the sky, father and Papa Tuanuku, the earth's mother and their children. And so it follows that people and nature are kin, are family. And we must care for one another in the spirit of Kaitiaki Tanga, which translates into guardianship by the people of the land for the next generation. In short, I am the environment and the environment is me. Our life source, our economy, our future. Now I've seen this in action first hand many times, not least in my own backyard, the Pacific, where the ocean is a source of protein, income, culture and connection. Now it is a source of challenge as it rises up and begins to inundate small island nations. It can be confronting to hear and see the stories of just how real these challenges are, but none of us are here because we have given up, but because we believe there is a way to change the future. We are not only part of the nature, but we are nature. Nature is living element. For indigenous people, nature is whole. Our planet is alive. The rivers are her blood. The trees are her hair. The soil, her skin, the wind, her breeze. And indigenous peoples, our planet, they know, they are the doctor. We are protecting 80% of the world's biodiversity because our way of life do not harm nature at the opposite. We are strengthening ecosystems. We improve biodiversity by cooperating with the birds and trees, listening to the winds, observing the cloud, learning from even the little insect. We protect nature by setting up our own limits. We don't take more that mother earth can give and we give back. We protect the sacred trees. We don't destroy the field of the medicinal plants. We choose, precisely, the animal that we can kill to just keep the balance of the ecosystem. As all of us know in this fight, no one can afford to sit on the sidelines. No one can claim that climate change is somebody else's problem or to get off for future generations to address. We are all affected by a warming planet. We see that every day. And decisions being made right now will determine our shared tomorrow. So we must choose and we must act as united nations ourselves. Our progress depends on collective action, on collective ingenuity. If we stick together, we can make fixing the climate the greatest project and greatest achievement of our lifetimes. We have the science, we have the solutions. Now all the world needs is political will. Together we can create a future where rampant carbon is removed from the atmosphere. Where green buildings and green business transform the levability of communities. Where easy access to renewable energy enables greater equity. Where sustainable agriculture feeds a growing global population. The needs are urgent and the costs of inaction are worse than any nightmare. But let us not be driven by, let us be driven by hope not fear. By optimism not despair. Because hope is not passive. Hope is the ultimate source of renewable energy pushing us forward every day to try and try again.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,922,2022-10-08 19:09:22
12697," Hope is the ultimate source of renewable energy pushing us forward every day to try and try again. Today, the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit in partnership with Mike Bloomberg and Bloomberg Philanthropies will ask each and every one of us what we can do to accelerate progress to repair our planet this decade and offer solutions on how to collaborate to drive this ambitious but essential climate agenda. We will continue to drive impact around system changing climate solutions and amplify the Earth Shop Prize's call to accelerate progress to repair our planet through collaboration and innovation. But most importantly, we will remind ourselves what can be achieved when we turn pessimism to optimism and optimism into action. We will never break, we will never break, build on our foundation strong enough to stay. We will never break, have the right to rise this and the mountain shake, all our will remain. We will never go now, we will never know. You will put a woman on Mars. You will bring forth global cooling. You will be the first Chief Crypto Officer. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer, disrupt, before you change the world, Bloomberg. Everything you need to get set for the start of U.S. trading, Bloomberg the Open with Jonathan Terrell, drilling down in the numbers and preparing you as only Bloomberg can weekdays on Bloomberg. Welcome back to the best of the earth's shop prize innovation summit. The guests featured ranged from heads of state to leaders of grassroots environmental organizations. Well amongst them was philanthropist and Microsoft founder Bill Gates. Yeah, it's too bad you can't do things overnight in either mitigation adaptation. I was the last one through Europe, people were the leaders were all saying, hey give me technologies so I can tell Putin to get lost. And I said, hey in five years you're going to be able to call him up. And they were like, no, we'd like it. No, it's the year now. Okay, that, how's your planning permission regime and all the planning for that future grid? Seeds typically between the time you start and they get out in the farmers fields is about eight years. Now we have a pipeline of innovations. You know, we've been funding the CG system for 20 years now. It's funded about a billion a year. It's if people care at all about adaptation, that thing will be funded at two billion a year. I mean there won't be anything close to the impact of climate related seeds, climate related maze, race, wheat, sort of a millet. And thank goodness because of human genetics, we know how to do the editing. Thank goodness because.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,923,2022-10-08 19:13:35
12698," Because of human genetics, we know how to do the editing, thing goodness because of AI, we know how to find the alleles, because of drones, we can measure stuff in the field. So there's huge advance in terms of how the whole seed ecosystem moves at full speed. The timing is very tricky here. The warming doesn't stop the day you get to zero emissions. There's a leg in this system, it's about a 20-year leg. So you haven't seen that Earth Tempestor's not equilibrated to the atmospheric CO2 content. So when you get to zero, that's not, it's not like 20-51. Take my air conditioner away. No, it starts quite a bit later. And so you have to look at what the peak is and you can't just plan for okay, 2030, 2030s where your main production in central Africa is down 25%. By 2050, it's down 70%. And you will have switched in most of those areas from a fairly heat-sensitive crop to sorghum. Now sorghum productivity is super low. So we'll get people to do better maize for these next 15 years. And then they are going to have to switch to sorghum. It is tough when you see the floods in Pakistan. I mean, nobody expected that. If the goal of climate was to make us pay attention, wow. That is way beyond expectation. So some adaptation money literally will just be disaffered to recovery money. The boundary of what is also pretty confusing. I mean, what is food aid? If climate is causing some food production losses, all world-proof program money is that all climate adaptation money? It is certainly the need for it is going up. That is about 6.5 billion a year. So relative to the systemic solution, which is the research piece, it is relatively larger. But the demand for that piece, which is the acute half of Pakistani rice got flushed away. And so you are going to have malnutrition problems if you don't go in for that. And that is also a type of adaptation. And so I do think we are going to bring some rigor to this because the pressure now, you know, the goal of doubling the adaptation money from, they say 20 billion here to 40 billion here. The pressure on that is the problem. Still peanuts. No, it is very small. I mean, literally, yeah, if you start sticking food aid in there, you can use it up very quickly, rebuilding after hurricanes. I mean, we had hurricanes before, but, you know, the costs there are absolutely gigantic. You know, there are ways of stopping wildfires, there are ways of dealing with sea level rise. So the innovation agenda, not just on seeds, the innovation agenda is going full speed on mitigation. That is where, you know, there is 100 companies break through energies funded, there is a lot of energy. And so by mitigation, you mean mostly energy. You mean everything to do with energy. You mean generation of energy, you mean batteries, you mean transport, you mean all of the new, and there are some renewables that are already traditional, but more that need to come on. So that is the package that you are talking about mitigation. Yeah. Or are you also talking about agriculture as mitigation? Yeah. So every area of emissions, you know, the world tends to focus on passenger cars and electricity. That is not a third of emissions. And so the focus on the easiest third, you know, now 4% of new cars are electric. You know, so that is the field that we are further still long. About 4% of energy generation is wind and solar. And as you triple the size of your grid, you want that to be say, you know, some people would say 100%, other people might say 70 to 80%. You know, the amount you have to build, we're, you know, not within a factor of 5 of the build rate of those. But those are the easy sectors. Cement, you know, clean cement costs over twice as much as the way we make cement today. And it's not, it's partly the heating energy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,924,2022-10-08 19:18:17
12699," Sement, you know, clean cement costs over twice as much as the way we make cement today. And it's not, it's partly the heating energy. It's partly the basic thing, you know, remember in chemistry when you take calcium carbonate and heat it, you get calcium. That's what makes cement. But the thing that goes away, that's CO2. And so we have to have a way of making cement, which a number of these innovative. And steel and iron. Yep. There's a whole family of heart to obeyed sectors. That's true. If you get a vet industrial sector, if you get green hydrogen that's cheap enough, it actually solves quite a large number of those. Some of the industrial processes should go straight to electricity. And some you go through, you do your reduction using the hydrogen, where you would have used some hydrocarbon concept before. For steel, we actually have companies doing both. We have electric steel and others doing electricity is the way of replacing the blast furnace. And then we have others that take hydrogen. And if you get the hydrogen cheap enough, you get the super magic thing, which is that the green product doesn't cost more. That's called green premium equals zero. And then your adoption scale is utterly different. If we try to subsidize steel and cement, say rich countries say, okay, we want to get rid of that, which those two are 15% of emissions, that's greater than all foreign aid budgets put together. It's over 200 billion foreign aid. You know, never will pass that number. It's just not politically possible. It's a number that's at about 170 and going down today. Coming up, but more from the panelists and finalists here at the earth's shop prize innovation side. This is Bloomberg. Hydrogen has a very special place in the universe. It's the first element on the periodic table. It is the most abandoned element in the universe. And when clean energy advocates think about what can we find, which would be as easy to use, as fossil fuels, they think about hydrogen. The fuel that will, when burned, only produce water. We like to imagine that if we just built enough of these and these, we could ditch fossil fuels and save the planet. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. There are some things where you just need a good old-fashioned combustible fuel. Now startups around the world are betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century. Welcome back to the earth's shop prize innovation summit. Finalists of the annual award appeared alongside special guests, including worldwide business leaders, philanthropists and non-governmental activists. Now, while the 2022 finalists have been announced, our panelists have their eyes on the future and here's what they had to say. This is the earth's shop decade. We are in a race to repair and regenerate the planet. Some will focus on policy, some will focus on activism. We are focused on supporting the game changes, the innovators, the entrepreneurs and the problem solvers. We believe in the power of human engineers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,925,2022-10-08 19:22:25
12700," We have only 8% of the ocean protected today. Our earth shot is, as Pati said, 30% by 30% of the ocean at least, 30% of the ocean protected by 2030. We know that if we protect the right 30%, not only will we prevent the extinction of many marine species, but also we will produce more fish. There's going to be these protected areas, going to produce a spillover that will exceed the forgone catch. So we're going to have more fish to eat, food security, livelihoods for people. And we know that for every dollar that we invest in a protected area in a marine reserve that produces 10 dollars in economic output and creates more jobs. So it's a triple win for marine life, for food security and for climate and of course for the economy. So that's the goal, the mission to in the next 8 years, and that's where the earth shot is really crazy. In the next 8 years, we need to quadruple all the ocean protection that has ever happened in human history. Are you optimistic that can be done? I am optimistic, there's no choice. I've seen firsthand the potential that a breakthrough idea can hold. And if we start seeing more of these transformative solutions across all the challenges facing our planet and suddenly our earth shot won't seem so improbable. The work will be difficult, it'll take extraordinary resources, determination, partnership. But we've got all the essentials right here in this room. So what is the challenge? It's the speed, scale, and cost of making these green hydrogen generators. Well that's exactly what we are working on. Because to make green hydrogen the fuel source of the future, it needs to be cheaper than fossil fuels. And that means, electrolyzers are going to need to be really, really cheap. If you want to take a solution around the globe as quickly as possible, you need to make it standardized, mass-produced commodity. A product that is easy to make and quick to build and cheap as well. Some believe electrolyzers need to be large machines. We believe the electrolyzer should be a standardized, mass-producible product that can make green hydrogen anywhere for anyone. In 2030 we imagine millions and millions of projects on restore. And we see places on earth where we see nature being brought back. But all of the other nodes that are key to ensuring success. So the technology providers, the nurseries, the seed banks, the funders, the government incentive programs. So that we have an ecosystem that really allows us to leverage the many, many connections within the nature-based solution space. In 2030 we have been focused on another key area which is cities. And cities require data and insights to take action on climate and to preserve nature, to create more nature and tree canopy. So we've set a goal that we want to- We want more nature in cities, exactly. Exactly, right. And so we've been partnering with cities like Los Angeles to give them insights utilizing AI and geomapping on where all the places that you can create more tree canopy. Which reduces urban heat islands, improves air quality sequesters, carbon. So we want to bring data and solutions to bringing nature into cities as well as of course preserving and restoring nature. And so one of the goals that we've set is we want to enable over 500 cities around the world. I know we're going to hear from the mayor of Paris after this to reduce a gigaton of carbon emissions by 2030. And so that's through data, tools, insights, whether that's evolving transportation systems or planting new tree canopy. So that's a big bold target that we want to see achieved by 2030. Anyway, I guess I'm in the wrong place. I came here to invite all of you to the Grouch Convention. But it turns out you're all about my least favorite thing. Helping.

And over time, the vision, the purpose, the courage, it embodied, has inspired each generation to take on its own challenges. Not because they're easy, but because they're hard. President Kennedy understood that the effort to land on the moon would bring out the best in us that everyone would have to contribute, that it would require innovation, creativity, teamwork, commitment, and faith. And that world would be better because of it. The Earth Shot Prize has inspired the same spirit of optimism and ingenuity on a global scale to tackle the most pressing challenge we now face, repairing the planet. My family and I are so excited that the Prince of Wales will honor this year's Earth Shot Prize winners in partnership with the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, a city that is committed to scientific excellence, environmental justice, and the fight against climate change. We're proud that President Kennedy's moonshot legacy still inspires hope, and we look forward to welcoming all of you who are working to ensure a better future here on Earth. And that's all from the Earth Shot Prize Innovation Summit. You can find complete coverage of the event, including full interviews and articles on Bloomberg.com. I'm Francing Lakewell from New York, and this is Bloomberg. What do Formula One cars and your local supermarket have in common? Well, strange as it sounds, they might both be using the same technology. A lot of innovation has trickled down from the world of high tech engines and it hasn't just found a new life in road cars. F1 cars have long been thought of as the peak of cool, and technology in them is also helping to pull down our produce aisles. Engineers from Williams are using their knowledge from nine constructors' championships, working with company Aerofoil to help reduce the energy consumption of supermarkets. The device they're building is based on the design of an F1 cars rear wing. It attaches to fridges to keep more cool air in the unit. They estimate they can reduce supermarket energy consumption by 25%. One innovation from F1 is also helping hybrids reduce their carbon footprint. That's curves or the kinetic energy recovery system. In common parlance, it's known as regenerative braking and works by storing energy of the car decelerating in a battery for later use. If that's not enough, F1 is now looking at curves or a thermal energy recovery system looking to harness the heat produced from braking and the engine exhaust. That could allow cars to generate the same power using 30% less fuel. So while F1 may have a reputation as a gas-duzzler, some of its innovations in the name of speed are helping in the everyday fight against climate change. You will shed light on dark matter.

Corporate giants, policymakers and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that. Every week on Japan ahead, right here on Bloomberg Television. What separates a great investor from an average investor? Is it an early affinity for markets? I put a satellite dish on top of the dorm room, so I would have access to real-time stock quotes. An unconventional path? What I really wanted to do was ski, so I left Wharton and I went up the main and became ski boat. I never ending thirst for knowledge. It is a constant education each and every day. An acute attention to detail. I was down there for three weeks. I met every tenant. I was counting the car traffic. I was learning the business. A willingness to take a risk? If you want to produce return, you have to be willing to take risk. Where the ability to recognize a mistake and move on. I don't mind a 90% chance probability of failure if there's a 10% chance of changing the world. In how to invest, I hope to provide a glimpse into the thoughts and practices of the world's great investors and hopefully inspire a new generation of professional investors. In my pursuit of identifying the traits and skills of a great investor, I first looked into their backgrounds. I found many were raised in blue collar or middle class families. Rarely where they from fabulously wealthy families or families where there was a history of investing professionally. But their path to a career and investing varied. Some like Ron Barron, the mutual fund manager and investor with more than $50 billion on her management started investing as a teenager. Yeah, from my grandma, it's well. I was interested in stock market because I had friends of mine who had been given stock from the grandparents who were prosperous. In Eastman, Kodak and Polaroid. I said, I want to do that. And my father said, we can't invest in stocks. We've never done that, you know, family. And in fact, one of the ideas behind my business is the idea was I wanted to be able to have people like my parents be able to invest in the stock market. So I saw that and then he said, well, I had $1,000 at the time. And he said, well, if you show me why you want to invest in a company and you put all your money into one company, then and show me why, then I'll let you do that and open account for you. And so I did research, I would go to this brokerage firm. And I was called McDonald's company, or from Cleveland. And they were right by Asperg Park High School. So I'd go there after school, sports and girls and stocks. I would go there after school. And all these guys, old guys, 40, 50 years old. They're sitting there on these green chairs and looking at a tape that hardly moved. I think the New York Stock Exchange was 25 million shares a day and maybe American was a million or two million shares a day. So look, I got a report on this Mama County National Bank and I start reading it. And it was around the corner where I lived in Allenhurst outside of Asperg Park. And I told my father why I wanted to invest in it. And he let me invest. And the stock was $10 a share, 100 shares. And then the stock every day for the next six months, seven months, every day, did they stay the same or went up in eighth? And it was printed to 15 stocks in the Asperg Park Press. And everybody said the same. And then it got acquired at $17 a share. So my $1000 became $1700. I said, man, there's nothing today. I want to do that. So I was interested. Hedge Fund billionaire Ken Griffin also turned an early affinity for math and computers into an early career in stock trading. Let's talk about your background before you started Sardin. You're born in Florida? I was born in Daytona Beach. My father worked on the space program back in the 1960s. But I spent my formative years in middle school and high school in Buck or Tung Florida. And you were a pretty good math student and I'm told a computer.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,928,2022-10-08 19:35:54
12703," each. My father worked on the space program back in the 1960s. But I spent my formative years at middle school and high school in Buckertone, Florida. And you were a pretty good math student and I'm told a computer nerd as well. Is that fair or unfair? Well, I appreciate the compliment because to be a computer nerd has obviously turned out to be a pretty good place to be in life. And yes, I was very interested in both mathematics and programming in high school. And it's defined my career and has had a very important role in my life. So you went to Harvard College. Most students there are taking courses or their athletics, but you were maybe doing that. But you were also trading securities. Is that true? That is true. I started a small partnership my second year at Harvard to engage in convertible bond arbitrage, which was a bit of a off the beaten path occupation for a kid in college. But I had a great fascination with markets and I had an opportunity to invest capital markets in my college days. And it was an incredible opportunity. It was a really great learning experience. But in those days, it wasn't common to be able to get stock prices instantly. You had to get a special terminal or special intended to let you get the stock quotes. Is that right? So it's amazing is, you know, I love the line people go, well, that's how we've always done it. And I get to think back into the early days of Citadel. We're always did it meant we used a fax machine, which you and I of course have memories of. And the fax machine was revolutionary. In the 1980s, real time stock prices were actually difficult to receive. And I put a satellite dish on top of the dorm room. So I would have access to real time stock quotes in managing the portfolio that I managed. And what did the Harvard people say? Interestingly enough, back in the 80s, Harvard had a general prohibition on commercial activity in your dorm rooms. So I had to go to the building superintendent to get an exception to put the satellite dish on the roof of the building. And fortunately, he was willing to grant me that exception. But not every investor saw their future in finance early. Real estate, Titan, Sam Zell and myself studied the law, became lawyers and hated it. I was always a good enough academic to get from here to there. So when I wanted to go to law school, I got seven A's. But I didn't get very many A's before that. And I basically used the four years of being an undergraduate to build a real estate business and build other businesses. And I just had a great time. So you were doing some real estate on the side while you were in college. And then you went to University of Michigan Law School. And to please your mother or father, you said I'm going to go to law school. But you weren't that interested in being a lawyer? No. Never. As a matter of fact, I ended up graduating and becoming a lawyer. And I practiced for four days. Four days? That's, I didn't realize you practiced that long. Four days. Four days. And so in the morning of the fifth day, I went to see the senior partner. And as only a 24-year-old could do, I looked in and I said, I just don't think this is a good use of my time. He said, okay, there's the door. Well, actually, what he said is, what are you going to do? And I said, I'm just going to go back to doing deals like I did when I was in law school and in the real estate business in the neighborhood. And so he said, one, if you stay here and we'll do the legal work, and we'll invest in your deals. And so that's what we did for you. And then there's activist investor Nelson Peltz, who didn't see the point in studying at all. What I really wanted to do was ski. So I left Wharton and I went up to Maine and became a ski boat. What did your family say? Nelson, we really wanted you to go to Wharton and be a good student. You're one of ski. I mean, that's not what you're supposed to do. That's correct. They did say that. What did you do? You said I went skiing. My father was an amazing guy. He wasn't happy that I left Wharton. He wasn't happy that I was a ski bum. And he wasn't happy that I grew a beard. But I did all of those things. The snow melted in late spring and came back and I had a a summer job offered to me in Mount Hood Argon to help them teach racing to young kids in Mount Hood Argonne. And I needed some money to get out there. I asked him if he'd give me a job on a truck a hundred bucks a week, two weeks, that was all I needed. He said, find shave your beard off and do it. I said I would. It was only.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,929,2022-10-08 19:40:19
12704," Two weeks, that was all I needed. He said, find, shave your beard off and do it. I said, I would. It was only temporary. So I shaved my beard off. And after about a week on the job, I started telling him things that I thought that were missed opportunities. And he set me up beautifully. He said, why don't you stay here and do what you want to do instead of going out to Mount Huracan. Well, I did. And that's what happened. There are also great investors like Paula Volent, one of the country's most successful endowment heads who came to investing after a completely different career. I studied paper conservation, restoring prints and drawings. I worked at the New York Historical Society for a while there. I then went to work at the Palace of Fine Arts in their Conservation Lab. And then I went to Los Angeles where I worked at the LA County Museum. I did a scientific work at the Getty. And then I set up my own conservation studio where I worked with contemporary artists like Ed Rouchet, St. Francis. And I was running my own business. And I realized I needed to know a little bit about finance because I was working with very expensive works of art. I was running a studio. And so I started taking a couple of business classes at UCLA. And through that, I got introduced to Yale School of Management. And I got into Yale School of Management at the same time I got offered a fellowship at the National Gallery of Art where you and I both serve the Lyscher Fellow. And I worked in the paper conservation lab there, combining paper and paintings techniques for conservation on contemporary works of art. So you did that for a while, then you went to Yale School of Management? My husband and I had been trying to have a child and it wasn't kind of works. It wasn't happening. So he said, OK, well, let's move to New Haven. And of course, that was instant. And my daughter was born after my first semester. So I took a break. And when my daughter was probably two months old, I went to David Swenson and knocked on the door and said, hi, I want to learn about endowment because I'm going to work at a museum. And this is about David. David looked at my resume. There was no finance at all. And he took me in. And I started filing and helping organize things and little by little I got projects to do. I remember he had me do a big research on soft dollars. That was one project I worked on. And little by little I became incorporated into the investment office. Coming up, we hear about the extreme intelligence and intention to detail that it takes for success on Wall Street. One of Sam's favorite samisms is we suffer from knowing the numbers. While Teslas and the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today won't electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total US greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71% building to cross America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do a hundred percent clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Teslas. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels. We want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of US greenhouse gas emissions. So what's the best investment advice you've ever put in? You haven't found anybody. The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance, and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day. And if you keep at it and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's not just interest. it was...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,930,2022-10-08 19:44:48
12705," Learn is additive every day and if you keep at it and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's not just interest. It was always said above compound interest returns, compound business returns, compound human returns. They're all very additive because you'll learn every day. And if you keep at it, it's very, very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make selling it the wrong time? And they sell when the prices go down? Yes, or yes. Not keeping, but people have conviction or they invest for the, if they invest for the right reasons, just keep at it. Another trait of great investors that shouldn't surprise you is they all tend to have a high degree of intelligence, many excelled academically. But true success as Mary Erdo's, the CEO of JP Morgan Asset and Wealth Management, points out, comes from training and continuing to educate oneself. So training on Wall Street, but specifically in Wealth Management, is a, is a very, very long process. We, we have 2200 analysts starting today and they're going to be working through the summer. We have 3600 analysts across JP Morgan Chase that will, that will start at the very, in the September time period for their full time role. And we work very hard to go through in-depth training and then to work through which ones actually are good at stock investing, which ones are good at M&A transactions, which ones are good at helping people understand things in a more simplistic matter. That's a two to three year training program. But that's pretty fast. If you think 10,000 hours is about what you need to master any subject. If someone comes in and has a regular, you know, eight hour a day job, five days a week, it's going to take you about five years to have a base level mastery. On Wall Street, it's more like 12 hours a day, six days a week, that cuts you down to about two and a half years before you become mastered in something. Once they've got that under their belt, they can then join a team. And if they've been successful going through the analyst program, joining a team, then the team will work through how that works. But it is a constant education each and every day. Every morning we start with an eight o'clock meeting and I call it like a mini university. And it's not just about what you've read in the newspapers as to what happened overnight. It's about understanding how all of those components fit together in a client's portfolio. And then what might be right for you would be different than somebody else. And you're synthesizing all that information every morning. And then you're going out and you're figuring out how to apply it to each situation. Don Fitzpatrick, the investment chief for George Soros, is of a similar mindset to Erdos. For her, the constant pursuit of new ideas and new voices keep her ahead of the game. So I read a lot. You know, in the morning, I'll skim through two or three different papers. During my days, I'm meeting with a lot of smart investors and smart people running companies. You learn a lot from there. I talk to peers. But I think part of the trick of this big business is being able to really aggregate and assimilate information. And one of the other tricks of this industry is trying to find sources of information that are different than the other people in the business because you don't want to get crowd thinking. I think that happens a lot in this business. Everyone's talking to the same people. And a view becomes consensus that might not be really grounded as well as it should be in facts. Attention to detail also sets great investors apart as described by two real estate legends. Sam Zell and John Gray. You know, one of Sam's favorite samisms is we suffer from knowing the numbers. I think we've managed to tip through the two loops for the last 50 years by never allowing ourselves to get swept up in the enthusiasm of whatever the current event might be. And I think by maintaining that level of discipline.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,931,2022-10-08 19:48:43
12706," up in the enthusiasm of whatever the current event might be. And I think by maintaining that level of discipline, yeah, we made mistakes, and that's to be expected. But we've all been, quote, controllable. No one mistake was ever catastrophic. The first deal I worked on was a shopping center in Chesapeake, Virginia, the Great Bridge shopping center. It was a $6 million transaction. We borrowed four, so it was a $2 million equity check. And you would have thought I was buying the island of Manhattan. I mean, I was down there for three weeks. I met every tenant. I was counting the car traffic. I was learning the business. And it was an amazing experience because I was the chief bottle washer. I was the waiter. I was the matredee. Because we were this tiny little business, and I was learning it firsthand. Now one of the most famous things in the real estate world is location, location, location, meaning that the location is everything. And also you might say it's local, local, local, because most people make real estate investments kind of in the area they know. You've made investments all over the world. How do you sitting in New York know about the value of real estate in Europe or in Asia, and how hard has that been to build a global business? So I think the key to that is to have a global footprint, to have hundreds of people all over the world. And it took us a long time to do it. I mean, we've been at this for 30 years, and you really need talented people on the ground. You need local people who know the markets. The one thing I'd say though that is advantageous about real estate is so many of the trends we're seeing, particularly driven by technology, are the same around the world. So when we started buying warehouses back in 2010, and we noticed that there were these e-commerce tenants showing up, and we started buying more in the US, it wasn't a big leap of faith to say the same thing's going to happen in Canada, it's going to happen in the UK and continental Europe and across Asia. So my view is that if you have the skill set, you can evaluate, plus you travel a lot, like you, I'm on planes a lot. I no longer run the real estate business day today. My colleagues Ken Kaplan and Kathleen McCarthy have done an amazing job, but they have teams around the world on the ground, and we're local in those markets, and I think that's really important. You cannot buy real estate in Mumbai the way we have flying in and flying out of New York. Next, we look at how skilled investors evaluate risk. We are 100% confident every time we make the investment that it's going to be a big company. We are wrong a lot of the time. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. We have to get interest rates higher and bring inflation back to our targets. It's better to pass this become a skier. We are running on thin ice. No one deliberately wants to go into that, but we sneak walk into conflict with unmatched reach and resources from more than 120 countries. The moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, you are global business authority. One of the easiest paths in life is to accept and follow conventional wisdom. But what great investors have found is that path doesn't lead to easy returns. The biggest wins come from going against the grain and taking a risk, especially if you are leading venture capital investor like Mark Andreessen or Vinod Kostler. Each top and venture firm has its own bar. So it has its own set of criteria for things that you should be done or not. Then the top tier venture firms as a group have a collective bar, which is a top tier venture firm.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,932,2022-10-08 19:53:01
12707," firm has its own bar, so it has its own set of criteria for kind of whether it thinks that deals should be done or not. And then the top tier venture firms as a group have kind of a collective bar, which is kind of is a top tier venture firm going to fund this company or not. And it's actually easier to answer that second question than it is the first question. Like after you've been in the business for a while, you tend to have a sense of like, okay, this is going to get funded by a top inventory capital firm or it's not. If it is going to get funded by a top inventory capital firm and if my firm doesn't think it's a good idea, you do wonder like who's right, right? Because the other firms are quite smart. So this is one of the regular discussions that we have, which is like, okay, if another one of these top infirmes is interested in it, that might be a very positive substantive signal. If the other top infirmes have looked at it and all passed, that might be a substantive negative signal. That said, some of the best deals in history have been passed on by a very large number of people. And one of the classic examples, Uber was passed on by a very large number of venture capital firms. Uber was actually available to be invested in on this site called Angelist, where literally anybody with a checkbook can invest. And so every once in a while you get these outliers. And it's fundamentally a game of outliers. The money is made on the aberrations. So you want to be generally open-minded and humble about your conclusions about what all these different signals mean. Now a famous economist, Herb Stein once said, if something can't keep going on forever, it won't. In other words, at some point things settle down. You worry that because the economy might soften at some point if interest rates are raised or just because of the business cycle, the wonderful world of venture capital will slow down a bit. And is that a worry for you? So it's a cyclical business for sure. It has a history of boom bus cycles, basically just like any other sector of the economy. That's that, I guess I would say. We do not have a great track record in our industry of predicting these cycles. And I think most of how we either perform or fail to perform is micro-not macro, which is to say it's based on the successor failure of individual companies. And if you just look at the history of venture capital and startups, many of the best companies have been formed during the hot periods. But also many of the companies have been formed during the cold periods. And they're pros and cons of those periods. And so look, it's possible there's another cyclical boom and bus cycle. Our plan for that cycle would basically be to just keep going, keep working with our existing companies, help them through it, keep investing in new companies all the way through, and basically bet on these sort of micro-level fundamental technological and economic changes that continue to happen. Most of what we do is uncharted territory. I would say the one piece that works really well in our business is go for higher risk, higher consequences. So most people in business reduce risk, increase the probability of success, which is reduce risk. But at the expense of making the consequences of success relatively inconsequential, you might make two times your money or something. I, for our business, what works is, I don't mind a 90% probability of failure if there's a 10% chance of changing the world. And that's very much the philosophy. It also goes with, it's the right way to make huge impact. It's not just venture capitalists taking risks. Columbia's endowment head Kim Liu also says gains are not without calculated risks. I think the best investment advice I've ever received is the fact that we are in the business of taking risk. And so if you want to produce return, you have to be willing to take risk and you have to be willing to analyze and mitigate that risk the best you can. And to make sure that the return potential of an investment is equal to the risk, but you can't avoid risk. Now, what do you think the most common mistake investors make generally? I think the most common mistakes is following the herd and just doing what everybody else is doing and not making sure that an investment is appropriate for your institution and making sure that the analysis that someone else has done is not appropriate for you or is not congruent with the way you think about the world. I think there are a million ways to make money. I think there are a million strategies that can work. Not every investment is consistent with your strategy. And so I think there's a lot of herd mentality. And that's a huge mistake that happens. Now sometimes risk don't pan out and mistakes are made. Now I might sit and stew over the loss for a decade or two, but a truly great investor like Kleiner Perkins Chairman John Doerr has the ability to admit a mistake, cut his losses and move on. When I first came to Silicon Valley, I hung out at Stanford on the second floor of Margaret Jackson Hall",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,933,2022-10-08 19:57:48
12708," Has the ability to admit a mistake, cut his losses and move on. When I first came to Silicon Valley, I hung out at Stanford on the second floor of Margaret Jack's Hall. And down that hall was Andy Bechtel-Shim, who founded Sun Microsystems, John Hennessy, who became president of Stanford, founded MIPS Jim Clark of Silicon Graphics. What I didn't do is go down into the basement. Where Len and Sandy were starting Cisco. So that was a miss on my part. More recently, I had the opportunity to invest in an electric vehicle company. And the conventional wisdom was venture capitalists ought not to invest in electric vehicle companies. Not new car companies at all. There have been 400 new car companies in the nation's history. Every one of them but one has gone bankrupt. But I was still very attracted to the market. And we had the choice of backing a brilliant car designer by the name of Henry Fisker. Or ambitious, slightly crazy entrepreneur by the name of Elon Musk. Well, we made the wrong decision. But Tesla did very, very well. And so did electric vehicles. So when I make a mistake, I only think about it for the next 10 or 20 years. How long does it take for you to get over these things? Well, I don't obsess on these, but I won't ever forget. This is a market that over the past few weeks has made it clear it wants to go higher. It got a little spooked by the idea that geopel it will potentially rise. At some point you had to fight for the trademark. Is that stressful? Very stressful. Especially we are a small company in a way. And to have to fight people who have those huge companies who put you 27 lawyers on your back for something which is yours is very stressful. I wish it didn't happen. Everything which happened to me is a lesson in a way that is bad or good. Once it's done, it's done. I'm happy about it. It's done. Did you realize at the time when you started the company that you would become so successful? You're actually so big. No, no. When I started the company, I wanted to have a shop in Paris, which is my hometown. And I wanted to do pretty shoes for pretty girls. That was my goal. Now you look back and you say, actually, I still make pretty shoes. But for many more women. Yeah, absolutely. Do you think you would have been so successful without the Red Soul? I think the Red Soul definitely of course participates to my work but also to the fame of my shoes because it's instantly recognizable. But then you know the design is very important. But definitely when you have such a strong sign of recognition, it participates to... Yeah. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative, like just be honest. We've had sort of a shift in, are we in some sort of circulation fears? The moment people were talking about that all day yesterday. The markets are preparing to close, but the day is not over yet. It's talked about it is now up about 45% of the volatility. A lot of volatility, right? You need the power of the Bloomberg terminal to get you market moving data before anyone else.

You've come to the world's attention many times with your work over the years but very recently at the beginning of this year, in fact, just a few weeks after the war started in Ukraine, you did come to the attention of many people because you took a photo of a Ukrainian family of four trying to cross a bridge who had been killed and that photo ended up on the front pages of the New York Times. Can you tell me a bit about how you came to that seat? So I went and I went directly to the east and was covering the east for about 10 days before the war started. When the war began, I went to Kiev and immediately was covering sort of daily missile strikes and the destruction and those who had been killed and injured. And so one day I was watching images come out from the wires and others who went to the European bridge and there were hundreds of civilians crossing, the elderly, women, children crossing out of your pain and all of those suburbs. And so we made our way toward the bridge through side roads and as we approached, there were injured, the territorial defense soldiers were taking injured over to sort of a brick wall off to the side. So we ran across the street and almost as soon as we got behind that wall, a round came in. So it was either a mortar round or a tank shell, we're not sure. It came in and hit sort of off to the distance. And then the Ukrainian military fired back. And so my security adviser said, would you like to go? And I said no because everyone knows this is a civilian evacuation route and those rounds are probably going toward a Ukrainian base that's off in the distance. But how wrong I was? The next round came in closer and so we dove for cover. And as soon as we popped back up, the next round came in right next to us essentially and it was sort of equidistant between us and a mother and her two children and a church volunteer that was helping us for them to safety. It was very chaotic. Obviously we were all sort of in shock because the round had landed very close to us. Everything was very dusty. And our security adviser immediately went to the aid of the injured and to a soldier who was nearby. And by the time he called us over, you know, the protocol was we wait to be told, you know, it's clear you can come. And so by the time he called us over, I ran across the street not knowing what to expect. Obviously I knew there was someone injured but I anticipated it being a soldier. And although there were civilians crossing steadily and even during the strike, I mean because nothing was shielded so people had to continue to move. And so when I got there, I came upon these four lifeless bodies. Of course, I didn't know if they were dead or alive at that point. I noticed sort of the tiny little moon boots of a child. And as a mother, that was sort of a sort of incredibly jarring and devastating moment. And I was trying to survey, but I was also kind of in shock. And I one side of the way",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,935,2022-10-08 20:06:08
12710," of sort of incredibly jarring and devastating moment. And I was trying to survey, but I was also kind of in shock. And I, one side of my brain was sort of saying, you have to start photographing. And you have to take these pictures because I knew that I had just witnessed, you know, something that was an intentional targeting of civilians. And so I took a few photographs, but rounds were still coming in. And so we were, our security advisor, Steve, was saying, you know, hurry up, work very quickly, and we have to leave. And so I kind of moved around the scene and taking a few photographs, thinking in my head also, I have to be respectful. And you know, perhaps I shouldn't show the faces. So I was trying to take pictures that show the faces and that didn't show the faces, so that we had some options. But the image you, I'm talking about, certainly the version I've seen, you don't necessarily look at the faces actually the way, now you've said that, the way that you look at the image. You can, I, you can't see them, but you can see them. But it's more you look at the scenes of a family. Exactly. And so I've been doing this for, I've been covering war for over 20 years. And I know that there are so many images I've taken that have never been published because they're, they're graphic. And so I was thinking of that as I was shooting, as horribles, that sounds, because obviously I've just witnessed the most devastating scene, but I'm also a photojournalist and that's my job. And so I was, I was trying different angles. And frankly, I didn't think the picture could ever be published because it was civilians. Do you know, do you know the impacts of that photo? Yeah, I mean, it's been used by the, by, I think the United States ambassador to the United Nations to talk about the intentional targeting of civilians. It's been used repeatedly as proof that civilians were targeted because I was there. I witnessed the run up and I, and I know that whoever was firing those rounds was bracketing onto that position. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. We have to get interest rates higher and bring inflation back to our target. So do you dream million people have been affected by this flooding and losing? Disruption is the whole point of a strike. With unmatched reach and resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. When you think of cutting edge technology at sea, you might be thinking of stuff like this. But there's an incoming revolution on the high seas that isn't quite as sexy but could be significantly more impactful. Container shipping is the key component of global trade. About 80% and 90% of all the world's goods are transported to sea at some point. But there's a significant unseen cost to the modern era of global commerce. About 3% of all the world's CO2 emissions come from shipping. 3% may not sound like a lot, but that's roughly comparable to the entire CO2 output of Germany. Since reducing trade isn't a likely option, what about a technological improvement to help reduce the emissions from these well-stocked maritime behemoths? You mentioned being a mother has that changed the job? Yeah, I mean, it's definitely changed the job in the sense that I'm more cautious now than I was before I had children. I think to a sort of normal person who doesn't do this for a living.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,936,2022-10-08 20:10:22
12711," job in the sense that I'm more cautious now than I was before I had children. I think to a sort of normal person who doesn't do this for a living, they probably can't see that, but for me making decisions on a minute-to-minute basis in a war zone, I know I'm being more cautious. I know I'm not going sort of all the way to the front or as far forward as some of my colleagues might be going. You also are now seeing, perhaps when you see an image, when you create an image, when you see the reality of a child who is dead in front of you, would have always affected you. I imagine. Always. Has it changed though? Yes, it has changed. I think, you know, I photographed, I have photographed children dying in Iraq and Afghanistan in Somalia during the Horn of Africa drought in 2011 and it was always devastating, but I think now as a mother, the first thing I do is sort of put myself in the shoes of that mother and I know, you know, I live in constant fear that something will happen to my children. So you're trying to keep yourself safe, but you're also trying to document at the same time. Of course. Perhaps processing it in a slightly different way. I mean, would you say you have become desensitized though? No. I do have to be in any way. No, not at all. I mean, I think I have ways of dealing with my emotion in that moment, but you know, part of that is just really focusing on the task at hand, which is making photographs and looking through the viewfinder that definitely helps me focus on taking pictures. But I'm not desensitized at all. I mean, I cry pretty much all the time when I'm photographing. I get very, very emotional and that's okay. I mean, I, you know, I don't have an issue with that. I don't know what my colleagues think of me, but, you know, I think it's normal. I mean, I'm a human being. And do you think, I mean, you talk about hanging back because of the risk as well, not necessarily going straight to the front. And yet when I asked you about that particular image, it sounded like it's very instinctive when you know you're not where you need to be, and you are heading towards danger. Correct. And that's obviously what I struggle with, because if I'm close and something happens a little closer or a little further from me, but closer to the front line, I'll likely go. But I think my, where I'm positioning myself, is sort of a little removed back and then making judgment calls every day. You know, if I hear that the school has been hit and 30 children have been killed, I will go. You know, if I hear that a building has been hit on the front line, but no civilians were killed, I'm likely not to go. So I'm weighing sort of what will I gain from risking my life? Although that building's been hit, but no civilians have been killed. I mean, this talks to the idea of, not you per se, but a criticism of those in your field of being war junkies, trying to find the very worst to document. And being in places they don't need to be, sometimes causing perhaps more risk. What do you say to that? You know, for me, the highest toll of war is civilian casualties. So that's not being a war junkie. That is documenting reality. And the reality is we are in a situation where one country has invaded another, and every civilian who dies is on account of that invasion. And so I think that if I'm in a position and civilians are being killed, I have to document that. That is a very important part of the job of someone who covers conflict. I'm presumably that for you in this work that you do, you don't obviously just cover war, you cover humanitarian disaster, climate change, the effects on the planet on that. But when it is about civilians, it sounds like the justification you have to make to yourself, to your family, and to those who could be critical is that you are providing evidence. Yeah, and that evidence has been used already by the United Nations. Have you taken pictures of people killing others, of the actual killers before? I mean, I've taken pictures of people who have been accused of killing others, but I have not been there sort of in the moment. I just wonder what that's like as well. You know, the seeing people do the very worst they can do to each. I think people are worse.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,937,2022-10-08 20:14:52
12712," others, but I have not been there sort of in the moment. I just wonder what that's like as well. You know, seeing people do the very worst they can do to each other. I think people are very smart about journalists. You know, they obviously don't allow us access to things when they're killing civilians. You know, I think that there was a time in the Cornwall Valley. I was with the American troops, the 173rd Airborne. I had spent two months living on the side of a mountain with the 173rd. Me and a colleague Elizabeth Rubin for the New York Times magazine. And the point was to understand the nuances of war and why so many civilians were dying in Afghanistan. And in fact, Lieutenant Colonel Oslohn, who was the commander of the Cornwall Valley, was very smart because he had this philosophy of transparency, because he believed that journalists needed to understand sort of the nuances of war to understand why civilians were being killed. And so we were in rock operation, rock avalanche, which was in the movie, The Documentary Restrepo. I don't know if you've seen it, but it's extraordinary. And so we were in that operation where we've jumped out of helicopters in the middle of the night into the heart of Taliban territory, literally walked with everything we owned for six days. And eventually we were ambushed by the Taliban. And we were ambushed from three sides, and there was a huge gun battle. Three soldiers were shot. One was killed. And in the retaliation of the American troops, I was standing with some of the soldiers. Everyone was very shaken up, of course. And one of the soldiers said, look, they're using Afghan women and children as human shields. And he literally had me look through the scope of his gun. And there were women and children on the roofs of the building where they were shooting from. And that is a case where it was incredible to witness. And I could only have witnessed that if I, because I had spent so much time with these troops, and really was willing to risk my life and to be there in the middle of Operation Rock Avalanche. A shot you took during that maneuver. We're going to take a look at that. Can you take me through it? There is an image, the aftermath of that ambush, where it's a very dusty picture. It is a scout team carrying the body of Sergeant Rughal. And he's in a body bag. And it was after that. And the scout team, Clainard, who is sort of leading the way, is crying. And they're walking through this very sort of desolate landscape. And I remember shooting that photograph and asking myself, what are we doing here? You know, what are we doing here? Years after 9-11, fighting in the middle of the mountains where there are no people. You know, and it just felt like such a waste that this young man had died for nothing. And in fact, a few years later, the American troops pulled out entirely from that area. There's another image of yours I wanted to bring to mind and for us to have a look at and talk about an 18-year-old woman in labor stranded in 2009. Tell me about that and how that came about. So in 2009, I won a MacArthur Fellowship, that is in America, it's called a Genius Grant. And it's essentially given to all different disciplines from a cellist, to a scientist, to a photographer, where I was paid a salary for five years with no strings attached to just focus on my work. And I felt a lot of pressure to decide what to focus on with my work, because it was the first time I could decide not be assigned a story. And so I started doing research and I decided to focus on maternal mortality and why over 500,000 women a year were dying in childbirth at that point. This was 2009, as you said. And Afghanistan, where I had been working for a decade at that point, had one of the highest rates of maternal death in the world. And that was because there was such a bad road network, people, women who were pregnant or in labor didn't have access necessarily to medical professionals or to clinics or hospitals that were staffed with doctors. They just couldn't get where they needed to. They just couldn't get where they needed to. They had to take a donkey for 12 hours and imagine being in labor, you know, getting on the back of a donkey. And so I...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,938,2022-10-08 20:19:09
12713," Doctors, they just couldn't get where they needed to. They just couldn't get where they needed to. They had to take a donkey for 12 hours and imagine being in labor, you know, getting on the back of a donkey. And so I went to very remote villages in Badaksham province, which was one of these provinces with high numbers. And on the way back, I was riding with Dr. Ziba, who was also helping me translate. And we noticed these two women on the side of a mountain and there was not a man with them, which in Afghanistan is very rare. And we stopped the car and said, what are you doing here? Do you need help? And it turned out the woman on the right, Norene So was in labor. And Norene So's husband's first wife had died in childbirth. And he was so determined to not lose her that he managed to get a car in the village. But when we met them, their car had broken down. So they were stranded on the side of the road. So I said, well, just get in my car. I'll take you to the hospital. We're going toward Fiasabad, which was the capital of the state. And they said, no, we need permission from the husband. So we'll wait. And so I turned to Dr. Ziba and I said, okay, you have to find the husband. There's one road in the whole province. He's obviously on the road, you know. So she found him, of course, pretty quickly and brought him back in the whole car, the whole family piled in my car and we took them to the hospital. And everyone asked me if she delivered safely. And if I took photographs and yes, she delivered safely. But no, I did not take photographs because I felt like I changed the course of that story with my presence by taking them. So I took a photo. I took about three frames and that photograph is one of those frames. And that's when you had met and just seen it because it's so striking the blue. Exactly. I met them. We asked their story and then we asked permission right before Ziba left to find the husband. We asked permission for me to take a few photographs.

Sleep is crucial important and I think we've moved from this attitude from its indulgence a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure for something as universally important to human life as sleep. Mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s. And so it makes that a really exciting field because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harnessed to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts. But if you want to be wise, you really want wisdom, you got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what you bring figures out while you're sleeping. I think on balancing a woman has been a help to you. A huge help being a woman rather than a hindrance. Yes, everyone thinks it's a hindrance, but in fact, it's a huge help because people, first of all, I've access to men and women. And particularly when I'm working in countries like Afghanistan and Somalia where men and women are usually segregated by gender. And people underestimate women I find and they still do. And so they sort of discount me and say, okay, sure, sure, go do you need to be underestimated? Yeah, I love being an officer. I love it. Yeah, it's one of those things. I mean, I suppose on the other series, much more serious side of it is that again, when you're thinking and calculating risks, you know, rape as a weapon of war is a unique tool wielded against women. Yes. And for me, when I was, I've been kidnapped twice.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,939,2022-10-08 20:23:35
12714," And for me, when I was, I've been kidnapped twice. The first time was in Iraq, and that was only a day, and it turned out, compared to Libya, was quite sort of, it was manageable in the sense that we were working outside of Fallujah. I was working with a colleague from the New York Times. We had heard a helicopter of American troops went down. We went to find it. We got copped by insurgents who thought maybe we were with the American occupation. We finally convinced them we were journalists. They held us until dusk, and then eventually let us go. Obviously, it was terrifying. We had guns to our heads for about 11 hours. We didn't know if we would survive. Libya was much more violent, much more dramatic. We were four journalists in one car. Originally, we had been two in each car, but one of the drivers' brothers had been shot at the front line. So he quit in the middle of the battle, and we ended up in one car. We had to decide how long to stay. That is not an easy discussion, because with four journalists, everyone has a different perspective on how long to stay, what our needs are, how dangerous a situation is. By the time we decided to pull back east toward Benghazi, we ran into one of Kedafi's troops checkpoints. It was incredibly hostile. The rebels had been covering, started opening fire on that checkpoint, so we were literally in a wall of bullets. The men were pulled out of the car. Me as the only woman, I was sort of left sitting there, because they didn't know what to do with me. But the car was not armored, so I had to get out of the car, because I knew that I needed to get behind cover. I crawled across the backseat, and when I jumped out, one of Kedafi's troops sort of came to me and was pulling at my cameras, instinctively I was pulling back, even though there were bullets, literally going, you know, next all around us. We finally made it to cover behind the sort of checkpoint building, and we're all told to lie face down in the dirt. We each had a Kalashnikov put to our heads, and we were about to be executed. We were begging for our lives. The commander came over at that point and said, you can't execute them, they're American, which this was all in Arabic and Anthony Shadee later translated for us. You know, in retrospect, I have no idea why they spared us being American, because in the Middle East, a lot of people don't like our foreign policy. And so we were tied up and blindfolded. And essentially, for the next three days, we were beaten up, tied up, blindfolded, threatened with execution. And for me as the only woman I was touched repeatedly, I was not raped, but of course, in that time, being tied up and blindfolded, I thought of the many, many women I have interviewed over the years who have been raped. And so I sort of ironically look to them for strength because I thought, well, if they survived it, and if it happens to me, I can survive it as well. Are you living just minutes a minute? A minute to minute. I mean, in a kidnapping, there is no sort of an outward on the line. It is literally every second is survival mode. It is, what can I do to get through this fear? What can I do to get through this pain? She's, I mean, it sounds like the scene from a film. And yet, it's your life. And I believe Jennifer Lawrence has been interested in your life all of their works. She was talking about the film. She was, we spent about three years together when Warner Brothers optioned the rights to my memoir. I wrote a memoir after that called It's What I Do, a Photographer's Life of Love and War. And that memoir was optioned almost immediately by Warner Brothers. Steven Spielberg was slated to direct and Jennifer Lawrence was slated to play me. And that went on for three years. Was it like taking Jennifer Lawrence to Ozides? I took her to the border with South Sudan when it was very, very tense. She wanted to understand what it feels like to feel that fear and to be close to a war zone. Obviously, we had to worry about her safety, so I couldn't take her.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,940,2022-10-08 20:27:52
12715," It feels like to feel that fear and to be close to a war zone. Obviously, we had to worry about her safety, so I couldn't take her. Hey, you're an extra headache. But I worry about what I list while you're deep away. That's very stressful. Let's just say, when I put her on the plane from Uganda, I could walk for a week. My back went out. But she eventually dropped out. Okay. And so now it is being made into a limited series. All right. So a TV series. A TV series. Correct. Okay. But Lisa Florentz now knows what it's like to do your job. She does. She's just come out with a movie playing a character named Lindsay. Oh, yeah. I think she got inspiration from it. What have you learned that from being in these scenarios, coming in and coming out of some of the worst things we can do to each other? Yeah, I mean, I guess I've learned the capacity for survival, for resilience, for forgiveness, the fact that human beings can be equally evil as they can be amazingly generous. And yeah, resilient. I think that I've learned a lot from the people I've covered. But I think we have to look at the ability of human beings to live both within those situations and to survive them after. Well, thank you very much for taking us behind the lens with you. Thank you. Lindsay. And thank you so much for being with us until we meet again. Take care and goodbye.

I think it's kind of a way of that past. No, I don't think so, but I think it's like any time that frankly it's when a lot of other people get into crypto, right? But it's when the audience is too, it's when it's in the news a lot. And when does that happen? A lot of times when the prices are going up. She was a federal prosecutor going after gangs and the mob before being handed for next assignment, taking down Bitcoin. Katie Han soon realized this new technology was much more than a tool used by criminals. She dove deep and became a crypto convert, swapping her prosecutor hat for a board seat at Coinbase, and became the first female general partner at Venture Firm and Recent Horror Whits. Han, now a prolific crypto investor, recently launched her own fund with one and a half billion dollars to deploy. It's the largest fund ever raised by a single investor. Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, CEO and founder of Han Ventures, Katie Han. Katie, it's so great to have you. Great to be back here in the studio with you, Emily. I want to start with a vibe check. Okay. What state of the crypto cycle are we in right now? It was hot. Yep. And then it got pretty cold. Hmm. Well, look, Emily, zooming back because I've been in crypto for a decade if you can believe it. We've seen crypto be really hot and then all of a sudden not. And so we've seen this before. However, I think one of the things that's a little bit different now is with each new crypto cycle, more and more people come into it. And so it's more and more pronounced each cycle. And I would push back on it's not. I think it depends on what area of the ecosystem you're looking at. We think developers think crypto and Web3 is still really hot. I am seeing a lot less of those. We're all going to make it hashtags. I'm seeing a lot less of them too, although I am spending less time on Twitter. So maybe that's why. Well, but with each cycle, there are new acronyms. What hasn't happened is a crypto winter in the midst of kind of really serious global macro conditions. So we have inflation kind of at record highs for our generation, in our lifetime. And then we have also a war that's broken out in the Ukraine. And we have a number of other factors going on here. So that's very different. There was some serious carnage out there. Socius, Luna, three hours. What's been your takeaways from that? I don't want to sit here and tell you that algorithmic stablecoins are bad. Because I actually think they're really interesting. However, I think what happened is you had, in this case you mentioned, Luna and Tara. That was an algorithmic stablecoin that was getting pretty widespread adoption relative to what the tech could do. I didn't realize you spent your teenage years living in Egypt and learning Arabic. Tell me about your upbringing. I was always uprooted. My dad worked for a large company and we were always moving just when I would get comfortable in one space. And I think actually that's pretty important. If you fast forward and look at my career, I'm comfortable being in uncomfortable situations. I didn't know a lot about venture when I got into it initially. I didn't know a lot about crypto when I got into it initially. And I was okay asking questions. I was okay not knowing the local acronyms or the Namanclature of a particular field. And I'm, you know, I'm taken right back to my teenage years in Cairo, moving from Houston, Texas one day to downtown Maddie in Cairo the next day. You studied law? I did. You clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. That's right. You became a federal prosecutor. You were taking on prison gangs. Yup. And the mafia. That must have taken a really sick skin. I was doing it at age 25. And now if I kind of take a step back and you know, I think that happens at different points in your career. Like, whoa, if I would have analyzed that a little more at the time. And I'm kind of in some ways glad I didn't. I just don't write.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,942,2022-10-08 20:36:34

Like, whoa, if I would have analyzed that a little more at the time, and I'm kind of in some ways glad I didn't, I just dove right in, because I found it fascinating. There was a human aspect to it and people's stories, and I felt like those stories mattered. So I was drawn to criminal law and became a federal prosecutor, and I did cases involving violent crime, but then really mistriing cases, being back in the courtroom, being before the grand jury. Like the prosecutor you would see on TV going to try those murder cases. Doing those two hour closing arguments. That's right. And so moved out here to California. I died at the largest prison gang in the world at the time. Outlaw motorcycle gangs, hostage taking, bank robberies, armed bank robberies, there was really not a kind of criminal case by that point in my career. I hadn't done it. It was right around that time, 2012. One of my bosses came in and said, let's have that same energy that you brought to those gang cases, to those murder cases. And let's go ahead and have you investigate this new criminal technology that we really need to look into and possibly shut this down. So you created the first cryptocurrency task force. How would you describe it? Fortunately, several of us in the government realized at the time, it's not possible, also not desirable, because Bitcoin is not an entity. It's not a person, right? It's a protocol. It would be like saying, let's go shut down cash. Let's go shut down the internet. It's not possible. Probably wouldn't be a good idea, either. I was using crypto and technologies like the Bitcoin blockchain, because that's all it existed then, this is 2012, 2013, to actually uncover criminal activity. So I didn't think that that technology was bad. Frankly, it was a tool that helped me uncover the various activity. And by the way, it was a step level function improvement better than compliance by banks. I'll just go ahead and say it. That's a little bit controversial. But I had spent a decade subpoenaing large financial institutions and five times out of 10 didn't get back what I needed. One case I worked on, and people always say, oh, you shut down the Silk Road. What actually happened? I was looking into something completely, not having to do with anything at all of the Silk Road, and came across some, what looked to be some kind of odd activity. And it turns out that a couple of federal agents on the Silk Road Task Force out of Washington, DC, were cropped. And that is the case that I ended up in dining, and I ended up prosecuting those agents, and they both went to prison. So that's the aspect of what Silk Road case that I worked on. I would never, never have been able to uncover that criminal activity by those agents, because they were federal agents, they knew how to cover their tracks. Had they not used Bitcoin blockchain. So that technology right there, if they had just used wires or cash or bank wires, we would never have uncovered that. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund from scratch?

I was practicing for you. I know you're pretty good. Ooh, I don't like that. I will take this. Well, put it over here here. Not cool. Not cool. All right. I will concede. I can see you've got me, Bid. Very good game. Well played. Thank you, sir. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,943,2022-10-08 20:40:53
12718," Oh, I will concede. I can see you've got me, Bid. Very good game. Well played. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Bid. Bid. Bid. So you became kind of a crypto convert after this. You joined the board of coinbase. That's right. Very early on. How did you and coinbase and Brian Armstrong come together? I hosted an event here in San Francisco at the Federal Reserve Bank. And I believe it was there that it wasn't just Brian. It was a lot of what I'll call legitimate actors and crypto who wanted to usher in this new wave, this new ecosystem. And then we brought together the heads of all kinds of agencies, really in an effort to kind of talk about building bridges. You know, the government and the crypto industry, we're never going to see eye to eye on a lot of things. But we did think there were some commonalities. Coinbase is a company that has suffered. They've been losing share. The valuation of the public markets has plummeted. Why do you think that is? And how do you think it can be fixed? Yeah. Well, I think again, a few things it's tied to. One, a large aspect of Coinbase's business now, of course, is trading revenue. And that's down when prices are down. And you know, the company's been very transparent about that long before going public. I mean, also, if you look at its S1, it specifically identifies that. And just how volatile crypto cycles are. So I think that's part of it. It's judged by public markets as a technology stock, or as a financial services company. By the way, I think it's both. I think it's not just a financial services company. I think it's so much more. I think it's really a portal to this whole new ecosystem. You were also on the board of OpenC until recently, there's an insider trading situation or accusation going on there. Coinbase has also had employees accused of insider trading. How much is this happening within crypto companies? And within the industry and how big a problem is? Yeah. I think crypto is under the microscope. So where you have a case, two cases, three cases, in crypto ecosystem, which now is a trillion dollar industry, I think multi-billion approaching trillion dollar industry, you're always going to be able to find examples like that. So I don't want to make too much out of a handful of cases. That said, the company Coinbase OpenC take these things incredibly seriously. Along with your position at Coinbase, you became a partner at one of the most story venture capital firms in Silicon Valley in the United East and Harwitz. What was your experience at A16Z-like? There I met Chris Dixon, and I met Ben Horowitz, and I met Mark Andreessen, and I had worked with them for just about a year, maybe a little bit over when they asked me to come and co-run their crypto funds at Andreessen Hearts. Again, I jumped at that chance, and I think, really, that speaks to the fact that, as I said before, things are a hell yes or there are no, and it was a hell yes for me. So Andreessen Horowitz is the kind of place where if you make a partner, you don't leave. Yeah. How did Mark and Ben respond when you said, yeah, you want to leave to start a crypto fund of my own? As you might know, Emily, they're an anchor. They're an anchor check into my fund, and I'm very grateful for that. You know, Mark and Chris and folks like them are also personal LPs. So I felt very supported when I shared that decision. And I will say that it was not running away from Andreessen Hearts. It was running to another opportunity. And you know, crypto is not, what do they say it's not a spectator sport? It's like, you're in it. It excuse very young. It's 24-7. It's global. And it's hustle. And at this, and that's a trade-off. It's a life trade-off. And at this point in my career and in my life, if I was going to continue to make that trade-off, I just wanted to do it and do it in a way that was really true to me. So you struck out on your own? Yes. To launch on Ventures, what gave you the courage to do that? What was the spark that lit the fire? Yeah. That got you to say, I need to do this and do this now. Sure. What I set out to do was to continue to invest in this ecosystem that I think is so broad that decision was very purposeful, and the timing was very purposeful. We have an early stage fund that does seed stage, Series A, even Series B. And then we have what we call an acceleration fund, which is, it's not a growth fund. It's a crypto growth fund. And I think those are different things. But it's later stage. It might be crypto-publics. Certain kinds of public tokens were set.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,944,2022-10-08 20:45:25
12719," It's not a growth fund, it's a crypto growth fund, and I think those are different things, but it's later stage. It might be crypto-publics. Certain kinds of public tokens were set up to hold tokens and participate in the token ecosystem, or later stage companies. I mean, there are now several crypto, many crypto unicorns. Space has become really competitive, even though you say, you know, crypto's had its kind of ups and downs. The thing is, a lot of people in some of those last cycles have seen the kind of venture style returns that can be having crypto. And so you've had a lot of new funds enter the space, and that's driven up competition. So what differentiates on ventures then from, you know, all of these other crypto funds or even the more traditional venture capitalists, like entries in Harowitz or Sequoia, they also have crypto funds now. Well, I think a lot of traditional venture capital funds now have crypto funds. It used to just be like a regulatory designation. It was like, are you an RIA, which is registered investment advisor? I would say for crypto founders today, it's not enough to just be an RIA, right? They, frankly, I don't even know if a lot of them care. That's a regulatory designation. What crypto founders today want to know is, do you live and breathe crypto? Do you inhale the discourse? Are you part of the community? Do you participate in governance? Are you going to be staking these kind of crypto verbs out there? And if you're not really in this space full time, I think it's very hard to run a successful crypto fund. We don't have a hedge fund component. So we're not sitting here buying and trading and selling. That's a hedge fund structure. And there are crypto hedge funds. We're not one. We're making seven to ten year bets. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund from scratch? You know, it's hard, but it's not impossible. We don't have a crystal ball. I don't know. I can't predict cycles, but I knew that we were in a cycle where you saw so much for ever an excitement around the space. And I already talked about what makes this different. But I think one thing also is we are a nimble strike force. We don't fish in the same pond. We have the crypto natives. We have a fishing execution. We have operators, seasoned operators who really know how to stick the landing. And I think that's reflected on our culture. I would say the only thing that's changed in our strategy as a result of the market correction is really more of a focus on early stage, but we still have our late stage fund. And when we see valuations, which I think will still see correct, spoiler, I think we'll continue to see some corrections. And so we might deploy our later stage fund a little bit more slowly. It might not be on an even 50-50 cadence. And that's okay. Long-term, our strategy hasn't changed. Long-term, we're committed to this space. How much do you think valuations are going to correct? You know, it's just, I can't give you a one-size-fits-all answer because crypto is not a monolith. So, we have some crypto companies that really follow more of an enterprise SaaS business model. You have others that are layer one protocols. You have still others that are consumer-facing applications. And I think one of the things we're seeing right now is the infrastructure layer. And that's where we're spending a lot of our time, by the way. And we think more and more use cases will come about when the infrastructure layers in place. So, my own view is we are not rushing to deploy. We're certainly not getting caught up. I'm not going to do VC FOMO and have you deploy that. You know, look, I think it's very easy to get into that mindset, right? It's because it's a competitive sport. It's a competitive space. And I think, I'd be lying if I said that that doesn't influence anyone. I try to, what I do, and I think I do differently, is I try to take stock of that. Oh, that's the FOMO mentality kicking in. That's bad. Again, you don't want to over-correct, though. What we look for is we look for amazing founders. It doesn't matter if I think valuations will correct if they're amazing founders. There's a huge tam. We also look for what's your regulatory plan? If you're launching a token, what's your plan to comply with the law? What's your plan for security, by the way? We've seen a lot of hacks in the space. We want to really dive in there and make sure that the founders have been thoughtful about, especially if they're custodian customer funds, keeping those funds secure. If it's a cross-chain bridge, what are the exploits? Have you changed your strategy at all, given the downturn? What? Have you backed out of any deals? We've decided not to do certain deals because the conditions have changed since you raised the phone. We have decided not to do certain deals. We've never backed out of a deal. We have decided not to do a few deals because we think that pricing was ahead of progress candidly. We might have been wrong about that, Emily. We might have been wrong about that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,945,2022-10-08 20:49:46
12720," We have decided not to do a few deals because we think that pricing was ahead of progress candidly. And we might have been wrong about that, Emily. We might have been wrong about that. But I think if we were wrong not to do a couple of deals better that we might have been right, because if we were wrong about that, I think we can find a way to still invest in those projects later. Well, one thing I'm hearing is that a lot of dry powder has just sacked up because... Yep. At least funds raised a lot of money raised, what was the biggest fund ever for a single person, not just a woman. Yeah. Anyone. Yep. Are you confident you're going to have a place to put all that money? I am, but if I don't have a place to put it, I'm not just going to go willing, nearly deploy it. One of the things that we told our LPs even during the period when we raised our fund, which was when crypto was undeniably still on a bull run, we said that we are going to be pretty steadfast, sticking to a two-year deployment cycle, and I think one thing that's changed is that might have lengthened. It certainly hasn't shortened, but we will, again, we feel very good that we have the capital to back great teams when we see them. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind, China. Falling behind. Informed. Be prepared. Be ahead of the game. We are going to be in a digital world. And I happen to think that we are going to be in a digital world. We are going to be in a digital world. We are going to be in a digital world. We are going to increasingly live in a digital world. And I happen to think that if you live in a digital world, you're going to want to own digital goods in that world. You're not just going to be satisfied to rent them, which is what we do now. We buy our content from Waldgarden's, without digital scarcity, which is what NFTs unlock. You don't really own anything. You're subject to the whims of a platform. And I think NFTs and digitally scarce goods fundamentally change that. We see NFTs back again. But we are spending a lot of time in the infrastructure layer. Like I tell you, zero knowledge, technology, scalability. We think of that as the plumbing. If you think of the fiber-hubtic cables. Remember, you couldn't have had YouTube and Netflix with dial-up. You couldn't have streamed content. The same is true of crypto use cases. We think that there will be a lot of new use cases unlocked when the infrastructure is there, when it's more efficient, when it's more user-friendly. So we're spending a lot of our time there. President Biden issues this crypto executive order. There are a number of ports that are coming due. What do you want to see from the administration when it comes to regulation? Are you optimistic that we will get there? Yeah. We were so delighted to see that executive order. This is not something you should normally be delighted about. But why we were is because it was to us a real recognition that this is a US government saying this field isn't going anywhere. This field is growing. It's growing so much that we are going to direct every single agency in the federal government to come up with a plan here. I think we take a step forward, but then you see we're a big government. We're a big system. We have states. We have local entities. So we take a step forward with the EO. And then we take some steps back sometimes too. And I think what I see as crypto founders are confused by that. They're starting to think.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,946,2022-10-08 20:53:41
12721," I can step forward with the EO, and then we take some steps back sometimes too. And I think what I see as crypto founders are confused by that. They're starting to think, well, I could go to this jurisdiction where there's a single regulator, and you don't have 50 states with different rules. It's the US government that needs to start taking stock of the fact that right now, Emily in China, there's a quarter of a billion, ECNY wallets, a quarter of a billion. We're still talking about whether there should be a government central bank digital currency. We're still studying that. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind China. And we're falling behind. What are the dangers of falling behind China and the rest of the world? This is years ahead, so I don't want people to take a headline and say, oh, I think the US dollar will be no longer the global currency, reserve global currency. I'm not saying that now. But fast forward decades, and if you no longer need to use the dollar because you have an alternative, I think that's a real problem. What would we use instead? Well, I think that there are going to be stable coins out there that people who have access to a smartphone will use. There is a demand for it. We see our 285% year of your growth with stable coins. So people are clearly liking the idea of this. Now, again, there have been some spectacular failures, too, but not all stable coins are created the same. But I think the important thing is that we really do need to not just quash innovation. What do you think of how Gary Gensler, the chair of the SEC, and how he's approaching it? One of the things that I hear from founders is that they're very confused because they get told, come in, register. Just come in and talk to us. But you have the one company who's done the ultimate act of going in and registering, Coinbase, File the S1. And still, you know, there's a lot of saber rattling still going on, I think. And again, I don't want to single out the SEC, you know, and I don't want to suggest that anything they're doing is bad. I do think, though, that right now there's a lot of confusion. And one of the pieces of confusion stems from the fact that, you know, and it started with the ICO, Mania, back in what, 2016, 2017, I can't even remember which year now, where the SEC was very loud about securities. A lot of them were securities, but the space has changed. And so to still view it through the ICO lens when so much has happened over the last five years in the space, I think is a mistake. What do you have to say to the skeptics out there who just don't believe in the future of Web3? And don't see where this is going. Yeah. I would say don't judge the current state of innovation by the end state of innovation. I hear from a lot of these skeptics. And by the way, I'm friends with a lot of these skeptics, too. I don't only want to live in a crypto bubble. They want to see the use cases. Especially if they're not technical. Well, when am I going to use it? What will I use it for? And I think one of the things that's not appreciated is how quickly the infrastructure here is catching up. And once you have kind of a, once you have really scalable blockchains that can handle a lot of thorough put and are very efficient, I think that unlocks a whole lot of use cases. People are spending more time on screens. That curve is up and to the right. Whether we like it or not, that is the future. I mean, those who have kids know that kids spend more time online. They want digital things, too. And I think to dismiss it, it is a bit generational. I do find not always, but it is a bit generational. If you talk to kids about being able to have money online, they instantly get that concept. They're comfortable not having to hold something in their hand to think it has value. Take us to the end state. Do Google and Amazon and Facebook and Apple still exist? I believe they will still exist. I mean, it depends what you talk about when you talk about the end state. I mean, I think that, you know, I think for decades, those companies will still be around. But the important thing is, I think this new ecosystem is going to represent a challenge to them. I do think that those entities, decentralized forces are coming and will cut into those entities, profits and revenues. So we have a little rapid fire section. If you could belong to any altcoin tribe, that's what it be. Gosh. There is no way I'm answering that because I will get trolls on Twitter by every other altcoin tribe. I'm a crypto maximalist.

And Brad DeLong of Berkeley on what the broad suite of economic history may be telling us about where we are headed next. People say that the United States has very little to teach them, that we don't have any greater grasp on how to deploy and use these technologies to create a good society. We had our fair share of about faces this week with the Bank of England's quick intervention to save the guilt market as explained by former MPC member Kristen Forbes of MIT. It's a matter of time. Because of the big market moves, there could be some margin calls, some pressures for force selling that could cause the guilt market to freeze up. And British Prime Minister Liz Truss giving up at least part of her economic program. It was becoming a distraction, so that's why we immediately changed that policy and that's the kind of government we are. But as ugly as the situation was in UK markets, it was nothing compared with the setbacks for Russian forces in eastern and southern Ukraine, with President Putin's efforts to quote Annex territory that his forces didn't even control. Which Admiral John Kirby of the NSC looks at as an indication that Mr. Putin just may be coming to understand how difficult his situation really is. The Annexation Announcements as well as his announcement of partial mobilization certainly shows the degree to which Mr. Putin knows how much he's struggling inside Ukraine. And OPEC plus weighed in with its own changes. Cutting production caps by 2 million barrels a day or about 7 percent, putting even more pressure on Europe and the rest of the world already worried about energy. Well, we were disappointed that OPEC made this decision. As the president mentioned, we think it's unnecessary if you look at the global environment where supply continues to be the predominant challenge. Then there's Elon Musk. He offered $44 billion for Twitter back in April, then decided to renegade, got sued, and on the eve of his deposition, returned to his original offer. Even it looks like he's going to be way overpaying. In many ways, this is almost the most expected outcome of all, which is settling on the eve of trial just before deposition of the main players, Elon Musk himself. He doesn't want to be deposed. He has probably some embarrassing text messages and conflicting statements, and all of that would make for a very unpleasant decision. But after all the back and forth this week, US jobs numbers actually came in surprisingly on course, adding 263,000 new jobs just slightly more than expected, with workers paid 5% more than they were last year. And a reduction in the unemployment rate to 3.5%, which made for a rough day in equities on Friday, but actually a pretty good week overall for equities, the S&P 500 adding 1.5% to end the week at 3639, and the NASDAQ, eaked out a gain of 3.4%. LONDS also had a topsy-turvy week, but ended up with the 10-year yield of a relatively modest 5-basis points to 3.88. Here to walk us through this week and what got us here are Aaron Brown, portfolio manager at PIMCO, and Chris Ellman, chief investment officer at CalSTRS. So Chris, let me start with you. Boy, given what we're seeing right now, are we looking at a long cold winter, would you say? Unfortunately, David, I think we are. I think the Fed, you know, with these employment numbers, the Fed knows that they have to continue this pace of aggressive tightening, and they're going to do so the next week and the next week after that. And I think, which is the street is pricing in, but I think after that, they're going to have to keep it up. And that's going to be into the winter, and it's going to be a tough time. So what do you say, Aaron? Is it going to be a rough winter? I think it is going to be a rough winter, I think that their bands of uncertainty are quite wide for next year. The Fed is tightening into an economic slowdown, and we haven't even seen the real impact of that slowdown yet. We're just starting to see signs of a gradual slowing, but likely we'll continue to see that into next year, and we think that we're heading into a recession into early 2023. And at that same point, just given the level of inflation, the Federal Reserve is now really challenged to be...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,949,2022-10-08 21:06:51
12724," that we're heading into a recession into early 2023. And at that same point, just given the level of inflation, the Federal Reserve is now really challenged to be able to arrest that inflation, get it under control, despite what happens to the economy. So I think that really poses a challenge for the Fed, and we'll likely see something that's fairly unprecedented, which is continued financial conditions tightening, and Fed tightening into an economic slowdown, even if it really leads to a harder landing than what the Fed's anticipating. And Aaron, I'd push back a little bit. I actually think we're in a recession right now. It's not a very strong one, and it doesn't hurt a lot. I was so with employment growing. You know, but we did have a negative GDP in the second quarter, third quarter is mild. To me, anything below 1% in the USA feels like a recession. But so what you're saying is, you think it's gonna be a really, we'll actually have a good traditional hard, negative recession with rising unemployment, which is exactly what Powell has said. I mean, that's his forecast. Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, my view at PIMCO is that we'll likely see unemployment rise to about 5% by the end of 2023. And so right now, we're sort of seeing some of those early signs, but we really haven't seen the full brunt of financial condition tightening yet. That's more to come. So we are going to continue to see a slowdown, and I think that's really gonna hit in the first quarter of next year and into the second quarter of 2023. Chris, given where we're at with inflation right now, the concern is about inflation, if we are heading to an intersection or even are already in one, no matter how long it is or how short it is, what are the tools the Fed has to use? Because typically you turn to the Fed and say, okay, start cutting interest rates. Doesn't look like they're gonna do that in a likelihood. No, they're gonna raise interest rates. They only have one tool. They have, well, they have their mouth. They can job on the market, which is what they're doing. They have the dot plot, which is going to indicate or direct the market. But the only tool they have is short-term interest rates and the Fed funds rate. And that's what they're using aggressively. I mean, good grief, 75 basis points. Those are big bounces. You know through history, you've gotta go way back before you have that aggressive tightening of monetary policy, and they have to shrink the balance sheet. So as they move through that, he's already said he's gonna hurt employment. Yet we have stronger numbers. I think the numbers, there's something strange in the numbers this week, just like last month, but we'll see how that balances out. We're gonna have a tougher time. And I think the question's gonna be about corporate earnings. You got CPI next week, and then you got the bank starting to roll out with their earnings. Aaron, has the market priced in the diminishment of earnings at this point, corporate earnings? No, I don't think that they have. What you've seen since the beginning of the year is equities have de-rated, largely driven by the market multiple. So you've seen the market multiple for the S&P 500, de-rate from about 21 and a half times to about 16 times today. Keep in mind that traditionally in recessions, the market multiple is somewhere between 14 and 16 times. So we're just at the upper end of where we typically are in recessions, and we think that you could see a little bit more de-rating from there. That's not really the challenge for the market. The challenge for the market is that when you look at corporate earnings for next year, the market's pricing them to be up 7.5% for consensus. Our forward-looking models are expecting them to be down about 9%. So that's north of a 15% differential versus what the market's pricing for next year and what we think it's likely to be. Also, historically during recessions, earnings fall about 27% on average. So there's real downside risks to our forecast and certainly to the market's forecast. And I think that's where you're going to see the real pressure point for the market in early next year. What's driving that is margins. We're at record high margins right now. The street is expecting that margins are going to expand further from here. So we've even higher than and hit new record highs. We've never seen that in a recession before. So I think the market's really mispriced and that's where the pain's going to come from. Aaron, I've got to ask you if we're already down 23% so far this year, how much lower do you think we can go? Do you see a support level on the S&P? I think that in a modest or modest.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,950,2022-10-08 21:11:19
12725," You know, we're already down 23% so far this year. How much lower do you think we can go? Do you see a support level on the S&P? I think that in a moderate recession, the market probably bottoms out about 30 to 50. There is downside risk if we see further, you know, sort of a more severe or harder landing from there. But, you know, 30 to 50 is still down about 14, 15%. So I do think that there's still room for the market to fall further. Where are you looking for? In terms of your estimates. Yeah, no, I agree 32 to 50. But I mean, that's a negative 36 on the year, which is you're like me. We have asset allocation portfolios. Where do you hide in that kind of a negative market? You've got bonds with the rates rising. So you're going to have continued negative returns out of bonds and then, you know, a negative 30 out of stocks. That's a rough calendar year. Where do you hide? Well, I think that I think there have been actually market opportunities that have arisen since the start of this year. Cash right now, two-year bonds are yielding north of 4%. Now, that's not a sexy return by any, you know, sort of stretch of the imagination. But if you can lock in 4%, you know, add a little bit of spread on top of that, you know, an IG corporates that give you an additional, you know, 2% or so. That's about a 6% return over the next couple of years. That's high quality paper that you can invest in. So I wouldn't, you know, sort of rule cash out as an option. I think that that's somewhere where you can hide and really not expect that much volatility and really consistent returns and sort of hide out there until we see the markets bottom and you can start incrementally moving back into risk. But we can't, I think you need to keep in mind as an investor that if the core of your allocation of your portfolio, which is sort of cash and core fixed income is unstable, then you really can invest in the outer ring assets. So, you know, we really have to stabilize rates in order to move out the risk curve into other asset classes. Right now, cash is a pretty good option. Okay, we're going to pick up exactly that question. Where do you hide in this environment? Chris Aylman and Aaron Brown will be staying with us. We're going to ask for them for some investment advice. We could use it, that's for sure. That's next on Wall Street Week here on Bloomberg. We make it very transparent to the shopper. You can buy it. It's different in different places or demographic of shoppers is completely different from food delivery and our right sharing where 70% women and half of them are moms.

12726," We will know. The facts on unemployment seem clear enough, or at least as clear as that changing social definition ever can be, the situation is getting a little better, but not much. The government announced today that the overall unemployment rate last month was 6.9%. The official unemployment rate has been stuck within a tenth of 7% for six months, and that scarcely represents the massive reduction of unemployment that at least some folks thought they heard Jimmy Carter promise a year ago. That was Louis Royce-Royce, on Wall Street Reef Back in October of 1977, when the unemployment rate was twice what it is today, and we were trying to get it down rather than focusing on inflation, whatever that ends up meaning for employment. If that seems like a galaxy far, far away, well maybe that's no accident. The top movie this week back in 1977 was Star Wars, and the top song on the charts was you got it, the Star Wars theme. Still with us, our Aaron Brown at Pimco, and Chris Aylman of Calcester. Aaron, let me turn to you and pick up on where we were talking just now with Chris, but where you hide, if you're really an asset allocator, you said cash is one alternative. Are there things that involve at least some risk that you go to, and how much it depends on what you think the recovery is going to look like whenever it comes? So I'm going to flip that sort of question and answer the second question first, which is unlike prior recessions that we've seen in very recent history, so think of the global financial crisis or even the pandemic of 2020, I don't think this is going to be a V-shaped recovery. I think this is going to be more of a prolonged sort of stalling of the economy and more of an L-shaped recovery than what we've seen in the past. And the reason for that is because inflation is high and it's likely to persist at high levels, you're not going to come in and see the fed start cutting as the unemployment rises like we've seen in the past. Instead, because the fed is moved from a dual mandate fed to a single mandate fed, really just focus on getting the inflation right down, you'll likely see, you won't see this sort of immediate relief that we've seen in recent history. And so that does change a little bit the landscape of how you think about investing. You know, historically, as we start to get closer to what we expect the bottom level of the S&P 500 to be, we start to, you know, scale risk back up, start to move back into equity investments to catch that recovery to the upside. And this time around, I think you have to be a little bit more patient. So instead, what we're really looking at is fixed income investments that we think are going to be able to sort of stand at the test of time, be able to sort of hide out in a safe haven assets. So beyond just looking at cash, we're looking at high quality investment-grade corporates, we're looking at municipalities, municipal bonds, you know, particularly for those who are, can take advantage of the tax advantages, tax-advantaged bonds, we think offer good value there at a sort of after-tax yield of 6.5%. You know, in addition, we also like some mortgage agency bonds and structured credit bonds as well. And then sort of high quality equities that are defensive equities, high free cash flow, dividend growth, strong balance sheets. We also think do well in this environment. But you know, it is a sort of challenging time for investors where you have to skew more towards fixed income in order to have stability of return as opposed to looking for a quick snapback in equities. But you know, I posed a question to Chris because I know he also manages a diversified portfolio. Chris, where are you looking at what type of sort of diversification are you looking at in order to sort of hide out over the next couple of quarters? Well, Aaron, you know, I've got the benefit of being able to go into private security. So I've got a good size real estate portfolio. We have a large private equity portfolio. Sure, it's going to have write downs, but its value is a bit more stable than we see in the public markets. We have a cash position, but the problem is for us cash is not outperforming inflation. So the old adage cash is trash is still true. We do like a private credit. You were kind of hitting on that that, you know, variable rate debt, short term debt with drawing delta, angry condo and right diagram. So you do like a few Stamp Out $합 rich thermal water tax? So staring out the funds. So now I'm hinting to all indagents",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,952,2022-10-08 21:20:05
12727," That edge cash is trash is still true. We do like a private credit. You were kind of hitting on that, that variable rate, that short term debt with high quality. And I think collateral is going to be key. Because as you said, we're going to have a long, rough winter. So you don't want to be loaning money to everybody after you do care about governance. But it is tough in this environment. I mean, if the economy is slowing and inflation is still strong, that's stagnation. And you look back in the 70s. I got to say, I love that suit that Lou had. I don't know where you get that back in the 70s. But I'm stunned by it. But you know, you look back in that time period. Returns in the 77 were terrible. There were hard places to it. It was just a very tough time to hide anywhere. Yeah, so I'm curious though, exactly about when you go into fixed income. Do you think the price is attractive now in some fixed income? Chris? Well, I agree with Aaron. I'm going to go short. I'm not going to go long fixed income and take duration exposure. Short-term credits. I mean, you've been holding credit for two to three years. And then it's money good. And as she said, you're going to put it in a spread product. So you pick up a couple of basis points by being in a corporate. You're OK. There's still a lot of money, David, international money that wants to come into this market, non-US rather, that wants to come into the market. You saw it in this week where suddenly comes rushing in. So I would give the advice to the average investors. You've got a slowly average cost in. You're not going to be able to call the bottom. As much as Aaron, I think there's a support number, it may not hit that at all. And the market's going to just bounce along. And in Aaron's example of an L, an L goes on forever. It's just flat. I hope we don't have to live in a flat recession for years and years. But I think this is going to be a tough market to find any kind of growth opportunities. So you want to protection and return of your money rather than return on your money. Aaron, one of the big developments this week was OPEC Plus and what they did. It certainly seemed to stun the white hats at the time. What does that tell us about geopolitical risk generally and specifically energy? It looks like oil prices are going to stay up there for a while. I think that's one of the things that the market's really mispricing. Right now, if you look at the forward curve for oil, the risk is really in this very short term where the market expects that oil is going to be elevated for the short term. But it really has an extrapolated or extended that expectation out the next one to two years. And I think that there's a real value in sort of the back end of the curve for oil. Because I think that these oil challenges are going to persist much longer than what the market's anticipating. One of the reasons for that is, first, we saw out of oil OPEC Plus this week, their intention to keep prices elevated. But I think the other challenges is that we really haven't invested here in the US or on a global basis on energy infrastructure. So that capacity is really constrained over the next couple of years. Even if we wanted to expand capacity or oil producers wanted to expand capacity, they don't have the ability to do so in the immediate term. And that's going to keep oil prices elevated. So the risk for oil, then the risk for the energy complex broadly isn't just this winter, but it's next winter as well. And next winter's challenges are going to be even more difficult, particularly on the shores of Europe, than what we're experiencing this winter. And so that's what I think the challenge is. And why I think this is something that's going to persist much longer than what the market's currently priced in. And David, it's running into the challenge of climate change. I'm looking at decades, not a short-term trade in carbon. And I'm glad that we're having a constraint on the ability to expand hydrocarbons and burning carbon. But you're right. People want heat. And Europe heats itself. Whether we like it or not, it doesn't heat itself with solar and wind. It's got to do it through fossil fuels. And that's matching and running into it as I were to reduce these fossil fuels. And I agree with Aaron. I'm hearing the same thing that Europe has enough oil and natural gas for this year in their supplies. But if it's a really cold winter, they're very worried about next year. So you're going to have climate change crashing into this challenge of OPEC and inflation and energy prices.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,953,2022-10-08 21:24:18
12728," very worried about next year. So you're going to have climate change crashing into this challenge of OPEC and inflation and energy prices, certainly over the next couple of years. Europe has a lot of challenges there right now. Not just energy, it goes beyond that. Does that make the U.S. relative the most attractive place to be for you? I don't know if it's the most attractive place, but it's one of the more attractive places, particularly the V-Cov-E Europe. And the challenge that Europe has is that they're, you know, starting from a lower productivity, you know, a lower and weaker growth rate to start out. They also didn't, you know, sort of fully recover in the same way that the U.S. did post-COVID. And they're now have wider fiscal deficits. They're going to have to spend more money in order to insulate their economy from a harder hit because of energy. And that's going to create real challenges at the same time where the economy is rapidly slowing. And so our view is that while the U.S. is going into recession, the recession in Europe is going to hit harder and is likely to be more prolonged. Thank you so much to Aaron Brown and Chris Haleman. When we come back, we're going to take a look at what's happening next week on global Wall Street. And this is Bloomberg. You will shed light on dark matter. You will make aging optional. You will turn 5G up to 11. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge, and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer, disrupt. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. This is Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. It's time to take a look ahead at next week on global Wall Street. China stocks reopening is the big story in Asia this week. Exchanges on the mainland, they've been shut for the past five straight sessions that's to mark the golden week holiday. So we could see a pop at the open given the moves that we saw in Chinese assets in offshore markets. And that would be of course welcome news for officials in Beijing because President Xi Jinping is just days away from securing a third term as Communist Party leader. That's at the 20th party Congress starting October 16th. Otherwise travel restrictions or the easing of those is the major theme as well. Japan will further loosen controls from Tuesday and Taiwan from Thursday. For Europe next week, there's a big risk lingering in the markets and that's the end of the VLV short-term program to backstop bond markets. They of course announced that they would be purchasing long-dated bonds after concerns that a huge spike up in yields in the long end of the curve meant that there would be danger for pension funds. So the B.O.E. has been doing this buying program. It's set to end on Friday, on October 14th. There could be jitters in this market. What it means to no longer have a B.O.E. backstopping a political story really of the UK government, which has been doing various U-turns. So all of that will be in focus this week. All eyes next week will be on the latest batches of U.S.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,954,2022-10-08 21:28:27

Produced surprises will be released on Wednesday with the headline figure projected to have fallen year over year for a third straight month. Meanwhile, the consumer price index release on Thursday is once again expected to show conflicting signals with a deceleration in the headline number from a year ago, but the core measure of CPI, which strips out food and energy, is forecast to re-accelerate its pace of growth rather than fall. Investors also will parse the release of the minutes from the Fed September meeting, and whether there was any serious discussion about slowing or even halting the tightening of monetary policy. And earning season is finally here. The latest round of quarterly reports kick-off with Pepsi, JP Morgan, City Group, Morgan Stanley, Delta Airlines, and United Health among the Notables. David? Coming up, we'll wrap up the week with our special contributor Larry Summersville Harvard. Let's go to the next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. This is a market that over the past few weeks has made it clear, it wants to go higher. It got a little spooked by the idea that geopel little potential rises. Back in 1997, I was interested in the following question, which is there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called sauropod dinosaurs, which had really long skinny necks. So apodosaurus is an example. Now, it's at really long skinny tails. So I made a computer model that showed that, in fact, the tail of these sauropod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip, a bullfip. Now, the way a bullfip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. And that crack is a sonic boom. I think the way they got to date was to impress the females by making loud booms. The innovation, money and power collide in Silicon Valley and beyond. Bloomberg technology with Emily Chang. Weak days at 5 p.m. in New York and 2 p.m. in San Francisco. This is Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. Every week we turn to Larry Summers of Harvard, our very special contributor here on Wall Street Week to help us sum up the major events of the week. And once again, we welcome back Larry Summers. So Larry, I think we should start with the jobs numbers out on Friday in the United States. I mean, some say not too hot, not too cold. Some people say, isn't this good? At least it's not getting worse. I guess my real question to you is, I may not be getting worse, but there are danger just in the inflation remaining where it is. We have 5% year over year increase in wages. I think these numbers were about what we expected. And the sensible judgment was that we've got an inflation problem. Core inflation figures look artificially good. They're better than me.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,955,2022-10-08 21:32:50
12730," Did the sensible judgment was that we've got an inflation problem. Core inflation figures look artificially good. They're better than median inflation. And yet core inflation ran at a 7% rate last month. And that was more than for the quarter. And the quarter was more than for the half year. And the half year was more than for the whole year. So we're not in a controlled place with respect to inflation. And there wasn't really anything in this report to suggest that we were coming into a controlled place. The monthly wage number was relatively favorable. But it was pretty clearly distorted by the fact that you had a lot more workers coming in in leisure and hospitality. And those are low wage workers. Workers where wages are most flexible are going up more rapidly. So I don't think this is a number that changed the picture that we've got an economy that is too strong to be an economy where inflation is going down. But that is maintaining its robustness. But I think we are headed for a collision of some kind or other. And we've just got to manage that collision carefully. And I think the sooner we start managing for a slow, managing for some slow down, the better we're going to do. I think Chairman Powell was way late to come to that recognition. But he now has that recognition. And he should be supported in that. So what do you think, Chair Powell, and the Federal Reserve will make of these numbers? How will it affect what they do in early November? I don't think these numbers are going to change what the Fed does. You never know what's going to happen. And certainly there's risk of some kind of financially traumatic event. But I think the chances of something that is large enough to divert the Fed are really quite low. So I'd be expecting that the market, which is anticipating 75 basis points in November and is anticipating 50 more in December, that would correspond to my best guess at this moment as well. And I think that kind of thing is going to be appropriate if we achieve disinflation. Larry, there's another strain of discussion. I've seen certainly this week. In fact, there was even some Fed staff work at the New York Fed suggesting that we better be careful. Because in fact, the rate that we may need and already get down to 2%, maybe so high, it will cause financial instability. There is a really safety and soundness issue. What do you make of that? Is it possible the Fed will have to choose between financial stability in the one hand and getting inflation down on the other? First, I think that should be the occasion for some sole searching. If we have an economy where we think there's going to be substantial financial breakage because the Fed lifts the Fed funds rate to 4.5%. Then we have an inadequately supervised financial system and an insufficiently active financial regulator. And so if anyone believes that, along with whatever monetary policy implication they draw, they better tell us how we think, how they think we ought to be repairing the regulation of the financial system. David, my sense is that you can never rule out these kinds of risks. But the Fed has more than one instrument. It has instruments for specific guarantee lending. We've seen that used a number of times. And each time we're surprised by how much the economy retains its robustness. In retrospect, we cut interest rates too much and kept them too low when we were supporting the financial system after COVID. In retrospect, we kept interest rates too low and blew up a bubble when we were supporting the economy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,956,2022-10-08 21:37:02
12731," system after COVID. In retrospect, we kept interest rates too low and blew up a bubble when we were supporting the economy with low interest rates after Asia and LTCM. In retrospect, we were surprised, amazed by how rapidly the economy grew when the Fed was necessary after the 1987 stock market crash. So we need to regulate right to preserve financial stability. We need to have a very strong firefighting force in order to respond if and when financial accidents happen. But I think it's a real mistake to suggest that somehow we shouldn't do the monetary policies that are necessary to avoid inflation becoming entrenched because of concerns about financial stability. You know David, the people who are still on team transitory, they're always saying that expectations aren't entrenched. The more it's true that expectations are not yet entrenched, despite high inflation, it seems to me that more important it is to move vigorously now with respect to inflation so they don't become entrenched. If they were already entrenched, we could discuss the right timing of a disinflation. But if we have the big advantage in disinflation of expectations that are not yet entrenched, surely we should be acting on inflation while we have that advantage. Larry, another big development this week was the OPEC plus decision to reduce production limits by 2 million barrels a day. Something that I think it's fair to say was set the Biden administration back a bit. He'd gone over there and asked the Crown Prince not to do that. It wasn't very pretty. So apart from perhaps any embarrassment on my cause, does it have larger macroeconomic effects for a globe that we are warned by WTO? No, maybe headed toward a global recession. There's nothing good in this. Certainly it's not what we wanted to see. Actually it's a lot less than 2 million barrels because many of the countries that reduced their quota weren't hitting their quota before, so the reduction in the ceiling didn't really matter. You didn't see a hugely dramatic move in oil markets in a way that was proportionate to the headlines that you saw. But certainly the risks are up and it just points up the importance. And we always do a scramble about the immediate when these things happen. And we don't forget about the medium term. Look, we made a mistake by canceling the Keystone pipeline. We made a mistake by slowing down all kinds of permitting activity. We made a mistake by being hostile as a country to natural gas. We made a mistake in the Congress a few weeks ago when we didn't pass the mansion program of expanding permitting. We crucially need regulatory relief where we're not going to get renewables online fast and we're not going to get the transmission lines that are necessary for renewables to become a large part of our energy fast. So the real lesson on this is we need a different kind of energy strategy than the one that we've had. We need a strategy that is balanced rather than an unbalanced strategy of total hostility to fossil fuels. Or God knows the kind of total strategy of favoring fossil fuels that we had. And even egregious favoritism towards Saudi Arabia that we saw during the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,957,2022-10-08 21:41:14
12732," of favoring fossil fuels that we had and even egregious favoritism towards Saudi Arabia that we saw during the Trump administration. We need to find a balance and I think we're making our way in that direction. Larry, it's always so helpful to have you on each week and I would like to say, Larry summons me to stay in with us as we bring in Professor Brad DeLong, Professor of Economics from UC Berkeley on his new book, Slouching Toward Utopia. That's an economic history of the 20th century. That's coming up next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. Big, expensive cities have a lot going for them. But if you live in one, you probably noticed that these big, expensive cities keep getting more, well, expensive. You could always move away. You might have just started working remotely, so there's really nothing keeping you there. But then again, moving is a hassle. Well, what if someone paid you 10 grand to do it? What if they threw in free office space, a bicycle, or a gym membership? Programs and cities and states around the US are doing exactly that and they're getting a lot of interest. We've had over 50,000 applications. About 90,000 applications. We've had over 1800 applicants from all over North America. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them? Or are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns for places looking for an injection of fresh talent? Welcome to the world of decentralized finance, Bloomberg's covering all things crypto, the people, the transactions, and the technology, Bloomberg crypto Tuesdays. This is Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. Our very special contributor Larry Summers of Harvard has stayed with us because we're going to bring in now Professor of Economics from UC Berkeley. He's Brad DeLong, the author of a new book, Slouching Toward Utopia, an economic history of the 20th century. So, Professor, welcome for joining us. It's really good to have you here. I've read this fascinating and really sort of protein in book. It's really quite a book. Let's set it up first because it's a history of the 20th century. But you don't necessarily define the 20th century as from 1900 to 2000. You started in 1870 and you end up in 2010. Why? Well, the big thing that happens happens in 1870. Before 1870, the world's poor and there's no prospect for the world being anything other than poor. After 1870, every single generation, humanity's technical competence doubles and then doubles again in the following generation. And such an enormous pace of technological advance raises the possibility for the first time of a world in which we can bake a sufficiently large economic pie for everyone to have enough. And that was nothing that humanity had ever seen before. One of the remarkable things, Brad, that you highlight is that it really wasn't very different to live in the United Kingdom in the 19th century than it had been to live in the ancient world 2000 years before. Say something about the acceleration of growth that you see is happening in the 20th century. Well, you know, I mean, it was British economist John Stuart Mill, right? He was writing in 1871 about how all the end of the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,958,2022-10-08 21:45:37
12733," You know, I mean, it was British economist John Stuart Mill, right? He was writing in 1871 about how all the industrial revolution had done was it had created a somewhat larger middle class and it had allowed manufacturers and the rich to earn greater fortunes, but that the overwhelming mass of humanity was still confined to the same life of drudgery and imprisonment. Then they had been before that they had been in before and before all the way back into deep time. It was very clear by 1900 that things had changed. You know, John Maynard Keynes writing in 1919 looks back and says starting in 1870 we entered economic Eldorado and that now our chief task after World War I was figuring out why we tried to blow it up and try to get desperately back to what was good was going on after 1870. Fortunately, we eventually did and so things rolled through up until our day. First of all, it gives us a sense of what happened in 1870 that brought all this about. There were some three driving forces in your book. Well, you know, everyone has an idea about just what it is that's made us as a civilization so wealthy that makes our economy so productive. And the different people have different things and they all go back some of them back even to say the year 1070 when it turns out that the law applies to a German emperor standing in the snow outside of the castle that allows and his tool. But instead it could be that the law relies to everybody, but you get three things that fall into place in 1870 that set technological progress into a much higher gear than ever before. And they are the industrial research lab so that you can rationalize and routinize the discovery and development of technology. And then the corporation as we know it, which rationalizes the development and deployment of technology, you know, to combine that with the globalized economy, with the telegraph and the I railroad and the iron hold ocean going steamship. And all of a sudden the incentives to deploy technology worldwide for production are so overwhelming and people turn their minds to how to do this that everything explodes in a way it never had before. Brad, much of the academic discussion of your book has centered on this idea of a pivot point in 1870. But I want to ask about a different judgment you make, which is that there was this major era and that the major era ended in 2010. I would have thought that the world was growing, it was becoming more integrated with technology. There were important political struggles. That was the stuff of history through the 20th century, much better in the second half of the century than in the first half of the century. The Cold War was a very different war than World War 1 or World War 2. But I would have thought that was a continuing process with substantial challenges. And yet you see us as now being in a quite different era. What's different about the era we're in than the era you wrote the history of other than more of the kind of progress and change that you saw as happening every generation? Well, I'm pleased you disagree here and I'm very pleased you disagree on our story. I had optimist here about our future. Because look, I've been losing arguments in person with you for 42 years, even when I think I'm right afterwards. And here I'm genuinely uncertain and I actually very much hope you are really right this time. My thinking was I've been listening to our friend John Furnald about how the underlying pace of technological progress has more or less halved since 2005 compared to what we were used to beforehand. Save in those years from 1975 to 1990 when technology was crawling toward a more energy efficient and invite.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,959,2022-10-08 21:49:54
12734," two beforehand, saving those years from 1975 to 1990 when technology was crawling toward a more energy efficient and environmentally friendly configuration rather than focusing on labor saving. But after 2000, after 2000, we seem to have a substantial loss of social and economic knowledge about how to run things. Things about financial regulation that I thought were entrenched, that were known in the bones turned out to have been completely forgotten in 2008. Things about the proper tools for macroeconomic policy that I thought were ingrained in the bone were also forgotten after 2010. And I remember UNI whimpering in 2012 that know for the more expansionary fiscal policy was not then a thing that ran any risks whatsoever. Combine that with the fact that from 1870 on to 2010, you know, first you had Britain in the United States and then the United States as the countries that people were looking to for examples as you always Leon Trotsky liked to say as the furnace where the future is being forged. You know, but now you go to China, you go to India, we even go to Indonesia and what you find is that people say that the United States has very little to teach them, that we don't have any greater grasp on how to deploy and use these technologies to create a good society and are in fact a society or a society that is more trouble. We're in more trouble than theirs are. Brad, if that is right, how much of it because of a running out of ideas and how much of it is running out of cohesion? One of the themes in your book is the sort of polls if I can put it that way between Hayek on the one hand, the market is king and Polonium and the others, the market has to serve people. How much of the problems we're in right now are because we're lacking cohesion because of the dispersion in wealth and income? I think we're definitely lacking cohesion. I think dispersion in wealth and income creates work of cohesion. I am struck by comparing the United States around 1900 with the United States today, that around in 1900 politics was as fierce and mean as it is today. You know, that is theodore Roosevelt denouncing William Jennings Bryan as the puppet of a alien European socialist, John Peter Altgill, the governor of Illinois, who had not only been born in Europe but also had dared to pardon anarchists. But there seems to be a very different flavor that is, I think it's Ezra Klein talks about it, that somehow that our media and our communications today focuses first on establishing, you know, who are your enemies? Do you share any enemies with me? And if you share enemies with me, I will listen to. So as I say, it's a remarkable book. It's slouching toward Utopia and economic history of the 20th century. Thank you so much for bringing it with us. We only really touch upon it today. I urge everybody to read it is really worth the effort. Thank you so much. That's Professor Brad DeLon of UC Berkeley.

12735," And then there are those bold pronouncements that have yet to be proven out one way or the other. Like President Xi's insistence that his zero COVID policy is the right one for his country. If you just look at the COVID-0 protocols, it requires all people returning from abroad to have 10 days of quarantine. Or President Putin insisting that he will ultimately still prevail in Ukraine. If he thinks he's losing and may lose his office and even life, then he could become completely unpredictable. But this week, this week we saw something a bit different. Big bold pronouncements being completely reversed not long after they were made. A big one was, of course, Elon Musk's change of mind again on whether he'd pony up 44 billion dollars for Twitter. We're now hearing that Elon Musk and Twitter, of course, that resolution really said to be sticking on the contingency of getting that debt financing. And that is going to be the key clause that we're focused on going forward. But at least, Mr. Musk took a few months for his change of heart. Over in Great Britain, we saw a new government lay out a new budget that included big tax cuts, starting with the top tax bracket. We love the tax cutting, but not at this time. This is just absolutely the wrong time to do this. Bringing immediate and violent reaction in the markets. She's trying to get the markets behind those two latter factors, probably significantly more difficult. And the Bank of England stepping in for the rescue. So suddenly, the Bank of England finds itself in the ECB situation. So, Prime Minister Truss' newly minted Chancellor of the Exchequer had to admit publicly that they had been wrong, clearly and dramatically wrong, at least on those top tax rates. And it came only days after he and Prime Minister Truss had gone so big and so bold. I think it was a distraction. And I think it was the wrong thing to do. One can hardly fault a government for listening to its people, even if the listening might have come better before the deciding. But whatever the right answer, the one thing for certain is that at least in this respect, Mr. Truss is no Margaret Thatcher. To those waiting with baited breaths for that favorite media catchphrase, the U-turn, I have only one thing to say. U-turn if you want to. The ladies not for turning. That does it for this episode of Wall Street Week. I'm David West and this is Bloomberg. See you next week. Every Friday with 30 minutes dedicated to fixed income, I'm Jonathan Farrow.

For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s and so it makes that a really exciting field because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day.

12736," to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harness to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts. But if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what you bring figures out while you're sleeping. When the COVID pandemic brought global travel to a standstill in 2020, the impact on the hotel industry was devastating. There was like nothing you could have imagined. It was a shock, it was a kick in the butt. There's very little that didn't change during the pandemic for the global chance. It's comparable to maybe five consecutive 9-elevens, what it did to demand. Maria, the world's largest hotel chain, so revenues plummet by 50% in 2020. Another blow came in early 2021 when CEO Arnie Sorenson lost his battle with pancreatic cancer. Long time Maria and executive Tony Capuano succeeded Sorenson, and despite the setbacks, he's optimistic about the future. Part of my confidence in the ability to lead the company through this crisis is I have the benefit of what I've called a long 10-year benefit. A long 10-year battle-tested team. A key member of this team is CFO Linioburg. She really is unflappable in terms of the way in which she handles business challenges. I think she goes well beyond maybe the quote traditional CFO role. She's involved in every aspect of the business. The openings in Q4, we're still right on target. We've even had a couple in Europe at NET. Not only is she obviously a wonderful steward of the company's balance sheet, but I rely on her heavily as any leader would as we try to look around the corner. Part of our job is to make sure what do customers want, what are they thinking that they want next year and the next year, and that takes investment, and that takes thinking ahead of time of where you want to get. You could call Linioburg, Merriott's chief future officer. I always love finance. I did figure out that once I'd worked at a financial services firm, that it was a great experience for a few years, but that I ultimately wanted to do it. I wanted to join a team for a more long term way to try to build a business. Overjoying Merriott as part of its investor relations group in 1999. As is often the case for many people, things evolve. The company grows, opportunities show up, and I really was able to build a set of skills and experiences that help prepare me for the CFO role, not only in corporate-level roles, but also operational and international. She's been chief financial officer since 2016, the year Maria acquired Starb with Hotels and Resorts and became the largest hotel chain in the world. Although that scale remains an advantage, all the industry's major players are finding it crucial to innovate in the wake of an unprecedented disruption. That was the wake of call for, you know, rethinking some of the operations and to try to figure out smarter ways to operate. The large hotel chains are very much still in the mode of figuring out what the consumer is going to look like, what guest demands are, what preferences have changed. How does Merriott need to reinvent itself in these very uncertain times? I think a lot of the initiatives that were in place, even before the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,962,2022-10-08 22:05:31
12737," and did self in these very uncertain times. I think a lot of the initiatives that were in place, a lot of the strategy that was in place, even before the pandemic began to unfold, will continue to serve us well. Continued global growth. More than 60% of our pipeline is outside the United States today. I think that will continue to increase as a percentage. When you think about market share for the company, inside the US, we have about a 16% share of the hotel rooms. While outside the US, we have 3%. But no doubt, I would expect that we will see greater growth rates of our rooms outside the US than inside the US. Does that mean that you'll be putting more investments overseas as well? Well, investments is an interesting word. But the capital structure of deals varies a lot by market. So for example, in some markets in Asia Pacific, there's far less use of debt. While in the US, there is much more use of debt to construct a hotel. So the investment needs are often different for an owner outside the US than inside the US. Notice that she refers to owners. That's because Merriott owns a very small percentage of properties that carry its name. The majority are owned and operated by franchisees, while the company operates others under long-term management agreements. This asset-like business model presents a CFO with a unique set of opportunities and challenges. Because we don't own all of our hotels. We have far less debt. We would never have been able to grow as fast as we've grown and become more attractive to our customers without having the capital from all these hundreds of owners providing capital. The challenges of the model are you're managing a lot of different constituencies. You have to really consider the owner's needs and what's going on in the financing markets. I'd say the biggest challenge is around prioritization, about really picking your spots, going after them, going after them quickly with your investment dollars, and then adapting as times change. And in a time of rapid change, Marion has made it a priority to invest in technology. We've worked really hard to improve productivity and to be able to come up with innovation that both is attractive to the customer, but also helpful to the owners. The fact that you can now go and have your mobile key and not have to stop by the front desk and that you can communicate about how you want your pillows, et cetera, all on your smartphone. That's both great for the customer. That's also great for the hotel. It allows them to plan better, allows them to run it more efficiently. There have been wonderful innovations. We're not done. We got plenty more to go. I think the key is to really enhance technology, but to realize the technology doesn't replace the face-to-face interaction. I have to make sure we do things right. After all, it's my name over the door. We are a people first business, but how do we utilize technology to enhance the services we can deliver and make those services more efficient? With the cost of wages going up and the cost of doing business, increasing every year, we have to figure out how to do more with what we have and how to utilize technology to become better at our craft. Coming up, Linny Oberg shows me how classic hospitality meets cutting-edge technology at one of Marriott's iconic hotels. On the digital platform, you can do so much in terms of communicating with your customers. And guess what? It's also economically really efficient to be doing it that way. It's all about engagement. This is Bloomberg. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. We have to get interest rates higher and bring inflation back to our targets. It's better to have the fastest becoming scarce.

12738," Unflame with unmatched reach and resources. From more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. Founded in 1927 as a root beer stand in Washington, DC, Merriott has grown from a tiny family business into the world's largest provider of hotel rooms. As it's added, millions of new customers, it's also expanded its customer loyalty programs. We were the first in the industry to have a loyalty program, so we understand the value and the importance of it. But in 2020, the public health crisis that ravaged global travel also threatened the consumer engagement these programs had built. Some of our most loyal customers didn't stay in a hotel for a year, but through our branded credit card programs, through the partnership with Uber that we rolled out, we found other mechanisms to keep connected with our customers, even in a period where they were grounded, not traveling at all. The partnership with Uber allowed Merriott Bonvoy members to earn points through vines and food orders. The credit card partnerships not only kept Merriott connected with customers, they connected the company with funds at a critical moment. What Merriott as well as Hilton did, they were in a position to generate cash by pre-selling points to their credit card partners. That shows just how much the credit cards value the relationship. And if you're willing to make a $1 billion cash advance to a hotel company, that was stock price had dropped by 85%. Means you really value the relationship and you trust the partner. You truly trust the partner. They'll make millions and millions of dollars from the branding of their credit cards. And then additionally with that, the consumers get the points on that. What we're seeing quite a bit this year is a lot of redemption of those points now that the world is opening up again. We've enabled our customers to have more choices in how to redeem those points. They can redeem them within our hotels. They can redeem them outside of our hotels with the partnerships that we have through experiences, etc. But I think it really helps our customers stay within the ecosystem of Merriott. I got a view of that ecosystem from Lini Oberg when she showed me around the Merriott Marquee in Times Square. Originally opened in 1985, the hotel was recently given a $135 million renovation. We started in the newly remodeled M Club Lounge, a premier amenity for Bon Voy members. Making our loyalty members now 157 million strong, making them feel welcome, special and appreciated for their frequent travel with us really matters. It feels like you're trying to own the full experience of travel, whether it's through your co-branded cards or your travel insurance. Why is it important to bring your guests into this ecosystem? It's all about engagement. One of the most important things is looking around the corner. What are the trends that you're seeing in customers? Particularly in the digital commerce space. It before, obviously, so many of our reservations were made by the telephone. We now see that well over a third of our reservations are made on our app. And on the digital platform, you can do so much in terms of communicating with your customers. And guess what? It's also economically really efficient to be doing it that way. The digital future is already in place for Merriott guests, transforming everything from the checking process to the traditional room key. But even as technology creates efficiencies, there are areas of rising cost on the horizon. After making deep staff cuts in 2020, Merriott needs to rebuild its workforce. For sure, the most painful part of this entire pandemic was about the furloughs and the layoffs that we had to do. It was necessary to survive, to make sure we got through to the other side. Now the company not only faces competition for workers in an economy reshaped by the pandemic, it's trying to do this while wages in the industry are rising and when customer and employees",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,964,2022-10-08 22:14:14
12739," Only faces competition for workers in an economy reshaped by the pandemic. It's trying to do this while wages in the industry are rising and when customer and employee expectations are in a state of flux. One of the real things that sets a hotel apart from a home sharing platform like Airbnb is the services that they offer to guests. So there's an incredible tension as they work through, you know, what those guest expectations are, what their strategic place in the market is, and what their, you know, labor cost needs actually are. So I do think they need to leverage technology to reduce the number of unskilled jobs in hotel operation. But they really need to provide jobs that require high level of skills so that they can reallocate part of their payroll to fewer workers and pay them better. We have been able to hire 40,000 people since the beginning of the year in 2021. And where you see it is in certain really hot markets. It's where you can see the shortages, but generally overall it is improving. Technology may help Marriott need this challenge as well. The company is rolling out a new labor management system that will more precisely match staffing to customer demand. This labor management system allows a hotel to much more assigned labor just in time. So you're able to say, I see what's coming over the next couple days. I can work the shifts in a way that frankly gives the associates more flexibility, but also makes the staffing levels more appropriate. It used to be prior that it would be more of, okay, I'm going to plan for all of next month. Done, your work shift, you know what it is. Now there's more flexibility and more adaptability to what's happening in the business of a hotel. Flexibility and agility will be critical assets for Marri and in the foreseeable future. But leisure travel driving the demand recovery and the forecast for business travel still uncertain. Hotel companies are hoping to attract a hybrid customer, adapting their spaces and services to a category known as Pleasure. You're going to be reminding people to say, hey, you know, take your family for the weekend, but maybe stay an extra night. And we have the business center and we have the guaranteed Wi-Fi and reception that can ensure that you can get business done from perhaps the pool or the beach on a come Monday morning. Where I'm a business traveler, where I likely will choose mobile check-in, mobile key, come up the elevator straight to my room. Then I may go on a family vacation. I want to talk to the front desk clerk and find out about a restaurant that no tourists are aware of. So now when you look around this hotel and you look before it would be really easy to tell exactly who was on a business trip and who was here, you know, seeing the city for leisure. Now much more of a blend. People staying longer over a weekend. That means we need to have space that works for everyone, no matter what the purpose. For hotels, conventions, big events, drawing big revenue, right? What do you do after the pandemic when perhaps we won't have as many conventions and events as in the past? Well, I think first of all, we ultimately will. That business is coming back. I think one of the interesting things we're seeing in the group business is that people are not canceling farther out. They're canceling really close in where there's still some discomfort in traveling, but where there is bookings that they feel comfortable doing in the next few months, those bookings are ramping up. So we've seen group get better and better and better with each quarter of this year. And we're actually really excited about what we see in 2022. Lini Oberg's job always keeps her on her toes and when she's not on the job, her favorite pursuits are active as well. I love to run. I've been part of a women's running group for 23 years and we still run together three times a week. How does that help you in the day-to-day job and the grind that it is to be a CFO of such a big corporation? It's always been for me a way to clean my head. A lot of people say they run with music. I generally don't run with anything. I really like...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,965,2022-10-08 22:18:36
12740," You know, it's always been for me a way to clean my head. You know, a lot of people say they run with music. I generally don't run with anything. I really like the time to think, reflect. You've always heard the saying that people get their best ideas when they're out for a run. There's no doubt there's something to that. Up next, Lini Oberg believes that chief future officer must be a good listener to be a good leader. I actually find that the listening is where some of the best decisions get made. And she says some of the best ideas come from a business culture of diversity. Over 60% of my global finance team or women, over a third are people of color. It makes us a better company, not only from ideas but from performance. This is Bloomberg. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. Let's just be honest. We've had sort of a shift in, are we in some sort of circulation fears? Moment, people were talking about that all day yesterday. We were talking about that all day. We were talking about that all day. We were talking about that all day. We will never know, now we will never know. Marriott's investments in the future extend well beyond the doors of its hotels. In February 2021, the Marriott Foundation announced a $20 million endowment to launch the Marriott Sorenson Center for Hospitality Leadership and Howard University. The partnership with a historically black institution aims not just to bring more diversity to the industry, but to give students the tools to rise to the top. So when we first spoke about this, it was about building a true partnership, really trying to solve for this year. And that is the lack of underrepresented minorities, especially at the upper echelon of these industries. And that is problematic. And what this is is to provide a solution. I think the positioning of that center is really unique in being one of the first to say publicly, we will not develop entry-level workers. We're going to develop people that you will need to take seriously. When you look at the travelers around the globe, it's a very diverse group of travelers, and promoting diversity promotes new thought, new ideas. It makes organizations stronger, it makes organizations better. It requires deliberate focus to drive the sort of diverse workforce that we want. If you look at our C-suite, more than 50% of my direct reports are diverse. If you look at our board, more than 50% of our board composition is diverse. On the diversity inclusion side, you know, I'm particularly proud in finance. We have over 60% of our staff.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,966,2022-10-08 22:22:58
12741," More than 50% of our board composition is diverse. On the diversity inclusion side, you know, I'm particularly proud in finance. We have over 60% of my global finance team or women. Over a third are people of color. It makes us a better company, not only from ideas, but from performance. The number of women chief financial officers has been steadily rising over the last decade and a half. A study of nearly 700 companies shows their representation doubling since 2004. Lineo Bergen tends to keep the trend towards diversity going as a mentor in all areas of business. One of my overall beliefs is really important for leaders to be approachable. And so the more that I can talk to anyone in my shop or frankly even out of my discipline about what they're doing and how they're thinking about it, hopefully it's helpful for both them and for the company. Unflappable, responsible and approachable. Lineo work has the expertise and the people skills to steer merit into the future. I asked her what she sees when she looks ahead. What's the opportunity for merit in the next 10 years and most excites you? We are all about being the world's favorite travel company. And there are so many more places for us to grow and so many more ways for us to connect with our consumers. I do think our size and scale gives us a unique opportunity. And when I think about those opportunities, we got to get at them. We got to make sure that we go and take advantage of them. And so a lot of this is about the translation of business strategy and financial resources and putting them together in a way that provides value to all of our constituencies. What's the challenge for marrying in the next 10 years that keeps you up at night? Pace of change. Pace of change. All of us have seen that technology has meant that the pace of change has only accelerated. When I think about when we would start a brand initiative 20 years ago versus when you start it now and how quickly it takes to get it done and rolled out. And what customers expect? They expect things really quickly. All of us, you know, you go on your smartphone, you're like, well why didn't I get that answer right away? And I think that is one of our biggest challenges is trying to keep up with the pace of change. How do you see your role as the F.O. changing in the next 10 years? Of course, you've got the standard parts of the CFO role in reporting accurately and with great transparency of our results and our state of health, critically important. But just as important is really helping the company find ways to accelerate growth. For me, it is very much about how to enable the growth that we want to achieve. What's a skill set or area of expertise that the CFO will need to develop in the next 10 years? Deep understanding of technology and where technology is going. I think it's number one. I think communication skills, the need for good communication skills is only going to continue to increase. You know, the old days you had the classic view of the CFO with the green eye shades kind of sitting and making sure the numbers all got tallied appropriately. I think it's much broader now and it really is about making sure that all the constituencies understand the strategy and the value that you're trying to deliver. What's the best advice that you'd give to somebody who got promoted to the CFO level today? Love what you do. It's really important that you love what you do. And then the other one is about listening. You know, as a leader, there's this expectation that perhaps you're going to come out with what everybody should go do and the edict of this is the way we go. I actually find that the listening is where some of the best decisions get made. By listening to team members so that you can say, I want to take part of that point of view and that point of view to get to the best decision and strategy for the company.

We don't have enough women founder CEOs who are getting funding. So basically less than 2% of VC funds go to women, less than 1% go to women of color. And so in this innovation space, I said to myself, what's the best way to use capital to move things for women? And that's when I started to say, okay, I actually need to move some money into the venture capital space and I want to do it smartly. I mean, the first goal is to make money. I'm not putting my money out as a social impact. I'm putting it out to make money. But I wanted to go behind funds like aspect ventures that's run by Theresa Gaugh and Jennifer Fonsdatt who are looking at these opportunities and they have a thesis around my gosh.

Much higher. Higher than furniture. Of course, yes. If Jakkoid has his way, other raw materials will follow. Cold, box-ite, tin, gold and copper, even palm oil. This November, Indonesia will host the G20. Jakkoi is one of the few leaders to have met both China's Eugene Ping and Russia's Vladimir Putin since the invasion of Ukraine. This is a conversation with President Jakkoi of Indonesia. Thank you for talking to Bloomberg again. When I was last year in 2019, you had just been reelected. Now you're halfway through your final term as President of Indonesia. You are the biggest country in Southeast Asia. You are right in the middle of the United States and China and their arguments. You recently said the world was in dire need of responsibility and wisdom. I suppose my first question for you was Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan? Was it wise? Was it even responsible? The rivalry of the big countries is indeed worrying. What we want is for this region to be stable, peaceful, so that we can build economic growth. But I think not only Indonesia, Asian countries also want the same thing. I think you are being very diplomatic, President. There was word that Nancy Pelosi was going to come to Indonesia and then you decided to change that plan. Is that true? No, no. We will openly receive, but there was no visit. It now seems to be a more serious danger of a Chinese invasion in Taiwan. There is a concern that if there is a conflict in Taiwan, it would spill over into the South China Sea, where you have territory, territory that China can test. Is Indonesia ready to defend itself or defend its land and waters in that case? So you are ready for that conflict militarily if it happens? We do want the region to be peaceful. It shouldn't come to the point that tensions rise until it affects economic growth and then later on affects the well-being of our people. In my opinion, it is very important that there is a space for dialogue between leaders, especially leaders of big countries. The global situation is extremely difficult.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,969,2022-10-08 22:35:49
12744," Aced for dialogue between leaders, especially leaders of big countries. The global situation is extremely difficult, and there shouldn't be further unnecessary issues. We are going through a food crisis and an energy crisis that hasn't been resolved. The pandemic still exists since some countries. Is that going to be a big theme for you at the G20 that you want to turn the debate away from these rivalries between superpowers and focus on issues like food security, inflation? Yes, it is better than having open conflict. It is better to have a forum for dialogue like G20. If there is space for discussion, we can discuss and have debates and hopefully come up with solutions. This is what we want. This is why we have a space for dialogue. I know that you have invited President Xi Jinping to come to the G20. Has he said he will come here in November? Yes, President Xi Jinping will come. And President Putin. President Putin has also told me he will come. Do you worry at all about the G20 being this conflict where you have the democracies coming forward with plans? And you have Putin sitting there in one room like this and you have Xi Jinping with his own agenda. It will be a very difficult house party to run. At the G20, we do not want to add to conflict or problems but to resolve the problems. How we can resolve all these problems, not to add problems and conflict. You know, you have to see Putin, you have to see Zalensky, you have to see Xi Jinping. Do you think that by bringing people together, that that is a way to solve conflict? Sometimes it can increase it. There must be communication. Even if it does not necessarily resolve the problem, it is better to have dialogue than to have open conflict. When we started this interview, I said that you were in the middle between China and America. But having looked at Indonesia, I looked at the numbers. American investment in Indonesia over the past five years is $9 billion. China has invested $40 billion. You look around here. We have a Chinese car factory around the corner. China is buying up a lot of the refineries and make precious metals. Here at the moment is losing the battle for hearts and minds in Indonesia, but also in Southeast Asia. Do you think that is fair? This is an approach that needs to be renewed because what is needed by countries in Asia, including Indonesia, is investment. What investment? If it comes from China, we welcome it. If it comes from America, we welcome it. We are not going to be choosy. You are not choosy, but one side is coming and saying, I want to invest, I want to trade. And the other one is saying, no trade packs. And I want to come and talk about other things. You know, this is what I mean. That is why I said previously they need to renew their approach. We have dealt with Donald Trump, who famously insulted his allies and promoted America first. Joe Biden was supposed to be different, but rhetoric aside, is there any change? Surely Joe Biden is still saying America first? He just isn't insulting you at the same time. Yeah, I will give family a minute. Indonesia wants to be friends with everyone. With any country, we don't have problems with any country. Each country will have their own approach. Each leader has their own style and approach, so there shouldn't be a problem. But now what's needed by Indonesia is investment, technology that will change our society. The one that will change our society.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,970,2022-10-08 22:40:14
12745," But now what's needed by Indonesia is investment, technology that will change our society. Young i Takan Mo Mo, Ngupah Ma Sarakat Gita. I just wanted to ask you about ASEAN since you mentioned it. You have a group of countries, but it is one where you look at the countries, it includes Myanmar, which seems to have all these problems with human rights and so on. Why do you keep Myanmar in ASEAN? We already had a meeting in Jakarta with all members of ASEAN. All the leaders came, including Myanmar's junta, and there's a consensus, five point consensus. The implementation hasn't taken place, and the approach we have taken hasn't worked. That's the complication we're facing. There are several ASEAN meetings after that, which we did not include Myanmar participation. One very last thing on foreign policy, you've been to go and see Vladimir Putin, and tried to talk to him and you saw President Zelensky in Ukraine. I think you've focused on food security and issues like that. Do you see any sign of peace or progress there as the President of the G20? Yes. Sayak gave, then put it out, and then put it out. I went to Kiev and talked to President Zelensky, one and a half hours. Then went to Moscow, Russia, to meet with President Putin, and talk with him almost two and a half hours. I want to see a space for dialogue after the meeting so we can discuss. Anywhere is no problem, but I see the chances are small. So I turned to issues like food crisis, and President Zelensky said they can't export because there were no guarantees for security to ship goods from Odessa port to Istanbul. That was the message I conveyed to President Putin. And President Putin said he will guarantee security for ships to enter Odessa. Those are what I told the media. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71 percent? Buildings across America burn fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100 percent clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels, we want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Indonesia is an extremely resource rich country. And the economy's potential is enormous. It has a third of the world's nickel reserves used in the lithium bath.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,971,2022-10-08 22:45:06
12746," is an extremely resource rich country and the economy's potential is enormous. It has a third of the world's nickel reserves used in the lithium batteries of electric vehicles. It's the world's biggest grower of palm oil, the second largest miner of tin, the third biggest producer of coal and ranks fifth for boxite. Its grassberg mine has won the largest reserves of gold and copper. Resource nationalism is nothing new, but Indonesia's two-term president is doubling down. After banning the export of raw nickel, he's now planning the same path for all the others. JacoE is moving downstream, creating higher-value products that will be used in everything from aircraft to semiconductors to touch screens and the batteries in electric vehicles. We want the added value to be in Indonesia, so there will be state income in form of tax, provide jobs in Indonesia. And the most important thing is that we can enjoy the added value. I'll give you nickel as an example. When we exported raw materials four to five, six years ago, the value was only $1.1 billion. Once we went downstream in 2021, our exports were valued at $20.8 billion, that's nearly 18 times. That's what we want to do with boxite, copper, tin, crude, palm oil, and others. We are not being closed, we are being open indeed. US, China, Europe want to come and cooperate, we are open. The messages you want people to come here and use these raw materials to make things. And so just to be clear, ferronical and pig iron, they will be the next ones to be stopped exported. So people have to use them here. When we, the industry here, are ready, exports automatically will stop. What we want is to build a large ecosystem to produce electric cars as many as we can here in Indonesia. And boxite and tin will also be in this list of materials to use inside Indonesia. Yes, that is correct. Not only nickel, boxite, for example, is used to produce alumina. And then be used to make cars body or cars chassis. OK, is this more beer? Exactly. You've talked about putting a tax on nickel products. You know, the next stage up, is that going to happen this year? An export tax on nickel products? Yes, come on, Ginnan. You're just possible to impose it this year? I can see around here, you've had a lot of success. You and I went around to a rather nice car factory and you have the electric vehicle, the electric battery construction, Hyundai, LG, Volkswagen and Toyota, Seamkin. The person who everyone talks about is Tesla. And you have a $5 billion contract to supply nickel ore. But you wanted to have a Tesla car factory. It now looks as if you hope to get a Tesla battery facility. And I wondered if you could give us any news on that. Is that any closer? Yes, we do. Everything is a car factory. If it is Tesla, we want them to build electric cars in Indonesia. From Ford as well, we want them to build electric cars here. From Hyundai, electric cars, from car makers in Japan, Toyota and Suzuki. We want a huge ecosystem of electric cars for the world. And that's what we want. We don't just want to reach batteries only because this is just half of it. You've made a very eloquent case. Elon Musk is a famously reasonable man. Why is he said no to the car factory then? It's still in discussion. Let's see later the final.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,972,2022-10-08 22:48:57
12747," Why is he said no to the car factory then? It's still in discussion. Let's see later the final result. You have negotiated with Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin. Either of them is difficult to deal with as Elon Musk. Everything needs time. I don't want to go quick with no result. It needs an intense communication and the result will show. Do you think there has been an element, though? Again, looking around here, there tends to be Asian countries which have been first trying to build electric battery facilities here. In the future, we want to build a large ecosystem for electric cars that is truly environmentally friendly. So the energy will come from green energies such as hydro power plants, geothermal, wind, sea waves, solar panels. The famous case of the palm oil, I think people back in April, you suddenly imposed an export ban on palm oil. The price shot up to $1,600. The flood did the domestic market, then you changed your mind. And partly because the domestic market was so full of palm oil, you let it export, the prices come down. Some people would say that Indonesia is now a very honestly run country, but it can be capricious. You change between these things. Do you think the palm oil ban was a mistake in retrospect? Yes. What was the problem? The problem was that there was a domestic market. At that time, the domestic market situation, there was a price spike of almost double. So we made a policy. There were several policies, but it didn't solve the problems for months on. So we stopped exporting crude palm oil and the domestic price fell. Then we resumed exports. I think it's okay. No problem. Will you remove the obligation to serve the domestic market first, the famous DMO, this idea that palm oil has to be offered to the domestic market first? Do you now want to get rid of that? Yes. If going forward, the price is stable, we can remove the DMO policy. We prioritize our national interest. We have to re-use the new ones to be able to maintain our national interest. Soaring energy prices on a short supply of key chemicals that produce synthetic fertilizers are sending peak, cow, and horsemen your prices soaring. Even human waste is in demand as farmers hunt for alternatives. fertilizer helps increase crop yields. You can see how much moisture is held into this. It's a lot of organic material into the compost that breaks down the manure and the straw breaks down into a friable mix that can be mixed into your soil in the ground and for growing a whole range of different vegetables. The nutrients in, the water in, really increases the kind of bio-dynamic profile of the soil. The recent price spike could mean more farmers going organic for the long term. Watch Bloomberg surveillance early edition for the news you need when you need it. I'm Matt Miller with Kayleigh Limes in New York and Anna Edwards in London. Australia's Central Bank raises interest rates twice as much as pork up. The recent surveillance for in-depth analysis. Well outside Tom Kane and Lisa Brown with some Jonathan Fero, the RPA, Fronts and Sensor. How does Japan get away with not raising rates? Can it sustain its normal at a time when everybody else is facing a very different reality?

12748," raising right and it's sustained. It's normal at a time when everybody else is facing a very different way. Bloomberg surveillance be informed be prepared. Be ahead of the game. Learn new. A consistent thing you've been talking about is green industries in the environment. You have a goal to make Indonesia carbon neutral by 2060. As you know, most of your energy now comes from coal, coal prices have gone up. I wonder, will you stick to your pledge that you would build no new coal-fired plants that is gone forever? Our target is very ambitious. 41% 2030 and 2060 we should be at zero, but this requires technology and funding. Money, the potential is clear. We have potential of renewable energy to produce 434,000 megawatts. But to shift from coal to renewable is not an easy thing because the price to produce energy from coal is still cheaper than geothermal. You're sticking to your pledge that there will be no new coal-fired power. Yes it's being done. It's just that there are still some that are still on the process of being completed, not new ones. Indonesia has an oversupply of electricity. Half of the emissions from Indonesia come from land use and forest clearing. 51% of Indonesia is forest and you have committed to keep to that level. But you are still letting people cut down rainforest, which is the really most useful bit. They're building other forests, farm forests. Isn't that the wrong thing? You should be protecting the rainforest first and then thinking about the other kinds of forests next. When forest fire happened more than 20 years ago, since 2016 it has been reduced by 85%. We also do restoration on more than 2 million hectares of peatlands. Within the next three years we will also do restoration for 660,000 hectares of mangrove's forest. In the past five years we also imposed a moratorium on new palm oil plantation. Does it make you cross when people from the rich world like me appear and countries that have already taken down their forests used their coal and you have a country of 270 million much poorer people who have not done this yet and we come and lecture you about this. As if forest clearing is in the past, no more today what we have now is restoration, revitalizing, taking care of the environment. I have required all mining companies to build a nursery for reclamation of their mining areas. We are working to improve the environment. I can take you to the nearest nursery center in Borgor that produce about 2 million seedlings a year and we will have 30 of those nurseries then you will believe that we are serious. Can I ask you very quickly about new centauras, this capital that you are building, 34 billion dollars, the aim is to finish it by 2045. This would be the new capital of Jakarta in Borneo. I wonder will you finish the first stage in August 2020?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,974,2022-10-08 22:57:31
12749," This would be the new capital of Jakarta in Borneo. I wondered, will you finish the first stage in August 2024? Are you on time in terms of that? The shift to a new capital is a long-term plan since the first president, Sukarno. It's my responsibility to put the policy in place, but we still check the feasibility studies. It will need funding of $33 billion, and we will use state budget to cover for 20%, while the rest 80% from private sector from investment. And this isn't just for two years. It's for 20 years. I'm confident with a good concept, and with good returns for the investments, I am sure many investors will come in. You know that many people in Indonesia look at problems, look at challenges like building new centaurer, that will happen long after you are supposed to give up. You are currently very popular. You have a 68% approval rating, and some of your allies in the legislature have suggested you could amend the constitution so that you could do a third term, keep building this capital, keep building car factories. I wonder if you said before you will follow the constitution, but can you rule this out regardless of the constitution? Let's talk about the new capital, Nusentara 1st. There is law on this that is supported by 93% of the parliament. What's there to be afraid of with that much support? Secondly, an amendment of constitution, I have said repeatedly, I will abide by the constitution, although support from the parliament is at 84%. Once more, I will abide to the constitution and wishes of the people. Sayat bad bad bad bad once they do see. President Jakoe, I'd like to say that you are still looking forward. Thank you very much for talking Bloomberg again. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'll talk to you about my own sort of fear of not being a kid. I'm not a kid.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,975,2022-10-08 23:01:34
12750," Six-time players, weekdays, this is Bloomberg. I talked to you about my own sort of fear of not being kids playing too much. A friend was like, try to think of it like he's like a painting. Yeah. Like show it, ask him to show it to you. Yeah. Like the same way you would treat a painting. Yeah. I'm gonna say what you mean. Yeah, that's right. So make it a family. Mm-hmm. Do you have kids? I have two daughters. Do they play? Yeah, they're older now. But they, not a lot, because like growing up, I think it was always the thing that dad did. He's in charge of one of the top gaming consoles in the world. Microsoft Xbox, a $16 billion business, home to Minecraft, Halo, and perhaps soon, Call of Duty. You're dead! So we're gonna start by going in the way back machine. A little bit. Uh, did some research. You worked at a computer mart in Vancouver, Washington, where you were selling and playing a lot of computer games in the 80s. Yeah. I'm thinking like stranger things. Stranger things resonates with my, yeah, definitely growing up, my inner geekdom is there. I'm gonna need some photographic evidence of this. What were your most played games in the 80s? So it was funny when I started growing up playing video games, most of it was going to the arcades. Now most people won't remember these days of like going to a store where you'd put quarters and play. Robatron was one of my favorites in the arcades. I would go play that. And then probably more in the 70s and the 80s, I remember my dad bringing a video game, the Atari 2600 with the cartridge's home. And that was kind of the beginning of it. And it just kept playing. And it's still with me. You started out at Microsoft as an intern. I did. In 1988. How would you compare Microsoft's history on games under Bill Gates versus Steve Balmer versus Sacha Madela? Yeah, I think like many things at Microsoft back in the 80s, we started in video games as much out of kind of a defensive. We were worried that other companies might be putting the home PC in place. And the avenue to get there was through video games and game consoles. So we said, okay, we're going to go start our own game console. Because if anybody's going to build a computer for the home, we wanted it to be Microsoft. I think through Steve's years, it was more about growing the business. And how do we bring kind of business leadership into this group of Ragtag people who are out there just having fun building video games as part of Xbox? I think with Satya, when I first took this job, and I got this job as head of Xbox, about two months after Satya, Nadella became the CEO of Microsoft. Well, and when Satya started, there were activist investors targeting the company. Yeah. The stock hadn't been doing well. They were targeting Xbox. Absolutely, yeah. At the time, absolutely right, that there was a question, why are we in video games? In fact, one of his first questions to me was, because he had come from the cloud part of the business being in the cloud, was he didn't actually understand why we're in video games. Not as a negative, just as literally, why is Microsoft at the time, what $1 trillion market cap company, why are we in the video game business? And he challenged us. Like, let's go figure out why we're in the video game space and see if it makes sense. And if it does, let's be all in. And if it doesn't, we'd make other decisions. Early in that journey is when this game, which I know you know about, is Minecraft. And the opportunity to acquire Minecraft came about like months after this moment. So I might have a kid or two that plays Minecraft, yes. And it really caused us as a team to think about, okay, if you're going to go spend $2.5 billion on this blocky Java-based game, how does this fit into the mission of this company? Let's talk about that strategy. Was the idea to tie gaming to the cloud? Was that the clincher? If you think about a game like Minecraft or Fortnite or Roblox, these are...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,976,2022-10-08 23:06:30
12751," to the mission of this company. Let's talk about that strategy. Was the idea to tie gaming to the cloud? Was that the clincher? If you think about a game like Minecraft or Fortnite or Roblox, these are games that play on iPads. They play on Xboxes, PlayStation's, PCs. The games were going from per device to per user. And cloud would be an enabler for that. But we didn't start with how do we fit cloud into video games. We were just kind of watching the trends of creators and where they were building. And saw this transformation of games being ubiquitous. How does this all, as you see it, connect to Microsoft's future? The cool thing I see going on now, and it does fit with the investments Microsoft's making in Azure and other places, is today the world, anybody's a creator. And video games are going through that same transformation where if I rewind to my childhood in playing video games, I walked into like an egghead software and there was a line of boxes. We might go create the best game in the world, but there was no way for us to get it in front of an actual person who might want to go play, because we couldn't get shelf space. All these things. Today, we see gamers on our creators on our platform from all over the globe who can create a game that can literally reach billions of people through our distribution capability to a player a game is a game. And you can deliver that game through the cloud to anybody who has a device that's capable of reaching the internet. I hear you're still an avid gamer. How often do you play games? Like how many hours? I go to bed early, so I got to bed at 10. It's Seattle at 10 o'clock. People who play with me online, they tease me about how militant I am at 10 o'clock. I'm out. I probably play 15 hours a week. As I understand it, you do your own deals. You don't necessarily need permission from Satcha to do a deal, is that true? No, there's definitely, it depends on the amount of the money in the deal. But when we think about some of our bigger deals, we go to the board. And so Satin Adela, Amy Hood, the CFO, have been incredibly supportive. As Xbox, we're one of the biggest consumer businesses in the company, we're a brand that makes Microsoft relevant to a whole generation that probably doesn't think about a lot of other Microsoft products in their day-to-day life. MUSIC Activision specifically is facing a lot of challenges here. There have been lawsuits, there have been employee walkouts how much did that concern you when you're thinking about this deal. MUSIC You will put a woman on Mars. You will bring forth global cooling. You will be the first Chief Crypto Officer. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge, and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer, disrupt. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. So what's the best investment advice you've ever been given by anybody? The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance, and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day. And if you keep at it and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's not just interest. It was always said above compound interest returns, compound business returns, compound human returns. They're all very additive because you'll learn every day. And if you keep at it, it's very, very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make? Selling it the wrong time. And they sell when the prices go down? Yes. Or yes. Not keeping, but people have conviction or they invest for the, if they invest for the right reasons, just keep at it. What you're in the process of a potentially monster deal, $70 billion acquisition of Activision, talked to us about how this deal came together. When we were thinking about on that idea of what are we capable of doing today and where do we need to go? The biggest gaming platform on the planet is mobile phones. One and a half billion people play on mobile phones. And I guess.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,977,2022-10-08 23:10:54
12752," One and a half billion people play on mobile phones. And I guess, regretfully as Microsoft, it's not a place where we have a native platform. As gaming coming from console and PC, we don't have a lot of creative capability that has built hit mobile games. One thing about the video game space is, if you've been around maybe too long, you know most of the creators out there. So you kind of know teams that could be a good fit in terms of what we were trying to do. But we really started the discussions internally at least on Activision Blizzard around the capability they had on mobile and then PC with Blizzard. Those are the two things that we're really driving our interest. Big Tech is under a lot of regulatory scrutiny. Big Tech deals are under scrutiny. What's the status of the deal? What have your conversations with regulators been like? I kind of come at this that big deals should be scrutinized. I think that's the role of regulators why they're in place. I feel good about the progress that we've been making, asking good hard questions about, okay, what is our intent? What does this mean? If you play it out over five years, is this constricting a market? I feel good about it. Microsoft had its time in the antitrust spotlight. Now the spotlight's on Google and Meta and Apple and Amazon. How is it that Microsoft has skirted the spotlight? Your competitors might say it's unfair. Well, I think you're point about us having grown through that time. I might call that the adolescent ears for us as we were kind of learning. I think it's an important consideration that we did learn a lot as a company through that time and what it meant. And I think that sticks with us today. You've been a really big advocate of cross-platform play and this idea that gamer should be allowed to play whatever games they want on whatever platform they want. Why is that so important to you? Maybe you happen in your household to buy an Xbox and I buy a PlayStation and our kids want to play together. And they can't because we bought the wrong piece of plastic to plug into our television. It's just seems that these artificial constraints that the industry might put up for near-term kind of business dynamics in the long run. If you take a business that is at 3 billion people growing to 4 billion people over the next decade and saying how do we continue to grow this business? Reducing friction for our customers. As an industry has to be at the top. So how far does this go? Does this mean that Activision games that call of duty you'll be able to play on any platform and perpetuity? I don't know what that means and forever. Like when you think about how long and it's not for any kind of nefarious business reason, it's just like what do we even platforms mean 10 years ago? Like I think the definition of some of these things might change over time. But our expectation is we want more people to play. So I know you're working with Sony on some things for the benefit of gamers. Can you talk to us about that a little bit? We have a pretty big publishing footprint on PlayStation as well as Nintendo, which means we have good relationships with those platforms because we're they're a big part of our business and we're a big part of their business. I think our long-term ambition of where we see this industry growing is also shared. I think the area where things get stuck a little bit, it's in the kind of near-mid-term competition. If somebody walks into a store and they have one $500 bill, they're either going to walk out with a switch, which is what most people buy, or they're going to walk out with a PlayStation 5, or they're going to walk out with an Xbox, or maybe somebody will go buy a Windows PC. But in that world of somebody's got to make a decision for one platform over another in the beginning, that is where I think we get stuck in some of the kind of near-term competition. I don't think that's bad. It's just the dynamic of each of us pushing each other to build the best product for our customers. Now, while you've been working to make the gaming industry more collaborative, the gaming industry has historically been tough for women, for diverse voices. When you look back on gamer gate, do you think you did enough? I can always look back at any incident for me and think about things that in hindsight, I should have done more, I should have done better. I'm proud of how our team evolves, how our leadership team evolves. Now, there's societal issues around us. The gaming industry is not immune to those. People in my position sitting here as kind of old white guys ahead of gaming platforms, not in more than norm than I should be, and I talk about 3 billion people who play video games. And if you say your audience is 3 billion,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,978,2022-10-08 23:15:18
12753," ahead of gaming platforms, not in more than norm than I should be. And I talk about 3 billion people who play video games. And if you say your audience is 3 billion people, then the demographic is the planet's demographic. I want our team to reflect the customer that we aspire to earn. I know that our teams ship their culture with every product they ship. Well, Activision specifically is facing a lot of challenges here. There have been lawsuits. There have been employee walkouts. There have been accusations of sexual harassment, sexual assault. How much did that concern you when you were thinking about this deal? We had access to data from the company before we announced the acquisition to see what the actual numbers were in terms of reports. We definitely as a team signed up to say, just like we're on our own journey with Xbox, that we're going to expand that journey if the deal closes. It's a lot of people and a lot of people that will feel very dedicated to and committed to building a great workplace environment for them. That's true of any of our studios, right? But it's obviously a conversation that you're going to have. You think about the board of Microsoft. And when they're thinking about the deal and they're typing into their search engine, Activision, what are the headlines that they're coming back? And there were questions that we had. We've learned from this. We will continue to learn. And we're committed to that journey. Not only for the betterment of our teams, but our customers, the creators on our platform. We think it's critical to our business success that we make progress here. Is Bobby Codic going to stay on? Yeah, I'm not in a position to make comments about their leadership team. We're in the regulatory phase and how that will close. When the deal closes, then we have say in how they're managed and how it goes. But until that point, I'm not really in position to say. There have been very specific allegations of Bobby being aware of things. That happened and not reporting it to the board. What has he communicated to you about what he knew, what he didn't know? The discussions we've had were about the teams where they're at. Can they make the progress they need to make? Because the closing is a long process. Are they putting in the work that they need to put in to move along their journey? And I believe they're committed to that. When I look at the work that they're doing now, there's always more that can be done. Activision has divisions that are unionizing. And I know Microsoft has said they'll recognize those unions. What does that look like? I've never run an organization that has unions in the so. But what I can say in working through this is we recognize workers needs to feel safe and heard and compensated fairly in order to do great work. So we thought it was important to make a public statement on that front for workers that are there, that are making decisions about their employment and how they want to, what that relationship looks like to understand what it would mean if Microsoft was able to close the deal. When I think about the environment on any of our teams, I build from a perspective of people, of building a workplace where people feel like they can do their best work in a sustainable way. And they could see this as a long-term career for themselves. So if Xbox employees decided to unionize with Microsoft support that? We knew we made the public statement that it wasn't, that it would have a broader impact than just the impact at what would potentially happen on a close of Activision Blizzard.

You will shed light on dark matter. You will make aging optional. You will turn 5G up to 11. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer, disrupt. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. So let's talk about some of the broader trends. You and I talked a lot during the pandemic, gameplay surge. Yeah. During the pandemic, we were all stuck at home. Has that changed? It has changed. We've seen gameplay hours come down a bit, which I will say I think is a good thing. People should get outside. People should moderate. Long-term growth trajectory for the business is incredibly durable and strong. You have adults now that have grown up playing like myself and it's become a more normal part of how people entertain and how families spend time. As the economy has tightened for consumers, as gas prices are higher, people are worried about what their home economic situation looks like. We're seeing gameplay hours kind of stay strong. I think from a value perspective, gaming's a good value for people at a time of kind of economic constriction. If people bought Minecraft, they can continue to go play Minecraft. What about supply chain? What challenges are you still seeing are all the consoles that you want to have made and time for the holiday is going to be here? I still think demand will outstrip supply for us this holiday. We will see when we get into 2023. You'll start to see more that supply is catching up with demand and maybe actually see one in the store when you walk in. What's the future of the console? I mean, our console's going to be around in 10 years. If even Microsoft is your sort of de-emphasizing. I equate in my head, gaming on console, the gaming on a television, but absolutely people are playing on more screens. And I think for us as a platform, if we don't adopt that as part of our strategy, we're kind of pushing against what our customers are asking for. We talked a bit about kids earlier and as a mom, I'm always slightly terrified that my kids are playing too much. Video games are ruining their brains. We're going to be exposed to all this bad stuff. That's all the positive. You're a very pro game for kids. And I wonder how do you support that? As a parent, you know what's best for your kid first. Like I'm not going to say what's best for any individual's kids. What we can say in the research backs this up, that gaming can be a great on-ramp for kids into STEM education as they think about, well, how are these games built? I also think the community power of gaming is something that doesn't get talked about enough. Last night, I was playing Escape Room on Xbox with one of my friends. And while the conversation might start about how are we going to escape from this room, then we're talking about his daughter who's looking at colleges. And we just talk about life, like people will when they're in the same place. And I think that ability for gaming, whether it's with kids or adults, to bring people from different backgrounds, different geographies, different social media, different economic, different religion, different genders together and shared experiences, is pretty unique out there. I think building those connections that video games can enable, maybe this is too altruistic, but there aren't enough of those things in the world today. Which brings me to the metaverse. You know, obviously, Sasha came on my show. I hope that this is the next big thing that happens off to the mobile internet. Facebook changed its name, to meta. Some gamers don't even want this whole metaverse thing. My view on metaverse is gamers have been in the metaverse for 30 years. When you're playing games, if you're playing a world of warcraft game, you're playing in role-bloss. You're playing in a racing game where everybody's in a shared world. These 3D shared worlds that gamers have been playing in for years and years, I think what we've found is there's more connection, as I was talking about before, because we have shared purpose. It's not at all surprising to me that gamers might look at metaverse and think, well, I don't really get it, because we've already have an avatar of myself. And I can already go into a shared world. And I can already sit there and have voice conversations with the people I've been playing for years and years. I can already sit there and have voice conversations. I can already sit there and have voice conversations. I can already sit there and have voice conversations.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,980,2022-10-08 23:24:04
12755," Well, I don't really get it because we've already, I've already have an avatar of myself, and I can already go into a shared world, and I can already sit there and have voice conversations with people anywhere. But I do think the skills that we have as game designers and game creators make a ton of sense in a lot of enterprise experiences, and this is why Sati gets excited about it. What about crypto? Play to Earn is all the rage right now. Play to Earn specifically is something I'm cautious about. It creates a worker force out of players for certain players to kind of monetize. Now, to be fair for us in the game industry, this has existed for years and years. There have been gold farmers of people who literally just spend their time doing some menial task in a game to accrue some currency that they could sell to some other rich player in for real money so that that person doesn't have to spend their time. And now you find games that are starting to build that into the economy of the game itself. We made some comments in Minecraft about how we view NFTs in this space because we saw people doing things that we thought were exploitive in our product and we said we don't want that. I think sometimes it's hammer looking for a nail when these technologies come up, but the actual human use or player use in our case of these technologies, I think there could be some interesting things. So let's talk about your priorities looking forward. You're in the middle of trying to do this really big deal. Are we going to see you keep doing deals? Are you still on the look out for new studios or new geographic locations where you want to build out Microsoft's gaming presence? Definitely on the second part, geographic expansion is critically important. We've hired our first people in Nigeria now as part of our team. We have teams in India, teams in South America. Again, when I talk about 3 billion gamers, I'll just use Africa for a second, like 1.2 billion people in the continent. Average age is what? 20 or 21. I think it's very, very likely that the next big hit games that we're going to see are not from the traditional locations, not from the traditional people. And I think that's fantastic. So geographic expansion is critical. Cloud is important to that as we put our data centers in places and we can not only distribute the games, but allow creators to use our cloud development platforms to build games without having to have the local hardware right there in their house or in their office to go build. I think that is important. So we're going to do a little rapid fire. Okay. What video games are you playing now? Cult of the Lamb. Most important meeting you've ever played a game in? You trying to give me trouble plus games? Have you ever just played a game in a meeting with Sasha? It's easier on teams calls because they can't see your screen. You're not in the same room with people. I have played games. Sautius caught me playing games before. And yeah, I'd say a Sautius meeting. I played the fifth. What's your favorite thing to do when you're not gaming? Of all things snowboard with my family. You have a lot of gaming fans. Who do you fan over? You know, one of the things I'd love to go do is find a game I've never heard of and go spend time with it and then talk to the creators about it. I think creating something, putting it out there is such a brave thing to do. If you could see any band in their prime, who would it be? Wow. So I'm a punk rock fan. So I'd probably go back and say like the Ramones. Best piece of advice for your 20s. When I think about these my career, not the only lens I have, there have been a number of times when others have made bets on me that I probably didn't think I was ready for, including the job I'm in now. And to listen to the others around you when they are making a bet on you, when they're pulling you to go do things, at least for me who was probably reticent, maybe a little imposter syndrome kicking in on was I really ready for something. But understand that others around you when they're encouraging you, that they're probably doing it for good reason. How do you balance work life and play? My little 15 minute commute back and forth is my transition zone of I'm now at work, I'm now at home. I don't even have a home office because when I'm home, I'm not at work. Like it's just always been my thing is that segmentation with my family and what I do. It doesn't mean I've never responded to a mail when I'm at home. But I'm very regimented that way. When COVID happened, it didn't work. When it didn't work, emotionally it didn't work, output wise, like motivation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,981,2022-10-08 23:28:15
12756," But I'm very regimented that way. like motivation. And I was pretty transparent about that with the people around me and how I had to change things. Does that mean you want everyone else to come back to the office? And what does it look like in 20 years? We're going to see video games really gain their space in telling stories that really change people's perspective on others lived experience. And I think that's a pretty cool thing. Alright, thank you Phil for joining us. Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world recalibrates. Often decades of stagnation Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation. Corporate giants, policymakers and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that. Every week on Japan ahead right here on Bloomberg Television. Okay, so you're moving in on me quick. Just trying to me with your fancy hands. I'm going to deal with your night because it's really bothering me. Ah, my night. Yeah, he's a troublemaker. Yeah. What did you get up to this weekend? You know, just robot stuff. A lot of chess. I was practicing for you. I know you're pretty good. Ooh, I don't like that. I will take this. Put it over here. Not cool. Not cool. Alright, I will. I will concede. I can see. You've got me, Bid. Very good game. Well played. Thank you, sir. Thank you. No one covers the world like Bloomberg.

No one deliberately wants to go into battle, but we sneak walk into conflict. With unmatched reach and resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks. 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, you are global business authority. Welcome to the earth shot prize innovation summit. I'm Francing Lackwai here at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. This event powered by Bloomberg featured finalists selected by the earth shot council. Larns by Prince William. The first time in the world, the world has been a global initiative that drives innovation on solutions to climate change and environmental issues in the fall.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,982,2022-10-08 23:32:10
12757,"...did by the Earthshot Council, launched by Prince William, is a global initiative that drives innovation on solutions to climate change and environmental issues in the following categories. Protect and restore nature. Clean our air, revive our oceans, build our waste-free world, fix our climates. So over the next half an hour, we'll bring you all the highlights from this most important gathering. This is Bloomberg. Protecting the environment was of course close to my grandmother's heart. And I know you should have been delighted to hear about this event and the support you're all giving our Earthshot finalists. The next generation of environmental pioneers. Together in this room are the people and organisations who will help us to achieve the Earthshot mission, to repair, restore and rejuvenate our planet within this current decade. That mission is not simple. Just as President John F. Kennedy so famously said, as he challenged the United States for America, to unite behind the goal, putting man on the moon, we choose to do these things not because they are easy but because they are hard. I know that the world is an uncertain place right now, that many families and communities across the globe are facing unimaginable challenges, from conflicts to energy crisis and food shortages. While addressing these in the short term, we must also remain resolutely focused on tackling the greatest challenges that threaten our tomorrow. Because if we don't, the changing climate will only serve to entrench these immediate challenges into fundamental global issues, severely impacting the lives of each and every one of us. That is why our collective mission is so urgent, but there is huge reason to be optimistic. The 2022-21 cohort of Earthshot winners and finalists is evidence that we can succeed. The we can protect our world for our children, our grandchildren and the generations that will follow them. These pioneers exemplify the leadership needed in this decade of change. They include inspiring activists, brilliant innovators, a forward-thinking city and even an entire country making a real difference. But they cannot do it alone. This must be a team effort. We must come together behind their innovative solutions to ensure they reach their full potential with peace and scale. While my message today is one of gratitude and encouragement, I also acknowledge that you cannot succeed in isolation. As governments, we have a responsibility to create the incentives and the space for you to flourish, a receptive environment for change and the accountability that comes with guardianship. In many nations, the foundation for this approach is being flayed for us long ago if we choose to listen. Where I come from, I'll tear our New Zealand a beautiful place. You must visit. Our indigenous people hold a worldview that every single living and non-living thing is connected. Our people, our plants, our animals, descendants of Ranganoi, the sky father and Papa Tuanuku, the earth mother and their children. And so it follows that people and nature are kin, are family. And we must care for one another in the spirit of Katiaki Tanga, which translates into guardianship by the people of the land for the next generation. In short, koha ho te taiau koh te taiau koha ho. I am the environment and the environment is me. Our life source, our economy, our future. Now, I've seen this in action first hand many times, not least in my own backyard, the Pacific, where the ocean is a source of protein, income, culture and connection. Now, it is a source of challenge as it rises up and begins to inundate small island nations. It can be confronting to hear and see the stories of just how real these challenges are, but none of us are here because we have given up, but because we believe there is a way to change the future. We are not only part of the nature, but we are nature. Nature is living element. For indigenous people, nature is whole. Our planet is alive.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,983,2022-10-08 23:36:37
12758," Nature. Nature is living element. For indigenous people, nature is whole. Our planet is alive. The rivers are her blood. The trees are her hair. The soil, her skin. The wind, her breeze. And indigenous peoples, our planet they know, they are the doctor. We are protecting 80% of the world's biodiversity because our way of life do not harm nature at the opposite. We are strengthening ecosystems. We improve biodiversity by cooperating with the birds and trees, listening to the winds, observing the cloud, learning from even the little insect. We protect nature by setting up our own limits. We don't take more that mother earth can give. And we give back. We protect the sacred trees. We don't destroy the field of the medicinal plants. We choose, pre-susely, the animal that we can kill to just keep the balance of the ecosystem. As all of us know in this fight, no one can afford to sit on the sidelines. No one can claim that climate change is somebody else's problem or shrug it off for future generations to address. We're all affected by a warming planet. We see that every day. And decisions being made right now will determine our share tomorrow. So we must choose. And we must act as united nations ourselves. Our progress depends on collective action, on collective ingenuity. If we stick together, we can make fixing the climate the greatest project and greatest achievement of our lifetimes. We have the science. We have the solutions. Now all the world needs is political will. Together, we can create a future where rampant carbon is removed from the atmosphere. Where green buildings and green business transform the livability of communities. Where easy access to renewable energy enables greater equity. Where sustainable agriculture feeds a growing global population. The needs are urgent. And the costs of inaction are worse than any nightmare. But let us not be driven by hope, not fear, by optimism, not despair. Because hope is not passive. Hope is the ultimate source of renewable energy, pushing us forward every day to try and try again. Today, the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit, in partnership with Mike Bloomberg and Bloomberg Philanthropies, will ask each and every one of us what we can do to accelerate progress to repair our planet this decade. And offer solutions on how to collaborate to drive this ambitious but essential climate agenda. We will continue to drive impact around system changing climate solutions and amplify the Earth Shop Prizes call to accelerate progress to repair our planet through collaboration and innovation. But most importantly, we will remind ourselves what can be achieved when we turn pessimism to optimism and optimism into action. Coming up, more from the panelists and finalists here at the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit, this is Bloomberg. MUSIC Imagine simply climbing a cable into space. The concept is known as the space elevator. Not only could it significantly change how we leave planet Earth, but it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space. And there are scientists who think we could have already built it. We have the material. We have the technology. We have the lasers. We have the climbers. We have all of it. If a private entity wants to build it or a government, they can build it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,984,2022-10-08 23:40:53
12759," So we have the technology, we have the lasers, we have the climbers, we have all of it. If a private entity wants to build it or a government, they can build it. It'll change society. We have no clue how colonizing in the space, how really spreading out in the space, really change our society over the next 50 to 200 years. It'll be completely different. We will never break. We will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never. Welcome back to the best of the earth's shop prize innovation summit. The guests featured ranged from heads of state to leaders of grassroots environmental organizations. Well amongst them was philanthropist and Microsoft founder Bill Gates. It's too bad you can't do things overnight in either mitigation adaptation. When I last went through Europe, people were the leaders were all saying, hey give me technologies. So I can tell Putin to get lost. I said, hey in five years you're going to be able to call him up. They were like, no, we'd like it. No. Okay, that, how's your planning permission regime and all the planning for that future grid. Seeds typically between the time you start and they get out in the farmers fields is about eight years. Now we have a pipeline of innovations. You know, we've been funding the CG system for 20 years now. It's funded about a billion year. It's if people care at all about adaptation, that thing will be funded at two billion a year. I mean, there won't be anything close to the impact of climate related seeds, climate related maze, rice, wheat, sort of a millet. And thank goodness because of human genetics, we know how to do the editing. Thank goodness because of AI, we know how to find the alleles because of drones. And measure stuff in the field. So there's huge advance in terms of how the whole seed ecosystem moves at at full speed. The timing is very tricky here. The warming doesn't stop the day you get to zero emissions. There's a leg in this system. It's about a 20 year leg. So you haven't seen that earth temperatures not equilibrated to the atmospheric CO2 content. So if you look at the peak, it's not like 20, 50, 50. That's not like 20, 50, 50. I think it's not like 20, 50, 50. So you have to look at what the peak is. And you can't just plan for okay, 20, 30, 20, 30s where your main production in central Africa is down 25%. You will have switched in most of those areas from a fairly heat sensitive crop to sorghum. Now sorghum productivity is super low. So we'll get people to do better maize for these next 15 years. And then they are going to have to switch to sorghum. It is tough when you see the floods impact us down. I mean, nobody expected that. You know, if the goal of climate was to make us pay attention. And you know, wow, that is way beyond expectation. So some adaptation money literally will just be disafter recovery money. The boundary of what's what is also pretty confusing. This is food aid.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,985,2022-10-08 23:45:43
12760," So some adaptation money literally will will just be disaffered recovery money the boundary of what's what is also Pretty confusing. I mean what is food aid? You know if climates causing Some food law production losses all world-proof program money. Is that all climate at Adaptation money it it certainly the need for it's going up. That's a system That's about six and a half billion a year So relative to the systemic solution, which is the research piece It's relatively larger, but the demand for that piece which is the acute You know half a pack Pakistani rice got flushed away And so you're gonna have Mount nutrition problems if you don't go in for that. That's also a type of adaptation and And you know, so I do think and we're gonna bring some rigor To this because the pressure now, you know the the goal of doubling the adaptation money from They say 20 billion here to 40 billion here The pressure on that is still peanuts. No, it's very small. I mean literally yeah, if you start sticking food aid in there You know you can use it up Very quickly rebuilding after hurricanes. I mean we had hurricanes before but You know the cost there are are absolutely gigantic You know there are ways of stopping wildfires there are ways of dealing with sea level rise So the innovation agenda not just on seeds the innovation agenda is going full speed on on mitigation That's where you know, there's a hundred companies break through energies funded There's a bi mitigation you mean mostly energy you mean Everything to do with energy you mean generation of energy you mean batteries you mean transport you mean all of the new And there's some renewables that are already traditional But more that need to come on so is that's the package that you're talking about mitigation? Yeah, are you also talking about agriculture as mitigation? Yeah, so every every area of emissions You know the world tends to focus on past near cars and electricity That's not a third of emissions and so the focus on the easiest third You know now 4% of new cars are electric You know, so that's the field that we're further still long about 4% of energy generation is wind and solar and As you triple the size of your grid you want that to be say and you know some people would say a hundred percent Other people might say 70 to 80 percent you know the amount you have to build were you know Not within a factor of five of the build rate of those but those are the easy sectors cement You know clean cement costs over twice as much as The way we make cement today and it's not it's partly the heating energy. It's partly the basic Thing you know remember in chemistry when you take calcium carbonate heated you get calcium That's what makes a man that the thing that goes away that's CO2 and so we have to have a Way of making cement which a number of these innovative and steel and iron. Yep. There's a whole family of hard to Abate sectors. That's true if you get a That industrial sector If you get green hydrogen that's cheap enough it actually solves quite a large number of those Some of the industrial processes you go straight to electricity and some you go through you do your reduction using the The hydrogen where you would have used some Hydrocarbon concept before for steel. We actually have companies doing both. We have Electrosteal and others doing electricity is the way of Replacing the blast furnace and then we Have others that take hydrogen And if you get the hydrogen cheap enough You get the super magic thing which is that the green product doesn't cost more That's called green premium equals zero and then your adoption Scale is utterly different if we tried to subsidize steel and cement They say rich countries say okay. We want to get rid of that which those two are 15% of emissions That's greater than all four and eight budgets",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,986,2022-10-08 23:49:39
12761," uh, say rich countries say, okay, we want to get rid of that, which those two are 15% of emissions. That's greater than all foreign aid budgets put together. It's over 200 billion foreign aid, you know, never will pass that number. It's just not politically possible. It's a number that's at about 170 and going down today. Coming up, but more from the panelists and finalists here at the earth's shop prize innovation side, this is Bloomberg. We make it very transparent to the shopper before they accept an order. What the order is going to look like, how much we're going to pay them and how much like the consumer is paying them. And so they can decide whether they take an order or whether they refuse it. And that's a kind of flexibility that our shoppers really value and the kind of transparency that they want. Are you seeing a labor shortage right now? And what are you doing to to combat that? It's different in different places or demographic of shoppers is completely different from food delivery and our right sharing where 70% women and half of them are moms. And that's because a lot of the job at Instacart is very different than just being in a car with strangers. It's about like going to the store, doing a good job of customer service of really picking the right products for the consumer. And we are seeing that being very appealing to women. Markets are preparing to close, but the day is not over yet. Stock that is now up about 45%. A lot of volatility right now. You need the power of the Bloomberg terminal to get you market moving data before anyone else. These numbers are much higher than expected. Operating today to overweight. You need top analysts to bring you exclusive global insight into cross-asset markets. The mini bond market is a really big focus. Bitcoin ain't right in the long today. It's going to be a short term. Bloomberg markets the close weekdays on Bloomberg. Welcome back to the earth shop prize innovation summit. Finalists of the annual award appeared alongside special guests, including worldwide business leaders, philanthropists and non-governmental activists. Now while the 2022 finalists have been announced, our panelists have their eyes on the future and here's what they have to say. This is the earth shop decade. We are in a race to repair and regenerate the planet. Some will focus on policy. Some will focus on activism. We are focused on supporting the game changes, the innovators, the entrepreneurs and the problem solvers. We believe in the power of human ingenuity, grit and determination to create solutions that if scaled could repair the planet. We have only 8% of the ocean protected today. Our earth shot is 30% of the ocean at least. 30% of the ocean protected by 2030. We know that if we protect the right 30%, not only will we prevent the extinction of many marine species, but also we will produce more fish. There's going to be these protected areas that are going to produce a spillover that will exceed the foregone catch. We will have more fish to eat, food security, livelihoods for people. We know that for every dollar that we invest in a protected area in a marine reserve, that produces 10 dollars in economy output and creates more jobs. It's a triple win for marine life, for food security and for climate and of course for the economy. That's the goal, the mission. In the next 8 years, and that's where the earth shot is pretty crazy. In the next 8 years, we need to quadruple all the ocean protection that has ever happened in human history. Are you optimistic that I can be done? I am optimistic, there's no choice.

12762," I've seen firsthand the potential that a breakthrough idea can hold and if we start seeing more of these transformative solutions across all the challenges facing our planet and suddenly our earth shot won't seem so improbable The work will be difficult. It'll take extraordinary resources determination partnership, but we've got all the essentials right here in this room So what is the challenge? It's the speed scale and cost of making these green hydrogen generators Well, that's exactly what we are working on Because to make green hydrogen the fuel source of the future It needs to be cheaper than fossil fuels and that means Electrolizers are going to need to be really really cheap If you want to take a solution around the globe as quickly as possible You need to make it standardized mask-produced commodity A product that is easy to make and quick to build and cheap as well And so while some believe Electrolizers need to be large machines We believe the electrolyzer should be a standardized mask-producible product that can make green hydrogen Anywhere for anyone In 2030 we imagine millions and millions of projects on restore and not just places on earth where We see nature being brought back But all of the other nodes that are key to ensuring success So the technology providers this the nurseries the seed banks the funders the government incentive programs So that we have an ecosystem that really allows us to leverage the many many connections within the nature-based solution space And in 2030 we have been focused on another key area which is cities and And cities require data and insights to take action on climate and to preserve nature to create more nature entry canopy So we've set a goal that we want to be more nature in cities exactly Exactly right and we so we've been partnering with cities like Los Angeles to give them insights Utilizing AI and geomapping on where all the places that you can create more tree canopy Which reduces urban heat islands improves air quality sequesters carbon And so we want to bring data and solutions to bringing nature into cities as well as of course preserving and restoring nature And so one of the goals that we've set is we want to enable over 500 cities around the world I know we're going to hear from the mayor of a Paris after this to reduce a giga-ton of carbon emissions by 2030 And so that's through data tools in sites whether that's evolving transportation systems or planting new tree canopy So that's a big bold target that we want to see achieved by 2030 Anyway, I guess I'm in the wrong place. I came here to invite all of you to the grouch convention But it turns out you're all about my least favorite thing helping Oh You've got me asca I do like helping people learn how to reuse repurpose and recycle Together everyone in this room can build a world where nothing goes to waste and that includes even you me Sorry, my guy I got to get going to that convention, but uh Just between us. Yes, I do have a recycling bin right next to my can, but no, I think it out okay. It'll ruin my image But my father believed in the power of the idea And over time the vision the purpose the courage it embodied has inspired each generation to take on its own challenges Not because they're easy, but because they're hard President Kennedy understood that the effort to land on the moon would bring out the best in us That everyone would have to contribute that it would require innovation creativity teamwork commitment and faith And that world would be better because of it The earth shot prize has inspired the same spirit of optimism and ingenuity on a global scale To tackle the most pressing challenge we now face repairing the planet My family and I are so excited that the Prince of Wales will honor this year's earth shot prize winners and",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,988,2022-10-08 23:58:19
