11808,A group of former UFC fighters that are suing the UFC scored a key legal victory on Thursday when a federal judge said he would grant their lawsuit class action status. Workers power in the labor market. There's a guy in the sport from the guy who just got his first fight all the way up to the Conor McGregor's that is pleased with the way the UFC treats fighters the way we've been strong armed the way we've been coerced Over unization in some sports Over free agency in baseball In boxing the Muhammad Aliac which restricts the kinds of contract terms that can be imposed on boxers. The fighters who brought this lawsuit see it as the continuation of a tradition in sports of athletes fighting Have agency and power in the terms of their work And who they do it for. Mix martial arts used to be pretty culturally and legally fringe in the United States it was banned by most states John McCain had famously called it human cock fighting There are some rules in the UFC but to a large extent Words of body parts and tactics and attacks are on the table and people get Seriously injured at times. Broken multiple times. World torn off how to get that reattached. In the two places about my neck broken. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,333,2022-10-06 00:01:44
11809,Take care of you. The fighters would say at the heart of UFC's power is the contracts that it signs with fighters. Before boxing had competition boxing used to be dominated by a few dominant promoters and the contracts were ported over from boxing and the contracts are basically designed to control every aspect of a fighter's career. There are long term. They last multiple fights. Fighters under these contracts Are To fight For UFC for a period of time And UFC can extend that time if a fighter declines a match or if a fighter gets injured Who the fighter fights they control when the fighter fights and then they have a number of different classes that make it very difficult for a fighter to ever break free from UFC if that fighter ever did want to become a free agent Are so one sided there really is no negotiation room for any of the things especially as you're coming up and as they're strangle hold on the sporter MMA got so much stronger Part of what's at the heart of this lawsuit is the ways that UFC Philly took other competitors off the board. The UFC has such a strangle hold on mixed martial arts and as they were buying up so much of the competition shutting them all down they really became the the only option for anybody that wanted to do this professionally ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,334,2022-10-06 00:06:05
11810,"World there is no negotiating these are our very strict never ending contracts and that's the case to this day Do you all see just says oh you wanna fight for us you sign here if you don't want to we've got 20 other guys that'll take your spot 7080 90% of the top fighters under exclusive contract meaning that those fighters are not available to any other MMA promoter Even if they wiggled their way out of the very restrictive contract that you have seen post on them Didn't have another All mixed martial arts option because there weren't robust rivals to go sell their work to. On Tuesday afternoon a class action lawsuit was filed in US district court in San Jose against a zoo by LLC with fighters kangli and john pitch attached to the soup Came to me and says hey come I know this lawyer he will help get the fairness for the fighters on you know in in the marketplace and I decided I wanted to step up for all the fighters that being affected End of 2014 6 years ago now. Group of now all former fighters, Auntie trust class action lawsuit against UFC In broad terms the case is an any trust case where we're claiming that the OFC is both a monopoly and a monoposony. When we talk about monopoly, we're talking about the power that a company has when it becomes the only one selling something. Monoposony is about the power of being a monopoly purchaser of something. In particularly, a monopoly purchaser of labor ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,335,2022-10-06 00:10:24
11811,Into the fight. It gets so disheartening. Because I've seen fights that are called the fight of the year. This is just that this brutal war. And they battled for four and a half rounds until one guy's body just gave up and then you find out oh that guy made $60 thousand for In one of the hearings in this lawsuit Sees attorney argued that if the fighters were really the product if all that UFC were selling were the fighters then the fighters wouldn't need you to see it all that a fighter is not The UFC product An Apple engineer who makes a cool iPhone is the product that Apple is selling. We the fighters make this whole thing happen. And walk this path right now. Are the product if the fighters are not the product then go ahead and release us from our contracts you'll do fine without us. Clearly. It's the identity and rank and popularity of those fighters that attract the eyeballs and make the sport what it is and if you can lock all those up and keep them from other promotions you can dominate the sport Which is what they've admitted they've done.

11812,"Every nation that's a coastal state has some region of the sea floor that falls within their territory of waters and many countries including the US the area that's underwater exceeds the area It's above water. So, huge amounts of nations, areas, and regions are just really unexplored on characterized. We know really know what's there. We know less about our seabed than we do about the surface of the moon or mars. Only 20% of it has been mapped. A map of the sea floor could lead to all kinds of discoveries like new marine species and rare earth minerals like cobalt that we need for electric cars and mobile phones. The value of all the gold deposits alone on the sea floor is estimated to be around 150 1 trillion dollars. I'm up could also help us when tragedy strikes. Malaysia Airlines flight 370 disappeared from radar screens. Mapping of the ocean floor is being carried out problem is that the southern Indian Ocean is just so incredibly huge Who we are, where we are, where things are, once you understand something, you start to value it When you start to value something that's when you start to really think about making it healthy and preserving it and keeping it going.

11813,Things like machine learning and artificial intelligence are also going to kick in in the next decade. Because with all this data they'll be able to make connections that a lot faster than perhaps we would have been able to which then again feeds our human understanding and also gives us new ideas and new ways of thinking of expiration. Until the early 20th century mapping technology was simple usually a weight attached to a long rope known as a deadline. After the Titanic sank in 1912 explorers proposed using sound waves to find its hole in the north Atlantic this led to Sona the most common technique used for mapping today Operated by the schmidt ocean institute the falco is an 82 m long research vessel Systems that have helped Deborah Smith and a team of other marine technicians to mop over a one 1 million square kilometers of the sea floor From somebody with a rope with some knots to Acoustics that is I call it math magic but it is incredibly advanced mathematical technology to be able to measure the distance in time of travel of sound on a moving ship. Multibe mapping works by using Sonars so Sonar is taking sound and the measurement of time so you have a multibeam sewnar and it sends out a ping of sound that sound travels to the water column hits to see floor and comes back to the ship and we measure that time and we're able to calculate the distance ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,338,2022-10-06 00:23:35
11814,Maybe with little bumps. Really don't think about all of this that's underneath and it's really Amazing landscape that's just hidden from us With more than 90% of the ocean deeper than 200 m fleets of all tournament vehicles could make the data gathering process faster cheaper and safer A new discoveries might help with exploration of all kinds. And look for life and other kinds of life forms. I also think in this next few years We will have a different kind of access to the ocean because of virtual reality and augmented reality and so that will allow us to sit in our living rooms and really experience what's underwater in a different way and see it this different alien planet ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,339,2022-10-06 00:28:22

The meat alternatives that have made it to the market thus far have been plant based. Imitation beef and pork made from ingredients like pea protein and coconut oil by companies like Beyond Meat and impossible That's a very different proposition from cultured meat which is made from actual animal cells. I'm a huge fan of any company of any person trying to make a product that's improving the food system including all the plant-based proteins maybe in some future menu you'll have this kind of cultivated chicken and you'll also have a plant-based version that's fine Ask yourself in our lifetime. Or likely to also remove the conventional option on the menu too. Need a more permanent solution. We do think we sort of need if you will endgame to this problem and we just think this is more likely to be that the path to achieve that.

11816,"Love duck. So we wanted to show that we at Memphis Meats can produce meats that we are the global population love to eat. There's a lot of similarity and how we grow the meats from various animals or fish but they're also different because of nutrients they need and how they actually come together to form the final product the meat and I think it's very similar to how we also grow various animals there's similarities in the feed that we give cows and cakes and But there's also differences how we cultivate and it's very similar for us as well. So we've been working with the FDA and the USDA for the last 3 years and really developing the guidelines on how this food should be regulated when we come to the market. As soon as we get regularly approval in the United States. People will be able to go to their supermarket and buy it and enjoy it. They'll be able to go to a Near them and order me directly from animal cells. But it's not just getting the meat right once approved the gates open to a very high potential demand and scaling becomes the next big hurdle We make chicken for myself, my friends, my preferred, my family, my colleagues, now we actually have the ability to make chicken familiar to people. So that allows us to invest into allow the economy subscale to drop the price. The second is we need to reduce the cost of the nutrients that these cells are consuming. So then chicken feed raises or drop The nutrients we feed ourselves does the same things we need to drive that down the cell density is another technical element we need to continue to to increase that and hammering all those things of the course of next 510 15 years we'll put us in a place where we're significantly below the cost of this animal protein and that will be one of the main inflection Wines that will will lead to a new way that he meet So here is a close up Of A half eaten Crispy chicken bite ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,341,2022-10-06 00:36:41

It will be the meat industry in 20 years. We're gonna look back and basically say, wow, remember back in the day when we used to use animals to make meat? Yes impossible stated goal really is to replace the use of animals as a food production technology globally by 2035 That would mean supplying a $one. 20 billion industry not to mention a source of sustenance as all his time. To be fair, the company has got a lot of people talking about its products. So, there's a thing called the impossible burger. Let's call the artificial meat, the realest, fakeest burger in the world. Not that. But before impossible foods can take over the world it's going to have to overcome strong competitors penetrate tough new markets and generally transform its product from a conversation piece into a new staple food With the coronavirus turning the world of food upside down this could be the moment when impossible's new fangled meat goes main street.

This is all made from plants. It's all made from this taste like beef. Doesn't that just look like real meat? So meat life. They Just like a burger it taste like yuckers. No it doesn't taste like a burger On the impossible burgers relative meetings but the debate itself was fantastic free advertising helping to propel impossible into major chains like white castle and then in the summer of 2019 into more than 7000 burger kings across the US To date the company has raised over a one 1 billion dollars and a funding round in March valued the company at around four 1 billion. But fake meat is a happening space these days and impossible faces some daunting competition. So now for the stock of the hour and that is beyond meat. Protein company are soaring today. Beyond me is also making a very meaty burger from Lance. They're very non GMO. They stress that all the time. To differentiate themselves from impossible. It'll be much easier to actually modify plant material to make it Take on the the texture and appearance and aroma of of animal protein. Right. But we won't do that. Had one of the biggest IPOs of the year in 2019 so impossible which is still privately held has some catching up to do. That you won't hear Pat Brown knocking his biggest competitor.

If eventually, China were able to use the port of Guadar as a military base. You know, no one would be surprised if China did use it in that way. I don't think in a short term like it is set up in Jaboti where it has a permanent base. Think it's more likely to use it as almost like a sort of forward based resupply option. Something I can use when it wants to. Other projects like building Pakistan's largest airport in Guada and two special economic zones have been delayed and 19 km highway linking the port with the macron coastal highway in Balochester is under construction too. Most of the people who live there and work there already are fishermen. They rely on access to the sea. The way that they highway express highway from the port was originally proposed would have cut off their sea access and so that was a A real point of contention with the community. There have been some proposals to allow them at underpass. It's still a little bit unclear how that is. It's finally going to be resolved.

The release of cyber punk 2077 in December of 2020 we'll go down as one of the most disastrous game launches in history and it instantly reroke the narrative of its celebrated developer city project red.

Other open world games felt empty and and forest and the developers Gave excuses as to why there couldn't be more rich story or interactions Blew them out of the water.

What's really leading the index or the benchmark in high today is energy stocks that can be expected given as well the moves that we had in the energy sector in the S&P 500 overnight. But also the flip side of that or the side effect of course is that high energy prices can lead to inflation becoming more entrenched but investors certainly seem to shrug off that today. So in terms of the individual benchmarks, the Hang Seng really one of the few that is in the red today. Otherwise, it's actually Korea's market that's moving as high today. Actually, chip stocks is really what's pushing there. We did have a note out from Morgan Stanley saying that the sector is likely to recover next year. So if you take a look at the bottom of your screen, change onto the COSDAQ. You'll see that the COSDAQ, which is the tech heavy sector in Korea, is actually outpacing those gains that you're seeing for the cost for there. But let's take a look at this chart because when you look at Asian stocks coming into this week, not only do we see a bit of positive momentum coming through this whole question around whether the Fed is nearing a policy pivot that has of course been quashed by the likes of Mary Daly but still something that really sent stocks higher. You couple that with a valuation stocks looking very cheap in Asian Raction track for the best week now since November 2020. Pull that into context though because of course we did have that seven weeks skid. Only send that a handful of times in the last couple of decades. So UCF will also really underpin the session for China when it starts back on Monday. Yeah and you'll be of course across all those moves. Thank you very much for the moment, animal droolers. They're only get to our top story. Flesh that out for you in a bit more detail because the OPEC plus decision to cut oil output by two million barrels a day in his latest opinion column Bloomberg's Javier Blas says that the cartel has delivered a massive snub to Western governments facing the worst energy crisis in half a century and it's difficult to see the move as anything but an attack on the global economy. We're now joined by our energy reporter Steve It's Zoptinsky in Singapore. So Steven just a few weeks ago you had the US president arrive at the shores of Jeddah in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. He walked side by side with the Saudi Crown Prince and there appeared to be an understanding that the Saudis would acquiesce to injecting more barrels into a sourcing global economy. This is a complete reset this morning. Absolutely. I mean you can't look at this any other way than potentially a huge stump of the White House. Biden went to Saudi Arabia. He pissed pumped MBS. He really put hat in hand trying to get more supply. The US thought that they made he had a win on that one. Initially OPEC plus reduced rated ad output to the market of very small marginal increase 100,000 barrels then which then they took away a little bit later and then now they're taking away two million barrels a day which is the largest reduction since the pandemic began in 2020. It is already sending seismic shifts to the market. You've seen Brent oil and WCI oil both rise pretty significantly. That is only going to add more inflation pressure in the US increasing gas leak prices right before the midterm election. It's a challenging outlook for the US and it does look like Saudi Arabia is partnering with with Russian choosing that relationship in this OPEC plus decision. Steven I mean as the meeting went on in Vienna I'm trying to visualize and sort of get a better sense of the dynamics between the different players there and what the rationale was behind raising it by two million barrels. We're taking two million barrels off this market specifically. You know the explanation is that you know when you're looking at where the market is going you are seeing that there's this recession risk and because of that OPEC plus the technical committee thinks that the man will drop and they want to keep a balance on the market and get ahead of this.

11835," Do more demand destruction and more than half of EU nations have reached limits on soaring gas costs. Let's get from the energy story around to the other side of the world and talk about the Asia markets with Annabelle Drupalister, Joneses from Hong Kong. So Annabelle, how was all of that being taken over there? Yeah, I think it was interesting what you just said there. You said about that bullish momentum that's still coming through into the US futures because that's certainly also underpinning what we're seeing in Asia today.

11836," goal committee, things that the man will drop and they want to keep a balance on the market and get ahead of this. So adding, you know, reducing the output by two million barrels a day is able to sort of provide some balance in the view of the OPEC plus members. At the same time, it takes away a lot of froth, you know, even though it's a two million barrel a day cut, it will actually really only result in 1.1 million barrels a day of actual physical reduction because there are a lot of OPEC plus members that aren't even hitting their production targets. So not only is this one way for the technical committee and those folks to look at how can we balance things? It's also a way to take away some of those overhangs by other OPEC plus members. Stephen, thanks a lot for the analysis. Much appreciate that's our energy portal, Steven Stepzinski in Singapore. There's never a dull moment with OPEC plus in these meetings every single time, drama. Well, from there we go to the San Francisco Fed president, Mary Daly. She sees a high bar for slowing the central bank 75 basis point pace of interest rate increases. Daly told Bloomberg that she thinks markets have it wrong by predicting a cut from the FOMC next year. Let's take a listen. I don't see that happening at all. I see us as raising to a level that we believe is restrictive enough to bring inflation down and then holding it there until we see inflation truly get close to 2 percent and demonstrate that price stability is restored. Let's cross out to somebody who's watching and weighing every word carefully that's our senior Asia economy reporter Michelle, San Francisco. So Michelle, is there anything that suggests at a level of the departure from the hawkish trajectory that we've seen consistently this week? In a word no, you said, I mean, they have been ruthlessly consistent, Mary Daly being the latest to talk about how they're not finished with their inflation fight. I mean, we've seen, we saw the RBA, we saw a job opening data earlier this week out of the U.S. that showed perhaps the labor market there is getting a little bit less tight. But then on the other side, you have what Steven was just outlining. You've got the OPEC price pressures ramping up inflation in the U.S. You have ISM services gauge overnight, one that I was looking at. This price is gauge still extremely elevated in the 60s, which is a high range for that mark. So what you heard from Mary Daly was that they're not done. Their data dependent, they're not seeing it in the data yet that they should be turning at this point. And so she and her colleague Raphael Bostic, who said not so fast, are really pushing back on the markets expectations that they're going to have to turn to cut sometime soon. Michelle, straight to the point, much appreciated. That's our senior Asia economy reporter, Michelle Jamisco. Now for a check-out on the first word headlines from around the world, here are a couple of things I'm watching. European Union has backed a new package of sanctions against Russia. They include a price cap on Russian oil sales to third countries and mechanisms to stop sanctions being dodged. Other measures target Russian individuals, including those involved in recent widely condemned referendums in Ukraine. But some nations say the latest draft weakened earlier proposals. UK Prime Minister Lestras has sought to rally-dispondent members of her ruling conservatives at the party's conference in Birmingham. The annual gathering has been overshadowed by humiliating government climbed on a mattress as planned to cut taxes on Britain's highest earners. She pledged to stay the course after abruising few days in which members of her own cabinet openly questioned her plan. We gather at a vital time for the United Kingdom. These are stormy days. In these tough times, we need to step up. I'm determined to get Britain moving, to get us through the tempest and to put us on a stronger footing as a nation. North Korea fired two suspected short-range ballistic missiles on Thursday, making a total of 10 launches in less than two weeks. That's one of its biggest test for Russia's underleader Kim Jong-un. Kim shortly after Pyongyang condemned the Biden administration for escalating tensions as the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier group made a rare U-turn to waters east of the Korean peninsula.

11837," Waters east of the Korean peninsula. That is your first word headlines. Let's get you bit of a snapshot of what else still to come on the show. We're gonna get reaction to the OPEC plus output cut. What it means for energy markets, that's gonna be with one of the most important voices in the space that's Ole Hansen, he's the head of commodity strategy at Saxobang. But at first, more Fed speakers pour cold water on hopes of an early dovish pivot. We talk strategy with Aberdeen Standard Investment Director of Change, Ashley. This is Bloomberg. How much of a push have you seen from the Kishiro government in terms of green funding? The Kishiro Administration has committed to doubling the amount of investments in so-called green technologies. I think we need more than just pronouncements. We need real money backing, very innovative startups and innovative companies in this space. What do you make of Kishiro's new capitalism? Well, I think he is very more reflective of the challenges that Japan society is facing, namely, that growth has been present, but growth has not been, of course, evenly distributed. But frankly speaking, it's hard to redistribute income. If you don't have much income to begin with, if the government and private sector can work together and collaborate to drive more innovative growth startups, that can really drive the income growth that the Kishiro government needs to redistribute. I'd like to reach a point where policy is moderately restrictive, somewhere between 4 and 4.5 percent by the end of this year, and then hold at that level and see how the economy and prices react. That was the Atlanta Fed President Rafael Bostic. Markets then still adjusting to a raft of issues that you had again in contracts for the SAP 500 reverse, the small decline in the index on Wednesday, European futures advancing, but the bullish sentiment weak enough there, the dollar, so it's biggest jump in a week on Wednesday, the OPEC Plus decision, of course, weighing on some of the analysis as well. I want to head out to the Aberdeen Standard Investment Director, James Asley, for a little bit more perspective here. They tied together what OPEC Plus does and what the Fed would like to do. But let's start off with the commentary from the Fed. We just heard from Mary Daly, are they going to be able to push forward as planned, come the next two to three months, or do you expect a little bit of a moderation, a little bit of an acknowledgement that the economy is weakening? Now, honestly, you suffer over the next couple of months. I don't really expect a softening. I've got to say, in general, fairly critical of central banks and have been for quite some time. I think in this case that the communication strategy of the Fed is the right one, because if they allow markets to latch on to any notion of them wavering, even if that's based on expectation of future weakness in the economy, then the market does the work of these financial conditions today. And you may never get to that point, because you actually create a short-term stimulus. So they have to sound.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,63,2022-10-06 04:18:11
11838," then the market does the work of these in financial conditions today and you may never get to that point because you actually create a short-term stimulus. So they have to sound robust, they have to sound unwavering, they're all channeling, they're in a Margaret Fatcher, they're not for turning. But the reality is that six months down the line, I don't think the Fed has much more idea than we do what the economy is is going to be up to and history suggests they're not great at Ford, guys. Maybe we need to, maybe we need to channel your inner FOMC membership because let's assume that you were there with some of the deliberations. How would you respond or suggest a response to what we got from OPEC plus overnight? That is really going to unravel a lot of the easing we've seen in energy prices and potentially create a real headache for this Fed. Yeah, absolutely, it's definitely not what anybody in the Western economy wanted to see. So far the rally in oil is not massively concerning, we moved from 80 to 92, 93 if we were to stabilize here. I don't think it's going to have a dramatic impact on inflation four, five months down the line. And again, I think with a high degree of certainty there was going to be enough inflation over the next few months for the Fed to deliver pretty much as their price. So I think you're talking about a 75 and a 50 or possibly 275 again six months down the line the middle of next year. It's a different story. But the Fed doesn't want to overreact to every single data point because obviously there are significant lags in all of this stuff. And as we've already seen, the rising commodity prices has been a will be demand destructive. One of the most red stories on the terminal this morning, James is about currency reserves around the world and how they've shrunk. So by $1 trillion in a record drawdown at 7.8% this year to $12 trillion. That's the biggest drops in Bloomberg kept kept record of this particular set of numbers in 2003. Is this where something could break in terms of sovereign currency reserves? And in that case, you might see a more coordinated global pushback to stabilize financial conditions. Maybe it's not the equity markets. Maybe it's not the bond markets. Yeah, it's a really good question. And it's obviously a difficult one to answer. A lot of the countries who have so far been obviously into being announced intervention programs have got reasonable reserves or in some cases they've got you know, incredibly large reserves and it's unlikely to be stressed there. But there are some countries and some currencies where they have very few reserves and they do have currency weakness, which is a huge problem. Unfortunately, one of those is the UK at the moment, but otherwise I'm thinking places like Thailand where the currency's been under pressure and they don't have significant reserves really to defend it. And so we might see individual stresses in some of those currencies, potentially this further pressure, upward pressure and treasury yields as well as those with large reserve balances decide that now is the time to intervene to sell dollars just to prevent declines in their currencies. Whether that leads to systemic stress is difficult to say, but honestly, I do subscribe to the idea that the Fed will height until something breaks and there are a lot of fragilities in this system. James, I mean, I want to get your input on what clients should be doing with positioning in this market. I know you've been cautious in the last month or two, maybe it's now time to nibble away in certain asset classes a little bit. Cautious, but probably more than a month or two to be honest, you said, as a right sky, I'm sort of paid to be miserable and I revel in that role at times. I still think there's a lot of wood to chop before we can start to look at the upstage of the cycle and really pile into cyclical assets and valuation has improved in a lot of corners, but to me, it's still not really accounting for the risks out there. Global equities look better prized than US equities. US equities to me still look way overvalued, but it's difficult to really decouple individual equity markets. I do think Japanese equities look interesting just because of how weekly yen is, how supportive that would be for Japanese business.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,64,2022-10-06 04:22:41
11839," difficult to really decouple individual equity markets. I do think Japanese equities look interesting just because of how weekly yen is, how supportive that would be for Japanese business, so buying them un- hedged maybe, maybe there's a position there that can survive the next sort of six to 12 months, but broadly speaking I'm still pretty cautious. I still like owning the dollar. I still think that there is value enough in now in the long end of the treasury market for a long-term investment and I still like precious metals here, but as I do think when the dollar turns when US real yields turn, we won't necessarily have got all of the inflation out of the system and I think precious metals could really benefit. All right so sounds like a little bit of gold, a little bit silver, I never heard anybody. Thank you very much for some of those views that's James Athe, fantastic to catch up, he's the Aberdeen Standard Investment Director. So much more coming up on the program. This is Bloomberg. Recently crypto currencies have been very popular. If a client came to you and said, look I'd like some crypto currencies in my portfolio, what would you say? We've actually been really deep into crypto, deep into learning about blockchain, and all of the new businesses. I would characterize this as crypto learners. We have made a series of toe-hold investments on behalf of our clients, both in some of the currency baskets as well as with some venture firms that are investing primarily in the crypto area. I think it has the potential to be completely game-changing, but it is still such the wild rest and so it's so uncertain, but there's, it has the potential to completely upend everything. Well, Saudi Arabia's energy minister was making headlines at Vienna, the country's sovereign wealth fund was also issuing its debut green bonds. It raised a total of $3 billion. Some of Foxman has more on this. So, Simone, the issuance got quite a bit of interest from around the world. Yes, some $18 billion of bids coming in for that $3 billion of issuance, and that really pushed yields on all three tranches of those bonds well below the initial guidance. In fact, the 10-year bond yielding about 60 basis points more than what Saudi government issuances for the similar period we have a GTV go, which kind of shows you what's happened. Now, there's a couple things to me. One, it says demand's still strong. Four golf bonds, four Saudi bonds, despite falling bond prices. Two, it says any investor angst about a green bond issuance by Saudi Arabia given its world's largest oil producer may be overplayed, not necessarily material to its ability to go and issue these green bonds in the market. Also, century bond, that was a new milestone for the ESG. And, you know, I wonder as well.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,65,2022-10-06 04:26:44
11840," Material to its ability to go and issue these green bonds in the market. Also, century bond, that was a new milestone for the ESG. And I wonder as well if this doesn't start to open up green bond sales across the region. We've seen Cutter Flirt with the idea. We've seen some other sovereigns do so. So we could potentially see other countries and other companies come to the market in the wake of the sale. And then some of the world's major energy producers are raising the alarm about tight markets for the fuel in years to come. Their latest commentary, what stood out to you? Yeah, a bunch of them speaking at an event in London sponsored by Energy Intelligence this week. All of them talking about supply next winter. Not saying that this year is the concern, but next year down the road, that's what everyone's going to be concerned about. The CEO of Cutter Energy, one of the folks who made such comments. He also said that the market will be structurally short of LNG supply until a lot of new capacity comes on the market, come 2026. Also, interesting to me were comments by the CEO of TES. That's a company that's building the LNG import terminals, hydrogen import terminals in Germany. He really called on European leaders to stick together. Otherwise there would be a threat for natural gas supplies across Europe. He also was concerned about next year's supplies of LNG. He said we're at the beginning of something that looking unfortunately worse than expected in the medium term. Right. And then briefly, fuel prices are also a problem in Tunisia, the country's central bank and the price of the market when it hiked rates yesterday. What's the context? Yeah, first monetary policy decision, since June when it decided to hold rate steady, really response to the highest inflation in 30 years, 9.1 percent year on year in September. We've seen a lot of concern from the markets about Tunisia's fiscal position, Moody's putting the country on watch for a downgrade last week and this decision by the central bank may not help it in its efforts to get that IMF loan very crucial to its long-term stability. So, Moody, thank you for that. That's a somewhat foxment at the California Central Center in Doha. Quick look at some of the Middle East equity markets because with the firmer energy prices both in natural gas and especially in crude oil, that should theoretically underpin some of the movements to the upside, but caution dominated in Gulf indexes in particular with the Tadau just down about a tenth of 1 percent. Looking at cable as well, the credit outlook was cut to negative by Fitch on fiscal risks. It is going to be front and center much of the FX thinking at 1.13.62. This is Bloomberg....

11841," It was only Bloomberg app weekdays on Bloomberg. You've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. They have. I've been in and seen it. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? It means they have a Bloomberg. This is Louac Daybreak Middle East. There are top stories this morning. Oil prices extend. They're rally after OPEC plus defies Washington, agreeing to the biggest production cuts since 2020. Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister says US led planets to put a price cap on Russian oil are adding to uncertainty in markets. We'll hear from him and the Russian Deputy Prime Minister later. Investors signal belief in a fledgling stocks rally as futures climb that's despite the latest Fed speakers pouring cold water on hopes of an imminent policy pivot. I see us as raising to a level that we believe is restrictive enough to bring inflation down and then holding it there. And Saudi Arabia raises $3 billion from its first ever green bond sale. I think it's first for Ray into ethical finance. Let's circle back to the markets in Asia. Annabelle Dhrulurs has all the nuances from our Hong Kong studio. Annabelle. Thanks, you said. We're seeing stocks in Asia moving high today, being underpinned by those moves in US Treasuries. Also moving around half percent of the upside. You can see here using the iMac function for the MSCI Asia-Pacific index. It's a pretty broad-based rally. There's a couple of factors also weighing into this. Because coming into the week, of course, stocks were looking pretty cheap. Perhaps there's a bit of a dip-buying opportunity going on as well. In terms of the actual sectors that are moving, we're keeping a particular watch on what we're seeing in the energy space. That's the biggest gainer today for us, given that we did have that OPEC plus decision deciding to cut production, so a supportive factor for oil prices generally. But then also what we're seeing in the IT index, because we're actually keeping a particular watch on chip stocks. In the session, if you change on now, we can take a look at some of the movers extending their gains into another session here. Because the TSMC actually jumped a few percent yesterday, around three and a half percent, given that we had a Morgan Stanley report out saying that we could start to see the chip sector recovering by the second half of next year. But that's also having other implications for chip makers, Yusef, including the ones in Korea. And then we've seen a lot of foreign outflows from Korea this year. I want to pick up on that. And it's also putting pressure on the local currency, isn't it? Yeah, that's right, Yusef. It's been pretty interesting. There's a very high correlation between pressure on or outflows from the Cosby index, and then also what we've seen in the Korean one. And actually, the Korean one, when you look at it versus its Asian peers in the FX space, it's been the biggest decline next to the Japanese yen, of course, the biggest in Asia against the dollar. But certainly that's been put in the bank of Korea under a lot of pressure. We just got their foreign reserves data yesterday. And we can see here that they've actually been forced to dip into their reserves to try and shore up the one by the most since the financial crisis. Generally, this is a global issue though. Of course, if you bring up this terminal chart, we can also take a look on a global scale. We've actually seen foreign reserves down around $1 trillion. The part of that is down to valuation changes in the dollar, but also just a sign of the stress Yusef that's in the market. And about thank you for highlighting some of those moves. That's the end of all rulers there. I want to get to the big story of the morning. And then is Saudi energy minister Prince Hamadil Aziz bin Salman. He says that the US late initiative to slap a price cap on Russian oil is adding to uncertainty in the market. We spoke to him following the OPEC plus decision to cut output. We wanted to give the market a clear direction, a clear input. And that's why we extended the agreement tool.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,67,2022-10-06 04:35:50
11842," We wanted to give the market a clear direction, a clear input. That's why we extended the agreement to end of 23, but we still have the same tools in our kit. Guidance to the market is crucial. Because without guidance, people would not invest, would not feel safe that they could invest. However, we still have the tools in our kit. Yes, we reduced the amount of meeting. We reduced the amount of overall expectations of doing something, but we still maintain the same flexibility. We still have each two every two months. We will have a GMMC. That GMMC is warranted the authority to have more than a meeting in every two months. It also was given the authority to call for a conference meeting if necessity is dictated. Part of the toolkit, and the kingdom has often done this, which is led from the front, and gone with voluntary cuts or ads to do the right thing to write the market. Did you consider a voluntary additional cut for society? Well, at this time now, there is no requirement for it. I think amongst us, we sought out a good deed. We had to be very practical, given the situation prevailing in some countries that are not able to produce their allocated voluntary volumes. And because of that, we elected to go for a bigger number, but in the final analysis, it will be a smaller number, but certainly a significant number. And therefore, it is sufficient for now. Again, our hope that the world economy and the trajectory of the world economy will become brighter, clearer and brighter. Our hope that people can bring more certainty in many aspects, certainty in terms of interest rate, in terms of growth, in terms of foreign exchange, and in terms of what this issue of embargo, caps and the rest of it, including the zero COVID policies, all of these things combined are making the situation, as I said in the press conference. It's been 35 years in this business. I have never yet to see a situation that it could compare to this situation. From your actions today at OPEC Plus, are you telling the market this evening that you are not prepared to fill any gap that might come from Russia? Is that what I walk out the door with that message to the market today? See how the market reacts to the cab to start with. See, there are people that are working with the presumptions that may happen and may not happen. The difference between us and them is that I have a motto. It's not produced by me, but I picked it from seminars. OPEC Plus, the output by two million barrels in a move that the US President Joe Biden called short-sighted. We were hearing just moments ago there from the Saudi Energy Minister. I want to widen out the discussion and bring in only hands in the head of commodity strategy at Saksabang. This two million barrel per day move doesn't make a lot of sense to a lot of people. What do you think drove the decision yesterday evening? First of all, to avoid prices falling further. I think also to remove some of the speculations of selling that we have seen in the oil market recently. By doing what they are doing now, they are not really supporting investors because investment in oil is not looking at the flat price. They are looking at prices for five years out. That probably didn't move much by that decision yesterday. We are squeezing up the front end of the curve and raising the back. We are forcing out some of the short positions. We are bringing the market back into a 90-100 dollar range. The risk is clearly in the short term, though we could move even higher than that. But you could have addressed that kind of situation with-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,68,2022-10-06 04:39:55
11843," I get back into a project to a 19 to $100 range, but the risk is clearly in the short term that we could move even higher than that. But you could have addressed that kind of situation with one or 1.5 million barrels. I mean, two million barrels was not on anybody's cards. You surprised the market. You may get quite a bit of a reaction from the United States where we're now, again, no pick in terms of the bill and pushing back the influence of OPEC plus on prices in the United States. Apparently, that's become a discussion point again. What extent might all of this have actually been political rather than based on market fundamentals? Because it sure looks like it. It looks political. I'm sorry to say. And that's why it's a bit of a mystery to me why they did at this point in time. Because reacting when prices are into the eighties, when we are faced with a global economic slowdown, that's not unnatural for the oil market to respond to a two-week demand in that sense. So the fact that we at the same meeting has Novak out saying that Russian production is likely to soften this short term. At the same time, they're cutting the output. That's basically just the segments that they want the market to remain tight. And I'm striving to buy in some of the reasons for cutting production at this time. Is there a new geopolitical premium that we need to now build into the energy prices? It's specifically crude oil. And is that something the market needs to kind of gravity towards in the next-ue training session? It looks that way. First of all, we need to get this. We'll see some of these short positions, which has been put on as a macroeconomic hedge against the recession. They're probably, they are being scaled back right now. And the market will, I think in the short term, we'll worry that with the uncertainty related to Russia still out there, then we'll see the risk of even higher prices. Clearly not what the world needs right now. And the problem as well, he mentioned yield and the dollar. And this is sending also wrong segments of the FMC. We know that the Fed is hiking into strength while the rest of the world is hiking into weakness. And that is dilemma, because this could potentially send the segments of the FMC, that they have to keep the foot on the break for longer. And that's obviously not what the global economy needs at this time. We had already a very strong statement from the United States overnight. We have yet to hear from the US president himself in terms of facing the camera. But what options are there? When he sits down with his cabinet at the White House, what are some of the scenarios that they can now pull out and execute on from stockpiles to maybe more aggressive foreign policy? Well, both they obviously can continue to let the oil come out of the strategic reserves. That's just making the rebound even harder, because they obviously want to replenish some of that oil at a later date. And that later date is difficult to see right now when we get a situation with ample supply again. And then there's been talk about the restricting exports of fuel products. That obviously would be the main loss on that account would be Europe. And again, that's probably not a really a signal they want to send at this time. So let's see, we need to get past the midterm election without too high prices and then see what happens after that. Goldman Sachs is talking about $110 a barrel now. They've increased their price target for the fourth quarter by $10 a barrel. I'd be up to hear a price forecast from you. So I'm going to ask you what you think at Brent and WTR are going to do by the end of the year. Well, we released our quarterly outlook on Monday before this meeting was. Well, that's really data. Yeah, exactly. But we call it 8 to 100. And I'm kind of wants to stick to that range. But obviously with the risk of an upside break and obviously so many opposing forces right now. And that's the only thing I think really agree on. This market is very, very difficult to predict right now because we got so many uncertainties both on the demand and the supply side. But I think the recession risk will still be linger in the market, but it's probably potentially preventing from really moving much above 100. But the risk in the short term is that we will see it remain bit. I mean, there are two perfect storms that are beginning to overlap. And one is with natural gas, the other one is crude oil. So a big move to the upside and the benchmark contracts on the European continent. What does the EU need to do to get this under control? Because the commentary from yesterday, sure didn't make much of a difference. It was actually had the opposite effect. Well, for now, we need to put on a sweater. That's really the first and foremost. We need some individual consumers to think about how we preserve energy. And I think a lot of that is happening already. And that's also why I'm relatively optimistic about, at least this winter, I think we will get fruit with enough gas in stock. But the next year is still going to be a problem because are we going to fill your pin?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,69,2022-10-06 04:44:41
11844, Relatively optimistic about at least this winter. I think we will get through it with enough gas in stock But the next year is still going to be a problem because are we going to fill the European gas Inventories by by expensive energy that obviously will be a challenge But this winter it looks like we are okay because I think up and down the country and up and down Europe We are seeing people just doing what they can to preserve gas and electricity Now for investors who are struggling with the volatility is underway at the moment in energy prices And especially given that you've got the macro still very much driving price discovery And it's kind of like walking in the dark a little bit at the moment Maybe they should be looking at some of the precious metals Given the fundamental backdrop that arguably plays in favor of that Well what we've seen this this this week only distrants my My view that gold prices and silver will will eventually move higher. We saw a strong move early in the week There was some early signs that we may start to reach this peak hawkish Necessary level in the US which obviously would be could be a turning point both for yields and the dollar and that would be very supportive But my my main reason for for for being long these metals right now It's just simply the insurance against the markets belief in inflation coming back down below market that the risk of inflation staying higher for longer Is there and once the market starts to reprise that we could see gold and silver more higher? All the terrific having you in the studio. Thank you for stopping by my friend That's all I have is the head of commodity strategy at saxophone bank safe travels back to the European mainland And this is both worked.......................,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,70,2022-10-06 04:48:23
11845," So it's probably more about setting a standard, which again in this long journey has to be seen as a positive, but it remains a relatively small one. And as you've said, there is a centri bond in that pretty bold in current market environments. I would be quite curious to see the market reception to do you expect to be strong demand? I expect to be strong demand at a relatively high yield, so we'll see, but there's been quite a lot of volatility, so it will say a lot about the state of the fixed income market. You've also had time to analyze the budget statement of last week, and one of the themes obviously that I've come to the surface is a country that is a little bit more cautious with the higher energy price windfall than it has been in the past. The past higher oil price, okay, we go out spending, things don't go so well, we cut spending. Is there a room for further calibration from the numbers you've seen? Absolutely. It feels that they've been extremely conservative, particularly on the oil price, using a $75 price, which we see as very conservative, so it does mean that as we see incoming months, probably with a higher price, they will have this buffer that they can use to increase investment. So they've been conservative at first, particularly on the oil price. Maybe not so conservative on gross, this is where we have slightly lower number, but the idea is really to maintain some fiscal space to be able to continue to invest in the diversification of the country, and they started from a conservative base, but we do feel that they will have some increased space to increase investment in the run-up of 2023. The sense I'm getting, from the conversations I've had and from what I've been reading, is that what happened yesterday in Vienna will be remembered for a very long time to come. It is a game changer for global energy security. That implies a higher oil price. What is your initial read on the meeting and sort of what it means for some of the government who can enjoy these higher oil revenues? I would like to shy away the political aspect of the discussion and also focus on one piece of the guidance, which is an oil price at 90, and we can understand why they want 90 or 85. This is basically the fiscal break even for a lot of GCC countries or OPEC countries. So it is also consistent with trying to maintain what I've already said in our previous discussion is some fiscal space. In these countries need huge fiscal space to continue to invest in the diversification of their economy. For that, they need a oil price at 90, not at 70. We're going to face a proper recession that could lead to prices much lower. If they want to meet their target, if they want to be able to invest, diversify their economy, they need to be ambitious in the cuts so that 90 dollar oil price becomes a possibility. Some closing thoughts on where that leaves the United Arab Emirates because we talk about liquidity in the Saudi financial system a lot with cyber rates, but I know I-Boards have been a focus for you as well, and it's obviously a slightly different angle to the dynamics of the UAE. The past few quarters have been amazing. So the starting point is one of a very, very robust economy. Now, there are two headwinds along the way. The fact that they will be cuts and most of the cuts will be on the shoulders of the GCC and particularly the UAE and KSA does mean that you have to cut your gross outlook a bit because of these production cuts. And on the other hand, another headwind is obviously emerging is higher interest rates. It doesn't have to lead to a major financial shock, but it does mean that as you dry oxygen out of the air, you make it more difficult for private agents to prosper. So they will be a slowdown because of that we're thinking construction, obviously we're thinking margins as well. So a bit of a headwind until we see basically the fed removing the pressure as they get closer to achieving their inflation target, which is obviously not now yet. So I mean, thank you very much for the deeper insight into Middle East economic matters. I always love a big fan of your work.

11846," for the deeper insight into Middle East economic matters. Always love a big fan of your work. That's Sami Shari's The Chief Economist, a bank, a long-barred, OD and Chi. Well, so much for the come on the show. A very eventful morning. This is Bloomberg. And today I will see you all in the Meerkart speakers from Tim improvements and changes. Thank you for the amazing inspiration for alhnith and the greatest, ever-feather- 85 years, God has perfect Indeed, The president has made it very clear that this is a significant focus. For the intersection of Wall Street and Washington, nobody covers politics like Bloomberg. This is really a reminder isn't it just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see suppression in the U.N. We did see suppression of futures. That is now being reversed. We're seeing oil futures extend a rally after all but plus agreed to cut it out, put by the most in two years earning a rebuke from the Biden administration at the White House. We went into this meeting with expectations but those got blown out of the park. They did indeed. The Emirates tried to recast the stage before we all went into the building yesterday that this is not the politicization of OPEC but petrol is politics, gas is politics and a 6% rally in oil is politics. It's also macroeconomics for the global central bankers. Three days that rebuilt a rally underpinned market or did it set a collision course of a cataclysmic kind of the United States of America. That's what went through my mind as I drove over here this morning reflecting on both the conversations with his Royal Highness Prince of Dulles has been so man, the Saudi oil minister who would not be drawn, would not be drawn on the politics of this or the response to the White House in terms of Jake Sullivan and what he had to say. But I also said to Dine, you said we were busy last night with no vac Alexander no vac. The price caps are coming. Nobody's quite sure what they're going to be. The known unknowns to quote Don and Runsfeld. But this is Alexander no vacs take on caps and caps. One you have already mentioned and that is the decision on cutting quotas by all countries present and by all countries in the group. But the second decision which is just as important as the first one is actually the extension of the declaration of cooperation because it was scheduled to expire at the end of 22. But now it has been agreed that it will be extended at the end of 2023 which gives the market significantly more certainty and significantly more predictability. And that's why decision was taken to balance the market out by these cuts by cuts versus quotas of August. And especially this is this is a very important ahead of the winter season when we would also see the seasonal decline demand by 2.5 to 3 million battles. And this decision which has been made today helps the market to balance it out. I think it's a very weighted decision at a timely one. Let's look towards February 2023. You will have more sanctions with.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,72,2022-10-06 04:57:33
11847," So the market to balance it out, I think it's a very weighted decision at a timely one. Let's look towards February 2023. You will have more sanctions we assume. You will potentially have a price cap. Can you tell me with a surety what your production in February 2023 will be? You said 92, 93% for 2023. But is that the worst case scenario by February with more sanctions on a price cap? So actions as we're seeing creates a very bad precedent and will primarily hit the ones who are actually doing it and the ones who are implementing it. We know and history has a countless number of examples of when market interference, especially with a mechanism of price control, can only lead to a deficit of a certain good. This mechanism is unacceptable to Russia and if it is implemented, we are not going to supply countries which join this mechanism. Bottom line with the market want to know, red hot headline, price caps equals production drop in Russia. Who fills that void? Yusuf. Thank you very much, outstanding coverage from Vienna Bloomberg's. It is going to provide further perspective throughout the morning. I want to get to equity futures and give you a sense of where we are with risk appetite. Getting a little bit better here if you're looking to go along on some of these plays. On the S&P 500 mini we're so called higher by half of 1%. But again, it is all about global energy security and how the Vienna yesterday rips that off. I tell you the right relating to don't mean it public. Apple has identified its next big business, bringing advertisements to more parts of your iPhone. Today, Apple pushes ads in three places, the App Store, Apple News, and the Stocks app. In the news and stocks apps, Apple shows display advertisements. That means that third-party companies like car dealerships or mortgage lenders can showcase their advertisements just like they can on a website. On the App Store, the situation is different. There Apple has search ads. This allows developers to buy their way to showing a buyer on search results. For instance, an App Store developer can bid for the term car racing or basketball so their apps would surface above competing apps in the list of results. Apple's push into ads is a little ironic, given that its ATT or app tracking transparency privacy feature limits the ability for Meta, Snap, and even smaller developers to generate as much revenue as possible for advertising. That's because the feature allows users to choose if they want their data collected and tracked across third-party apps and websites. Still, Apple's hoping to expand its own ads business and is planning to add search ads to its Maps app. Other areas where ads could eventually appear are an Apple Books and Apple podcasts, along maybe one day with an ad supported tier of Apple TV Plus to compete with new offerings from Netflix and other streaming video providers.

11848," Markets come down in Europe from the financial centers of the world. Bloomberg markets European clothes with Guy Johnson in London and Alex Diel in New York. Real-time numbers, real-time analysis weekdays. Good morning. This is Bloomberg Daybrake here up. I'm Danny Berger in London and these are the stories that set your agenda. Biden-Rubyuk, the White House, criticizes OPAC Plus' first decision to cut output calling the move short-sighted. Crude climbs for the fourth straight day. Price cup creates a very bad precedent and we'll primarily hit the ones who are actually doing it and the one-score implementing it. Energy discord as OPAC Plus unites. EU chief Ursula von der Leyen calls for limits on gas prices. After the block acts on oil, Moscow says the move will backfire. Pivot, what pivot? Fed officials continue to call port-called water rather on prospects for a quick policy turn. Mary Deglie tells Bloomberg there's a high bar for any change. Good morning. It's the day after an OPAC decision. A decision that some have characterized as the battle between OPAC Plus and the West. A cut of 2 million barrels per day means that we might face higher inflation and we certainly have already faced the backlash coming from the White House and concerns there of what it means for prices at the pump. So you are seeing not much change this morning and Brent crude but it is back above $91.00 a barrel. This is a gain of 6.5% so far this week. You did see 10-year yields those to tire yesterday in response to all of this yesterday around this time. We're at 3.6%. We're at 3.7%. We are down about a basis point. But what we might be seeing now with a weaker dollar, 10-year yield not doing too much this morning. We do have non-farm payrolls tomorrow. It's a huge risk of any cracks might signify whether this pivot narrative from the Fed has any staying power. We've heard from Fed officials saying nope it does not but still might just be some repositioning some window dressing ahead of that. Same goes for equity markets. We saw this late day rally in the S&P 500 yesterday ending the day little change. Well that late day rally continuing into today's session. We're going to be in the S&P and Nasdaq both up more than half a percent. The big winner this morning really solid gains in Euro Stalks 50 futures. Up about 1.00 and a third percent. But again how long can this last a lot of risk events on the horizon. Well along with gains in US and European futures. We're also looking at Asia stocks that are higher for a third straight session. Let's bring in Annabelle drillers who's in Hong Kong for more on these markets. So Annabelle more risk on. Yeah that's right what you were just pointing out there Danny is really what's underpinning the moves that we're seeing in Asia today. Because coming into the session is actually pretty interesting futures. We're pointing to a weaker start. But then the trading for the e-min has got underway and we saw that moving high. So that's really been reflected today. A couple of things or sectors we're really watching in particular. There's the energy story of course with the OPEC plus production cuts. We are seeing the energy index moving the broader benchmark higher. And then there's the chip story as well because we had Morgan Stanley out with the report saying that the chip sector could recover into the second half of next year. So that's really also leading the cost be there. You can see that is the biggest gainer in the region. And if you bring up the cause back at the bottom of your screen you'll see that tech heavy index in career is really what is leading us higher. But in terms of the global backdrop as you said it's going to be interesting to see how long markets can ignore those bigger issues that are going on. So firstly you've got this these views that we're hearing from Fed officials. Mary Daley the latest saying this idea of rate cuts next year. Basically the market has it wrong. So that's one of the big factors there that we're watching. And of course if you have higher oil prices that does risk inflation becoming more entrenched. But the other factor as well in Asia in particular. If you bring up the terminal chart coming into this week. It starts with looking pretty cheap. So you've also got to look at is this an opportunity for dip buying and actually in Asia on track for our best week now since November 2020. Of course put it into perspective again because we did come off a seven week slide and we've only seen that a handful of times.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,74,2022-10-06 05:06:09
11849," perspective again because we did come off a seven week slide and we've only seen that a handful of times over the past couple of decades but still Danny will see how long come this last? Yeah certainly feels that it can't last much longer given how enthusiastic these markets have been and about thanks so much and about jewelers there in Hong Kong. Let's get to our reporters now from around the world for our top stories. Manus Cranny, of course, is still in Vienna still abandoning us on this show for a little bit for the latest on oil and OPEC. Lubo Prenina joins us with a breakdown for the first ever European political committee meeting and community meeting that is. And Michelle Jamrisco joins from Singapore for our central bank update. Well, let's start with OPEC and oil prices trading slightly higher this morning above 92 barrels of dollars of barrel after an action pack 24 hours. We had OPEC plus agreeing to cut its output by the most in two years. And of course, Eurne Jarebuk from the White House National Economic Council Director Brian Deese saying that President Joe Biden is disappointed by the short-sided decision. Well, we were disappointed that OPEC made this decision. As the president mentioned, we think it's unnecessary if you look at the global environment where supply continues to be the predominant challenge. We've been working for some time to take action and encourage action globally to make sure that supply actually matches demand. And then on top of that, the EU approved new sanctions on Russian oil which draw a deviled threat from Russia. Let's head to Vienna with menace. So, menace, let's start with this rally in prices up six and a half percent so far this week on barrel of oil. So I was in the car on the way over here and what is it? What do we do for 24 hours in Vienna? The job done, six percent in a week, floor creators or clear collision course with the United States of America which has expanded a vast amount of political capital on a approach more with the kingdom. There's royal highness in the press conference, in the conversation, very reticent to get drawn into the response on the issues from the White House. But of course, the red headline on the Bloomberg terminal went to the Russians because it's about the price caps which are coming. The known unknowns, you know I like to quote Donald Rumsfeld, one day I'll get the sequence right. But there are a series of known unknowns and the unknown knowns and the unknown knowns are the impact of those price caps. Let's listen to Novak. Such actions, as we're seeing, create a very bad precedent and will primarily hit the ones who are actually doing it and the ones who are implementing it. We know and history has an accomplished number of examples of market interference especially with the mechanism of price controls. It can only lead to a deficit of certain goods that this mechanism is unacceptable to Russia. And if it is implemented, we are not deploying the two sublime countries which join this mechanism. These price caps are going to interfere with Russian supply and this is the whole point. We don't know exactly the framework of these cons, but Danny, it is going to mean a near-term potential drop-in production, a deficit, that's what these price caps can potentially deliver. And then I push the side, you print somewhere, are you going to fill the gap? Are you going to fill the gap that's potentially created? Because here you are, caught by two million barrels a day into a market. We also had a conversation, Danny, about the global macro backdrop. That's how OPEC Plus presented these cuts. But the bottom line is the worry about the dollar, the worry about inflation and they're worried. The worry about central banks going hell for lever to tame inflation at any cost to growth. Danny? Well, of course, a stronger dollar also just means that for many folks, including a price cut, higher oil is going to be even more painful. And, man, it's looked such good interviews yesterday. I don't think we can say it enough. Really on top of everything. And we had Saudi's top oil official saying that that U.S. led plans for a price cap on Russian exports only.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,75,2022-10-06 05:10:33
11850," I don't think we can say it enough. Really on top of everything. And we had Saudi's top oil official saying that the US led plans for price cap on Russian exports only adds to market uncertainty. Yes. Again, fragility, uncertainty. The language used in the press conference was about prudence, it was about being preemptive. This is why they were taking this action. But it's prepared for more volatility. And as I said, there was a salary-driven, shameless plug. Go and have a look at Twitter. The whole interview is there. But it's about the volatility that's coming from these macro factors. Let's just tune in for a piece. A soup song of his Royal Highness. I don't want people to think that this is one way street. In this case, no, it's a variety of combuting uncertainties. And they could go a street altogether into the positive side or to the negative side, or it could be a combination. We went on to discuss whether Saudi would do as they've done on many occasions. Take the higher ground, the bigger role, and perhaps consider unilateral cuts, which they've done in the past. If you're not a candidate or unilateral ads, he wouldn't be drawn on that exactly. But you can certainly talk about a toolkit which is far from expanded. It was a packed house. It was great to be back in Vienna. It was great to be back in the bunker, so to speak. But there's a whole host of issues around this. And my takeaway is this. We're set for a heck of a bumpy ride on volume demand, on the supply, on the price cap. And it's very clear. They could be outing like hell if no pack really comes to life from Congress, Danny. Never too far from an outing like hell. Man, it's great stuff. As always, stay warm. You're going to be back with us again in about 30 minutes' time. So stay tuned for that. We're going to listen to more of Man, this is great. Interviews, Man, thanks as always. Now, Prague today will play host to an extraordinary summit of European leaders and other regional players. It's the first ever European political community meeting. And it comes as the EU backed a new package of sanctions on Russia. For more on this, let's get to Bloomberg's Luba Proneena in Brussels. So Luba, yesterday, European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen reached out to the EU leaders, basically a plan to tackle the soaring gas prices. What did that plan involve? Indeed, the president of European Commission reached out to the leaders of 27 member states in the European Union who are meeting in Prague this week to talk about what can be done to address the soaring gas prices. And she wrote a letter yesterday addressing the European leaders where she laid out a plan, what can be done. And there are a few tracks. Obviously, central to this is connection of gas prices and electricity prices. And what the EU is ready to discuss is the introduction of a temporary cap on the prices of gas that is used to generate electricity. So this will be a focus of discussion, but also around that while this temporary cap is in place, the European Union will work on a new benchmark for gas that will complement the existing one, the TTF title transfer facility that Ursula Von der Leyen says is not reflecting the actual situation in the gas markets today. So the European Union will work on that. Also parallel to that, the EU is planning to take action to dampen the price for gas that is imported from other countries. And it's going to talk to trusted parties like the USA and Norway. Yeah, I mean, to be fair, we've fallen about 50 percent from the peak of Dutch front month gas futures. So perhaps there was an element there of, as you say, perhaps it wasn't really reflecting fair value just thinking about this strategic move. But that was really something that you should know about the probed demos. But these latter weeks you'll be talking off-the- practical regulations about gas and",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,76,2022-10-06 05:15:38
11851," on the prospects or really more accurately the lack of prospects for U.S. rate cut next year. Both Mary Daley and Raphael Bostic are the latest to bang on the drum on the need to keep tighter policy in place. Let's bring in senior Asia economy reporter Michelle Jamrisco. I mean, Michelle, it didn't really take much for this pivot party noise to die down. No, that's right, Danny. I mean, this debate is as hot as ever. Of course, you've got the markets and other Fed watchers on one side. Looking at that gloom and doom in the global economy, rising recession risks. You saw the RBA earlier this week with a smaller than expected rate hike that dovish turn that we saw. But none of that has changed it for the Fed. They're still looking at data that these they think is red hot inflation that they need to continue fighting in the face of jobs data that maybe has shown a little bit less tight labor market with the job openings earlier this week as well as jobs day data on Friday that should show at least a little slowing in job growth. But what they're saying is not so fast to quote Atlanta Fed's Raphael Bostic. They don't see their rate hikes damaging the economy revocably yet. And they want to continue with that because they're not seeing prices come down convincingly enough. And of course, the OPEC news, not a comfortable development for either the White House of North of Fed. But it certainly bolsters the Fed's case to continue those rate hikes for now. Mary Daly setting a very high bar for relenting on the 75 basis point hikes. So all signs point to the fact that they should have a fourth straight meeting if it were decided today a fourth straight meeting where they're doing 75 basis point hikes. And that will come November 1st to second. And I wonder how the sort of ramifications of this for more global central banks, Michelle. We get the ECB minutes today of their September meeting. How does an aggressive Fed feed into what we're expecting from the ECB? Well, it's certainly rattling for ECB and the likes of central banks everywhere. I mean, they have to kind of take in an account, especially the more externally facing economies like Australia we saw earlier this week. They have to take into account the impact of that stronger dollar and all this Fed speak and the commitment that the Fed is projecting to keep those rate hikes up. Certainly paired with that. And what's spooking the markets, I think a lot, is the growing recession risk, of course. And the European economy seems to be a bit worse off, I should say, than the U.S. economy at this juncture. So anything that kind of worsens that growth side while inflation is not improving in any of these places or at least marketly, so will kind of trigger some further action and some complicated decisions on the part of other central banks. Okay, Michelle. Thank you for walking us through it. All that's Bloomberg, senior Asia economy reporter, Michelle Jamrisco. Coming up on the program, more Fed speakers pour cold water on hopes of an early, dovish pivot. We're going to talk market strategy with a need a gop to head of equity strategy at Emirates and BD. This is Bloomberg. Why is everybody want to be a consultant? And what are all these consultants do? Well, David, I think that we actually defy the label consultant because sometimes consultant seems to imply that we only give advice. And when you look at what Accenture does, we're really different than the traditional version of a consultant. We're really about relevance and results. And that's what is driving our business. What about a consulting project? In my example, on the CEO, I have a problem, I call you up, I say, solve my problem or give me a solution. We don't operate as big companies permanently in crisis mode. And so when you think about, how long does it solve things, a lot of it starts with.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,77,2022-10-06 05:19:04
11852," I say solve my problem or give me a solution. We don't operate as big companies permanently in crisis mode. And so when you think about how long does it solve things, a lot of it starts with the company being willing to set aggressive goals. And so what we are trying to do now is work with our clients to work differently and to work faster. Everything you need to get set for the start of US trading, Bloomberg the open with Jonathan Terrell. Drilling down in the numbers and preparing you as only Bloomberg can, I don't see that happening at all. I see us as raising to a level that we believe is restrictive enough to bring inflation down and then holding it there until we see inflation truly get close to 2% and demonstrate that price stability is restored. I'd like to reach a point where policy is moderately restrictive, somewhere between 4 and 4.5% by the end of this year, and then hold at that level and see how the economy and prices react. FOMC members, Mary Daly and Rafael Bostic, echoing that the Fed is unlikely to cut rates next year. We did see equities fall slightly after pretty big gain for the first two days of October. Let's bring in Anita Gupta, head of equity strategy at MRETS and we need to be the conversation. Anita, one of the best starts for this equity market to an October since the 1930s. What are we witnessing here, just a little bit of start of the month reshuffling or is it something more sustainable? Yeah, good morning, Danny. And what we see here is after three quarters of sequential negative returns for equities. What investors and what markets were hoping for was a little bit of a Fed pivot. Now, that's not our view at this point and with inflation numbers with energy prices still staying high. We don't think that's going to happen. So what you saw was a few rays of sunlight, but it's not going to be a full season of sunlight. We still have very sticky inflation with the Fed convinced on the tightening parts to curb inflation. And that feeds into corporate margins when you have higher rates. So the storm clouds remain. If I can take the glass half empty version of what you just said, Anita, you mentioned the energy picture and what that will mean for inflation. Well, yesterday we of course get OPEC plus saying that they're going to slash output by 2 million barrels per day. We have seen break evens decline pretty significantly from their peak. Anita, I believe we have this chart and they didn't take up too much after yesterday's OPEC plus decision. How much is OPEC challenging the inflation picture, essentially challenging the Fed as Jeff Curry over at Goldman Sachs put it? Well, very definitely you've got a supply demand situation, you know, in addition to the fact that OPEC economies are looking at balancing their budgets. So, and in fact, as we've seen this whole morning, we've seen other analysts come in, it's not really a 2 million barrels a day. Cut it will relate to around about a million, million point one barrels per day. So energy prices were expected to stay higher. I don't think that this cut is the only instrumental factor in keeping those energy prices higher. So inflation, yes, is driven a large part by energy prices and that is a sticky part of the inflation that's not going away. Shelter, yes, we are seeing a few green shoots and again, this is a phenomena across 80% of the world. The sticky inflation driven by both higher rents, higher energy prices, higher food and the Fed is definitely on a continued tightening part. But so are a number of other central banks. What if Anita, the Fed doesn't pivot because inflation is alan Capital",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,78,2022-10-06 05:23:30
11853," But so are a number of other central banks. What if Anita, the Fed doesn't pivot because inflation is conquered? What if they pivot because we have dysfunction in this market? That liquidity issues continue to snowball. They continue to worsen and the Fed needs to pull a BOE of sorts and step in and help this market. What is the possibility or the probability that that is how a Fed pivot unfolds? That's always the possibility, Danny. I don't think that this is a market or a scenario where everything is absolutely definitive. The market is driven by data. So is the Fed driven by data. We are seeing on the earnings front, we have seen companies give guidance as to lower the quarter going forward whether it's FedEx, whether it's Apple, whether it's Facebook, cutting employees. So from the ground level, you are seeing corporates coming up with lower expectations for the quarters ahead. Now that is where your economic growth comes from. We're also looking at the monetary supply. We're looking also at a very much stronger dollar. So would the Fed have to step in some point like the Bank of England? I think it's way too early to say anything. I think we just have to wait for data to see where economic growth goes, where the standards of living. That's very important in terms of US recession, especially and how that plays out into this coming winter. I'm sure this is going to be a question asked over and over again this earnings season in need. So might as well kick it off now in terms of an earnings recession, the worst that we might see from earnings. How much is it priced into this equity market? Equity markets are always leading earnings. So the 25% fallen equities we saw in the first three quarters were reflective of expected slower earnings growth. We are looking at from a facet consensus analyst estimate about a 2.9% earnings growth for Q3. That's the expectation. But surprisingly for Q4, they're again looking at analysts at a 4% earnings growth. That's a year on here. And for 2023, it's around 6 to 7%. Now that's where we think we are going to probably see lower earnings growth. Maybe even flat. The expectations are way too high for 2023. You're definitely going to see the impact on corporate margins from the higher inflation numbers. You've seen wage growth that stays sticky. So it's not going to be as positive a year in 2023 as 2022. And we're coming off a very high base in 2021. And yet we are seeing earnings growth in 2022. Okay, Anita, just out of time. Thank you so much for joining us this morning. Anita, go ahead of equity strategy at Emirates and BD. Coming up, markets take a breather after relief. We're going to bring you the latest on this equity rally running on a steam picking up again in the futures market. We got the twist and turns for you. This is Bloomberg. China's military power has been growing at an incredible speed over the last 20 years. A strong country must have a strong military as only then can it guarantee the security of the nation.

11854," Can it guarantee the security of the nation? In terms of sphere of influence, we absolutely know that China wants to be dominant in Asia. So there is a target to get to that point, to be a military that is appear to the greatest militaries in the world by 2035. The competition for influence is a global one. And through a multi-decade trajectory fueled by planning, money, and pragmatism, China is building a military that allows it to shape the 21st century just as the US shaped the 20th. Welcome back today, Break Your Up Happy Thursday. So this really interesting debate unfolded in the equity market yesterday because at one point, US stocks were down some 1.8%. But they have this massive turnaround late in the day to end basically unchanged, just a loss of about 0.2%. You had, well, as far ago, the analyst over there saying, oh, someone took out this big options market bet, and that caused the dealer to take the other side, things rallied, you have Susquehanna saying it's because of retreat in the dollar. Regardless, the impact was a rally that started late in the day yesterday and the US has continued into this future session. It's also continued in a big way to the European future session because Europe closed down pretty negatively when the US had started to rally. So what are we seeing this morning? We're seeing a gain of 1 and a third percent for Euro stocks 50 futures. If it holds this, you know, pretty solid week for equities, which just not that long ago, we're plumbing the November lows of last year while coming up oil prices extend their rally after an op-hat cut. More on the next. This is Bloomberg. How much I could push have you seen from the cashier? What do you make of Kishida's new capitalism? I think he is framework is reflective of the challenges that Japan society is facing, namely that growth has been present, but growth has not been of course evenly distributed. But frankly speaking, it's hard to redistribute income if you don't have much income to begin with. The government and private sector can work together and collaborate to drive more innovative growth startups that can really drive the income growth that the Kishida government needs to redistribute.

11855," Good morning. This is Bloomberg Daybreak, Europe. I'm Danny Berger in London. These are the stories that set your agenda. Biden review could the White House criticizes OPEC plus first decision to cut output calling the move short-sighted crude climbs for a fourth straight day. Variety of combuting uncertainties and they could go a straight altogether into the positive side or to the negative side or it could be a combination. Energy discord as OPEC plus unites EU chief Ursula von der Leyen calls for limits on gas prices after the bulk acts on oil. Moscow says the move will backfire. Price cap creates a very bad precedent and we'll primarily hit the ones who are actually doing it and the ones who are implementing it. And pivot what pivot. Fitt officials continue to pour cold water on prospects for a quick policy turn. Mary Daley tells Bloomberg there's a high bar for any change. Let's stick on that oil story. What's been described as a battle between OPEC plus and the West. We are seeing crude extend a three-day rally. It was an action pack 24 hours in this oil market. Of course we had OPEC plus agreeing to cut its output by the most in two years that earned a rubbuk from the White House. The EU meanwhile agreed to a plan by the EU to impose price caps on Russian oil experts. Well let's head back to Vienna where Bloomberg's managed cranny has been braving the cold standing by. Man, I believe it's called pathetic fallacy when the weather matches the mood. Chile in Vienna there. Chile when it comes to the relations between the West and OPEC plus. Just think of the political capital. The White House has expanded in extending its reproach more to the House of side. I'll return to that in a moment. Let me just float that out there. The other side of this trade and the OPEC plus the plus relationship is Russia, Novak deputy prime minister on the ground here in Europe to talk to his, I suppose his cohort of like-minded people, is how do you re-grasp the nettle in a market when you're dealing with a series of literally unknowns? Why would the price cap work? What impact will it have? The red headline on the Bloomberg terminal was very clear from Alexander Novak deputy prime minister of Russia. Production will drop. My question in the back of my mind who's going to fill the gap? Let's listen to Novak's first take on caps. Indeed, there have been two important decisions taken today. One, you have already mentioned and that is the decision on cutting quotas by all countries present and by all countries in the group. But the second decision, which is just as important as the first one, is actually the extension of the declaration of cooperation, because it was scheduled to expire at the end of 22. But now it has been agreed that it will be extended until the end of 2023, which gives the market significantly more certainty and significantly more predictability. And that's why decision was taken to balance the market out by these cuts by cuts versus quotas of August. And especially this is a very important ahead of the winter season when we would also see the seasonal decline demand by 2.5 to 3 million barrels. And this decision which has been made today helps the market to balance it out. I think it's a very weighted decision at a time, everyone. Let's look towards February 2023. You will have more sanctions we assume. You will potentially have a price cap. Can you tell me with a surety what your production in February 2023 will be? You said 92, 93% for 2023. But is that the worst case scenario by February with more sanctions on the price cap? So, the sanctions as we're seeing creates a very bad precedent and will primarily hit the ones who are actually doing it and the ones who are implementing it. So, and history has a countless number of examples.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,81,2022-10-06 05:36:18
11856," We'll primarily hit the ones who are actually doing it and the ones who are implementing it. We know and history has a countless number of examples of when market interference, especially with the mechanism of price controls, can only lead to a deficit of certain goods. This mechanism is unacceptable to Russia. And if it is implemented, we are not going to supply countries which join this mechanism. So Danny, you know, the whole essence of price caps from the EU are going to lead to a deficit. Who's going to fill that gap? That is the big question as OPEC Plus goes into cutting mode. I think a number of other messages came through. It's about the extension of the cooperation agreement through next year. So that shows you there's a solidarity between OPEC and OPEC Plus. That is not going to dissipate a challenge, no fact. In terms of will you cut the gas flow off through the Ukraine? I pushed him and pushed him. Go listen to the interview. Again, it was about delivering the standard kind of answers, but was it on the table? It's certainly not top of their agenda. That was the one upside that I took away from it. But that's for the House of Sard. Preemptive, proactive. That's what his role in Hainan. That was the message he wanted to convey. But, Manus, I mean, you teased me. You teased our viewers with the political drama. Take us into it. What has been unfolding since this decision? Yeah. I was sitting in the bunker sort of in there last night and then suddenly this thing led up. It's attached to my hand as you know. I mean, I can't go anywhere without it. And it was the Jake Sullivan. The president is unhappy. Biden sees these cuts as unnecessary. But the Jake Sullivan. The Jake Sullivan memo is incredibly interesting because I think it brings to play, you know, my favorite word, trifecta. So what it brings into play, there's a kid going to school. He's not going to get there. Go on. What you've got is the risk of exports being stymied. You have the risk of no peck, which is the ability, if it goes through Congress, to suicide, sovereign nation, who's potentially a part of OPEC. That's the real issue at play. And the third and more important issue is, of course, the air of the president, the unnecessary of these cuts. So the White House, not only were panicking yesterday, according to rapid in energy, but we're nice seeing really a very, very fierce pushback by the White House. And I just wonder where this will escalate to or can it be de-escalated. Let's listen to his Royal Highness Prince of Dulles. He's been some man on his take on yesterday's proceedings. We wanted to give the market a clear direction, a clear input. That's why we extended the agreement to end of 23, but we still have the same tools in our kit, you know, guidance to the market is crucial. Because without guidance, people would not invest, would not feel safe that they could invest. However, we still have the tools in our kit, we still, yes, we reduce the amount of meeting, we reduce the amount of overall expectations, of doing something, but we still maintain the same flexibility. We still have each two every two months, we will have a GMMC. That GMMC is warranted the authority to have more than a meeting in every two months. It also was given the authority to call for a conference meeting if necessity dictates. Part of the toolkit and the Kingdom has often done this, which is led from the front and gone with voluntary cuts or ads to do the right thing to write the market. Did you consider a voluntary additional cut for society? Well, at this time now, there is no requirement for it. I think, amongst us, we sought out a good deed. Certainly, we had to be very practical, given the situation prevailing in some countries that are not able to produce their allocated.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,82,2022-10-06 05:40:40
11857," To be very practical, given the situation prevailing in some countries that are not able to produce their allocated voluntary volumes, and because of that we are elected to go for a bigger number, but in the final analysis it will be a smaller number but certainly a significant number and therefore it is sufficient for now. I think it is very clear, his Royal Highness sees two-way risk and a preparedness. The word in the news conference or the press conference was tweak. You know he pushed back, this is an ice-ed, this is the first of a series of jumbo cuts and he really wanted to push back on that narrative with me as we sat down Danny. I got a wonder, Goldman Sachs, they have this note on it, I am sure you saw two Jeff Curry and team labeling this OPEC plus takes on the Fed. I mean if we have oil at $100 a barrel or higher because of this cut, what does that mean for the Fed, for inflation, for this macro environment we are in? Shall we go for a shameless plug? Why not? If you go on your list and the whole interview on my Twitter or on Blinberg.com, let's go with the global brand. It is very clear which is, it is a risk, it is this balancing act, his Royal Highness makes the point, look, I said, surely you just got a fuel inflation, we are up 9% in three days, everything the central banks have been trying to undo and his point to me was, well, the central bank policies have been going after inflation at the cost, any cost to growth and this is the conundrum isn't it? You know, you add 10% of the oil prices, you refuel the inflation narrative but his point to me was, is that central banks and many would say from a macro point of view are absolutely correct. They will not stop until the job is done in stymine inflation and with that in mind there's a cost to growth and that is a huge risk, along with the dollar, strength of the dollar, macro rates all played into this conversation. Manas, I just want to leave it off on this, I know you're probably feeling the cold especially from your Dubai but you know, Muhammad, our producer tells me it's going to be up to 23 degrees there in Vienna, you're basically in summer weather, Manas, you can ditch this scarf. You mean I won't get to wear the coat, you mean I won't get to wear the coat on the scarf all day. Honestly, it's too fashionable, keep it on, it's fine, it's worth it. Such great stuff. Let me just plug it for you again, go to Manas' Twitter, go to Bloomberg.com, watch the interviews, really great stuff, huge implications. Thank you so much. Looking forward to you back in the driver's seat here, let's get back to these markets, let's start with that oil market because we saw all of the implications, all of the fallout from this, we saw oil, it's basically hanging tight but again, we've seen a monster rally of 6.5%. So perhaps not unsurprising, we're hanging around 93.5 dollars a barrel. Ten year yields, those did perk up yesterday in response to this inflationary output of higher oil prices. We were at about 3.6% yesterday, so we stand at 3.7% in some change that we are looking at a drop of about two basis points. Bloomberg Dollar Spot, that's weaker this morning, that's allowing equities to rally. We are doing a little bit of repositioning ahead of a Friday, NFP report, that payroll report, going to be pretty consequential for the Fed, our cracks showing in this labor market, are they going to have to keep hiking rates until they are, there are cracks, so we see a rally continuing in US futures in European futures. I don't have them here for you at the moment, but European futures up more than 1%. There we go, TV magic, European futures up 1.4%. Well, coming up, we're going to talk Twitter, Elon Musk's deposition in the Twitter lawsuit, it appears to be on ice. All the details for you next. This is Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,83,2022-10-06 05:45:17
11858," Music Recently, cryptocurrencies have been very popular. If a client came to you and said, look, I'd like some cryptocurrencies in my portfolio, what would you say? We've actually been really deep into crypto, deep into learning about blockchain and all of the new businesses. I would characterize this as crypto learners. We have made a series of to hold investments on behalf of our clients, both in some of the currency baskets as well as with some venture firms that are investing primarily in the crypto area. I think it has the potential to be completely game changing, but it is still such the wild west and so it's so uncertain. But it has the potential to completely upend everything. Elon Musk and Twitter are said to have agreed to postpone the billionaire's deposition that was set to take place later today. It follows must dramatic U-turn to revive his $44 billion offer for the social media platform. We're joined by Richard Windsor, founder of Radio Free Mobile to get into this. Richard, I want to start here. Musk meets so much noise about trying to get out of this deal whether it be bots or whistle blovers. What do you make of him all of a sudden just surrendering unconditionally? Well, I think what's happened is that as it happens in many legal cases is that the initial, you know, something has happened that has matured weakened his negotiating position and he's either come to the conclusion or been advised that he's going to lose and the best option for him now is just to go through on the deal that he originally made. That's what I suspect has actually happened. I don't think particularly he's had a change of heart. I think he's always wanted to buy it. It was more about the fact that his timing wasn't great because the minute he bid $44 billion, the bottom fell out of the technology market and he thought maybe I should have paid less. Well to that point, so in the letter that Musk lawyers sent to, filed with the SEC, sent to the team at Twitter. So two things jumped out to me, really short letter, but one of them basically saying that him buying the company, it's contingent on two things. I want to start with one of them. One of them is that provided the Delaware Chancellor Record enter an immediate stay of the action and adjourn the trial and all other proceedings related to closing the order. So kind of going to what you're saying before the court case, closing this thing up so he does buy it. But I wonder, is there a risk which Richard in which they closed the deal, this stops so the purchase can continue, but then he doesn't go through with it. If that makes sense. So trial stops and then Musk box out. Is that a risk here? This is an indication of how little trust there is between the two sides. Because obviously Twitter think that's exactly what he's trying to do, which is why they are trying to back down every or close, every potential exit for him, which he could somehow wiggle out of paying the price that he agreed to pay. So I think that's really what's going on here. I think the fact that he has pretty much uncategorically caved into the demands that he buys the company for $44 billion kind of indicates how weak his current legal position is. And frankly, I'm not surprised. I always thought he was going to lose the case. Yeah, you have been saying that for some time.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,84,2022-10-06 05:49:20
11859," or billion kind of indicates how weak his current legal position is. And frankly, I'm not surprised. I always thought he was going to lose the case. Yeah, you have been saying that for some time, Richard. So you can take a victory lap with us. That's fine. I want to bring you to the other thing, though. That was in that same sentence that I just showed you. The other thing closing the steal is predicated on. He says that it's predicated on pending receipt of proceeds of the debt financing. Richard, this is a bond market, a high yield bond market, which has essentially been frozen. Banks really struggling to offload LBO debt. What's the likelihood that Morgan Stanley and friends are able to actually put together a debt package for him? Is this a big risk to the deal going through? I don't think so. I think the problem he's going to have is that the deal is going to be much more expensive. If you put it together six months ago, or five months ago, when he originally announced it, interest rates were considerably lower, and the market was considerably more willing to take on risk. And so from that perspective, he could have got it away more easily and at a lower price. Now, he's going to have to pay a hard... I think that there's plenty of cash out there willing to be deployed. It's just the willingness of that cash to pay high valuations or receive a low yield has gone away. And so basically, I think the deal will get done. It's just going to be a lot more expensive than it was. I mean, how much appetite is there going to be for this? Considering we just had a starting since late April, when he backed out of the deal, or whenever that was, of course, he'd agreed to the deal. In April, we've just had Musk non-stop just sparinging Twitter. I mean, who's going to want to A, buy the debt, or B, join Elon Musk in committing equity to this? Well, I mean, let's be fair to Twitter. I mean, Twitter is utterly dominant in its space. It monetizes quite effectively what it does. There has been outside of just that little space that it does, and it has a highly engaged user base. So there is potential value there. The question is, is the, you know, Twitter's management for a decade have failed to expand it effectively? Can Mr. Musk pull it off? I got to bring you a quote from John McLean. I just love this. He's a manager at Brandywine saying, it's similar to a vegetarian going to a steakhouse very limited appetite. So he might disagree with you that anyone wants it. But, Mr. to that point of Twitter, the successfulness of the app, I was asking you this in the break. What's going on with Elon Musk and the everything app? How does that apply to Twitter? What would it mean? Does it change Twitter? Does it compete with Twitter? I don't totally understand. OK, so the financial problem that Mr. Musk has, is he's paying according to some people, including myself, probably three times more than what Twitter is worth. So somehow he's got to prove or create value inside Twitter that would justify the $54.20. Now, one of the ways one could do that is to expand the appeal of Twitter. You know, there's much more to the digital ecosystem, just micro-blogging. There's video, there's social networking, there's instant messaging, there's news, there's podcasts. There's all kinds of things that you could do. Could it, basically, it would mean Twitter's use to spend more time engaged within the Twitter property, and that would increase the value? The idea behind the super app is a bit like 10 cents WeChat. We know WeChat started off as a bit like WhatsApp or Telegram. And now you can do everything on it. In China, you can buy a train ticket, it's your cinema tickets, you can pay people and so on and so forth. The idea, I think, behind the super app is to do exactly that. And quite frankly, if he's ever going to justify a $54 price tag, this is exactly what he has today. Okay, Richard, I'm afraid we're going to have to leave it there. Thank you so much for joining us this morning and waking up early. Richard Windsor, there's a founder of Radio Free Mobile. Coming up, investors are off-loading Italian bonds at the fastest pace since the pandemic for a struck. That all follows a warning from Moody's about the nation's finances.

11860," Down fold fold down those 1, 6 1 11 Min USC 씨 conta Smith please сем Why is everybody want to be a consultant and what are all these consultants doing? Well David, I think that we actually defy the label consultant because sometimes consultant seems to imply that we only give advice and when you look at what Accenture does we're really different than the traditional version of a consultant. We're really about relevance and results and that's what is driving our business. What about a consulting project? In my example on the CEO I have a problem I call you up I say solve my problem or give me a solution. We don't operate as big companies permanently in crisis mode and so when you think about like how long does it solve things a lot of it starts with you know the company being willing to set aggressive goals and so what we are trying to do now is work with our clients to work differently and to work faster. Let's talk about Italian bond risk and to do that let's bring in Bloomberg's market editor Valerie Taitel. Valerie you flagged the story to me this morning and so let's go over some of the risks that perhaps are leading to the drama so you flagged me we had ECB ECB's Fabio Panetta there were hopes that perhaps you'd join as the finance chief of Italy that's not happening we also had Moody's morning as well on their finances. Yeah exactly and then thirdly we had the bi-monthly release of the PPP holdings from the ECB. Now these showed reduced support for BTPs over the month of August and September now give you some background we know that PPP purchases ended in March of this year but there is flexibility in how they reinvest the dividends until the end of March 2024 sorry the end of 2024 now you would think that in in a period of volatility which we had this summer where Italian yields rose 150 basis points maybe they would use that kind of flexibility that was given to them to support BTPs to support their bond market but but that was clearly not the case and that's just our this most recent month right before that they they have been helping Italy out exactly yes they had been reversal that yes so they had been you could say diverting funds away from northern European countries and and putting it a bit more into reinvesting in southern European countries so okay tomorrow yesterday rather not tomorrow my days are mixed up yesterday we have the confluence of these risks you have Panetta not joining you have Moody's warning on the new government and then the pet holdings are lower and then we get this blow out yes and I want to do that I want to show you on the next chart how pivotal this was for me please so the 10-year-old jumped nearly 30 basis points the largest jump since the beginning of the pandemic and it's the second largest jump since March 12th 2020 that was after Lagarde said her famous quotes I'm not here to close spreads so it was quite a big move and I think a lot of this was it was kind of overshadowed by by the dealings with OPEC yesterday as you and Manas have been talking about but but this move it's large 10-year yields in Italy are nearing 4.5 percent jet debt to GDP metrics with this new government coming to place are in focus and then today at 12 30 we have the ECB minutes yeah investors are going to be highly attuned to any comments on QT QT discussions within",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,86,2022-10-06 05:58:05
11861, to place our in focus. And then today at 12.30 we have the ECB minutes. Yeah. Investors are going to be highly attuned to any comments on QT. QT discussions within within the set within the central bank. Maybe something they could roll up before the end of the year. But I mean they do have this this program the TPI program to help in these cases. Could they just be transitioning from PEP help to that program? It's still very vague the the metrics by which they would activate this TPI program. But one of them is they need to see a sustainable debt debt metrics within a country. That does look. And with this new government and it's pulling this all under huge focus now for Italy's bond market. Exactly. A big old question mark put on this bond market. Valerie thanks so much for walking us through that. Valerie Taito there are markets editor. Well that's it for Bloomberg Daybreak. Markets is up next. This is Bloomberg. So as you look back on your career what would you say is the best investment advice you've ever received? Probably the best investment advice that I never received. But that I've lived my whole life around is surround yourself with really good people. I thought about it just today like I do many times you know what makes a great investor. A great investment firm is comprised of people who are optimists and pessimists and realists. Because in the intersection of the debates that go across that wide range of personalities is where you find truth. It's part of the reason I'm so focused on freedom of expression. I see it my own four walls the robust and fulsome debates around how we commit our capital. What defines a good idea? What businesses to build or pursue? That's what drives the success at Citadel. And I've been very fortunate in life to have always had a group of friends who really push me who make me better. And here I get to work with three and a half thousand colleagues who in their ways make me better each and every day and collectively as a team we've had the opportunity to have an incredible impact on the financial landscape around the world. Everything you need to get set for the start of U.S. trading. Bloomberg the open with Jonathan Terrell. Drilling down in the numbers and preparing you as only Bloomberg can weekdays on Bloomberg. Good morning. Welcome to Bloomberg Market to Europe. I'm Anna Edwards live in London. The cash trade is just less than an hour away. Here are your top headlines.

Energy Discord, as OPEC plus unites, EU chief First-of-Live underlion tries to rally the block behind a limit on gas prices after taking action on oil. European leaders meet in Prague today. Plus, pivot, what pivot? Fed officials continue to pour cold water on prospects for a quick policy turn. Mary Daily tells Bloomberg there's a high bar for any change. Good morning everybody. Welcome to the program. Let's get straight to some breaking news, shall we? Or in fact, we are waiting for some breaking news on the German economy. Now here it is. Factory orders falling by 4.1% year on year. The estimate was for a drop of 5.5%. The August factory orders number then, month on month, falling 2.4%. The estimate was for a drop of 0.7%. So a bit of conflict, perhaps, between what is being signaled by that month on month versus year on year number. But if we focus on the month on month, a drop of 2.4% is much bigger than the estimate of a less than 1% drop. This is a volatile data setting. It is just one month's worth of data. But the number last month was down by more than 1%. And of course, there's a lot of concern going into the winter about the state. A German manufacturing and the factory sector. And so we'll certainly get to a conversation about that with Karsson Brezki, who joins us a little bit later on in the program. But, says, and perhaps gloomy news coming through on where we are on the German economy, the Euro trading at 0.9920. So actually gaining full tenths of a percent in this morning's session. Now, we're just under an hour away from the start of cash equity trading here in Europe. Let's have a look at the future's picture. We've got futures pointing higher, actually, and quite substantially so here in Europe, just to recap, we were down in the European session by more than 1% on stocks 50. So perhaps we have a little bit of catching up to do because the US session went from a negative picture to actually reclaiming some of that ground. And later in the day, or certainly from lunchtime onwards, rally in the United States. And that means that there's a little bit of a gap to be closed by the European equity markets on the US side of things, though that that rally looks to continue. So US futures point higher by half a percent on E-minis Nasdaq features up by 7 cents of 1%. So the US raised its losses in session despite the fact that we saw higher energy prices for a third day because of those moves that in the USA and with LPEC plus, the energy names help to drive some of that. But if we look of the GMM, you can see where we're picking up that fairly bullish theme, when it comes to equity trading in Asia, the KOSPI, the Nikkei, the Sensorix, all trading higher. slightly strangely bullish, perhaps, given the dynamics we're dealing with at the moment. Perhaps the way that the oil price is playing out in markets, perhaps, there are different ways to interpret that right now. We'll get into that conversation a little bit later on, but the markets said to say in the short term, feeling fairly bullish despite higher energy prices of late. So that's where we are on the GMM. Let's talk about those oil prices. Oil prices are trading higher this morning or at least have been pretty flat on Brent right now. After an action packed 24 hours, OPEC Plus agreed to cut its collective output by 2 million barrels per day, the most in two years. Although the move may not hit oil supply by quite that much, it does have implications in the energy war between Washington and Moscow that Saudi Arabia is willing to help Putin rather than Biden. We have so many uncertainties. They helps the market to balance it out. I think it's a very weighted decision at a time, D1. While we were disappointed that OPEC made this decision, as the president mentioned, we think it's unnecessary. I don't want people to think that this is one way to speak. Let's head to Vienna where Bloomberg's Manus Grannie is standing by. Let's start with the rally in prices then because this has been a multi-day trend sort of in anticipation of what was going to happen where you are in Vienna. So we've seen this rally in prices. Some people though questioning just how much of a cut will actually see though and therefore how much of a sustained impulse we see on prices. Good morning, Anna. You're absolutely correct. You know, if we sort of stand back for a moment and go two million, the blockbuster headline, but of course it's a paper cut, but it's about direction. It's about clarity and confidence. That's what they wanted to intimate in that House of Central Banking behind me for oil. So it was about the messaging, his Royal Highness, Prince of Dulles, there's been some man talking about prudence, talking about preemptive moves. So that was about the messaging. I asked him was this the first of a series of jumbo cuts that could come from the centre of Bangkok?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,88,2022-10-06 06:07:31
11863," students talking about preemptive moves. So that was about the messaging. I asked him was this the first of a series of jumbo cuts that could come from the central bank of oil. And he sort of played that down. So this is about delivering confidence and continuity. But my gosh, we're in for a level of conflict, aren't we? Between here and the White House, between Riyadh, Moscow, along with a number of other states and the US. So Anna, there's a number of issues here. For the central bank of oil, I think it was about the messaging of ready to do more. They painted it up as being the global economic situation. But politics, it really does matter, Anna. And of course, the price caps are critically important as well. And this is what Alexander Novak put into context, the risk to the market and supply from Russia on caps. So, such actions, as we're seeing, creates, I mean, either price cap creates a very bad precedent. And we'll primarily hit the ones who are actually doing it and the ones who are implementing it. We know and history has a countless number of examples of when market interference, especially with the mechanism of price controls, can only lead to a deficit of a certain good is that this mechanism is unacceptable to Russia. And if it is implemented, we are not deploying the two sublime countries which join this mechanism. Alexander Novak, they're talking about the uncertainty. I'm just looking at the oil brief today and again, the lack of details, the lack of clarity, not my words. But those are Prince of Dulles, there's been Salman. But Anna, my gosh, we're in for a bumpy ride where the White House, aren't we? Yeah, absolutely. Let's turn to that next, then, to geopolitics. I think that's one of the things that I think is that the US has a very bad idea of this, man, is Saudi Arabia's top oil official is saying that the US led plans for a price cap on Russian exports, that that was something that added to the market's uncertainties. How is the geopolitics of this playing out? I was sitting in the bunker last night, and suddenly pop, pop, pop, pop. It was, you know, Jake Sullivan's memo from the White House, Biden sees this, cut as a necessary one to see more detail. Then, Jake Sullivan got punching stuff, which is, you know, this is a disappointment and putting out there on the table, the SPR, the Special Petroleum Reserve, released, there would be more of that to come. That's where it's almost like a young and a young, you know, you want to cut by two million? I'll see you and raise you. I've got an SPR, and I will release more if I have to. But there's much, much more potent part of this, is the prospect of no-peck, which is the ability of Congress to churn on the members of OPEC. His Royal Highness likes to keep the market outing like hell. Of course, no-peck could cause a bit of an outch for the whole of OPEC. Let's listen in to what his Royal Highness had to say about the prospect of volatility in this market and his take on yesterday's proceedings. I don't want people to think that this is one way street. In this case, no, it's a variety of converting uncertainties and they could go a stray altogether into the positive side or to the negative side, or it could be a combination. And as the central banker of oil, of course we got into the weeds about, you know, they are raising rates. I said, you're fueling the inflation debate again. You're refueling the inflation narrative and he said, Manus, he said, central banks are so focused on taming inflation. They are prepared to raise rates and almost at growth at any cost, you know, hitting growth at any cost. So the strength of the dollar, federal reserve, MPC, BIOJ, central banks raising rates, it all came into play in that conversation. Anna. Yeah, really interesting. The central banker, Voila, up against the more conventional central banks there. Manus, thank you very much, Manus Kranik joining us there from Vienna with the latest on the complexities and the developments around oil. Let us get a Bloomberg first Web news update. Alice Akin joins us with the latest on our top stories. Good morning, Alice. Morning, Anna. Ursula Wunderline is proposing that the EU intervenes in the gas market to cap rising costs.

11864," It's proposing that the EU intervenes in the gas market to cap rising costs. The Commission President's plan includes a temporary price limit on the Dutch benchmark gas price which is used for all gas traded in Europe. Wonderlijn contends the price no longer reflects the blocs energy reality and the rapidly shrinking share of gas from Russia. The World Trade Organisation says global trade will slow next year as major economies face strong headwinds. The WTO forecast global goods trade will now grow by 1% next year, a big revision on its previous estimate of 3.4%. It blamed a cocktail of factors including rising prices, restricted energy supplies and growing US China tensions. North Korea has five two suspected short-range ballistic missiles towards waters where a US aircraft carrier had been deployed, making a total of 10 launches in less than two weeks. That's one of its biggest test for arges under leader Kim Jong-un. The firings came shortly after Pyongyang condemned the Biden administration for escalating tensions. And Kim Charles III is expected to be crowned on June 3rd next year in a ceremony at Westminster Abbey. Bloomberg has learned that British officials are converging on that date, although talks are still ongoing. The coronation, almost 70 years after his mother was crowned, will form the centrepiece of days of celebration to mark the beginning of the monarch's reign. Global news, 20,000 days on air and on Bloomberg, take part by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. This is Bloomberg, Anna. Thanks very much, Alice Atkins, in London. Coming up, it's been a wild first month for Lissrosse's government and for UK assets, with £300 billion wiped from the combined value of the nation's stock and bond markets will have more on the investment case around the UK later. Up next, more Fed speakers, Paul Coldwater on hopes of an early, duffish pivot. We'll discuss that and plenty more with Kastan Breski, who joins us from IMG shortly. If you have any questions for our guests, then please do send them to us. IB Plus, CV Go. That's the function to use on your Bloomberg. This is Bloomberg. China's military power has been growing at an incredible speed over the last 20 years. A strong country must have a strong military, as only then can it guarantee the security of the nation. In terms of sphere of influence, we absolutely know that China wants to be dominant in Asia. So there is a target to get to that point, to be a military that is a peer to the greatest militaries in the world by 2035. The competition for influence is a global one. And through a multi-decade trajectory fueled by planning, money, and pragmatism, China is building a military that allows it to shape the 21st century just as the US shaped the decade. I'd like to reach a point where a policy is moderately restrictive, somewhere between four and a four and a half percent by the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,90,2022-10-06 06:15:20
11865," I'd like to reach a point where policy is moderately restrictive, somewhere between four and a four and a half percent by the end of this year, and then hold at that level and see how the economy and prices react. I don't see that happening at all. I see us as raising to a level that we believe is restrictive enough to bring inflation down, and then holding it there until we see inflation truly get close to two percent and demonstrate that price stability is restored. FOMC members, Mary Daley and Raphael Bostic, they're saying that the Fed is unlikely to cut rates next year. That's as trade is best on at least one reduction in 2020-03. Let's bring in Kastan Breski, ING's chief economist who joins us now and global head of macro. Kastan, great to have you with us. Perhaps our conversations around a pivot from the Fed are a little too binary, and I wonder if you can explain what a meaningful pivot will look like to you, Kastan. Some people seem to be talking about stopping hiking so much, others are talking about stopping hiking and others are talking about cuts. And depending on what your interpretation of the word pivot is, you can get to a different time horizon. So what are you thinking about? I think you're going to have very long pivot, isn't it? For us, the pivot really would be stop hiking rates. There's not going to come now, but this should come at the end of the year. I think when you look at what happened this week, elsewhere, we had the reserve bank of Australia yesterday already signaled a kind of pivot only hiking by 25 basis points. We had the polar central bank, which actually stopped hiking interest rates. So if you look very closely around the globe, we already do see that some central banks are at least slowing down the pace of tightening or even stopping it. So for the fact, what is the pivot means bringing an end to the hiking cycle, and we think that's going to happen already at the end of this year? OK. And for them to pivot in any way, Kastan, they might have to see signs of the labour market turning of inflation data coming down a little. We talked a little on the programme yesterday about whether the Fed was going to be able to weigh down sufficiently on inflation or whether something else in the economy might break first. And if financial fragility might get in the way of the Fed's tightening plans, is that something that you're thinking about? We are definitely watching it at financial stability is clearly an issue. But I think we can view it as a couple. Housing, but an enormous, importantly, a role in the inflation index in the US. And with mortgage rates, north of 6%, I think it's just a matter of time before we see house prices coming down, and this would then also lead to a very significant drop in headland inflation in the US. I think of the strong dollar. Strong dollar should also help bring down inflation in the US. So I think that we will see a headland inflation in the US coming down much faster than we will see it coming down in the eurozone. And this should help the Fed actually then justify this pivot at the end of the year. OK. That's interesting. So we're going to see a headland inflation, the various measures of it. And some people are suggesting there are signs that it's peaking, others saying all these price pressures they really do persist in the US. Let me ask you about what you think the impact of oil prices is going to be here. Because we've seen action being taken by OPEC plus, and yes, that looks as if it lifts oil prices, or it has at least in the run up to that meeting. Others say, no, well, they won't cut really by that much. So it's not going to, it's more of a geopolitical story than it is an economic story. How do you work in what we've heard from OPEC plus what that does to oil prices? And therefore, what impact that has on inflation? Well, it definitely is a geopolitical story because it also shows that OPEC plus is signing along with Russia in this war, new friends. That is a very important signal that OPEC plus sent to the world. And what we actually do, we have to take the announcement that will be cut for granted. So this means that we're going to see higher oil prices than you're fully right. This means that in the US, the impact of lower oil prices, we just had over the last couple of weeks, will be offset. And it could mean that at least the energy price component might stay high for a bit longer. But well, don't forget, I think it was the biggest chunk of the inflationary pressure in the US comes from halving. And now we could see a reversal of very quickly.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,91,2022-10-06 06:19:56
11866," Well, don't forget, I think you were the biggest chunk of the inflationary pressure in the US comes from housing. And there we could see a reversal very quickly. OK, so we're reversing on the housing impulse. Carson, thank you. Stay with us. Carson Breschi, ING Chief Economist and Global Head of Macro, saying with us a little bit longer on the program, we'll get his insights into Europe next. Coming up, the president of the European Commission calls for a price cap on Russian gas as dozens of European leaders more broad than the EU gather for a summit in Prague. More on that next, this is Glingberg. How much of a push have you seen from the Kishita government in terms of green funding? The Kishita administration has committed to doubling the amount of investments in so-called green technologies. I think we need more than just pronouncements. We need real money backing, very innovative startups and innovative companies in this space. What do you make of Kishita's new capitalism? I think he is framework is reflective of the challenges that Japan society is facing, namely that growth has been present, but growth has not been, of course, evenly distributed. But frankly speaking, it's hard to register the income if you don't have a income to begin with. If the government and private sector can work together and collaborate to drive more innovative growth startups, that can really drive the income growth. The Kishita government needs to redistribute. Welcome back to Bloomberg Market. You're up for 40 minutes until the start of cash equity is trading. The future picture actually looks pretty bright. The US future picture looks bright also not as bright as the European story. In fact, the European story has come off earlier highs, but we do see some gains at the start of the European trading day catching up with the US story of yesterday. Now, the leaders of 44 countries are gathering in Prague for an extraordinary summit in the shadows of the war in Ukraine. For European leaders, the focus is still firmly on energy, this as Russia warns against price caps in a Bloomberg TV interview. Furthermore, let's talk to Bloomberg's Maria today who's covering the meeting in Prague. And we're saying again, Maria, this is a broader than just EU meeting, isn't it? More than 40 countries, as I was saying, they're not just those in the European Union, but the EU commission leader, Ursula von Delaian, has been making waves by calling for a price cap on gas. There's division even within the EU on this, though. So is this going to happen? Well, Anna, she has, and this is a letter that she sent yesterday to the EU 27 governments in which the head of the commission says the Dutch benchmark, the TTTF, no longer reflects the real price of gas. So as a European energy market transitions away from it, she says she's now in favor of a temporary price cap. The problem, Anna, and this is fundamentally the issue, is that there is a number of options in terms of this price cap. What does it look? Well, right now, there's at least five options on the table. You could argue they're just going to cap potentially Russian gas. Will it be all imported gas into the European Union? And this is about separating the gas that gets you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,92,2022-10-06 06:24:06
11867," Well, you could argue they're just going to cap potentially Russian gas. Will it be all imported gas into the European Union? Is this about separating the gas that gets used to make electricity? Is there something similar to what the Spanish already do? And that is a fundamental issue. They all agree prices need to come down ahead of the winter, but the formula, the magic formula for 27 countries. There's still fire away from it. And I hear her today, Anna. We are not any closer, any closer than we were yesterday, to a consensus. The idea that by tomorrow, they could announce a price cap and being told is very premature purely because they have not decided on a formula yet. And Germany has been opposed to such an idea. Maria, thank you very much. Maria, today, I'm joining us there from Prague, where that wider European meeting is set to take place. Karsten Brezki, I and G.T. for economy is still with us. Let's pivot to Germany then, Karsten. And what you're hearing, I suppose, from a German perspective. But thinking across Europe, what are the policy options that you think we're going to see here? Germany's tried to take its own independent action, that's been criticized by some other countries in the European Union. So what happens next from here, do you think? Well, what happens? I think we will see more national and fiscal stimulus measures. And I hope that we'll also get some coordination at the European level. This is how it very often works. So there has to be a common agreement at the European level, like Maria just said, on the price cap. Apparently, it's not going to come this week. But there should be some principles, some common guidelines that we don't have. We cannot have different price cap measures across the country or across the region. We look at Germany. There are a lot of discussion has to on this 200 billion Euro package. I think also when you look at the details, it is not really 200 billion Euro. It is up to 200 billion Euro. It is very often a bit of window dressing, using already announced measures, put it in this package. It's also spread over two years. But what it means to be able to do is again, that the German government, even though it's very pro-European government, that sets a message to the rest of Europe, that it is Germany first and Europe second. And that is not a very good message to government sense. Right. So that's what's causing waves in Brussels. Mr. Germany has been proposed to the idea of a cap on gas prices. Do you understand why what would be best for the German economy? Well, for the German economy, we definitely need so many supporters and we need the cap on gas prices and the government already announced the cap on electricity prices. It also announced, actually, that needs the intention to come up with a price cap on gas prices. So I don't know what it is they're currently still proposing. problem is that they even in their own government, even Jeremy, they cannot agree on what kind of price cat for gas prices they really want to decide on. So is it going to be a base on last year's consumption? Is it going to be a cat at a certain amount? Is it going to be a certain price? So the devil, I saw in the detail here. I think what is very clear that the Jeremy government is heading into a very severe wintery recession and we're going to see more fiscal support on it, and then the whole thing. OK, Carlson, so that's Germany. Let me pivot to Italy with you. We've seen yields going higher on Italian debt products. And there was a warning from Moody's yesterday flagging policy risks attached to the new right-wing coalition. The ECB is also preparing to talk about QT, and that can sometimes be something that spooks the Italian bond market. What are your concerns around Italy? Well, first of all, we really need to wait until the new government has been set up as we see that it's going to take a while. And then the biggest concern is that the new government will not be compliant with previous European agreements. Because this would then also stop the from ever triggering TPI for Italy. So the next detail of the new economic government needs to stay within compliant with all the fiscal rules with the already existing national reform programs. So if this remains the case, then I think we don't have an issue with Italy. If Italy diverts from this path, and for example, goes to Germany, saying, well, all of a sudden, we now need big, faceless stimulus. Well, that will have an issue. OK, Carlson, really interesting points. I think I can take one more journey into the current context that we decided all of a sudden that weБ decided right alone and that MASAME will take almost everything across the new country. But the view clearly rests, and you probably will never see the full situationD",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,93,2022-10-06 06:29:36
11868," from this path and broke down with those to Germany saying well all of a sudden the amount of big things to stick with what that we have an issue. Okay, Karsten really interesting point to leave the conversation on. Thank you very much. Karsten Breschki, I and G's Chief Economist Apologies for some issues with the sound there. But I think we got to most of what Karsten was trying to communicate. We'll get back to oil and that story shortly. Oil prices extend there rally after opact class defies Washington agreeing to its biggest production cards in at some two years. That's up next. This is Bloomberg. So, the 700th anniversary of Dante Allegheri's death has triggered the work of many institutions and offered a very rich schedule of events. Today in Santa Crochet we present one of these projects which has offered a difficult start because COVID-19 has stopped the project that was shared by the opera de Santa Crochet by the Franciscan community from Florence Municipality and the fun for religious building of the internal minister. Today Felice Limousani's project is finally enjoyable. In the Pazi Chapel, the marvelous architecture by Felipo Brunolessi, the most important images from the divine comedy created by the French illustrator Gustaf Dore. Through these images we can live the violent emotions of hell, the weight of purgatory and the sublime joy of paradise. The digital humanities are a cultural occasion to exploit. Summing up, it's about merging humanistic disciplines with new technologies. I find this to be an innovating and modern tool to update culture. Cultural heritage becomes something to hand over to the new generations and not to be put aside. So it's about using technology, pixels, and binary code with the human and humanizing content.

11869," Welcome back to the program everybody. Let's have a quick look at the futures picture then because we are half an hour away from the start of the European trading session and the European futures picture looks positive. We've got European futures moving higher this morning, but I should say off earlier highs. So the DAX features up by 8% of 1% CAQ features up by 7% of 1%. We have been a little higher than that earlier on in the day. And this is all to do with the fact that yesterday the European stocks lost more than 1% on the stocks 50. The US managed to close the day pretty strongly a rally that lasted much of the day. In fact, unwinding the earlier losses. I mean, to factor some of that in to the start of our European trading day. So we will do that. No doubt. So the futures picture looks broadly positive. Let's dive into some charts though now and to do that, let's think about the FX markets. We're joined by my colleague, Mark said it said Valerie Titell, Valerie, good to see you this morning. So we've seen world currency reserves shrink by a record $1 trillion. That's the sort of headline story. The calculations that Bloomberg has been doing. Some are saying this is some kind of canary in the coal mine. Why is this grabbing so much attention? Great. Thank you, Anna. I've got a chart which I think encapsulates why this time it's a little bit different. This is a chart with these white bars of quarterly change in global currency reserves. And this blue line is the Bloomberg dollar spot index. So if we just look at what's happened recently, we've had a huge strength thing in the US dollar and a dwindling of foreign currency reserves. This reflects countries like the Czech Republic, India, intervening in their FX markets to support their currencies. Now, if we take a step back and compare this last time, we had a stress like this in 2008, for example, countries across the globe, or foreign currency reserves across the globe had already been built up. You can almost picture it like their war chests were ready. We had the slowdown that 2008 brought. We had the Fed releasing dollar liquidity into the market via their dollar swap lines. And then after that, we saw the dollar, we saw the dollar retrace. It's almost like they had enough fodder in their back pocket to weather this crisis. Now, if we take what Mary Daily told us yesterday that it's a very high bar for the Fed to pivot here, they're not done with their inflation fight. You look at this and you think their war chests are already depleted. The dollar might not be peaking, and this might come back to haunt them. Because foreign governments and foreign central banks need these currency reserves. Because what happens when, for instance, a bank within their economy or a large corporation, all of a sudden needs some dollar funding. And then they turn to the central bank. That's their emergency outlet. The central bank then says, sorry, I'm already out. This is almost dry fodder for cracks in the financial system to cause instability before inflation started to reverse you. Okay. That sounds to what we were talking about yesterday. It's interesting. We talked a lot about the B.O.J. and their intervention, but as you pointed out, there are many more central banks that have been doing this. It hasn't just been Japan or governments rather. The hearing dollar funding has been stretched and you've been talking to us about that for a few days. Perhaps this is a similar situation to early in the pandemic, or is there something that's different this time? Yes. To explain this, I've brought up a chart of Euro dollar cross currency basis, which sounds complicated, but it's really not. It reflects the premium that the premium in which investors and banks are willing to pay to hold dollars instead of any other currency. Now, in 2020 and early 2020, we had the same situation. The line going more negative means investors are more willing to pay a premium to sit on dollars instead of Euros, for example, as this chart's showing. But back in 2020, we had completely different dynamics. The Fed was slashing rates. They were amping up their Kiwi program. Again, they released dollar swap lines for other central banks in the world, flooding the world with dollar liquidity. We are far, far, far from seeing that kind of situation where the Fed is going to save us at this point. In the last few weeks, we've been seeing this dynamic where there's desperation to hold.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,95,2022-10-06 06:37:09
11870," or the Fed is going to save us at this point. And already, in the last few weeks, we've been seeing this dynamic where there's desperation to hold dollars on a balance sheet as your end approaches. OK, and that's what that desperation looks like, that big drop in that blue line there on your chart, Valerie. Thank you very much for that, Valerie Tysel, with the latest on a couple of the market dynamics that have caught her eye over the past 24 hours. Let's get a Bloomberg business flat. Some of the top, but corporate stories we're covering this morning. Here's Alice Atkins. Good morning, Alice. Hi, Anna. Bloomberg has learned that Elon Musk and Twitter have agreed to postpone the billionaire's long awaited deposition in the company's lawsuit. Musk reversed course earlier this week and said he was committed to going ahead with the $44 billion takeover. The move comes as lawyers try to finalize procedures to dispose of Twitter's lawsuit. The World Trade Organization says global trade will slow next year as major economies face strong headwinds. The WTO forecast global goods trade will now grow by 1% next year, a big revision on its previous estimate of 3.4%. It blamed a cocktail of factors, including rising prices, restricted energy supplies and growing US-China tensions. And Virgin Atlantic is pulling out of Hong Kong for good. The UK airline is canceling flights and closing its offices in the Asian financial hub, ending a 30-year history in the city. It says one key factor is closed Russian airspace, which extends flights between Heathrow and Hong Kong by at least an hour. That's your Bloomberg business flash, Anna. Alice, thanks very much. Alice, Anna, Kins in London. Now, Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak has told our set Bloomberg that the oil price cap imposed by EU sanctions is unacceptable to Moscow. He says it will stop supplying oil to those countries that join the mechanism. Indeed, there have been two important decisions taken today. One, you have already mentioned and that is the decision on cutting quotas by all countries present and by all countries in the group. But the second decision, which is just as important as the first one, is actually the extension of the Declaration of Cooperation, because it was scheduled to expire at the end of 22. But now it has been agreed that it will be extended until the end of 2023, which gives the market significantly more certainty and significantly more predictability. And that's why decision was taken to balance the market out by the cuts, by the cuts versus quotas of August. And especially this is a very important ahead of the winter season, when we would also see the seasonal decline demand by 2.5 to 3 million battles. And this decision, which has been made today, helps the market to balance it out. I think it's a very weighted decision at a timely one. Let's look towards February 2023. You will have more sanctions we assume. You will potentially have a price cap. Can you tell me with a surety what your production in February 2023 will be? You said 92%, 93% for 2023. But is that the worst case scenario by February with more sanctions on the price cap? Such actions as we're seeing creates a very bad precedent. And we'll primarily hit the ones who are actually doing it and the ones who are implementing it. We know and history has an countless number of examples of market interference, especially with a mechanism of price control. We can only lead to a deficit of a certain good. This mechanism is unacceptable to Russia. And if it is implemented, we are not going to supply countries which join this mechanism. Alexander Novak there, speaking exclusively with Bloomberg in Vienna, after OPEC class agreed to cut its collective output limit by 2 million barrels a day. Let's get back to our colleague, Manus Krani, who's in Vienna, who you saw there, conducting that interview. Manus, it's been a really hectic 24 hours where you are. There's been the cart, there's been the cooperation agreement that he talked about. There's also been EU policy changes which he was responding to there. What's been your big takeaway from everything that's happened in oil markets over the past 48 hours or so?

We clearly indicated also this our KAPAC budget 12 billion for the next three years that we will keep investing into organic growth. We are very focused on our regular dividend payment.

You can catch that tonight at 6.30 pm in London 7.30 pm in Hong Kong. Let's get a Bloomberg first-where news update, top stories we are covering. Hi Anna, Ursula Wonderlijn is proposing that the EU intervenes in the gas market to cap rising costs. The Commission President's plan includes a temporary price limit on the Dutch benchmark gas price which is used for all gas traded in Europe. Wonderlijn contends the price no longer reflects the bloc's energy reality and the rapidly shrinking share of gas from Russia. The World Trade Organization says global trade will slow next year as major economies face strong headwinds. The WTO forecast global goods trade will now grow by 1% next year, a big revision on its previous estimate of 3.4%. It blames a cocktail of factors including rising prices, restricted energy supplies and growing US-China tensions. King Charles III is expected to be crowned on June 3rd next year in a ceremony at Westminster Abbey. The Bloombergers learn that British officials are converging on that date although talks are still ongoing. The coronation, almost 70 years after his mother was crowned, will form the centipede holiday on air and on Bloomberg Quicktake powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts and more than 120 countries. This is Bloomberg, Anna. Thank you very much, Alice Ackins here in London. Now globally, assets have been hit this year by central bank efforts to tame surging inflation. The UK recently, things have been especially bad. Confidence has been shaken after a mini budget, so-called mini budget, packed with tax cuts, saw the pound hit a record low against the dollar, procted intervention from the Bank of England in bond markets and eventually a government uternament questions over credibility. In total, 300 billion pounds has been wiped from the combined value of the nation's stocks and bonds for analysis. Let's bring in our UK Stocks reporter Joe Easton. Joe, very nice to have you with us this morning. We've breakdown for us the hit to markets that we've seen over the last month. As you mentioned, over the entire market, it's been around 300 billion. A lot of that has been in the domestic stock market, so around 80 billion off the domestic market, obviously some of the corporate debt as well, the distress companies. They've seen massive drops in their bonds. We've seen guilt yields elevated still up around 4%. They were down at around 3% when trust took over. They were already on the rise, obviously, given the interest rates environment. But the effect of trust taking over certainly had a lasting impact. The only thing that's really recovered is the pound and that's partly because the dollar has sort of come off its highs and also just a bit of easing of those worries around the UK. Yes, I was going to ask you how much of that initial response then has been sustained, that initial response to the so-called mini budget, how have UK markets responded, for example, to the government's U-turn? That did seem designed to limit the political damage, but that was not much of what had created the economic damage. Yes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,98,2022-10-06 06:50:10
11873," For example, to the government's U-turn. I mean, that did seem designed to limit the political damage, but that was not much of what had created the economic damage. Yeah, I think the actual fiscal impact is only around £2 billion from that change in tax policy. However, I think what it actually did was it actually showed investors that, um, quating and trust can actually probably be reined in a bit, and they can actually probably be convinced by the other MPs on their party to scale back a bit of this all out growth policy that they're clearly going for. I think one of the most damaging things at the moment is we haven't had the OBR report on the UK government finances. They can't seem to make up their mind when that's coming out. They seem to think it'll be coming out in the end of November, but that really needs to come out. Yeah, so a U-turn, which was then sort of U-turns, and our colleague, Allegra Stratton, calling that a doughnut. So we don't, I don't know what's happening with that one. Let me ask you about where this leaves UK assets then, because I know that in your piece you've got a quote from the Libra and Capital, saying that clients are talking about the UK as being uninvestable. But that said, the UK looks very cheap on a lot of measures, and they talk about if the if profits drop by a quarter, that would leave them, even that would still make them look pretty cheap. So even if profits drop further from here, what are you sort of sensing in that conversation? Yeah, I mean, I think in my perspective, I think the UK stocks look really cheap across large number of sectors. So if you're looking at home builders, some real estate retailers and the UK bank specifically. So home builders, they trade on around a 30% discount just for the land that they own. They own around £30 billion worth of land. The stocks are trading collectively at around £20 billion. It doesn't seem to make sense. UK banks have fallen around £15 cents since the last budget, so you're talking Lloyd's, NatWest, even Barclays, which makes a huge amount of money in your work. It speaks to the senselessity to those who are guilty of the yield, though, and what's happening in mortgage markets? Exactly. So people are predicting a mortgage crisis. The market's pricing in around a 10% price in UK drop in UK house prices, which you could argue that seems too bearish. So from my point of view, I do think there's a lot of value in UK stocks. OK, Joe, thanks very much. Thanks for joining us, Joe Eastern. From Bloomberg there, we're the latest on the investability or otherwise of UK assets. Coming up, we'll look at the broader stocks to watch stories today, including Shell, who pointed to a weaker third quarter performance, following a record first half. That up next. This is like that. Why is everybody want to be a consultant? And what are all these consultants doing? Well, David, I think that we actually defy the label consultant, because sometimes consultants seem to imply that we only give advice. And when you look at what Accenture does, we're really different than the traditional version of a consultant. We're really about relevance and results. And that's what is driving our business. What about a consulting project? In my example, on the CEO, I have a problem. I call you up. I say, solve my problem or give me a solution. We don't operate as big companies permanently in crisis mode. And so when you think about how long does it solve things, a lot of it starts with the company being willing to set aggressive goals. And so what we are trying to do now is work with our clients to work differently and to work faster. Everything you need to get set for the start of US trading. Bloomberg, the open with Jonathan Terrell. Drilling down in the numbers and preparing you is only Bloomberg can weekdays on Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,99,2022-10-06 06:54:28
11874," Jonathan Terrell, filling down in the numbers and preparing you as only Bloomberg can weekdays on Bloomberg. Welcome back to Bloomberg, Mark is Europe at seven or so minutes to go until the start of cash equity and the future picture looks a little brighter, capturing it a bit catch up with Wall Street of yesterday. We saw a bit of a turnaround, let's get the individual stocks we're watching, Danny Berger joins us with that and we've heard from Shell this morning. Right, exactly. Signalling that their third quarter might be a little bit weaker, of course this is all coming off the back of some really banner earnings for Shell. So, comparables are already really difficult. So, they've warned on their chemicals, business margins, negative they're looking worse than they had been before. That's just interesting, sort of from a macro perspective since chemicals are used in literally everything is produced using chemicals. So, that's a macro signal to keep track of. Gas business, those margins a little bit weaker as well. But again, and it comes off of just such a strong year for the oil giants, it's not totally surprising to see that come off a little bit. Okay, and then Imperial brands, not a business we talk about all that frequently, but some new slow rounding this company. Yeah, the cigarette and e-sig maker, so Imperial brands, a one billion pound buyback. They say that at the moment their debt levels are towards the low end of their targeted range. And that has allowed them the freedom to go into this market by about five and a half percent of the shares currently outstanding. They're also on target to reach some of their medium term goals. So, overall a beneficial picture for Imperial and of course buybacks, putting that into the market always gives a stock and a little pop. Okay, let's keep it sort of UK focused, I suppose, because the actual, we'll say out with some news. I also realized not only did I pick all UK companies, but I got all the syn stocks for you, got oil, I got cigarettes, and now finally alcohol, Diagio saying that they are off to a strong start of the fiscal year of 2023. They're on track to meet their medium term outlooks. Morgan Stanley writing that this is what they call reassuring that it's positive for Diagio, that they are on track to hit all these targets. They said it might not change things too much in terms of what their price target is for Diagio, but again, it's that reassurance they've injected into the market. Okay, well it is nearly the weekend, Danny, with all the syn stocks we're in this morning, nearly, I mean it's Thursday, nearly enough. Bluebacks, it's the new Friday, Danny Berger, thank you very much. Let me get back to you from UK stocks, specifics, perhaps to some of the oil narrative on a macro level. We've got some interesting calls coming through this morning. Morgan Stanley raising its first quarter 2023 Brent forecast to $100 after that OPEC plus meeting, saying that oil will find its way to $100 quicker after that OPEC plus meeting. We saw that big cut to production announced by OPEC, and they're joining other houses in this call because Goldman Sachs has been talking about their fourth quarter target for oil, raised that $10 to $110 a barrel. And UBS talking about Brent advancing above $100 over the coming quarters. City though, also talking about how what this does to the oil price, but warning that the move could backfire if it hits economic activity even more. And that does seem to be something that some people are citing when it comes to oil prices. Yes, it can increase inflation, but it can also weigh on demand, of course, as we know. That is it for this hour of programming coming up. The European Open is up next. The future has been pointing broadly higher. US futures also point a little higher this morning. This is Blaineberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,100,2022-10-06 06:59:26
11875," China's military power has been growing at an incredible speed over the last 20 years. A strong country must have a strong military, as only then can it guarantee the security of the nation. In terms of sphere of influence, we absolutely know that China wants to be dominant in Asia, so there is a target to get to that point, to be a military that is appear to the greatest militaries in the world by 2035. The competition for influence is a global one, and through a multi-decade trajectory viewed by planning, money, and pragmatism, China is building a military that allows it to shape the 21st century just as the US shaped the 20th. Access the financial world on demand. Here from leading economists, policymakers, and industry experts, be alive and on-demand webinars, only from Bloomberg. Start exploring to see what's moving the markets. Visit Bloomberg.com webinars. This is really a reminder, isn't it, just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see some pressure on the UN, we did see some pressure on the futures. That is now being with us. Welcome to the European market. Open everyone a minute to go to the start of cash equity trading and froncing like what here in London. And here are your top stories, not so pumped. The US slams OPEC plus for its decision to slash crude output saying the cartel is aligning with Moscow. Rallying cry Ursula von der Lyon says calls for EU intervention and gas markets regional leaders meet in Prague to seek common ground. Plus pivots, what pivots, fed officials, poor more cold water, equity bulls, Mary daily tells Bloomberg an early end to tightening is wishful thinking. So let's take a look at the futures. Despite all the concern out there in the markets and we have a pretty scathing review also what could have to UK stocks. From now on we have a number of reports actually, okay, UK stocks and bonds and none of them I have to tell you are very encouraging or positive. European stock futures getting some 6 cents of 8 percent. So it does look like we're opening a little bit higher. The bullish sentiment I guess weakening the dollar after its biggest jump in a week yesterday. And so that's also potentially giving a bit of a lift. So watch out for currencies. Watch out for commodities. I think without a doubt the biggest story of the day is what's happening with OPEC. Our man is crying on the ground in Vienna with some great, great exclusive interviews. He was actually the first one to speak to the Russian energy minister. Brent crude you can see 9312. So watch out for any kind of impact this has also in terms of spat between Russia and of course OPEC and the U.S. The CAC 40 opening up. So we're seeing some of these markets in exactly the indices opening the footsie pretty much unchanged. But we are seeing gains for the CAC 40 and the IBIX over in Spain. So process and the one thing we always watch out for and you know what it's like is basically what we're seeing with the U.S. 10-year yield 377. The action of course overall in the markets yesterday appeared to rethink on the impact of the decision by OPEC to reduce daily production by 2 million barrels. I'm a little bit surprised at what the markets are doing now because of course the question is if you reduce by this much what does OPEC know that economists don't. Now all prices trading higher this morning after an action pack 24 hours.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,101,2022-10-06 07:03:00
11876," The question is, if you reduce by this much, what does OPEC know that economists don't? Now, all prices trading higher this morning after an action-packed 24 hours. OPEC plots agreed to cut its output. By the most in two years, earning a rebuke from the White House. Well, the U.S. National Economic Council Director, Brian D., says President Biden, is disappointed by the short-sighted decision. Well, we were disappointed that OPEC made this decision. As the President mentioned, we think it's unnecessary if you look at the global environment where supply continues to be the predominant challenge. We've been working for some time to take action and encourage action globally to make sure that supply actually matches demand. And the EU approved new sanctions on Russian oil, drawing a veiled threat from Russia. Now, let's head to Vienna where Bloomberg, Manus Krani, is standing by. Manus, let's start with the rallying prices. I mean, you had some market-moving interviews yesterday. What are traders looking at today? They're more worried about more cuts to come. It's the three C's, Caps, Cuts, and Conflict. I'll come to the conflict in just a moment. To quote one of the great American quotes from the time of war, the Iraq war, you know, the known unknowns and the unknown unknowns. And of course, we're going into this vortex of the unknown, which are what will the impact of these price caps have on production and prices and volatility? For the Russians, it's going to mean a reduction and near-term reduction in production. That was the red headline from Novak, the first hit time with the Deputy Prime Minister exclusive to Bloomberg. And then the Saudis are worried about the volatility. But let's tune in to Novak and his salutary warning to the West as he arrived in the heart of Europe. I'm touching. Such actions, as we're seeing, create, I mean, I eat a price cap, creates a very bad precedent. And we'll primarily hit the ones who are actually doing it and the ones who are implementing it. We know and history has a countless number of examples of when market interference, especially with the mechanism of price controls, can only lead to a deficit of a certain goods that are in the market. And if it is implemented, we are not going to supply countries which join this mechanism. Get ready for volatility. Production drops from Russia. Who's going to fill that gap? The society's Israel-Hannis Prince of Dulles has been someone who wouldn't be drawn in terms of his readiness to fill any customer needs that could come from a drop in Russian production. But why cut knives? They're painting. And this building in the bunker last night, Francine, that you know so well, they painted graphs and imagery, Blinberg graphs, in terms of the drop in demand, the fragility of demand, the fragility of the situation. But the bottom line is all that political carpet, the, you know, the fistic bump moment that you saw Biden and Mohammed bin Salman have that political carpet, the Biden spent. No peckers back on the table. That could have the Saudis arching like hell. And an espior. And you cut, you want to cut barrels off the barrel? I'll see you and raise you because I've got a lot of oil in the bunker in the espior. And I will release it. Those are the messages coming from the United States of America, Francine Tom. Yeah, it does feel like it's just so much more political. There's also great peace behind your blasts looking at the, of course, interlinks between some of the decision what it does also to the coffers in Russia. So Saudis top oil official saying that U.S. led plans for price cap on Russian oil only added to the uncertainty matters. Indeed. And that uncertainty is what's irking everybody. How it's going to play out, where it's going to play out. Let's listen to his Royal Highness, Prince of Dullesys, bin Salman. Ack of details and lack of clarity and the lack of the fact that we still have two months to go for these two things to be activated. These two months would be a period of uncertainty. We don't see what would be the reaction of the market, of the participant. He again reaffirmed his message that the markets were f**king.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,102,2022-10-06 07:07:33
11877," We don't see what would be the reaction of the market, of the participant. He again reaffirmed his message that the markets were fragile and illiquid. I pushed him, is this a series of jumbo cups to come? Are you ready to do that? He pushed back against that. In the macro discussion, and go and listen to the whole interview, because it is worth it, shameless plug, why not? But it is about the central banks around the world are prepared to chase inflation, taming at any cost to growth. But of course, I put it back to him and I said, you know, you're stoking, refueling the inflation fire. The central bank of oil took action yesterday. The question is whether it's a one and done or one of many multiples to come. Tom, Francine. Thank you so much. I have to say I'll do a shameless plug for you. It was a fantastic interview. I am unclear what the market is looking at, because either they just think the world economy is going to be much worse unexpected, or they're trying to give Russia a helping hand. And that has a whole lot of geopolitical implications. Manas Krani, they're on the ground for us with, of course, all of those exclusive interviews. And he'll have plenty more throughout the day. Now let's bring in Bloomberg's Christine Aquino and Neil Sullivan, O Sullivan, chief investment officer of multi-asset strategies for EMEA at Neuberg, Berman. So thank you both for joining us. Christine, I'm looking at oil and I'm thinking like, okay, the oil markets and traders are pretty cool about this. I mean, should we look at it as a geopolitical standoff instead of an imminent recession, you know, red flash warnings? Well, Francine, it does seem like a geopolitical sound of at the face of it. What I'm particularly worried about is the implications for inflation longer term. I mean, the reason probably that the Americans in particular were very incensed about this. There's, of course, the political aspect of it as Manas was alluding to. But then there's also the economic, monetary policy aspect of it. This is not going to be a good thing. Higher oil prices heading into the winter time. I mean, the U.S. the fed officials have been just repeatedly hiking those rates and really trying to get a lid on energy prices specifically, but also inflation more broadly. This is not going to be good use. It's not going to be good use for the mid-term election season in November. And so all around, it just spells quite a negative picture for inflation in the U.S. but also globally. And yet markets are up, you know, which is a conundrum, right? Because it filters through inflation. It exacerbates the standoff or they see something ugly happening in oil demand. And it's probably part of the broader bigger theme of, you know, deglobalization where frictions are coming back allies who used to work together becoming a little bit more contra-toms. I think two things to be why the market a little bit more sanguine about it. It's obviously a two million cut, but when you look at the numbers, there are already one under that. So it's probably a net effect of only one by the time you look at it. And secondly, if you go back to earlier on in the year, when you had the situation where the sanctions were coming in, people assumed there was going to be much greater shortage of oil. Unlike gas, which is piped, oil is shipped and it's made its way through the world into lots of other places. And so the worst effects of that did not happen as expected. So I think markets are still probably watching this to a little extent. However, continuing to have inflation protection in your portfolio is clearly something you need to do. Yeah, so how do you do that? But, you know, first of all, I also have a morning must read. And today I have to say it was fantastic. It came out late last night by a Javier Blas, one of the most brilliant opinion pieces, peace writers, especially when it comes to oil. And he says, you know, this is a direct snub to Western governments. So given all of the implications, how do you protect your portfolio? So I think when you look at your portfolio and look at what's going on, there's a lot of things in the commodity side that could happen. The other thing we're not talking about, but the other reason there's been probably a pullback in commodities recently is being in shiny economic activity has been a lot lower than expected. You could look into post-aparity conference and see a lot of things potentially open up, particularly if something like the zero-COVID policies were to be relaxed a little bit. And that could be a real bull case. So having exposure to commodities in your portfolio is clearly something that you should probably have strategically. And also there's some tactical elements to it as well. Because of those markets at the moment, the role yield is really, really interesting in commodities. The cost of the spot commodities, relative future commodities, it pays you to effectively take that curve on an ongoing basis. So putting that into a portfolio is a very interesting thing. Yeah, and then of course it goes back to dollar, king dollar. But it took a bit of a breather yesterday. Absolutely, Francine.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,103,2022-10-06 07:12:08
11878," So putting that into a portfolio is a very interesting thing. Yeah, and then of course it goes back to dollar, King Dollar. But it took a bit of a breather yesterday. Absolutely, Francine. It's still kind of very interesting, really, the dynamics of the dollar and everything that's feeding into it this year. I mean, I think there's a little bit of this view that perhaps the peak is behind us. But I'm a little skeptical of that just because of what we keep hearing from the Federal Reserve officials, right? I mean, this week, they very much pushed back against this idea of a pivot. It's which void markets initially at a start of this week. Until we heard from the official saying, I know, hang on. We're going to keep doing this for a little while longer in that peak rate. We're not even close to it yet. And so, you know, if they're going to be, that's the path the policy moving forward in they're out doing everyone else. It's really difficult to see the dollar pulling back on a sustained manner. I think it might be a while before we get to that peak peak that a lot of people are hoping for. Yeah, and so we'll talk about, of course, the Fed and just the second. We'll also hear from Mary Daling, Raphael Bostick. What I'm surprised about is that the market wants to believe so bad that they're done with hikes or that they will take care of the economy that they just keep on trying to price it in. And then you have official after official, you know, that just come on and say like, guys, we're fighting inflation. We're fighting inflation. This is the one thing, the one job that we want to do right now. So, one of the things that's really interesting, we talked about the Fed, after the GFC, there was a long period where the the dot, the forward dot, the one way out in the future, it stayed at 4% for a really long time and nobody kind of believed it. Now that dot is sitting at 2.5%, which is the Fed is telling you, no, we're moving it up here, but the market don't want to go there. So I think there's clearly a desire for people to see peak Fed. Now, what I will say is that when you look at what's going on, I think people, I think we're in, people have talked with the new normal for a long time. We're probably back to an old normal situation, but real rates, the Fed is now data driven. They used to give you forward guidance, they won't anymore. They have, the market is expecting what it's expecting, but the Fed will react to data. Let me, I mean, I don't want to push back too much, because you're absolutely right, but if there's this belief for this longing in the markets, even by just looking at the current data, they have to be aggressive if they're going to go from the inflation number now to 2%. Is that not being priced in? I think if you look at the heist, you see 75 and 50 built in. They are going to keep an eye on what is happening thereafter. And if you start to get to a session, if you still start to see things going down, my personal view is that they're really focused on is the inflation expectations. That will drive everything. And it's only when they see that that is very, very anchored and they see real evidence of things falling off that they will start to code. So I would agree with you. We remain in our portfolios position that things that we'll be doing well should financial conditions continue to tighten will be rewarded in portfolios. Yeah, would you go as far as saying, Christina's just markets are too optimistic about their own future? At this point, Francine, yes, I would think so. I mean, again, you're absolutely right. This is kind of the sort of the price action that we saw this week is really that kind of hope. I mean, it's almost like it's hope you know that the Fed is going to be stopping as policy, high-king cycles soon, but we're really maybe halfway through it at best. And we've seen this before, right? I mean, over the summer, the narrative was peak inflation, which was very quickly shattered when we saw successive CPI prints that really exceeded expectations. I think we're in danger of kind of falling into that same trap. Again, this week, especially ahead of those non-farm payroll numbers tomorrow, I think if that affirms the Fed narrative that they're going to keep moving forward, then markets have to recalibrate the expectations. All right. Thank you both. We have plenty more, of course, on the Fed, Bloomberg, Christina Kino, and staying with us.

11879," How much I could push have you seen from the Kishita government in terms of green funding? The Kishita administration has committed to doubling the amount of investments in so-called green technologies. I think we need more than just pronouncements. We need real money backing, very innovative startups, and innovative companies in this space. What do you make of Kishita's new capitalism? I think he is framework is reflective of the challenges that Japan society is facing, namely that growth has been present. The growth has not been, of course, evenly distributed, but frankly speaking, it's hard to register the income if you don't have much income to begin with. If the government and private sector can work together and collaborate to drive more innovative growth startups, that can really drive the income growth that the Kishita government needs to redistribute.

I don't see that happening at all. I see us as raising to a level that we believe is restrictive enough to bring inflation down. And then holding it there until we see inflation truly get close to 2% and demonstrate that price stability is restored. I'd like to reach a point where policy is moderately restrictive, somewhere between 4 and a 4.5% by the end of this year. And then hold at that level and see how the economy and prices react. Well, those are some FOMC members, Mary Daley, Raphael Ballstick, equing that the Fed is unlikely to cut rates next year. We're back talking markets with Nile Sullivan, chief investment officer of multi-asset strategies for EMEA, ethno-burger, bourbon. Now, I think I'm pronouncing it right. So I get full marks for that. This was like my only stress today, apart from looking at treasuries and trying not to get the market expectations wrong on that. What needs to be reprised like now, not tomorrow? Treasurer or equities? I think, as I said earlier, I think the Fed is becoming increasingly data driven. So it's very hard to look out forward. They're giving you a very clear steer and they want the market reigned in. I think the Fed would like to tighten financial conditions generally. The Fed rate is only a very small part of that. When you look at the financial conditions, equity markets and the tenure rate are equally as important. There is no doubt that the Fed is not in favor of financial market conditions losing and is doing its best to reassess that from Jackson Hole all the way through to now. I think when you look at that, you certainly would be concerned that the equity markets, particularly in the US, have probably retrenched a long way. Therefore, the fear would be that this would be another of the bear market rallies that we've seen along the run. In your conviction call, so you have, for example, short duration opportunities in credit and high yield? Is that G7 countries? In particular, what you're looking for is one of the big themes we're going for is favor the fittest. This is going to be a tougher market. In particular, in that context, just return for equity for a second, I would be very much focusing on low volatility, higher quality, stuff that is already marked down. On the fixed income side, I think, in particular when you look at some pockets in the US and elsewhere, you have over the next number of years a recession should have come not like...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,105,2022-10-06 07:20:33
11880," on the fixed income side, I think in particular when you look at some pockets in the US and elsewhere, you have over the next number of years a recession should have come not likely to be very, very aggressive, but pricing built into credit spreads would be much more in line with a very much steeper recession. So, particularly on a two-year, three-year view in investment-grade credit in high yield, you can see that those assets will be money-good in the end. It could be a bumpy ride from here to there though. Okay, what's a bumpy ride? Like actual pain both ways? I think you will see falls in value along the way because if there becomes growth fears, then every high yield asset will reprise. But I think they will ultimately end up money-good over that period because of the protection that I mean, there will of course be defaults, but the spread would be greater than the defaults will realize we believe. When you look at the government chaos here in the UK with the U.K. and the pretty chaotic conservative party conference, is the U.K. investible? I think the U.K. faces some real problems, particularly when you are reliant on the kindness of strangers when you are running a budget deficit, a twin deficit. So, you need to have the confidence that is there. I think what you have seen over the last few days and weeks with the effect of the OBR coming back on the picture, though nobody is 100% sure when with the movement of tax cut is evidence that they are trying to be a little bit more market-aware and market-savvy. But I think you also have some key dates coming up over the next while when the bank is being removed. It's support and the LDI market needs to go back in and function. The one thing I will say there, though, not since Mario Draghi has a central banker achieved so much with so little being spent, today this bank of England has only spent about 3 billion of the promise 65, and it has managed to stabilize and normalize those markets. Yeah, but in 10 days effectively, there is no last buyer of last resort. There is no stated last buyer of resort, but the market has learned a lesson. And I think generally speaking one of the other lessons I think that is out there is the central bank put that has been there for a while, is probably still there, should there be financial stability threats like we saw in the UK or in details where not necessarily much use for equity markets, but very use for credit markets.

A big news, of course, on OPEC and energy. But you can see stocks for the moment getting some 7-10 of 8%. Now globally assets have been hit this year by central bank efforts to tame surging inflation in the UK recently. Things are especially bad. Confidence has been shaken after many budget. Packed with tax cuts, saw the pound hit a record low against a dollar, prompted intervention from the B.O.E. and eventually a government U-turn. Now in total, 300 billion pounds have been wiped from the combined value of the nation's stock and bond markets. For analysis, let's bring in our UK stocks reporter, Joe Eason. Joe, great to have you on the program. This was pretty brutal. 300 billion pounds wiped off. This goes to the credibility of the markets. Why have the markets freaked out so much? Well, I think that the big issue here is this all-out push for growth is obviously going to mean higher interest rates across the board from the Bank of England, also the mortgage market. Probably going to see potentially crashing the mortgage sector. The big issue now looking forward is we really need to see this report from the Office of Budget Responsibility. There's going to sum up the state of the UK government finances. That's the only thing that investors can really go on and really judge how sustainable this fiscal expansion is. The government can't seem to make up their mind of when that will come out. It looks like it will come out in the end of November now. That was actually the big thing that we saw from Fitch last night with their warning on the UK credit outlook. They need to see that report. Joe, I have to say I looked at the latest mortgage use. I had to sit down with the drink of my choice to absorb the news. So the key UK mortgage rate climbing above 6% for the first time since 2008. Are you hearing possible defaults or things like that? 6% is the key level that's like red flag for the banking industry. Once it goes above 6%, then it brings into question the health of the debt that these banks own. That's why we've seen a big sell-off in the UK banks. Even since the budget, I think, Lloyd's, that West companies like that, they're still down around 10%. Because they're worried that these mortgages will actually go bad at the lower end of their mortgage books. They could actually be big defaults and big provisions books at the next earnings season. This is a huge news that we really are spending a lot of time and thank you to your team to really keep on top of this. So UK markets, how have they responded to the U-turns by the government? Yesterday was that loose trust speech? Yes, I think the U-turn, it was kind of a strange one. What it did really was it showed us that the government can actually be reigned in a bit. So, a quiet thing and trust can actually be kind of tamed by the MPs on their party that don't want to lose their jobs at the next election. And they're saying, look, you can't just do these tax cuts that won't play well with the electorate. So, that was actually a relief for the market. Fiscally, it's only worth around £2 billion in terms of the bill for the budget. But politically, it showed investors that actually this policy of all out going for growth might not last. We might see the cost of government debt come back down and that would reduce the interest rate crisis. Joe, thank you so much. Joe Eason, there was a very late disinteresting seat. The more, I mean, well, markets, of course, keeping the government in line and then their own MPs.

I don't know if I'm asking you to choose amongst your children, but you know some of the most recognizable buildings by you of course the Millennium Bridge, London City Hall, the Reichstag and the Great Court British Museum. What was your favorite project to do? The Reichstag does stand out because first of all it's an energy manifesto so it transformed something that was dependent on fossil fuels it uses all the technology to produce something which is essentially carbon neutral and there's a public building that's a statement. It's a symbol of a city, it's a symbol of a nation, it incorporates works of art, it's recycling an existing building which as I mentioned earlier is the ultimate in sustainability if you can give a new life to a building. It also creates public space at the roof level. It's the most visited parliament in the world so it puts the public above the politicians who are answerable to them and that of course was made possible by the politicians so it's a demonstration of democracy in action.

11883," The shadows of Russia's war in Ukraine. Now for European leaders, the focus is still firmly on energy. This comes as Moscow warrants against a price cap in a Blueburg TV exclusive. For more on all of this, let's bring in Maria Tadeu, who's on the ground covering the meeting in Prague. So, Maria, the head of the commission or some underlying calling for a gas price cap. Will it actually happen? Well, for Insin, she has. And this is a letter. There's three pages that she sent out yesterday to the heads of the EU 27 governments in which she argues, when you look at the Dutch benchmark, the TTF, it no longer reflects the true cost of gas. And therefore, the European Union has to transition away from it. Now the issue is you have now 17 countries in the EU that say they are in favor of this price cap. The commission is responding to that, but the problem is they don't have the formula. And Francine, when we talk about a price cap, there's at least five different options on the table. What I hear is that there is no consensus in terms of the formulation, in terms of the structure. And this is what this meeting will be about. To try to figure out a consensus area in which the 27 can live with. Remember also, by the way, the Germany has set up until now, they do not favor a cap because of the rippercussions it could happen to play. So, that's the energy challenge. How much of this is politics? We have 44 heads of state, including Liz Truss. And she is finally taken part in this European political community. Now, this is a trial run for a concept that in many ways, was brought forward by the French President, Emma, and Michael, the idea is that this is a space where EU countries and non-EU countries, but that clearly have the same common interests, can gather together and have a debate. Remember, Francina, a few weeks ago, Liz Truss was asked is, Emma and Michael, a friend or a foe of the UK, and she could not really put out an answer. She said the jury's out on this question. Perhaps today they can clarify things between the two. And then the other issue that will feature two is this common response to the war in Ukraine. This overshadows everything, as it often is the case, in any political meeting that is happening this days. In Europe, it's a common response, how to respond to the Russian aggression. Maria, thank you so much, Maria, today, there on the ground for us in Prague. Now, joining us to talk about the economy is Yari Sten, chief European economist at Goldman Sachs. Yari, thank you for being here and actually in person in the studio. When you look at some of the challenges out there, I think there's nothing good coming out of this OPEC decision, because they either see a much slower turn to, you know, the economy, or it just exacerbates this division in geopolitics. What's the impact for Europe? Yeah, so we do think the decision to cut supply is going to push oil prices higher from here. We just raised our forecast to one ten later in the year as a combination of tight supply, but then also strong demand as we substitute away from gas into oil. Now of course, the effect of high energy prices means on the one hand slower growth, but it also means more persistently high inflation. I think the latter is probably key at the moment, because central banks are still struggling with high inflation rate. But you're not reading this as a kind of collapse in demand from China or a complete recession worldwide that OPEC is anticipating. I think it's more that you've seen a significant slowdown in growth around the world. It's been pretty broad-based, so oil prices as part of that have been falling. And so these supply cuts, I think, are designed to put a floor under that and are probably going to work to push up oil prices somewhat in coming months. How problematic is it that these central banks are basically hiking into a recession, into the winter where we also need to heat ourselves? Yeah, I mean, it's a classic supply shock where you have on the one hand higher inflation on the other hand lower growth, and we think recession across Europe. So it's a difficult trade off for central banks, but at the same time, I think they've been very clear that the focus is on inflation, so particularly the ECB has a single mandate, price stability, that's where the focus is, and that's why we think for now these pretty large braid hikes will continue, and we don't see a central bank pivot around the corner. But the UK also in the makes, which has complications of their own. Well, where do you see the UK headed?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,109,2022-10-06 07:38:08
11884," see a central bank pivot around the corner. But the UK also in the makes which has complications of their own. First of all, where do you see the UK headed? And because of the fiscal spending, we weren't sure how they were funding it. Is it a warning shot to other European countries? Yeah, I think, first of all, the key issue in the UK is of course that it has both the tight labour market that the US has and also the big energy shock that the Euro area has. And so that's really I think the context in which we have to see this fiscal expansion, which of course is helping to cushion the depth of the recession we think, but is adding to the medium term inflation pressures. And so we do think bottom line is that the Bank of England needs to step up the pace of tightening and we do think they will step up to a hundred basis point, hike in November to try to rein in these increased medium term inflation pressures. What about QT? Is this a mistake? Well, it has been delayed and of course the focus has really been on financial stability, on the guild market functioning. I think that has been quite successful. And we do think that they're going to be more cautious with QE with the asset sales when they start in coming months. Just so that we fully understand, because we also have this pretty incredible mortgage rates hitting 6% in the first sense since 2008. If there were to be a sharp downturn in the UK, maybe more than you're expecting, where would you see a person in the housing market or elsewhere? Yeah, I mean, generally it's about the consumer, the cost of living crisis, high energy prices. So we really think that it's going to be consumption that will drive the economy into recession. And in fact, we think we are already in recession. Of course, the fiscal expansion is going to cushion some of that. So we think it's going to be a relatively moderate recession in the base case. But I certainly think that the housing market could be one source of a bigger hit to growth in coming months. And so, for example, with current mortgage rates, the interest payments that households have to do on mortgages could go back up to where we were in 2007, which of course would imply a further drag on household spending. Yard, talk to me a little bit about what you're seeing in the US. You have the Fed not wanting to pick it. And actually, you see officials being quite aggressive. What does that mean for the rest of the world? Because if dollar continues going higher from here, it's problematic for everyone else. Yeah, so I think in the US, we've seen some progress towards the labor market rebalancing that's needed. So at the end of the day, you have too many jobs relative to the supply. They need to rebalance that. So for example, earlier this week, the droughts numbers, the drop openings that came down, I think were quite helpful. At the same time, you still have strong wage growth, strong underlying inflation pressures. And so we think it's too early for the Fed to stop hiking. We think they will do 75 basis point hike in November and some more to get to 4.75%. Now, that does imply we think continued upward pressure on the dollar. And so we do think that the European currencies will weaken somewhat more against the dollar. And of course, that does raise the pressure on both the Bank of England and the ECB. And so we do think that another 75 basis point hike is very likely for the ECB in October. I think what they do in December depends on how the inflation numbers will evolve. But our base case is that they will hike all the way to 2.75. And of course, the weak euro, the pressure from higher rates in the US is part of that story. Should they just go one percentage point at the next one? I think 75 basis points is a pretty rapid clip. I think it's likely they do another one if not two of those. And then I think it's likely they slow down. All right, Yari, thank you so much. As always, Yari is standing there, Chief European economist at Goldman Sachs joining us in the studio today.

About a consulting project. In my example, I'm the CEO, I have a problem, I call you up, I say, solve my problem or give me a solution. We don't operate as big companies permanently in crisis mode. And so when you think about how long does it solve things, a lot of it starts with the company being willing to set aggressive goals. And so what we are trying to do now is work with our clients to work differently and to work faster. And so what we are trying to do now is work with our clients to work with our clients. Welcome back to the Open, everyone. 43 minutes into the European trade and day. We're still holding onto gains, but actually we're seeing a bit of a reversal for the footsie. That was earlier gaining some 2-10s of 8%. The biggest story in town is of course energy. The impact of that on energy will be translated, of course, through inflation. We're just weighing this oil curve, but treasury 10-year yields in the U.S. also edging higher, the dollar actually weakening after its biggest jump in a week yesterday. Now OPEC-plus agreed to cut its output by the most in two years. And the EU approved new sanctions on Russian oil drawing a veiled threat from Moscow. And as being exclusively to Bloomberg in Vienna, Russia's deputy prime minister, Alexander Novak, says the EU's price cap may backfire. Indeed, there have been two important decisions taken today. One, you have already mentioned, and that is the decision on cutting quotas by all countries present and by all countries in the group. But the second decision, which is just as important as the first one, is actually the extension of the declaration of cooperation, because it was scheduled to expire at the end of 22. But now it has been agreed that it will be extended until the end of 2023, which gives the market significantly more certainty and significantly more predictability. And that's why decision was taken to balance the market out by the cuts versus quotas of August. And especially this is a very important head of the winter.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,111,2022-10-06 07:46:23
11886," My decision was taken to balance the market out by the cuts by the Cots versus Claude's or Fogist. And especially this is this is a very important ahead of the winter season when we would also see the seasonal decline demand by 2.5 to 3 million battles. And this decision which has been made today helps the market to balance it out. I think it's a very weighted decision at a timely one. Let's look towards February 2023. You will have more sanctions we assume you will potentially have a price cap. Can you tell me with a surety what your production in February 2023 will be? You said 92 93% for 2023 but is that is that the worst case scenario by February with more sanctions on the price cap? Such actions as we're seeing creates a very bad precedent and will primarily hit the ones who are actually doing it and the ones who are implementing it. We know and history has an countless number of examples of market interference especially with the mechanism of price controls. We can only lead to a deficit of certain goods. This mechanism is unacceptable to Russia and if it is implemented we are not going through supply countries which join this mechanism. Well that was Russia's deputy prime minister Alexander Novak for an exclusive conversation with our managed county. Meanwhile Saudi energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman says the U.S. led plans for a price cap on Russian exports only adds to market uncertainty. We wanted to give the market a clear direction, a clear input. That's why we extended the agreement to end of 2023 but we still have the same tools in our kit you know guidance to the market is crucial because without guidance people would not invest would not feel safe that they could invest. However we still have the tools in our kit. We still we yes we reduce the amount of meeting we reduce the amount of overall expectations of doing something but we still maintain the same flexibility we still have each two every two months we will have a GMMC. That GMMC is warranted the authority to have more than a meeting in in in in every two months. It also was given the authority to call for a conference meeting if necessity is dictated. Part of the toolkit and the kingdom has often done this which is led from the front and gone with voluntary cuts or ads to do the right thing to write the market. Did you consider a voluntary additional cut for society? Well at this time now it was there is no requirement for it. I think amongst us we sought out a good deed. It certainly we had to be very practical given the situation prevailing in some countries that are not able to produce their allocated voluntary volumes and because of that we elected to go for a bigger number but in the final analysis it will be a smaller number but certainly a significant number and therefore it is we feel it is sufficient sufficient for now. That was the Saudi energy minister Prince of Dalyze has been someone who have plenty more from those two great interviews from our menace cranny later on the programme.

11887," A big revision on its previous estimate of 3.4%. It blames a cocktail of factors including rising prices, restricted energy supplies, and growing US China tensions. North Korea has fired two suspected short-range ballistic missiles towards waters where a US aircraft carrier had been deployed, making a total of 10 launches in less than two weeks. That's one of its biggest test barrage under leader Kim Jong-un. The barrage came shortly after Pyongyang condemned the Biden administration for escalating tensions. And King Charles III is expected to be crowned on June 3rd next year in a ceremony at Westminster Abbey. Bloomberg has learned that British officials are converging on that date, although talks are still ongoing. The coronation, almost 70 years after his mother was crowned, will form the centerpiece of days of celebration to mark the beginning of the monarch's reign. Everybody who used 20,000 a day on air and on Bloomberg Quicktake powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. This is Bloomberg, Francine.

11888," Like the September jobs report, Friday on Bloomberg Television and Radio. Welcome back to the open. Every once in a 53 minutes of European trading day, we're still saying gains across the board, but actually not as much as previously. So there's a bit of a pause. Certainly there is in US futures, look, European stocks modestly higher, but again, it's not the kind of 1% gain that we saw 30 minutes ago. Investors now debating whether higher oil prices would further weaken growth potentially, maybe slowing central banks rate hike cycles. Now let's also take a look at how the markets are moving in the first hour of equity trade. Joining us now is Jan Patrick Barnett, JP. The problem actually is that there's a million ways of looking at the OPEC decision. You either think they're seeing something that we don't or you say, look, this will, of course, fuel inflation and what do central banks do? Well, yeah, so at this point, I would say it's for the market, for the stock market, especially. It's not super bad news, but it's also not great in the sum of all things. So I was talking for a couple of people this morning and they all said, look, this is probably going to keep inflation higher for longer, and that's not something that we want to see at this point. But on the other hand, as long as oil remains behind below the $100 mark, at least in the long run, then probably people can live with that in some way or form. So traders, it seems, not taking the hawkish signals from the Fed as a gasp, but what can you tell us? Well, I mean, we talked about this yesterday in saying that people are looking for that Fed pivot point in earnest to drive the market higher. So we didn't get that from the first speeches we saw, but we also did not get a more dovish tone, so that's good news there. I think like a more hawkish tone, sorry, so that's good news there. But the thing is like, market still believes that if the economy is cooling and we are moving into a recession territory next year, that the central bank could probably cut rates, and that's still the playbook that they are positioning for, nevertheless, what the central bank is saying at this very moment. J.P. Any chance of the Secretary rally being sustained? Well, again, we are in a market that is driven by a lot of short-term technical factors. Positioning has been playing a big role these days, where we have seen like super bearish positioning in auction markets and in in trend following people. So this has driven the the rally so far and what we would need to see now is like more the fundamental guys, the long-term investors becoming a little bit more bullish. That's not the case so far. On the other hand, I find it very interesting that everybody is suspect and this rally will not be sustained. That usually if everybody is on the same side means the opposite happens. So it's going to be interesting to see if this was a contrary call to say this rally will not be sustained. Definitely interesting. Thank you so much, J.P. Barnett, there was the very latest on some of these stock moves. Now that's it for the European market open surveillance. Early edition is up next. Once again, US futures actually stalling. If you look at the oil price action, it's stoking at the inflation debate. Now the decision by OPEC plus to reduce output really drew a warning from the White House about the negative effects on the global economy. And then we have a breakdown. It's different if you're at Goldman Sachs or if you're Aberdeen, what you're expecting the target for Brent to be. I think Goldman Sachs, in the fourth quarter, that price target for Brent is at $110 a barrel. We'll have plenty more of course on the market action. We'll look at geopolitics as well. This is Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,114,2022-10-06 07:59:43
11889," To be continued... China's military power has been growing at an incredible speed over the last 20 years. A strong country must have a strong military, as only then can it guarantee the security of the nation. In terms of sphere of influence, we absolutely know that China wants to be dominant in Asia. So there is a target to get to that point, to be a military that is a peer to the greatest militaries in the world by 2035. The competition for influence is a global one. And through a multi-decade trajectory fueled by planning, money, and pragmatism, China is building a military that allows it to shape the 21st century just as the US shaped the 20s. So you've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen it. I've seen it. What does it mean? What does it mean? It means they have a Bloomberg. This is Bloomberg's early edition with Francine Markwell. Well, good morning, everyone, and welcome to Bloomberg's Surveillance Early Edition in Francine, Lackoy here in London. Here's what's coming up on today's program. Not so pumped, the US slams OPEC Plus for its decision to slash crude output, saying the cartel is aligning with Moscow. Rallying cry, Ursula Vunderlion calls for EU intervention in gas markets, regional leaders meet in Prague to seek common ground. Plus, pivot, what pivot? Fed officials pour more cold water on equity bowls, Mary Daly. Tells Bloomberg an early into tightening is wishful thinking. So first thing is first, let's check it on the markets. We've been bouncing it up and down a little bit. I mean, not down, but certainly we open about 1% higher and you can see now European stocks getting some 410s of 8%. This is all about perception. Do you think that if OPEC cuts a lot and inflation goes up, does it make central banks more aggressive in heights or in the contrary? Do you think that it really hurts tipping the world into a recession? And so are they a little bit more accommodative? If you're on a trading floor right now, this is the impact or the thinking that you need to decide on. And that will change your view on some of these equities, S&P futures. You can see now largely unchanged, but on the lower side, a lot of focus because we have three surveys here in the UK. And whether the UK is still investable for the moment, that stock price of FTSE 100 is actually unchanged. We also worry about mortgages now to 6% high. Let's remember this is the highest since 2007. The DAX getting 6% of 8% similar to the CAC 43, 10% higher. Now, Saudi Arabia's energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, says U.S. led plans for a price cap on Russian exports are fanning the uncertainty that drove OPEC plus to its biggest production cut in two years. Now, the minister refuted claims that re-ad is siding with Moscow over the west. I would say an insulting view to assume that OPEC plus is...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,115,2022-10-06 08:03:54
11890," It's siding with Moscow over the West. I would say an insulting view to assume that OPEC Fluss is nothing but Saudi Arabia and Russia degrading. And to unfair, because from day one, as I took office, I was saying, as a chair of OPEC Fluss, I will treat every member of OPEC Fluss as equal as any of us, simply because we need the consensus. Let's head to Vienna, we're Bloomberg's manus crime is standing by our news breaking machine. So, Manus, what's the latest? You have two very important interviews, Saudi Arabia and Russia. What do you learn? There's going to be a vast amount of uncertainty on the implications on the price caps from the Russian side and from the Saudi side. This is what they are perhaps most fundamentally worried about or concerned about. I would just emphasize that I did try to press his Royal Highness Prince of Dulles, his Bunzelman on the response in the bunker last night from Jake Sullivan in terms of an SPR release in terms of potentially no peck. No peck coming to life again. He would not be drawn on those issues Francine. We're not here to deliberately jack up prices. We're not going for a jumbo set of cuts. And indeed he did warn. Yes, you could say very are jacking scene at 10% rally in prices. That's going to fuel inflation. But as he said back to me on the inflation side, he said central banks this vehement commitment by central banks to tame inflation regardless of the impact on growth. Those are the jumbo issues as it were that we talked about. But when it comes to price cap, the critical red headline went to Novak. He stole the show and the prints on the headlines. It was a bite price caps and the impact on production in the near term for Russia. Let's listen in. So, Christian, you're quote. Indeed, there have been two important decisions taken today. One, you have already mentioned and that is the decision on cutting quotas by all countries present and by all countries in the group. But the second decision, which is just as important as the first one, is actually the extension of the declaration of cooperation because it was scheduled to expire at the end of 22. Now it has been agreed that it will be extended until the end of 2023, which gives the market significantly more certainty and significantly more predictability. And that's why decision was taken to balance the market out by these cuts by cuts versus quotas of August. And especially this is this is very important ahead of the winter season when we would also see the seasonal decline demand by 2.5 to 3 million barrels. And this decision, which has been made today helps the market to balance it out. I think it's a very weighted, it's a very weighted decision at a timely one. Let's look towards February 2023. You will have more sanctions we assume. You will potentially have a price cap. Can you tell me with a surety what your production in February 2023 will be? You said 92 93% for 2023. But is that is that the worst case scenario by February with more sanctions on a price cap? Such actions as we're seeing creates a very bad precedence and will primarily hit the ones who are actually doing it and the ones who are implementing it.

This mechanism is unacceptable to Russia. And if it is implemented, we are not going to supply countries which join this mechanism.

11891," during the relationship with OPEC and OPEC plus price caps are supposed to keep the oil flowing. It's going to reduce Russian production and it's going to introduce volatility according to the Sides Francine. So those are the messages coming through from both sides here. Yeah great great interviews. Manas Cranny on the ground for us there in Vienna. Thank you so much. Now we're also joined by Karen Carnele-Tombour, Co-Chief Investment Officer for Sustainability at Breachwater Associates. Karen thank you for joining us. I mean there's a different number of plays outside from sustainability but of course 100% linked to this. What do you see as the main market schisms that could get us away from more money being poured into sustainable investments? I think that this environment has helped investors reflect on what their values are, what they're trying to do in choosing to move towards sustainability as a goal. You've had nine month environments where cash has been king, the tightening, the fact that really it's been rising and central banks have been needed to catch up was the single most important force in markets. So all assets did poorly and within that environment, the one best best best performing asset was any kind of energy that got very squeezed and looking ahead you're likely to have very tough environment for investors continuing as policymakers battle between not being able to get what they want on inflation or on growth and I think that that's left investors in a tough spot whether or not they prioritize sustainability goals and goes to prioritize sustainability goals in some sense more committed given how much the world has changed. Karen, how has the world changed in terms of perception but also inflation because of that massive opact cut? I think that the opact cut is the news of the day and likely to sort of put a supply bottom if you will underneath what could be a lot of downward pressure on all commodity prices from the fact that now you have all these interest rate heights in the system and so what's happening is you know you had this huge inflationary force coming into this year that was going to show itself both phenomenal demand and in inflation and that's what we got some of the highest nominal growth we've seen. Now that there's been as many interest rate heights as we've seen there is a lot in the system to slow the economy and that's going to take some time but it's going to slow the economy it's going to slow demand and from the perspective of any price certainly oil you know you have to get some decline demand showing up in lower prices unless supply gets cut I still think that the decline in the economy that's coming is more severe than expected and that supply decline helps put some bottom against that. But Karen why do you think markets are still you know pricing in this Goldilocks scenario or they too optimistic about their own future? Absolutely I think markets are pricing in this Goldilocks where somehow magically both we don't have a very severe recession and earnings don't get her very much and inflation sort of magically comes down to where central banks wanted to be. I think the reasons markets are doing that is because it's what we've gotten used to we've had many decades where central banks were able to get what they want they weren't very constrained they were so many secular deflationary forces to pretty much every time the economy slowed a little central bankers could ease massively into that situation not risk inflation and inflation would never get out of their control but the secular environment has changed very significantly they're big secular inflationary pressures coming into the environment and I think it's going to take some number of years for markets to adjust to that and realize just how constrained policy makers are and how they're not going to be able to get both the economy and unemployment outcome they want and inflation outcome they want at the same time especially necessitates lower equity prices. But so Karen if you look at all of these challenges because of the proximity to Russia and I guess you know the buffer that Europe doesn't have is it going to be the region that will really under perform the rest of the world? Yes I think Europe and the UK have already borne the brunt of this environment because they're in the regions that are also having a more secular competitiveness shock that's a much deeper shock than it's kind of the one-off of COVID if you will these are economies that are reliant on having access to",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,117,2022-10-06 08:12:38
11892," killer competitiveness shock. That's a much deeper shock than it's kind of the one off of COVID, if you will. These are economies that are reliant on having access to at least competitive energy prices relative to the rest of the world to have a manufacturing sector. And that shock, the inability to get energy at the same prices, the rest of the world is going to be, and the need to actually ration them, actually experiencing stagnation. It isn't just rising inflation and rising demand, but you actually have to ration energy away from households, away from businesses. That's going to be a very long, much deeper, more challenging shock than to the rest of the world. Because beyond getting the immediate, a huge phase right now getting to the winter, there's this long-term competitiveness issue that's going to come. And you see it already with the central bank dealing with much tougher circumstances, wanting to protect households, but already running into what feels like a balance of payments crisis. And in those conditions, where they realize that, you know, if they're going to get currency weakness and balance of payments pressure, then they try to print money into rising inflation. And yet, they also want to protect their economies. Yeah, and we have great, Sharon. Karen, we'll get back to that our Valerie Taitel put together with Hank Breake, evens versus WTI. Karen, Karen, Carl Njalt, Humbur from Bridgewater Associates stays with us. Coming up at Morphet Speakers, poor cold water, on hopes of an early-davish pivot, we continue the market's conversation. Next, this is Blueberry. Hi. How much have you seen from the Kishirah government in terms of green funding? The Kishirah administration has committed to doubling the amount of investments in so-called green technologies. I think we need more than just pronouncements. We need real money backing, very innovative startups and innovative companies in this space. What do you make of Kishirah's new capitalism? I think he is framework is reflective of the challenges that Japan society is facing, namely that growth has been present, but growth has not been, of course, evenly distributed, but frankly speaking, it's hard to register the income if you don't have a income to begin with. The government and private sector can work together and collaborate to drive more innovative growth startups that can really drive the income growth that the Kishirah government needs to redistribute. Power, policy, politics, from the White House to the Hill, Bloomberg covers the leaders in legislation. That was really a tectonic shift for this White House. The theory of this bill, as I understand it, is there will be a multiplier effect. How to Democrats mobilize specifically younger voters. Bringing you the political news you need to know. The president has made it very clear that this is a significant focus. For the intersection of Wall Street and Washington, nobody covers politics like Bloomberg. I don't see that happening at all. I see us as raising to a level that we believe is restrictive enough to bring inflation down and then holding it there until we see inflation truly get close to 2 percent and demonstrate that price stability is restored. I'd like to reach a point where policy is moderately restrictive, somewhere between 4 and a 4.5 percent by the end of this year, and then hold at that level and see how the economy and prices react. FOMC members, Mary Galean, Raphael Bostick, saying that the Fed is unlikely to cut rates next year.

11893," saying that the Fed is unlikely to cut rates next year. Now, that's as traders bet on at least one reduction in 2023. And Karen Carnell, Tom Boer from Bridgewater Associates, is still with us. Karen, first of all, there is a belief in the markets that, again, going back to that Goldilocks in area that they can have it both ways. But I feel like Fed officials have just been saying the same thing, which is we will stop at nothing to keep inflation under control. So if that's the case, if that's your interpretation, where should Treasury's inequities be? Well, I think that, and the important thing to keep in mind is that the Fed's job today is actually not that hard yet. I think it's only going to get harder, because right now, they're in a situation where the economy still looks pretty great. So they can say we're going to prioritize inflation, inflation, inflation, because they haven't actually seen any real economic slowing. I think what's going to happen next few months is it's going to get a lot tougher, because the economy will slow. They've hiked enough. They're not hikes in the system. And we know from past cycles that there is a lead lag. There's time from the rage rising so they actually get the slowing and making its way through the system. So they're going to start seeing better inflation numbers, worse economic numbers, but be in this spot that's going to feel terrible, because they're not going to want to slow the economy further. But while inflation will slow, it's not going to get to the numbers that they're hoping for. So I think it'll be a much tougher call for them in a few months. Right now, my guess is they're going to stay roughly like what's priced in. They're not going to want to kind of obsess the apple card that I'm trying to roughly what's priced in. Once the economy starts slowing, they'll have a tougher call. And my guess is they're going to need to start having aggressive hikes again in order to make sure that inflation actually gets under control and suffer a lot more economic pain than they're hoping to. Karen, what's your take on China? Could it be that actually it's much worse than expected? And that would also justify the OPEC code. I think that China is worse than expected in the sense that look, China is the most disconnected economy. It definitely has its own cycle. It's easy and tidying in its own pace. It already has had a pretty deep recession. And it's trying to stimulate relative to that. But its stimulation has not been super effective. And they haven't kind of pulled out all the stops, if you will, because while they're not constrained by inflation, they're the one economy in the world that doesn't have a major inflation problem, they do feel constrained by a lot of other issues. They really want to change the quality of growth. They want to make sure that the property sector actually delivers. They want to make sure that basically new debts don't get created as a way of responding to the slowdown. And so there in a situation where they're not really turning their economy around in a huge way. They're not going to be in a deep recession, but they're not going to be the global engine and growth that can offset how we, the rest of the world, is going to be. And that means that, especially from a commodity perspective, oil less than other commodities, that there are major, major source of demand. And if property sector is the thing they need to slow, that's where a lot of commodities go. Karen, thank you so much for the terrific brief. And Karen Karnial, Tom Boer, there are Co-Chief Investment Officer for Sustainability at Bridgewater Associates. Now, coming up, demand slowdown, hiring freezes, and the end of easy money.

Francine, yes, this is a perfect environment to talk about what has happened within the tech sector at a time of course of higher rates and valuations coming down. European tech companies have raised about $55,000,000,000 this year. So it's not all bad news, but of course it is a more challenging environment.

Meena, thank you for coming on to the show. Let's start then with this environment that tech is facing. Higher interest rates, lower growth, and a lot of pressured cut costs is tech being brought back to Earth at this point. First of all, thanks for having me Tom.

So we are seeing across the board some level of cost cutting, but where there's great companies, they will still continue to invest in growth. It does bring to mind that famous Warren Buffett quote, when the tide goes out you see who's been swimming naked. Are you seeing a tick up in failures? I think there will be, don't forget, a lot of companies raised a lot of capital last year. So there will be many that do ride the storm, but it's a matter of which companies become the acquirers versus which ones are the ones that get acquired ultimately. The valuations troughed. We've seen them come down, so we invested at the very early stage, so at the Series A, and obviously public markets have come down, and that has trickled down. And so at the start of the year there was a big mismatch between investors and founders just from evaluation expectations, but now we're seeing that come back together for sure.

11895," 🎵 Why is everybody want to be a consultant and what are all these consultants doing? Well David, I think that we actually defy the label consultant because sometimes consultant seems to imply that we only give advice and when you look at what Accenture does, we're really different than the traditional version of a consultant. We're really about relevance and results and that's what is driving our business. What about a consulting project? In my example on the CEO I have a problem, I call you up, I say solve my problem or give me a solution. We don't operate as big companies permanently in crisis mode and so when you think about like how long does it solve things, a lot of it starts with you know the company being willing to set aggressive goals and so what we are trying to do now is work with our clients to work differently and to work faster.

Well, good morning everyone and welcome to Bloomberg's rounds early edition of Fronting Lacqua here in London. Now, 300 billion pounds has been wiped from UK stocks and bonds over this trust's first month as Prime Minister. It follows the market route over her government's sweeping tax on borrowing plans. You can see our next guest sitting to the right of the UK Chancellor. She's one of the top city bosses at the Chancellor Met, the Tri-Morstor Market Conference. Well, I'm very pleased to welcome Tina Lee, Chief Executive from the UK and Ireland at Deutsche Bank. Tina, always such a pleasure to speak to you. Make these smarter on what we should be looking out for in terms of pitfalls, but also opportunities. First of all, what's your take on the UK right now? You sat next to the Chancellor. There's obviously a credibility problem that was played on the markets. Can they get back on their feet? I think they can. I mean, there's been a lot of sound and fury that we have seen over the last 10 days. And I think the work that the Bank of England has done in terms of announcing their guilt purchase scheme has clearly calmed markets. And we've seen that in where Sterling has moved to to levels where it was before the mini budget and guilty yields of obviously stabilise, even though at much higher levels. So I think we have a pause here. The question, obviously, is around the medium term financial plan. That is on November the 23rd. That will be coming, obviously, with the OBR assessment, which I think will be key. And that was one of the things which spooked markets because that was lacking with the mini budget statement. So I think for me, the question is given that the Bank of England.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,121,2022-10-06 08:33:16
11896," BK and that was one of the things which spooked markets because that was lacking with the mini budget statement So I think for me the question is Given that the Bank of England will conclude or allegedly conclude that their purchase scheme by October the 14th What happens between now and the 23rd so Much of that is around I think communication with the market that was missing Which is strange because they they also put the markets are certainly the city at the the kind of the forefront of their plan That's right. That's right. So I think that started to happen We saw the coordinated statements from the chancellor and from the Bank of England early last week The purchase scheme was helpful and also made some of the statements which have been coming out of the chancellor with regard to his commitment to fiscal discipline You know when you look at you know the the Bank of England and the fact that they're starting Qt. I don't know whether they need to wait or whether This is something that you know make a huge difference for your bank So Qt I think is a program that the Bank of England has spent quite some while preparing the markets for so The Bank of England will still be committed to that program What happens though is more focused on the short term in other words? You know do we actually see a slight adjustment to that program? Do we see an operation twist? Type option where perhaps the bank bank of England made by Longbonds and actually sell short short Short gilts But that I think remains to be seen so I think Qt is absolutely on the cards and that's something which which we're anticipating Is going to actually play into the supply of gilts for 2023? I think you also have some great new headquarters in London right in a year How committed is Deutsche Bank to London and to the UK? We are very committed so I think as you rightly say we've got flagship headquarters Which is right now under construction and we'll be moving in in October of next year And so what does that mean in terms of your role though for for your clients? Will your role change given the uncertainty in the UK? So is it you know attracting investment? Is it clients elsewhere that that's the opportunities because of pound or are people pulling back right now? No, absolutely not. I mean we have so many clients here in the UK and as you know London is a great cross-border Financial center so that was actually very much the crux of the conversations that we were having with the chancellor and his team last week Around actually how is an industry we can continue to support London as a leading global financial center and continue to attract capital and talent Inter-London so I think that is not just about the short term That's also through the medium term as well, but the UK and especially London seems to have lost quite a lot to Amsterdam in terms of IPOs And things going through the pipeline Do you think this government understands what is needed to get that back? I know there was also talking about for example ministers being able to supersede some of the regulators in attracting IPOs Yes, so I mean IPOs are really at the end of the value chain Yeah And actually the focus and and again some of the key messages that we've delivered to the chancellor and his team is around the Need to support startups to support seed funding and actually make sure that those high growth companies actually stay in London and IPOs Actually fall out of that in two five ten years time so so for us it's a long game You know this isn't something that can either change the positive or the negative overnight It's really commitment to London as a financial center. That's really important Do you think you'd play a role also you know further norath or in in in brand new elsewhere? You mean in the UK and the UK we already have over a thousand people in Birmingham Yeah, so that is a center which we will continue to be investing in and we also have operations in in Ireland as well So the UK will continue to be a significant region really for Deutsche Bank Group Both in terms of profitability But also the depth of talent that we're able to source here in the UK I have a million questions also on you know the relationship between the UK and of course Europe on clearing houses and things like that Do you I mean would you move people? I know you've moved you've already moved some people great to continental Europe That's right. I mean for Deutsche Bank We've always been very fortunate in the sense that we have such a significant operation already not only in Frankfurt But in the other European hubs so we have moved people in the low hundreds That's working incredibly well and we continue to monitor where it's best place for our people to be both in terms of Sales coverage but also in terms of risk taking what's your biggest challenge right now? I mean that there's a lot",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,122,2022-10-06 08:37:38
11897," And we continue to monitor where it's best place for our people to be, both in terms of sales coverage, but also in terms of risk taking. What's your biggest challenge right now? I mean, there's a lot happening in the UK. It's also, I guess, you know, trying to get people still to return to the office. I imagine some of them want to work from home as chief executive of the UK. I mean, you're juggling so much. What do you think is hardest? So, I think the hybrid working side of things, we've actually had lots of people return to the office. As you would expect, sales and trading are in five days a week. Really, the challenge is around our infrastructure functions. Not around getting them in, but actually making sure that there are reasons for them to come into the office. And that's really important. So, that's not just about me messaging that I'd love to see more people around. Deutsche Bank and around our offices, but also making sure that our leaders and our managers across the whole region really make it worthwhile for our people to come in. Do you need to pay them more because inflationary pressures? Not necessarily. I mean, we're very mindful to cost of living. We're mindful to what inflation looks like here in the UK. I think, as we know, we're expecting CPI to peak at something like 11% by the end of this year. So, and we're looking at the talent market. So, there will be pockets where the market for talent is extremely hot. We seek to remain competitive. We're not looking at wholesale increases in terms of salaries, in terms of addressing the cost of living crisis, but we are very focused on being competitive. Do you know, overall, do you think this government will be business-friendly after the mayhem that we saw over the last 10 days? Do you think there'll be good for activity? There'll be good for business. There'll be good for the city of London. So, I think what we have all welcomed is the engagement actually from this government. Both in terms of wanting to hear directly from industry, and I should say not just financial services, but from business more broadly. Clearly, the growth agenda is a key priority for this government, and will be critical in terms of how the market assesses the medium-term fiscal plan. So, it's not a question of top-down. They're very keen to hear from practitioners what we can do to help support that growth agenda. So, what would you need from them? I don't know whether there's too much red tape or, again, it's regulation that needs to be loosened up a bit to be able to rival other European capital. So, I think there's always room for improvement when it comes to the regulatory framework. However, in my view, I think it's more about streamlining, rather than sort of wholesale change and a race to the bottom. So, for me, it's very much evolution rather than revolution. I mean, remember, we have some of the most sophisticated regulators here in the UK, and for me, that is actually a necessary foundation for stable and financial markets. Yeah, but some people say it's too regulated, right? It makes them more difficult because regulation is so high compared to other places. That's right. And I think that the government is open to actually hearing that, and I would say actually our regulators are too. So, I think watch this space. It's early days, but I think there's lots of areas where the breadth of regulation and the number of regulators potentially can be streamlined. When you speak to a lot of your clients, are they ready to put more money in the UK in terms of investments, or is it a little bit of a way to see because of the shock last 10 days? I would say that some clients are pausing, and I think that's reasonable. And as I said, we have a period of time between now and November the 23rd. We have seen sterling depreciate somewhat against the US dollar. That's now recovered to about the 1,12, 1,13 level, which is where it was before the mini-budget. But obviously, I think we should be very mindful of the value of sterling because that does have an ultimate impact in terms of the value of UK PLC. Do you worry? One of the things that we're looking at is mortgages, which I don't think impacts you directly. But does it impact the viability of certain firms? Do you worry that certain customers in the UK will go bust because of what will live through in the next four or four months? I think as you said, for Deutsche Bank, that's not a relevant impact. So, for us, it's really second order in terms of the impact for us. We really are really focused on speaking with our UK clients and really helping them navigate what are really tricky markets and arising into stray environments. Tina, thank you so much. As always, for joining us, Tina Lee, the Chief Executive Officer for the UK and Ireland at Deutsche Bank, joining us for an exclusive conversation on the City of London.

11898," Deutsche Bank joining us for an exclusive conversation on the City of London. Now let's get straight to the Bloomberg. First word news, here's Leanne Gertz. Hi Leanne. Hi Francine. The World Trade Organization says global trade will slow next year's major economies face strong headwinds. The WTO is forecasting that global goods trade will now grow by 1% next year. A big revision on its previous estimate of 3.4%. It blames the cocktail of factors including rising prices, restricted energy supplies, and growing US-Tina tensions. German factory orders dropped in August, hinting at a lack of momentum as your biggest economy stands on the brink of a recession. Demand failed 2.4% from the previous month, though data for July was revised upwards to show again this came after the late reporting of some large aerospace orders. North Korea has fired two suspected short-range ballistic missiles towards waters where US aircraft carrier had been deployed, making a total of 10 launches in less than two weeks. That's one of its biggest test barragers under leader Kim Jong Un. The firings came shortly after Pyongyang condemned the Biden administration for escalating tensions. And King Charles is expected to be crowned on June 3rd next year in a ceremony at Westminster Abbey. Bloomberg has learned that the British officials are converging on that date, although talks are still ongoing. The coronation comes almost 70 years after his late mother was crowned and will form the centerpiece of days of celebrations to mark the beginning of the monarch's reign. Global news, 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg, quick take, powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries and the Anne Gehrins. This is Bloomberg, calls for a street party, Francine. Always a street party. I'm always in you, you organize. If I get my voice back. This is, Leanne, all the street party that you and I have been doing. Except you keep your voice. I lose it. This is the problem. OPEC Plus, let's get back to business. OPEC Plus defies Washington, agreeing to the biggest production cut since 2020. Now we'll bring you the very latest on that next. This is Bloomberg. China's military power has been growing at an incredible speed over the last 20 years. A strong country must have a strong military as only then can it guarantee the security of the nation. In terms of sphere of influence, we absolutely know that China wants to be dominant in Asia. So there is a target to get to that point, to be a military that is appear to the greatest militaries in the world by 2035. The competition for influence is a global one. And through a multi-decade trajectory fueled by planning, money, and pragmatism, China is building a military that allows it to shape the 21st century just as the US shaped the 20th.

For the comprehensive platform that helps you work smarter and faster, the difference is Bloomberg Law. Economics, finance, politics. This is Bloomberg's surveillance early edition of Frontsy Lacqua here in London. Now, OPEC Plus has agreed to cut its output by the most in two years, earning a rebuke from the White House. Meanwhile, the EU approved new sanctions on Russian oil drawing a veiled threat from Moscow. Now, let's head to Vienna again, or Bloomberg's managed cranny is standing by, Manus, first of all, great interviews. So what's the latest? Bran. Well, the latest is job done. Isn't it mission accomplished? Markets up six, seven, eight, nine percent in this base of four days, or is it? Are we about to embark on a very serious period of conflict? Having Joe Biden expanded a great deal of political capital on a reproach, which might be under reconsideration. The message is very clear. We're worried about price caps. The message is doubly clear, which is for Russia. Price caps could mean production reductions. But the Saudi minister, his Royal Highness Prince of Dulles, has been summoned. We're not here to deliberately jack up prices. No, Manus, I'm not setting the stage for jumbo cuts to come. This is about moving on from a monolithic issue which was COVID, in splendid isolation, to a whole host of uncertainties. But of course, this was the issue, as to whether he likes to keep speculators outing like how, and whether that job was done. Let's take a listen to the prints. Masakas, or I said this, but I was talking about more to do with making sure that we have disciplined market, a market that serves its original purposes, which is a market that has sufficient liquidity. That liquidity has been handled by extreme volatility. Extreme volatility, unfortunately, brings premiums to become very expensive. And that market is so fragile, it is still a liquid. There's a warning shot there from his Royal Highness. But of course, it's about the volatility, Francine, that could come from price caps. And that's perhaps the deeper story at play here in OPEC Plus. The known unknowns, and now the unknown unknowns, Francine. Yeah, I feel like it's all falling apart. What's next for Saudi-US relations? I think Saudi-US relations are going to be tested. This is where you know, the adults need to stand up in the room. You've had the Biden-Jakes Sullivan immediate response in the depths of the press conference. You want to cut. You want to cut by two million barrels a day. I will see you and raise you. I'll go for an S.P.O. release. And you know what? You want to get frisky with me again? I'll unleash the hines of Congress and raise the spectre of no-peg. That might get everybody outing a little bit more in the building behind me. But when it comes to the Russians, they are much more focused on the price caps. But these relationships between the USA and America is brother Cain and fist bump the President of the United States of America. That's called global political capital, Francine. Yeah, and certainly, if Manus, thank you so much. Manus Crenny, they're the very latest. And of course, talk about his two great interviews. Now, sticking to energy for more on this, let's also get Maria today, who's live for us in Prague. This morning, where an extraordinary summit is being held. So, Maria, the head of the commission or sub-underline calling for a gas price cap. Will it actually happen? Yes, she has in Francine. Now she's put it on paper. This is a letter she sent out to all the heads of states of the EU 27 countries yesterday, in which she argues, when you look at the prices in the Dutch benchmark, the TTF, it no longer reflects, according to the head of the commission, the real cost of gas. And therefore, the European Union needs to transition away from it. And that means temporarily a cap. The problem is, and this is the fundamental issue, is that you have a growing number of countries that call for it. The commission now responding on paper, but they can't agree on a formula. And we talk about a price.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,125,2022-10-06 08:50:47
11900, issue is that you have a growing number of countries that call for it. The commission now responding on paper but they can't agree on a formula. When we talk about a price cap Francine there's at least five different options on the table and then the other issue is the Germany's still not behind this idea and then there's a ramifications potentially. If prices do go down the maybe demand destruction will not be as intensive as it needs to be so then you're back to square one. Yeah the problem with all of that is that there's also politics in the middle so what happens in the politics? You have 44 heads of states and I think the UK Prime Minister is also arriving. Yes and Francine she is here today it's finally confirmed remember at one point there was questions as to whether or not she would attend this meeting is a European political community of course countries that are members of the EU but also others that don't and the idea here is that they can sit around and debate issues they have in common. Now for this trust she gets a step away from her domestic problems for a few hours potentially meet with Emma and my co-member a few weeks ago she was asked is he a friend or a foe of the UK and she said they're juries out maybe today they clarify issues also issues around Brexit and then you have the Ukrainian question which is still the perennial debate here especially because the Turkish president is going to be here too and he has been key in that green deal which could perhaps expire going into the winter so there's a lot of Ukraine to hear. Maria overall I mean when you look at the different players or who are the heads of state that you'll be watching out more closely for. Well Francine today really is a Emanuele McCorn this is his baby to some extent he was the one that pitched this idea and when I spoke to French diplomats yesterday they say to some extent this is already a went-through French diplomacy the fact that we're here today in Prague and this meeting is called the European political community may actually help to reset some of the difficult relations like the UK but not only and then of course it's all of shouts you know there's a lot at play with that mega package to 100 billion euros remember Francine it sparked a lot of tensions and there is a feeling here the Germany still has some explaining to do. Yeah that's absolutely right Maria thanks so much Maria today oh they're in Prague for us now coming up we stay in Vienna throughout the morning to bring you the very latest on OPEC's biggest production cuts in two years this is Bloomberg No one covers the world like Bloomberg. The pressure broker just got far too hot in banning him for the government to handle. You foresee two-thirds of the crypto hedge funds will disappear are we close?

11901," In terms of green funding, the Kishit administration has committed to doubling the amount of investments in so-called green technologies. I think we need more than just pronouncements. We need real money backing, very innovative startups, and innovative companies in this space. What do you make of Kishit's new capitalism? I think he is framework is reflective of the challenges that Japan's society is facing, namely, that growth has been present, but growth has not been, of course, evenly distributed. But frankly speaking, it's hard to register the income if you don't have a income to begin with. If the government and private sector can work together and collaborate to drive more, you know, innovative growth startups, that can really drive the income growth that the Kishit government needs to redistribute. The economics finance politics, this is Bloomberg's Relance Early Edition. I'm from St. London. Bloomberg has agreed to postpone the billionaire's long awaited deposition in the company's lawsuit.

11902," Apple has identified its next big business, bringing advertisements to more parts of your iPhone. Today, Apple pushes ads in three places, the App Store, Apple News, and the Stocks App. In the news and stocks apps, Apple shows display advertisements. That means that third party companies like car dealerships or mortgage lenders can showcase their advertisements just like they can on a website. On the App Store, the situation is different. There Apple has search ads. This allows developers to buy their way and dishoeing a buyer on search results. For instance, an App Store developer can bid for the term car racing or basketball so their apps would surface above competing apps in the list of results. Apple's push into ads is a little ironic, given that its ATT or app tracking transparency privacy feature limits the ability for Meta, Snap, and even smaller developers to generate as much revenue as possible for advertising. That's because the feature allows users to choose if they want their data collected and tracked across third party apps and websites. Still, Apple's hoping to expand its own ads business and is planning to add search ads to its Maps app. Other areas where ads could eventually appear are in Apple Books and Apple podcasts, along maybe one day with an ad supported tier of Apple TV Plus to compete with new offerings from Netflix and other streaming video providers. I'm Mark Gurman. This is Power On. Hey, so you've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. They have. I've been in insane it. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloombergs. Bag of Bloombergs. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloombergch. I've seen the Bloombergch. What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? What does that mean? It means they have a boomerick. This has been an incredibly tough year for the bulls. It's been a great year for the bears. There's a lot of distortion in the data. It's really about finding what's going to work in a persistent high inflation environment. I think that there's a concern in the broader financial markets that something might happen within the US markets. It's just the uncertainty factor that's keeping markets on edge. This is Bloomberg surveillance, early edition with Anna Edwards, Matt Miller and Kaley Lines. It's 10 a.m. in London, 5 a.m. in New York and 5 p.m. in Hong Kong. Our top stories today. Traders versus the Federal Reserve. They keep betting that the central bank will cut rates next year, even though Fed policymakers keep saying that they won't. The OPEC plus oil production cuts, the Saudis, stopping President Biden and helping Putin. And European leaders meeting Prague. The summit will be dominated by the energy crisis and the war in Ukraine. Welcome to Bloomberg's surveillance, early edition. I'm Anna Edwards in London with Matt Miller and Kaley Lines in New York and Kaley. The European market is kind of catching up with the US of yesterday today. The global vibe, though, seems to be trying to work out what the significance is of those production cuts from OPEC. What that does to inflation and to global growth? Yeah, and we're going to have more on those stories in just a minute. And of course, by extension of wondering what it means for inflation, there is a question of what it means for central bank policy. As we've had the pivot conversation revival in recent days. And of course, that is something they also pay attention to in Asian markets, where it really was a mixed picture for equities overall. You did have the MSCI Asia Pacific index as a whole up about three tenths of 1% in part due to the gains in markets like Japan. But you had some underperformance as well coming from Hong Kong, which saw some of the gains of yesterday, the best day for six months in the Tuesday session, retreating a little bit with the hang saying down about four tenths of 1%.

11903," from Hong Kong, which saw some of the gains of yesterday, the best day for six months in the Tuesday session, retreating a little bit with the hang saying down about four tenths of one percent. Now, as I raised the central bank question, of course, you've had Fed speakers pushing back on the idea of a pivot, pushing back on the idea of rate cuts coming in 2023. And that has put some more upward pressure on bond yields. And Australia, for example, overnight, the 10-year yield rising 14 basis points to the 377 level. One interesting thing I wanted to point out in foreign exchange as well, the South Korean want stronger against the dollar for a fifth day in a row. That is, it's best five days against the dollar going back to the spring of 2020 strengthening by about six tenths of a percent this morning trading right around the 1400 level. All right. We are looking at S&P futures that are down this morning after a down day yesterday. Although it should be mentioned, we were off a lot more. And Wells Fargo has come out and said they believe that one options trade yesterday provided a big bounce in the market because market makers had to reposition themselves by going out and buying the underlying equities. So really interesting trade, great story in the Bloomberg recommend you check it out. Nonetheless, looks like we're heading back down again today. Only four tenths of one percent, not looking at the one percent plus drops in futures that we saw yesterday at this time. We do see the Bloomberg dollar index starting to climb a little bit, though. And if you looked at the chart, the one day chart of this, you would see that it had come down and is now going much further back up. So the gain of only one tenth of one percent of the dollar index doesn't look terribly significant until you back out and see from where we've come or from whence maybe I got to ask Anna about that. The 10 year yield right now barely changed but at 375. So still at a relatively high level. And again, this is a case of a yield that was down and has come back up through the unchanged level into, well for a moment, into positive territory. Nonetheless, the point is it's come up from a lower level and 9X crude as well, 87, 82 after the big cuts that we got yesterday from OPEC and all the surrounding stories about how OPEC may be sliding now with China and Russia. We saw some gains in this market. Although they're not quite so pronounced. You see two million barrels a day and you think we're going to see a huge jump. We have seen forecasts though for bigger gains in Brent especially, right? Goldman Sachs says one tenth of barrel now. By year act. Yeah, absolutely. From whence we came, I don't know, sounds maybe right, Matt, but even here in New Old England, that sounds a little old fashioned. So maybe not. Let's have a look at European markets. We've got a European stocks. Give us a pretty kind of mixed picture right now. Felly flat, either side of the flat line down a quarter of 1%. And that is again an oil story down by a quarter of 1%. The cat caron, Felly flat, the DAX, up a tenth of a percent. Let's have a look at where we are on some of the fixed income stories and energy stories across Europe because these are having an impact. There's a big focus once again on the long end of the UK gilt curve. Yes, we know the Bank of England is operating here. Yes, we know that they're doing quantitative easing essentially. They're buying some of the bonds in the market there to stabilize the market still. They haven't been doing that so actively over the last couple of days. But a lot of people ask you, what happens when we get to the end of the cliff edge, we've seen mortgage rates rising in the UK and that's adding to concerns about how this spreads into the underlying economy. Conversation's going on about that. The Italian two year yield in focus as well. We had seen this yield rising, we've seen the 10 year yield rising up to pretty recently. And a lot of this to do with concerns about where BTP yields go if we start to see the new government in New Zealand trying to take fiscal action to support the economy there. One of the rating agencies out with a warning to watch those developments. Brent Crude, Matt's already talked about where we are on oil, only up by two tenths of one percent. Matt's point about how we haven't seen outsized reaction, perhaps to those cuts in production. Are they really going to be as much as billed and have we seen a big run up in prices in the expectation of these cuts? Both of those could be true. But as Matt says, 110 is the call now for some. We've seen Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and UBS all talking about going north of 100. And Shell, despite the fact that we have a broadly supportive environment for oil prices, then Shell is losing ground today. Down by 4.4 percent, they put out a trading update, Kayleigh, and some analysts talking about that being a little bit weak in terms of their performance. All right, Anna, well let's get back to the central bank story because Fed officials keep repeating the mantra that they don't plan to cut interest rates next year. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daley and Atlanta Fed President Rafael Bostic were the latest to bang the drum on the need to keep tightening to place in place to reduce inflation. Mary Daley spoke to Bloomberg's Michael McKee in an interview yesterday.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,129,2022-10-06 09:08:24
11904," We're the latest to bang the drum on the need to keep tightening to place in place to reduce inflation. Mary Daly spoke to Bloomberg's Michael McKee in an interview yesterday. I don't see that happening at all. I see us as raising to a level that we believe is restrictive enough to bring inflation down and then holding it there until we see inflation truly get close to 2% and demonstrate that price stability is restored. Bloomberg's Danny Berger joins us now for more. So Danny, their message is cleared. The question is, is the market receiving it? No, not really to put it just flatly, Kayleigh, because we are still pricing in cuts for next year. So for our radio listening audience, I have the Euro Dollar Curves up on a chart in front of me. I'm looking at next year's what's implied for rate cuts and for 2024. So at the moment, we're implying one rate cut in 2023 of 25 basis points and at least two in 2024. Again, this is not what the Fed is saying, saying both daily there and Boston yesterday saying, we're going to hike rates. And then once we get there, we're staying at this restrictive level to make sure that we have conquered inflation. So that's potentially why we will see more jittery markets again, things like tomorrow's pay rolls report, because we're looking out for any of those clues if there are cracks that would allow them potentially to cut next year. But for the time being, no, the markets are not listening to the Fed saying that they will keep rates restrictive. Danny, I also saw a great story on the Bloomberg last night pointing out that world currency reserves are shrinking to the tune of about $1 trillion or about 8%. That's a big drop. Not only is it a big drop, Matt, but for that level of it happening in the first half of the year, that's the most that we've ever seen since the Bloomberg data, which goes back to 2003. At heart of the issue here is the fact that the dollar is rising. So all of a sudden things like Euro, again, all those are the reserve currencies. They've become less valuable. Then at the same time, you have treasury selling off. So if these foreign reserves are in the form of treasury, that's all of a sudden less valuable and these countries are spending on energy. So it just means that the firepower they have in their tank to spend to defend their currencies is significantly lower, because they're not going to get the same amount back. For example, if they were to sell off treasuries are US denominated assets right now. And so at the moment, a lot of these countries still have enough ethics reserves to continue to defend their currency. But the thing is the Fed, as we're just saying, isn't going to pivot. So this could potentially just continue to deteriorate and continue to deteriorate the firepower of countries to defend currencies. Yeah, and I'm saying, and Danny, we've talked a lot about, of course, the Japanese doing this, but India, the Czech Republic, others also spending big on that front. Danny, thanks very much. Bloomberg, Sunnyburg with the latest on those market themes. Let's turn to one of the important drivers today. And that is oil policy. OPEC Plus agreed to make a large production cut to keep oil prices high, drawing an immediate rebuke from the United States. The move was defended by ministers from the producers group as necessary to protect the oil industry and their own economies from the risk of a global slowdown. Bloomberg's Manus Cranny joins us now from Vienna. Manus, what did you walk away with from the last 24 hours? What stands out to you? Look, I think it's a comprehensive seize. It's the cuts which are sizable, but I realize that the cuts, the caps, the price caps that are coming, the capital, the political capital, which has been expanded by the White House. And in some ways, perhaps rebuke by, not just Saudi alone, but by the OPEC Plus, by the arrival of Alexander Novak here in the heart of Europe, the deputy prime minister. But they're not deliberately trying to jack up the price of oil. Both sides, the Russians and the societies exclusively speaking to Bloomberg, talking about their concerns about the price caps. You know, price caps are supposed to keep the oil flowing through the system, but the risk to Russian production is very clear. That's going to drop. Who's going to fill that void? But of course, it is the lack of precision detail. It's going to deliver more volatility on a growth shock as well in the next couple of months. Let's listen in to his Royal Highness, Prince of Dulles, his Bin Salman on his take on caps. Pack of details and lack of clarity and the lack of the fact that we still have two months to go for that these two things.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,130,2022-10-06 09:12:20
11905," Ack of details and lack of clarity and the lack of the fact that we still have two months to go for these two things to be activated, these two months would be a period of uncertainty. We don't see what would be the reaction of the market, of the participant. Israel Hain is also wanting to be preemptive and went on. We talked about inflation and the dollar and this is going to stoke inflation. This is going to refuel inflation and he said to me, he said there is a vehement commitment by these central banks to tame inflation at any cost to growth and that's perhaps part of the narrative about why, potentially why, they are taking this preemptive action in terms of cuts are there some pretty awful data that they've seen that we haven't quite worked out. Alright well, Manus, you hinted at the conversation you had with Russian Deputy Prime Minister Novak as you said in your updates after being sanctioned. What were the highlights from your discussions with him? A couple of big takeaways, Kelly, good to be with you, which is they're not really talking about potentially cutting off the gas through Ukraine, that's in the depths of the interview. Go and listen to it, wouldn't exactly respond but it certainly doesn't sound as they've cutting off the gas route through Ukraine is really on the table. That's point one. The second and perhaps more important point is, are you at an energy war with the EU? He said no, it's not an energy war, it's a special situation. So again, go back and listen to that. It's about reframing the narrative. He sanctioned by the EU but he is not sanctioned by the Europeans and he is flowing in here. I think in the weeds of all of this, I want you to take away one thing. The OPEC-plus agreement has been extended. There is no sign of fracture between the OPEC family and the PLUS family which is Russia and that is causing the air of the White House and I'll tell you what, the hens have been unleashed, more SPR, more oil from America, count to your cut and I tell you what, his oil hens likes to keep the markets and the speculators outing like hell. I'll tell you what, if no PEC comes to life in Congress, it could keep a few people here and in the hot climates as well of the GCC, outing like hell. Manus, thanks very much. Bloomberg's Manus Tranny there reporting from Vienna. We're going to have more on his oil interviews later on in the hour. Right now I want to talk about the leaders on other energy story really. The leaders of 44 countries descending on Prague for an extraordinary summit being held in the shadows of Russia's war in Ukraine. For European leaders, the focus is firmly on energy. This comes after Ursula Fonderlion, European Commission President proposed a gas price cap she spoke to the European Parliament yesterday. Such a cap on gas prices must be designed properly to ensure security of supply and it is a temporary solution to cater for the fact that the TTF, that is our main price benchmark, is no longer representative for our market. Introducing a cap on gas overall is a temporary solution until we will have a new EU price index developed that ensures a better functioning of the market. Bloomberg's Maria today are joining us now in Prague. Maria, the head of the Commission, Fonderlion calling for a price cap. Is it actually going to happen? What she has and Matt, she's now put it in paper. This is a letter that she sent yesterday to the EU27 heads of states and what she says. When you look at the Dutch benchmark, the TTF, it no longer reflects the real cost of gas. We have to move away, but in the meantime, there will be a cap. The issue here, and this is fundamentally the problem. She has a growing number of countries in the EU that call for it. The Commission has to respond. But when you look at a cap, the problem is there is about five different versions of it. It's not clear what the formula would look like. And then on top of that, you have the political tensions that come.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,131,2022-10-06 09:16:34
11906," A cap, the problem is there's about five different versions of it. It's not clear what the formula would look like. And then on top of that, you have the political tensions that come with this. When you look at countries like Germany, they say they worry about the supply and the impact that this would have. And then, of course, the ramifications that could come with lower costs. The idea is that to get ahead in the winter, you need storage, you need supply, but you also need demand destruction. If prices go down, then maybe people will turn on the heat. And so you can see that this is incredibly complicated and very complex. Is it often this when you look at a continent that essentially has 27 different systems? Maria, thank you very much. Maria, is it with the latest from Prague? Kaley? All right, Anna, well, let's take a look at some of the stocks moving in pre-market trading here in the US as well. And keep an eye on some of those company stories. Of course, the one that has caught all of our attention this week is Twitter and Elon Musk. We are still awaiting further progress on that deal after Elon Musk said he wants to go through with that $44 billion buy. The question is, will the financing line up? What happens with the lawsuit? There is still a lot unanswered. And as a result, you still have Twitter shares trading below that $54.20 offer price right now. Twitter trading at $50.86 this morning, down about 9.10 of 1% in Tesla for its part, down about 8.10 of 1% in early hours. There is also a question of whether Elon Musk has to sell some of his stake in the EV maker in order to fund that deal. One stock moving higher though is Pinterest, Goldman Sachs, upgrading the stock overnight to the equivalent of a buy rating, putting a $31 price target on the stock. That would imply more than 20% upside from where it closed yesterday. 26% upside, I believe. It's higher by 5% in pre-market trading this morning right now trading at 25.90 in up. Okay, we're keeping on Pinterest. Coming up on the program then, Kaylee, we will talk to Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller, Tayback. Get his perspective on the pivot, no pivot, what's the latest thinking there and a $100 billion bust. Self-driving cars were supposed to be the future but detractors are getting louder as the losses are getting bigger. Read more in today's big take on Bloomberg.com or on the Bloomberg terminal. This is Bloomberg. Let's check Estelle's business, the comments are coming to resolve some big problem. Sure. It's impossible the industries in an arms race that will lead to spending itself into an oversupply. I mean, that has happened before. We've looked at this very carefully and the digitization of everything. Tell me what aspect of your life, Emily, isn't becoming more digital. Well, I'm trying to prevent that, but yeah, I think it's happening. And COVID has accelerated that. The industry cost $500 billion last year, the semiconductor industry overall, and estimates are a trillion dollars, a doubling by the end of the decade at that point. I believe those estimates, it's not that there's not going to be some blips and turns on the way, and the majority of that is driven by leadership process technology, of which only three companies can satisfy that need.

11907, are it'll be your favorite way to stay in the game catch the lineup Friday's and Saturday's only on Bloomberg welcome back to Bloomberg surveillance is the early edition on Matt Miller with Kayleigh lines here in New York and Edwards with us out of London I'm looking at a chart here for those of you listening on radio that shows the estimate for GDP going into next year clearly it's down as markets are expecting a recession as well as the estimate for core PCE which the Fed really focuses on that continues to rise so the question is why do we see expectations of reportedly a Fed pivot driving markets up as we did on Monday and Tuesday is it that the market expects a recession and the Fed to turn around in the face of that or is it that the market expects inflation to come down which doesn't look like the case from this chart let's bring in is Simon White with us Simon White is with us right now Simon you wrote a fascinating piece for the daybreak newsletter which is why I wanted to have you on this morning I thought that the market maybe expected inflation to come down which is why they think the Fed will cut because the Fed has been really vehement that it is going to only lower rates one inflation gets back to 2% not because the economy falls into a recession so yeah it's very curious the bear market we're in today's you know one of the 20% worst bear market since 1929 so the equity markets kind of saying a recession is coming and the curious thing really is that and you'd expect lower prices would increase the probability of lower prices still but if you look at option markets what's actually happening is that the sort of demand for crash insurance is relatively declining so the market's kind of saying yeah lower prices we might have a recession but also it's basically saying that the Fed put is getting closer so therefore you know there's no as need demand for this sort of crash insurance okay so would you need to go out by that insurance even though you see downside not as much as before or at least you think the Fed has got your back yeah essentially I thought we'd been all retrained away from the Fed put Simon I thought we were supposed to expect that anymore the Fed is laser focused on inflation and so you know the equity markets can just keep selling off regardless it's been conditioned I think I mean as as much as the Fed has gone out of his way to say it's this is different right this time the empty market is basically saying we don't believe you when push comes to shove the market's down what 25% the max off the highs that is bad but I mean it could get a lot worse they're saying it's probably not going to so they're not paying up for that insurance okay Simon thanks very much thanks for bringing us the story you can read that on the Bloomberg terminal by strategist Simon White and for more on Simon's story and others check out the market's live blog MLID goes the function to use on your Bloomberg terminal this is Bloomberg Bloomberg has enhanced search on the terminal to deliver what you need when you need it now you can simply type phrases in every day English in the command line,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,133,2022-10-06 09:25:07

This is Bloomberg's surveillance early edition. I'm Kayleigh Lines with Matt Miller in New York and Anna Edwards in London. Now keeping you up to date with news from around the world, here's the first word. North Korea is ratcheting up the tensions in the region. It fired two suspected short-range ballistic missiles toward waters where US aircraft carrier had been deployed. Earlier this week, Kim Jong-un's regime launched its first rocket over Japan in five years. North Korea criticized the US for redeploying an aircraft carrier group to waters east of the peninsula. And Bloomberg has learned that before Elon Musk renewed his offer for Twitter at full price, he was seeking a discount. Musk's representatives in Twitter held talks in the last few weeks about a buyout for less than $44 billion. The New York Times says he was looking for a 30% reduction. And of course, that is one of the individual stock stories we continue to watch. But we are also watching stocks at large as we consider the possibility potential of a Fed pivot or a cut coming next year. We'll look at how optimistic this market really deserves to be. Matt Meiley, chief market strategist at Miller Taeback, is joining us coming up. This is Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,134,2022-10-06 09:29:26
11909," The standard way for venture firms work is you commit capital, let's say over a five thousand hours on your website, your account loans, your bank case, your interest time, right? So you would hope to get paid for their liquidity. And today, maybe 20 to 40 percent if things go well is sort of baseline. Let's take another subject. Such a post somebody says, I don't want to invest in Andrews and Horowitz. I want to be Mark Andrews. And how does somebody become a venture capitalist? What are the skill sets for good venture capitalists? It is high degree of intelligence, hard work, lot of luck, dress the right part, don't wear a tie. What are the things that make one a good venture capitalist? So the highly successful VCs historically are very idiosyncratic. You have people from very different backgrounds, Mike Morris is a former newspaper reporter, John Doris of former chip salesman. You've got people with very different midge and briar has more of this kind of blue chip investment background. You have people with very different backgrounds and experiences. And so I think it's some set of skills and some set of knowledge. And then there seems to be a taste component to it that's really hard to measure and really hard to predict. We'll mark it that over the past few weeks has made it clear it wants to go higher. It got a little spooked by the idea that geopold will potential to rise. This is Brunberg's surveillance early edition. Here's what you need to know. Traders versus the Federal Reserve, they keep betting that the central bank will cut rates next year, even though Fed policymakers keep saying that they won't. The OPEC class oil production cuts for Saudis are snobbing Biden and helping Putin. And European leaders meet in Prague. The summit will be dominated by the energy crisis and the war in Ukraine. I'm Anna Edwards in London with Matt Miller and Kayley Lines in New York and Matt, European equity markets have been just catching up really with the moves higher on US markets yesterday. And broadly speaking globally, investors trying to come to terms with what it means for OPEC to have cut production. What that means for inflation and for growth? Yeah, for sure. And higher oil prices are maybe bad for equities. We did have a big move lower in yesterday's cash trade. But then a jump higher, as I mentioned earlier, Wells Fargo thinks that was fueled by one big options trade, a $31 million option trade. I think it's really fascinating theory. Check it out. There's a story on the Brunberg terminal. We have what looks like not a lot of moves. Now, it stays like this where I'm kind of wishing for Dan Curtis's four-panel GIP screen. Because then you could see that we have a lot of drops and jumps just like yesterday's equity market. The S&P futures are down, but only four tenths of 1%. So maybe we didn't just see the options trade. Maybe it was the jobs number that also helped the moves yesterday because otherwise this number should be a lot lower. We do see the Bloomberg dollar index right now just above unchanged, but it had also been lower earlier. And I believe the dollar is still up against the pound and the euro. The 10-year yield was down earlier. It's back up now a little over one basis point, but it's a 376 and a half at a relatively high level. And this is a problem for equities as well as the oil price, which is at $8809 a barrel. This is for Texas Intermediate. Of course, Brent is up above 93. And we've seen forecasts from Goldman Sachs, for example, for Brent now to rise to 110 with those production cuts.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,135,2022-10-06 09:33:55
11910," The media, of course, Brent is up above 93 and we've seen forecasts from Goldman Sachs for example for Brent now to rise to 110 with those production cuts, which is a course of problem for manufacturers and anyone who uses energy like me and my truck. Kaley, what do you see in the pre-market movers? It always comes down to you and your cars, Matt. We know you better than that. Now speaking of cars, Tesla is one stock to watch in pre-market movers, specifically as it relates to Twitter because there is a lot of questions about that $44 billion deal from Elon Musk to buy Twitter that he wants to go ahead with. Will it go through? We still don't actually know for sure. As a result, Twitter is still trading below that $54.20 offer price right now at $50.79 down just about a percent in pre-market trading. Well, Tesla, coming back to the cars for you, Matt, down about $9.10 of 1%. But really that is kind of in keeping with what we're seeing more broadly in large-cap technology. And that is that they are mostly in the red in the early session here in the US and videos down by about 1.1% and Apple down by half a percent as well, Anna. Okay, Lee, European equity markets then making up for lost ground when it comes to the US session of yesterday up by two tenths of 1% on the Europe stocks, 600. These are some interesting moves in bond markets to get to and we're seeing selling of bonds broadly across the European space today, but this is government bonds. But we do see and we see a move higher therefore in the 30 year UK gilt yield. And this is in focus because we're getting closer and closer to that cliff edge that's been created by the Bank of England stepping in at the long end to try and car markets essentially after we got that so-called mini budget. What's interesting in the last hour, we've just heard from John Cumbliffe at the Bank of England saying that the Bank of England actually identified on the day of the mini budgets that there was a risk to the pension system and some of the insurance products that it relies upon. And so that's interesting because perhaps it suggests there was quite low tolerance, low buffers, risk buffers if you like, for what was going on in markets there. So we'll look for further details on how the market ready itself for normal functioning mid-October. The Italian two year yield also a little bit higher, but really the questions here are around what the new government is going to do. One of the rating agencies out with a note on that and shelled down by 4.2%. This on the back, Kaley, of a trading update from the business despite the fact we've seen higher oil prices have laid. We've seen OPEC cutting back on production. Shell moving lower on its trading update, which some investors or some analysts rather have described as a little bit weak. All right, and well that is one equity story we are watching today. Let's talk about equities more broadly now. Joining us is Matt Mealy, chief market strategist at Miller Taeback, up early in the morning for us in Massachusetts, which we always appreciate. Matt, it feels like the market is trying to decide if something has changed this week. The Federal Reserve, the speakers we are hearing from, is telling us nothing has changed. We are still staying in the course going to fight the fight on inflation until it is done. We are going to keep our a tire for longer. The market still though thinks now that they're going to cut in 2023. How optimistic are you about that possibility and what it means for your view on equities? Well, I'm not very optimistic on that view. However, I think a lot of investors are doing right now, especially on the institutional side, the biggest issue is what happened with Credit Suisse. People are thinking, oh my gosh, maybe something is broken. A lot of people have been saying for a long time that the Fed will keep tightening until something breaks. I think a lot of people are worried that that's what happened with Credit Suisse. Therefore, the Fed will have no choice but to pivot early next year. I'm not so sure that that's true, but if Credit Suisse is, there's definitely some issues there. But once those seem to be those issues come down, we still have to worry about a recession. The market right now is still on the expensive side. If we go into a recession, what happens in every recession, at least since World War 2, is earnings have gone down. If earnings go down and the market is already slightly expensive, they're going to get more expensive. The market's going to have to come down further. Whether we see a further rally over the next several weeks, I still think it's going to be a good opportunity to take some chips off the table. Just so I get a better understanding of what has gone wrong at Credit Suisse, Matt. They have tier one capital ratio of like 13, I think 13.8%, very strong. They're not looking to face liquidity issues in the near term, but it's been very much, it's been a lot more expensive to ensure against a default in their bonds, doesn't mean they're going to default. Their equity fell to an all time low and it looks like some market participants have pulled back in terms of giving them equities to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,136,2022-10-06 09:38:33
11911," their bonds doesn't mean they're going to default. Their equity fell to an all-time low, and it looks like some market participants have pulled back in terms of giving them equities to give out to short sellers. What specifically is the concern around Credit Suisse? Well, I think the biggest concern really involves their derivatives book. I mean, we have, oh, the bank, it wouldn't know, at least I don't think anybody's really talking about a repeat of 2008. But if people, if we're worried about counterparty risk, I guess, as people worry about, geez, if they're going to fail, or if they're not going to live up to their obligations, suddenly a bunch of hedges out there aren't hedges anymore. When they go to get their hedge and a bank like Credit Suisse would say, sorry, we're failing. That unravels a whole lot of hedges, and that creates a big problem. So that's the concern, whether that's a real risk or not, we don't know. But that's, I think, really, what the markets are betting on right now, that there's something with Credit Suisse will force the Fed to, even if they don't pivot, at least they'll pause. I don't think that's enough to really keep the market from falling further, but it could, but we get for longer than I had been thinking a week ago. Well, yesterday we heard Mary Daly tell Michael McKee that she wants to raise and hold, which I thought was a little bit more bullish than raise and raise, right? And in terms of the pivot, the Fed has been very clear, they're only going to cut rates once inflation gets back down to close to 2%. Now, what do you think they mean by that? Is 4% close to 2%, does it have to be 3 or less? Is there, do you think they have a set number in their head? Because inflation, especially after the cops of this year, next year is going to be much weaker? Well, the biggest concern I have is that even if it's, you know, people say, well, geez, maybe they'll raise it to 4%, that's going to be good. How good is that? I mean, really, again, in a stock market, because if we're at 4%, suddenly those, you know, 17, 18 times earnings, evaluations that we've been used to for a while, no longer are valid. You get, the higher those legislatures are, the lower the multiple has to be, and we're not there yet. So again, I think this is a situation where people are getting, you know, they're thinking, oh my gosh, if the Fed is not going to be quite as hawkish, therefore they're going to go back to QE. That's just not going to be the case. We're not going to be able to have those evaluations. So again, if we get a rally in the fourth quarter here, I don't think that's going to bow as well for next year as a lot of people think, because we're heading for a recession. That's just not good. Matt, I spoke to a guest earlier who told me that in his view, the pivot means stopping hiking. Others seem to think that a sufficient pivot for risk appetite could be stopping hiking so much. And some obviously think that we need to see cuts in interest rates to be a full sort of pivot. How are you thinking about, I'll be thinking about it in two binary of fashion, what a pivot from the Fed might mean? Yeah, I said, there should be pivot, or just just a pause enough. I mean, you know, again, that it'll be better for risk assets. If the Fed doesn't keep tightening, but it's not going to be better for inflation, inflation will create a problem, you know, creates a stagnation, et cetera. I mean, Ernie is going to have a negative impact on earnings, I guess is my point. And so that you do need, again, if you want to go back to what we saw before, before the Fed started tightening, you need a cut in interest rates and QE to justify those high evaluations. And we're just doesn't seem like we're going to get that. The point is that a pause is not enough to help the market rally. It may be it helps it from selling off as much as people have been worried about, but I think it eventually will cause the market to go lower because, again, without QE, the market was artificially high because of QE and zero interest rate policies. We're not going back to that kind of policy, at least from everything in the Fed is telling us. Matt, thanks very much. Thanks for your input, Matt Melee, of Miller's hayback. Coming up on the program, we'll get further insights on oil, part of our interview. With the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novag and also our Compensation with the Saudi Energy Minister, all of that next, this is me, Matt.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,137,2022-10-06 09:42:50
11912," And also while compensation with the Saudi Energy Minister, all of that next, this is me back. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the road today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total US greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building to crowds America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels, we want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of US greenhouse gas emissions. Access the financial world on demand.

This is Bloomberg's surveillance early edition on Matt Miller-Kaley Limes here in New York, and Edwards with us out of London. Now OPEC Plus agreed to cut its output by the latest in two years, the Alliance plans to slash daily output by two million barrels a day that moved through a rebuke from the U.S., which has been seeking more oil from producers. Russia's deputy prime minister Alexander Novak spoke exclusively to Bloomberg in Vienna. In the end, there have been two important decisions taken today. One, you have already mentioned, and that is the decision on cutting voters by all countries present and by all countries in the group. But the second decision, which is just as important as the first one, is actually the extension of the Declaration of Cooperation, because it was scheduled to expire at the end of 22, but now it has been agreed that it will be extended until the end of 2023, which gives the market significantly more certainty and significantly more predictability. And that's why a decision was taken to balance the market out by the cuts by the voters of August, and especially this is a very important ahead of the winter season, when we would also see the seasonal decline demand by 2.5 to 3 million barrels. And this decision, which has been made today, helps the market to balance it out. I think it's a very weighted decision at a timely one. That was Russia's deputy prime minister Alexander Novak, emphasizing cooperation between OPEC class members. Meanwhile, the Saudi energy minister says the United States led plans for a price cap on Russian exports only adds to market uncertainty. We wanted to give the market a clear direction, a clear input. That's why we extended the agreement to end of 23, but we still have the same tools in our kit. Guidance to the market is crucial, because without guidance, people would not invest.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,138,2022-10-06 09:46:39
11913," But we still have the same tools in our kit, you know, guidance to the market is crucial. Because without guidance, people would not invest, we'd not feel safe that they could invest. However, we still have the tools in our kit. We still, yes, we reduce the amount of meeting, we reduce the amount of overall expectations of doing something, but we still maintain the same flexibility. We still have, each two every two months, we will have a GMMC. That GMMC is warranted the authority to have more than a meeting in every two months. It also was given the authority to call for a conference meeting if necessity dictates that. That was the Saudi energy minister there. Let's get some expert analysis. Will Kennedy joins us, Bloomberg, Senior Executive Editor for Energy and Commodities. Will, the action we saw yesterday by OPEC-plus was met really instantly by some objections from the United States, from the White House. Why should we be so surprised that there was cooperation between OPEC-plus countries and this is what they delivered? It seemed as if the US may be wrong-footed by this, but OPEC-plus as a grouping has existed for a long time, and Russia has been part of that. Well, there were... There was a lot of diplomatic outrage earlier in the year, just a few months ago between President Biden and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as you remember, President Biden traveled to Saudi Arabia. And he sought more oil and his political priority has been really to keep gasoline prices low. He's facing a difficult election in a month's time, and amid that, OPEC comes with a surprisingly large cut. I think if we were talking 10 days ago, no one would have said that they were going to cut quotas by two million barrels. They've done that because they see a lot of uncertainty in the market. Prices have been quite weak recently, but from a US perspective, it probably was quite a surprising move. And is there anything they can do to counteract that will realistically? Well, the US has been intervening heavily in the oil market by releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It's released almost half of what's available, so it could do more, but there are dangers there clearly in running down that stock of inventories too hard, so that will be one consideration. And they can look to encourage more oil production elsewhere. It was interesting that there was a report yesterday in the Wall Street Journal that they might e-sanction on Venezuela's oil industry. And of course, the administration has been keen to have a deal with Iran. Well, don't we have enough oil for us to use here in America right under our own earth? Why would we fly to Saudi Arabia according, Mohammed bin Salman and ease sanctions on Venezuela when we could just be nice to the people in Texas, Oklahoma, and the decodas, and get our own oil out of the ground? Well, you don't have enough oil, frankly, put them at. The US has a lot of oil, and oil production has increased markedly over the last decade, but it still imports huge amounts of oil, especially from Canada. And that's not exactly how oil markets. Oh, that's different. You better tell Justin Trudeau, though, because I think he might be a bit worried. But no, the US does not have self-sufficiency, and it's a global oil market. Could the US try and keep oil at home? Perhaps, but oil is fungible. And the Middle East, the OPEC, Saudi Arabia, remains absolutely critical to balancing the global oil market. It always has done, and it still does. And Saudi Arabia is really the only repository of spare oil capacity in the world. So whether President Biden likes it or not, Saudi Arabia remains an absolutely fundamental part of the global energy system. OK, and so we see calls now for oil likely going. Vietnam, Guatemala, I'm sure was joking. And anyway, he's not a charge. He's got nothing to worry about. Coming up later today, more on the global oil market, we will talk to Steven Shaw, principal of the short group, Bass of 730AM in New York, 12th.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,139,2022-10-06 09:51:23
11914," Yeah, nothing to worry about. Coming up later today, more on the global oil market, we will talk to Steven Short, Principal of the Short Group, that's at 7.30 a.m. in New York. 12.30 p.m. in London, this is Blaineberg. 12.30 p.m. in London, this is Blaineberg. 12.30 p.m. in London, this is Blaineberg. In the past two decades, China has built large infrastructure projects in almost every country in Africa. African governments themselves said we are tired of aid and charity. We want to do trade, we want to be treated like partners. The Chinese came along and said, great, we don't do aid in charity, we want to do business with you. Global gateway will mobilize 300 billion euros till 2027. Now the US and Europe are answering back with their own infrastructure initiatives to counter China, but African experts are skeptical. China has been that guy around the corner with a bouquet of flowers to Africa, the US, Europe and the UK, of time and time, again say be careful of the flowers you see out of the window, they are funs on them. A lot's happening on Wall Street. I think Che Powell said things that were indefensible. Need to catch up? This is World War Three Week. I'm David Weston. We've got the information and insights. We think that's the next second shift. From business's most influential and instrumental. It's knocking it out the bull path. It's a challenging dynamic. This is a level of uncertainty that we haven't had to deal with. Bloomberg Wall Street Week live Friday with replays all weekend on Bloomberg Television and Radio. This is Bloomberg's surveillance early edition. I'm Katelyn Lines with Matt Miller in New York and Anna Edwards in London. Now let's take a look at what is ahead on this Thursday. The ECB will be publishing an account of its September policy meeting at 7.30 a.m. New York time. The European political community will be meeting for the first time in Prague. Plus on the economic data front here in the U.S. We'll be getting initial jobless claims at 8.30 a.m. Eastern ahead of tomorrow's payrolls report. And we'll be hearing from more Fed speakers throughout the day, including Minneapolis Fed President Neil Kashkari, Chicago Fed President Charlie Evans, and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester. And Anna, I would imagine we'll hear something similar to what we've already heard from Lake Samarit daily this week. They're going to keep going. They don't plan to cut in 2023. Yeah, this Fed is not for pivoting. Seems to be one way to summarize it. Now let's think about how high the Fed goes with its rate hikes, shall we? Because we've heard over and over again about the concept of neutral rate R-star, where the Fed needs to hike in order to balance supply and demand to rein in inflation. But Bloomberg's Valerie Tytel has been talking this week about another concept that's doing the rounds. I think paper from the New York Fed put it out there that might complicate the Fed's inflation fight. And Valerie is here to talk us through it. So Valerie, we've heard a lot, they know R-star, the neutral rate, where the Fed sort of weighs down on demand so that demand comes down to match supply and lower the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,140,2022-10-06 09:55:41
11915," Kate, the Fed's inflation fight and Valerie is here to talk us through it. So Valerie, we've heard a lot, you know, our star, the neutral rate, where the Fed sort of weighs down on demand so that demand comes down to match supply and lower the whole inflation comes down. But our star star is a little bit more complicated. Take us through it. Yeah, so this paper went over this concept of our star star, which is the level at which we reach financial instability. And the one conclusion from this paper is that after a time of low interest rates when leverage is built up in the economy, similar to what we have today, that our star star drops below our star. Meaning, as the Fed hikes rates, we hit a point where we hit financial instability problems before we begin to tackle inflation. And its argument was that the length of period of time where rates are kept low, this excess leverage built up that this gap actually widens. All right, so looking at this chart, I see a couple of arrows for the past few hiking cycles. Is this one different? Is this cycle going to be different? So look, there's a few reasons why this cycle is different. One is we have a more obvious urgency to high rates to dampen inflation. We have an actual inflation problem. The second, if you look at it, maybe our star star and our star before were closer. So 2008, the credit crisis, we saw cracks in the credit market. And then you look at the previous hiking cycle in 2015, where we saw cracks appear in the repo market. But maybe that was fine because our star and our star star were close. So we didn't necessarily have this gap. Now, today we have an actual inflation flight. We have an urgency to high rates. And we could get to a point where the Fed needs to consider financial stability concerns before inflation turns around. And we always talk about this delay of transmission, like the transmission mechanism. You know, it'll be a few months before these, the rate hikes Fed has gone through to hit the real economy. But what if it's not just a delay? What if it's a completely different level, or we see instability versus inflation declining? Valerie, thank you very much. Brimbo is Valerie Titell joining us with the latest on this really interesting concepts. And Kaylee, we've been talking about this a little bit this week. Valerie's been talking about this this week, sort of behind the scenes and also on set with us. And also flagging how the Bank of England works into this. That this could be an interesting example where you see quantitative easing happening at the margin. They don't use that term. That's not what it's supposed to be. But we've got targeted policy action from the central bank at the same time as you've got interest rates going on. Yeah, it's a question of what parallels exist there. And I would point out for everybody listening to us on radio, you can see that fantastic chart. And the arrows that Valerie was talking about by checking out GTV go on the Bloomberg terminal. That's where you'll see all of our charts that we use throughout the program. That is it for early edition. More surveillance is ahead. The team will be Tom John and Lisa, of course. They'll be hearing from a range of voices including the Estonian Prime Minister, a gathering of European leaders happening in Prague today. This is Leanback. What do you say to the cynics that say, look, it's all nice and fine, but a lot of it is greenwashing and you're not.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,141,2022-10-06 10:00:03
11916," What do you say to the cynics that say, look, it's all nice and fine, but a lot of it is greenwashing, and you're not a good company, you're just a less toxic company than some of the other oil majors. Well, the first thing to say is that, you know, I'm a big believer and we need to put ourselves in other persons' shoes in life in general, and so I understand that point of view and I get that people have that perspective. I don't agree with that, obviously, but I understand where they're coming from. We have an enormous challenge as society, which is to provide the world with reliable, affordable and clean energy. That's what society wants, that's what society needs, and I believe, in my heart, that a company like BP is actually one of the few companies in the world who can actually make that happen. We can talk about the things that we're going to grow and over the coming years, and I find it hugely exciting and energizing for our organization, but that's what the world needs, and you simply can't go against the grain of society, you can't defy gravity, and that's why we're making the change that we're making. Right now, the market really has been held hostage by technicals, by sentiment, by politics, by geopolitics. This is the uncertainty factor that's keeping markets on edge. The markets have to go through the earnings season first, and I would expect that to be a volatile environment. I think that there's a concern in the broader financial markets that something might happen within the US markets. We're very much looking out for that US recession coming through, because that's the key turning point for the Fed. This is Bloomberg surveillance with Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow, and Lisa Abramowitz. Next stop payrolls, live from New York City, from our audience worldwide. Good morning, good morning, this is Bloomberg surveillance on TV and radio alongside Tom Keane, and Lisa Abram with Tom Jonathan Farrow futures negative six tenths of 1% jobless claims a little bit later this morning, TK, then onto tomorrow for payrolls. Yeah, something's changed this week, and it is, as we heard from Holland, Hurst over at City Group, many others as well. Tomorrow, all of a sudden really matters for the Fed meeting, going up at far more than that, it has to confirm that Jolt statistic from earlier this week, that Jolt, the market, is two good days, but then Stasis, we really haven't pulled back. And negative this morning, and some pushback from Fed speakers all over the place. Ramo, yesterday, and I went through the Fed speak for today, and I just kept scrolling down, I don't, we're getting there, don't worry, who's not speaking exactly pretty much everyone except for Fenture, J. Powell, but perhaps he's going to be the one that's going to be saying the same thing, and all of them are probably going to reiterate what Mary Daley said yesterday, which is, stop thinking we're going to raise raise to a certain point, and then we're going to just cut them. And they're basically continuing to push back against this idea of rate cuts in 2023, and the market keeps saying, you're wrong. I mean, basically, that's what you want to signal, that's not what you're going to do. Right, exactly. It's basically the pushback. Basically, people are getting more pessimistic on the global market, and they're saying the Fed's going to ultimately cave. And guess what? The market's been right, and this is sort of the perverse consequence of years of the Fed getting it wrong, the market being more correct. I mean, this is for the credibility question. That's the Fed speak. Let's talk about the controversy around OPEC class crew, the previous three days time, up almost 11%. Yeah, I did a lot of technical studies this morning on this. I want to make clear, it has not broken resistance, but boy, has it gotten there quickly? Controversial. Yeah, it's in the pushback from the white hand. I was surprised. You were ahead of this on me. I was like, yeah, oh, so what? Well, all of a sudden, it's controversial, but it's only controversial about one thing. I think there's an election in November. That's all this is about... It's Operation Midterm, so that it out. The White House Lisa came out and said that OPEC plus was aligning with Russia.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,142,2022-10-06 10:04:24
11917," virtual about one thing. I think there's an election in November. That's all this is about. It's Operation Bittum. Yeah. That it out. The White House leased, that came out and said that OPEC Plus was aligning with Russia. Kind of stating the obvious because the clue is in the name. It's the plus in OPEC Plus. And the Russian Energy Minister was there in person, in Vienna. I mean, it's not that much of a stretch, but then that the response would be to release more from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve potentially into November, what convenient timing to your point about what's going on with the election raises some issues about stability in the market going forward. If they've really used all of the reserves at a time when you aren't necessarily seeing the crisis level depletion of some of the of what's unstuck? Is that the best use to the SPR operation midterms? Are you really going to ask me to ask me if I can get in? I'm going to ask a question. Does it work? I can ask a range of people today. That question. You know, some people could say perhaps it gives stability to the economy in a time when you're laughing at me. I'm just trying to provide the other argument. I'm just smiling. Okay. She doesn't look at me because I'm always left. Okay, but I'm just saying you could make an argument. However, a lot of people are concerned at a time when you are seeing dwindling demand, they're going to use the SPR at a time when you've seen those reserves fall to record a little less. Very diplomatic in these show openings now. Very diplomatic. It's because we're all close together. What do you think? I agree. Sense Tevin. We're close. So I agree. It's all about that. What's cool is as we came into this new set, folks, and remember this, we brought the Bramow cam with us. We did. Features right now negative 7.10 of 1% on ESMP. I'm going to whip through the price action for you. Last couple of days before yesterday were really, really big. Then it's Tom Poit and at things of calm down rolling over again, but we were deeply negative yesterday and we took a big chunk out of that before we got to the close. Features down about 25, call it 26 points lower, down 7.10 of 1%. It was just a little bit higher by two basis points, 377 Eurodollar given me nothing. 9887 totally unchanged after all the drama of the previous three days. As we got that OPEC plus cut of about two million barrels a day, Lisa Krueger, I know where 87 dollars and 70 cents. And we can get into during the show exactly how much they're actually going to be cutting because they're not actually meeting the production targets as is. So it might be about a 1 million barrel cut and it might be a little bit less than that depending. So there's a lot of vagaries here as we see a meandering price action there. 7.30am, we get the ECB monetary policy account. John, why is it called an account rather than minutes? Because there's no detail whatsoever in them. Okay, great. You don't get the sum, the several account pool. They don't really go there. Okay, so we're not going to get any detail, but people are going to be looking for it anyway, especially after the ECB speak that we heard yesterday. Christine Lagarde talking about several consecutive rate hikes in following meetings. After there was a little bit of pushback from some of the devs on the ECB yesterday, German 10-year yields jumped by more than 16 basis points, the most going back to March 2020. Yes, this was the reversal of what we saw of the potential pivot over the first two days or the earlier days of the week because of Australia, Central Bank. I don't know. You could make your example, but other people, Subbectually, it has to do with the gas prices, natural gas prices in Europe. 8.30am, US initial jobless claims. How much does this give the tea leaves? A very strong labor market, albeit with signs of slight weakening around the edges. Honestly, some of the projections that we've been hearing on Bloomberg surveillance are pretty dire in terms of how low unemployment claims would have to go before the Fed starts to either accelerate or how high some of the jobless rates have to go before they pull back. And these are some of the questions heading into March tomorrow's non-formed payrolls. And today, this is for you, Fed speak includes drumroll, media outlets, Fed president Neil Kashkari, Chicago Fed president Charlie Evans, Fed governor Lisa Cook, Fed governor Chris Waller, Cleveland Fed president Loretta Messard, anyone else on the Federal Reserve who wants to speak, they're welcome to come on this show, John. We'll make a room for them. You get Kashkari twice and I think you get messed the twice as well. Twice? They're a lot of do that. Twice in a day. Busy, hey. I think nothing's ridiculous. We don't need to waste time on this. I've made it clear. You think it's waste of time. I think it's way over communication. I think it's just absolutely. President Bostic did a night speech yesterday. This worthy of being read. Okay. Okay. So take a look at that. Mercedes-Junecker joins us now. The head of European FX strategy at City. Mercedes was going through your estimates for cable for Euro sterling cable parity below Euro sterling likely to get to about 95 maybe above. Mercedes, can you walk me through where that next leg of sterling weakness is going to come from?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,143,2022-10-06 10:09:06
11918," Oh, Euro-sturbing likely to get to about 95, maybe above. Vecelios, can you walk me through where that next leg of sterling weakness is going to come from? Oh, it is coming very soon. Look, the market has been on a super high over the last few days, likely to a certain extent of a broad-based dollar weakness, because of the fact that there were quite a lot of short positions on there in equities, in bonds, and some longs in the dollar. And these are being paired back, and that's what we're seeing. It's a tactical rally, it's a bear market rally. It will soon come to an end, either through an exhaustion of positioning or through a catalyst, which could be the NFB tomorrow. But I think the big picture remains for being dollar bullish. Now, as far as sterling is concerned, look, I think what we've learned the recent days is that the UK government is still going ahead with that plan to boost growth, which is entirely unfounded. Apparently, no government has ever been able to target and achieve a certain level of growth, and, apparently, will be going ahead with increased borrowing. We haven't really had anything to suggest that we're going to be in a massive return. I hope that we will, but if that does not happen, I think the borrowing trajectory of the UK is going to be really bad both for guilds as well as for sterling. Facilios, I look at both today, the 10-year guild and also Sterling, as John mentioned, south, which is the horse in which is the cart? Does FX follow fixed income or does fixed income follow the currency market? Well, I think typically what you're going to get is that the FX will be following years, will be following the fixed income market. But I think when you are in situations where there is a crisis of confidence because I think this is the environment that correctly describes what's happening in the UK, you get simply a confluence of factors that move things together. Effectively, what's happening is that you're getting the repricing higher of risk premium. And when this happens, you get both yields higher and the change rate lower. But from really a medium-term, deep, deep fundamental perspective, the issue is going to be that Sterling is going to remain the main shock absorber. You look back in, you know, the previous year. In 1972, similar tax cuts in size, it eventually led to the chance of a floating pound and the pound lost about 38%. It acted as a shock absorber, but then right now you have even a bigger current account deficit. So I think it is unavoidable if these policies carry on and say that trajectory that we're going to see big depreciation in Sterling. What does the Bank of England do on October 14th? That's a very good question. Look, I'm going to answer with a question. Does it really matter that much? Because if you see over the past six days, the past six days, would I have inclined that they could have actually purchased up to 30 billion Sterling in long-dated yields? And they have actually purchased less than four billion. So effectively, yes, when we had the news, there was some headline impact, and we saw a significant decline. But let me highlight the following. 30-year yields in the UK went from 5% all the way down to 3.8% on the announcement. 120 basis points. So far, they have equipped about 50 basis points of that. And they are trading close to 4.3%. So my bottom line is, yes, the B of E can do certain things. I think they were pretty explicit that they're going to terminate them on the 14th of October. But these things are only going to last in the very near term. The history is abundant by examples that unilateral central bank interventions moves, actions.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,144,2022-10-06 10:12:56
11919," in the very near term. The history is abundant by examples that unilateral central bank interventions, moves, actions cannot reverse when you have a big crisis of confidence. Viserios, thank you, sir. As always, Viserios, Janakas, they're working through some big issues in the European markets. Of course, we don't know what the counterfactual is. Do we? Where would you expect if they weren't in the market? If they didn't have a package that size? Correct. Basically, he's saying it doesn't really matter and it's going to weaken no matter what. But then does it mean that longer term yields would be much higher? Does that mean it's a very tricky issue, which is a reason why some people don't really know what's going to happen. John the phrase, it amonic, comes from hyperconvexity and on Twitter, strategic midterm reserve. Do you like that? I think that seems pretty accurate. It's not the SPR, it's the strategic midterm reserve. It's the SMR. We're going to have that conversation later. Dan Morris is going to join us too from BMP Power By looking forward to that in the next hour. Future's down seven cents of 1% live from New York. This is Blinkberg. Keeping you up to date with news from around the world with the first word, I'm Lisa Mateo. The price of oil is holding steady a day after OPEC plus agreed to the biggest production cut since 2020. The Alliance plans to slash daily output by two million barrels and that wouldn't move. That move would drew a review from the US which has been seeking more oil from producers. Meanwhile, Russia repeated a warning that it won't sell any crude to any country that adopts the price cap. North Korea is ratcheting up attention in the region. It fired two suspected short range ballistic missiles toward waters where the US aircraft carrier Ronald Reagan had been deployed. Earlier this week, Kim Jong-un regime launched its first rocket over Japan in five years. North Korea criticized the US for redeploying the Reagan carrier group to waters east of the peninsula. In the UK, a new study says millions more Britons will be dragged into higher tax brackets over the next three years and that will cost twice as much as Prime Minister Liz Truss' personal tax cuts. Their board comes from the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The government is reducing the rate of income tax but it's also freezing the threshold where people start paying and that will force them into higher tax brackets. Atlanta Fed President Rafael Bostick says he favors lifting interest rates to as high as four and a half percent this year and then he wants to keep tightening in place to reduce inflation. Bostick's view is in line with the Fed's policymakers. Markets are projecting the likelihood of a 75 basis point hike the next meeting in November. Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quick Take powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. I'm Lisa Mateo. This is Bloomberg. Apple's the lane. It's next major iPad software update. iPad OS 16 by about a month from September to October. Apple made the decision for a number of reasons including a still buggy stage manager multitasking interface and in order to link the launch closer to the more similar macOS Ventura. Still it's an unusual move since shifting the launches to the fall in 2011. Apple has released its new iPhone and iPad software updates simultaneously each year around September.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,145,2022-10-06 10:17:10
11920," Ifting the launches to the fall in 2011, Apple has released its new iPhone and iPad software updates simultaneously each year around September. By staggering the releases, users may find some issues around compatibility with cross-device features like retracting and editing messages in iMessage, the new shared iCloud Photo Library, and the new feature for transferring FaceTime calls between iPhones and iPads. It will also make it a bit harder for developers to launch apps that run on both the iPad and iPhone that require new APIs and features found across iPadOS 16 and iOS 16. Regardless, it was still of course the right move. Stage Manager on iPadOS 16 is still quite buggy, I don't find it particularly intuitive, and it's not compatible with most iPads and many third party apps in the app store. The feature clearly needs some more polish and complaints from consumers about Stage Manager will now no longer probably overshadow the earlier launch of the iPhone 14. What does it mean?

11921," Here's a taste of flavour of what he had to say. The output cut is aimed at stabilising markets. The decision is not a sign of solidarity with any country. Then there's some pushback against the White House there. The price cap, Tom, on Russian oil is destructive, and it hurts everybody. The comments from the Kremlin just moments ago. The comments from the Kremlin, nothing on the word, Vance in Ukraine. I was stunned that they had line used today, John, of people beginning to pundit that Ukraine could go after Crimea from 2014. But it's certainly Russia deflecting the story at least. Clearly, the price cap story that the Europeans are pushing has complicated the OPEC plus effort in the last 24 hours. And that's kind of blurred the lines, I think, for a lot of people. Well, there it is. And it's an OPEC meeting. Is Manistill in Vienna? I think he still is. I'm not sure if he's got a plane yet, but I saw him there earlier this morning. Right now, we go to Ann Marie-Horden in Washington. She is focused on the election in OPEC plus Maria today. Oh, it's not. And she is in Prague this morning. Maria, away from the narrowness of the U.S. debate, moving out to the first Tuesday of November. What is the response to OPEC plus across Brussels in continental Europe? Well, Tom, the reality is, oil is a conversation for the United States. And here, there hasn't been much reaction because Europeans were focused on gas, as you know. And you're going to allow me to get technical. But yesterday, the head of the European Commission, Ursula Fonder-Lion sent out a letter to the 27 heads of states in which she said we will intervene the gas market and prices need to go down. And what the Europeans were focused on is the gas price cap. That's the main focus, but this is an incredibly complicated situation because when you talk about a price cap, I can tell you there's at least five different formulas where that could work. And then, of course, you have the Germans who say they worry that any intervention would kill the little supply that's already in the market. So not a lot of reaction on the oil for them. This is very much a gas story today. Amary, I want your response to all of this. Hyperconvexity add on Twitter. They're phrasing up mine, but I'm going to use it all morning. The strategic midterm reserve. Is that about to get tapped through the rest of this year? Well, if you look at the statement closely from Jake Sullivan and Brian Deese yesterday, they said that this is something the president could do. He could, once again, tap the SPR. The issue with that, Jonathan, is at the moment. And we should note that already additional sales they have from that will be coming down the pipeline in the next few weeks. But we should note that the SPR right now, the levels they're at are the lowest they've been since the early 1980s. And there's a lot of pushback from their Republicans that the SPR has been politicized by this administration, because it is not an emergency situation, it is not disastrous to relief. It is used to push prices down. And the White House also talks about the fact that they were able to get prices down from five dollars in the peak in June to right now. They're going up a little bit, but just under $3.90 a gallon on the national average. So this is something we could see because this OPEC plus decision has really put them in a bind because they still have to deal with the fact that gasoline prices inflation are top of mind American voters. We should also note Americans are voting now. In some states, early voting is open. This is a big issue. And the timing and the optics of this was a huge snub for the White House. And Marie, this is the reason why, when you have the Kremlin saying that this is not political, people will say, this is like a company saying, we're not about to collapse. These are things that no one wants to ever say. And I'm curious from your perspective, how much pushback there is to Saudi Arabia from the U.S. because of the snub, because the fist bump didn't work, the discussion didn't work. Now Russia's there, all of this kind of pushing against an agenda. Yeah, it is. The timing of it is terrible in terms of the president just under three months from that fist bump from his landmark trip to Saudi Arabia. And then of course, this comes right before the midterm elections. But what I would say is that there has been U.S. officials obviously leading up to this, reaching out to their counterparts in the Gulf to advise them against this. But I think what is clear is that Saudi Arabia put the price of oil above their relationship with the United States with this decision. Maria, I want to give you the final word on the path forward here. I hear much more from people that we've secured the energy we need to get through this winter. But in doing so, we've made 2023 incredibly fragile. Can you walk me through how people are talking about not just this winter, but next year as well? Well, it is because Jonathan, when you look at",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,147,2022-10-06 10:26:17
11922," 23 incredibly fragile. Can you walk me through how people are talking about not just this winter, but next year as well? Well, it is because Jonathan when you look at storage is 90% and yesterday one of my contacts actually told me that they expect to hit 100% of storage across the EU sooner than anticipated so you could be looking at potentially in the next two to three weeks. So that is good for this year, but when it comes to next year well, this is a complicated situation on the volume, especially if you do see the countries like Russia, we've had the Nordstrom explosions, Ukraine, whether that pipeline is going to hold or not, is still a big question mark and then you have the price. So this is going to be incredibly complicated going forward, but I think for a lot of European leaders, what they focus on and remember they also have their domestic agenda is getting Europe through the winter. Maria, Amary unmatched the tour of your thank you. Maria today are there and Amary has done. At least a term, this is where the conversations at TK goes beyond just this winter. It's what is next year look like and if you've achieved the storage numbers you want to achieve for this winter, how do you repeat the act in 12 months? And the gas oil separation where it's about gas in Europe and over there it's a very discrete conversation as we started out with in the US. And I'm told Nevada is one of the two key Senate elections now in the last 30 days of Galenagas in Las Vegas from $4.82 to $5.54 and that's your main, that's a substantial jump. We looked at the chart, we were talking about that. Starting to go on the wrong time, Rex. Yeah, Lisa, we've seen that in the last couple of days. How much is this actually going to be something that will remedy that with more release from the strategic petroleum reserve versus some of the frictions and there are finaries. I mean, there's a lot of complications here in order to get lower, even lower energy prices. And then here's the flip question. What happens if the output cut does not raise prices? What does that say about the global economy? And that's actually something that a lot of people were really wondering after some of these moves. And I'm not sure what Tom said though all year. And I think it's so so important. What happens if China drops COVID zero comes back on mine? I mean, I looked at Hong Kong flights yesterday, United Airlines announcing they're going to start up in January, so Kathy Pacific still doing it. But boom, that opens up 10 airlines off we go.

We've looked at this very carefully and the digitization of everything. Tell me what aspect of your life, Emily, isn't becoming more digital. I'm trying to prevent that, but you know, and COVID has accelerated that. The industry crossed $500 billion last year. The semiconductor industry overall and estimates are $1 trillion a doubling by the end of the decade at that point. I believe those estimates. It's not that there's not going to be some blitz and turns on the way and the majority of that is driven by leadership process technology of which only three companies can satisfy that need.

From New York City this morning, good morning, the price action this Thursday morning, shaping up as follows, we're down 7.10% on ESMP. Similar script to yesterday morning and then we switched things around almost by the close, features down about 8.10% on the NASDAQ. Two stands and 30 shaping up as follows. Can we see some calm in the bond market? Come on. Some calm after. Chris Harvey of Wells Fargo said, guvies are trading like cryptos. Yields are up by a couple of basis points on a two year 417, couple of basis points higher than 10 year 377, crude has been absolutely searching over the previous three days. On ESMP 500, energy stocks are up more than 12% over the last three days. Over the same period, crude is up by around about 11%. Right now, crude just an inch lower, down a 10th of 1%, 87, 69, Brent crude, 93, 28, with down a 10th of 1% there. A little bit later this morning, Tom, going to catch up with Francisco Blanchard Bank for America, looking forward to doing this. Really look, that's really an important conversation. He's been very informative. I have to point out if we can get more spec on who nailed 70 to $80. Right. I wonder what he thinks right now. It's great. Here right at the resistance level. This is a really important conversation with Pantheon Macri economics. Ian Sheperton always sharp on a global view distilled down to the central bank of the United States. Ian, you talk about the importance of Fed persistence here. If we get data that persists, this is a Fed that will blink. Talk us through how you perceive the data trail to be forward to where the Fed has to make a decision. Yeah. So, well, December, I think, is shaping up to be potentially a very interesting meeting. So remember, the new Fed dot plot shows 125 basis points of Hikes on November December together. And it looks to me that if we get more data that look like the Joltz report that came out earlier this week showing a really big drop in job openings. And we also get a couple of decent CPI inflation reports. Actually, we get three before the December meeting. My guess is they're going to be much better than we saw last month. If that's the case, then I think the Fed's really going to struggle to convince markets that it needs to do a total 125 basis points in those last two meetings of the year. But let's be clear about this. We need both of these things to happen because the Fed's been very clear. A ton of speakers this week and of course, Chappell at the last meeting at the press conference saying, look, it's not just about the current inflation rate. And by the way, one good inflation number isn't going to do it. We need to see a run there enough. But it's also about the labour market because what they're concerned about is that...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,149,2022-10-06 10:34:36
11924," Not just about the current inflation rate and by the way one good inflation number isn't going to do it, we need to see a run fair enough. But it's also about the labour market because what they're concerned about is that even though there's some pretty strong downward forces on inflation, you know there's this bulwap effect in inventories is going to be quite a big deal over the next year or so. They're looking at wage growth of 5% plus and saying, look, even if inflation comes down quite rapidly by next spring, we're worried about where it will be later in 23 and 24 if wage growth doesn't moderate. So I do think they want to see some moderation in the labour market as well as some better inflation numbers. But here we are now with the possibility of that happening as soon as the end of this year. So this December meeting I think is going to be extremely interesting. I'm just wondering even whether in November the case for going by another 75 has already been weakened as well. You know maybe that that you know that that Jolson number was a bolt from the blue. Nobody was expecting anything like that. You know you get a 12% drop in job openings in one month. So some things are starting to move. The Fed speakers aren't moving yet, but you know a few more weeks of numbers like this and there will be movement. Jan this is from November 2nd to December 14th which is a new K-Asel really decides the rest of their season. You think that's the critical part? That's a critical part of the trip. November 2nd is the Christmas period. It's usually the critical part of the season. I'm becoming a sophisticate. Ian what you're saying about December now is what you said about September 3 months ago. What have you been surprised by? Yeah yeah. Well what pushed the 75 September you know we had the horrible inflation numbers and that made it impossible for them to do anything less and then put the slight chimer down again. But I think there's a very good chance that things change now you know we're seeing now so many retailers talking about how they've got far too much inventory. It's not just Walmart anymore you know Nike have said it and we you know we're hearing from the car business that imagery is rising again and that's allowing sales to rise but it's also seen real down with pressure on prices. You know use car prices are down 13% since January and the rate of decline at auction is accelerating. So there's some things that I hope would happen by September that didn't are now happening and they're in the data. But we need more of them you know just a snapshot of a few good numbers isn't going to be enough I think Paul and his colleagues have been very clear about that. But the thing is December still a long way away three more rounds of inflation reports three more PPI's three more CPIs two more PC reports that's a lot of inflation data. And I think that we're kind of reaching this tipping point now where the bullwhip effect that all these companies are talking about is going to become visible in the hard data. And at that point that puts the Fed into a different place especially if at the same time the next couple of Jolts numbers are by anything like what we just saw this week. I mean that really was was very startling in has don't fight the Fed turned into the Fed is just wrong and we're right. I mean basically you're seeing the market say we could say we could hear from 15 more Fed speakers today and 25 tomorrow and they could all tell us we're not going to cut rates next year. You're still going to cut rates because the data is moving faster than your acknowledging do you think that the market is right and the Fed is wrong. Well they've both got a point so here's the thing you know rates have gone up so much over the last year that under normal circumstances I'd be screaming about a recession I'd be screaming at the Fed you're pleased for goodness sake stop all this hawk this hawkish talk stop the tightening you know very soon you're going to have to signal and easing the difference in the reason I'm not saying that so you know as I would be normal. Is it the fact is that the household sector in the US is still sitting on one and a half one and three quarter trillion dollars of pandemic savings which they are clearly being willing this year anyway to run down in order to maintain their spending and that's offsetting some of the hit from interest rates and similarly the corporate sector's a lot of cash as well. So you know again in a normally economy with rates of this much I'd say yeah you've definitely done enough and you're in real danger of overdoing it real danger of triggering a recession that we really don't need I think but the consumers holding up extremely well housing notwithstanding and the corporate sector looks okay as well but there's enough straws in the wind here now you can see it in for example some of the regional Fed surveys now capital spending intentions of really weakened a lot you can see it obviously in the housing market and you can see it in the Jolts numbers and you can see it. Some of the other business surveys and the consumer surveys as well just saying that you know maybe things are beginning to wobble a bit in some sectors it's not a collapse it's not a route of the economy definitely not but is it the sort of a",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,150,2022-10-06 10:39:02
11925," as well. Just saying that, you know, maybe things are beginning to wobble a bit in some sectors, it's not a collapse, it's not a route of the economy, definitely not. But is it the sort of economy where you still need to be hiking by 125 basis points at the next two meetings? That is far from clear to me at this point. What I'm really hoping is that by the time this sit down in December, it will be clear and it will be clear to them that they don't need to keep going so aggressively because every incremental hike here now, I think, is raising the risk of triggering something that we don't need because the US economy to me doesn't need a recession. Okay, triggering something that we don't need, the US doesn't need a recession. Other people would disagree with that, including some people perhaps on the Federal Reserve based on some of the forecasts that they have currently in play. What's your view though if we do get a recession of the depth of it based on the trajectory of rate hikes that we see based on how quickly the data is changing to accept some of the weakness that people were expecting to see earlier in the year. Yeah, so my general rule is that recessions are proportional to the imbalances in the private sector that preceded them. I mean, the whole point of recession is to force the private sector to change its behavior from doing things that are overstretching it to coming back to normal. So if it's not very overstretch, then it doesn't need a deep recession. So, you know, I don't expect anything like 08 be much more like 1990 or 2001 so mild and brief, but I don't think we need one at all because I think this bullwhip effect in inventories and the crushing of margins that it's going to impose on the retail sector is going to bring inflation down faster than the fed things, even without any meaningful rise in the unemployment rate. So, now, I realize we've never seen anything like this before. We've never seen it on the upside with the speed of that margin expansion and we've never seen anything on the potential downside that we've got coming either. This is very much on Charter Territory, but you know, when you're in on Charter Territory and you've already hiked a lot, you know, maybe the prudent thing to do is to ease off a little bit and just have a look around, you know, that's the thing when it's on Charter. You don't know really where you are. So maybe pause, have a look around, give the data a couple of months to break one way or the other, if they don't, then okay, carry on hiking. But if they do break to the downside, bearing in my monetary policy works with really quite long lags, if you're still hiking aggressively in November and December and yet the inflation purchase already breaking to the downside, then what you've done is impose disinflationary forces on the economy for the whole of next year, which it probably doesn't need. In the last 10 years as a top 10 finish uncharted territory for Newcastle United in. Well, was seventh now. There we go. Be 17. Can I ask you guys a question? I've been whining for years as a complete amateur about more goals. Manchester City is doing that. Are they changing the game? Let's let's rephrase that. Harland is doing that for Manchester City. But I mean, you're like the Boston Bruins with Bobby Or are they changing the way the games played? I don't think the changing the way the games change, Lisa, I think if just gone and bought the most prolific scoring world football right now, is that pretty much the most American thing that anyone should say? He wants more points. Basically, I want more goals. We're actually because it's not active enough. That's more points. More points. Yes, that's quintessential American response. More goals. More points. You should get three points for a goal. That's what you should do. Shall we do a road trip to Newcastle? Three points for a goal. Are you happy? I'm not mocking America sports. I love it. It makes a ton of sense. You know, the game at Newcastle, it's like when you go to see the top. If you go to a game at Newcastle, that's a real atmosphere. That's like all more. That is a real atmosphere. I'd love to go and watch a game up there. We should make that happen. So do people there say we'd like to see more points? They'd like to see more points. Yeah. That's the conversation that Jordy's have after every game. But, you know, it's like, it's high this into uppacked, John. Aren't they taken? Newcastle's taken up by new warners. That's right. Good.

There's attention, I think, between them and the rest of the league at the moment about where the money's come from, but the certain football clubs that have questionable sources.

And it comes after they closed their fund to a lot of outside investors because they wanted to be more aggressive and take more bold bets and not have to adhere to some of the standards of certain pensions, etc. And guess what? They've crushed it. Can you think of how many different market regimes have played out in the last six years? You think that my boss is on the team? They've just crushed it. Those guys, I don't just never level. I've actually, John, I've actually looked at this very hard to get beyond year three is statistically broke. It's home 114% in 2022.

President Biden had hoped his visit to Saudi Arabia would encourage the Saudis to pump more oil. The Saudi Arabia's Saudi Arabia would encourage the Saudis to pump more oil. Shares of Shell dropped after the energy giant pointed to a weaker third-quarter performance. And that's likely to end a run of record earnings.

While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the road today won't electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building across America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels. We want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. I see us as raising to a level that we believe is restrictive enough to bring inflation down. And then holding it there until we see inflation truly get close to 2% and demonstrate that price stability is restored.

The gasoline crime scene probe has been concluded. Suspissions of sabotage have strengthened the probe. Tom showing signs of detonations. The latest from his Swedish security service to serve. And I guess we see more. I mean, I don't know how deep it is, but it's not that deep to begin with. And they go down with cameras, right? As we get more headlines, I'll share them with you Tom. I don't I think that's all there is to it. Futures negative 27 that VIX remarkably stable over the last number of days, which has been noted by those looking for a cathartic move. It hasn't happened. Right now, Julie Norman joins us. We're going to write the ship here on a lot of the discussion of the war in Ukraine. She's co-director of the UCL Center on US politics and is noted for a real understanding of war and terror. Professor Norman Good morning. It's been a topic on this show. And frankly, I think it's out in the zeitgeist as well. The response that any institution should have to what happens in a war, never pretty, but then there's torture. How do you judge or gauge the reports we see from Ukraine of Keynes X?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,153,2022-10-06 10:51:55
11928," But then there's torture. How do you judge or gauge the reports we see from Ukraine of Kena's ex? I will, Tom. We've seen reports of Kena's ex from Ukraine really since the very beginning, and I don't think we should sugarcoat that at all. Obviously, it's hard to verify all information, all stories that are coming out in a conflict situation, but we have seen just so many patterns from Russia's atrocities in this war in different parts of Ukraine, and it matches a lot of their tactics that they've used in previous conflicts as well. So this is part of a pattern for Russia, and it's one that I unfortunately expect that we also continue to see more of as the war continues. Even today, we saw targeting of civilians, which is a bit different than some other atrocities we've been focusing on, but that will continue. Whatever anyone's politics in the movies, there's a Geneva Convention. What Convention is there now? How do we institutionally respond to this? Yeah, well, we always have these international law documents. We have a Convention Against Torture, which has a lot of sign on to it, but all of those are only as strong as the will to enforce them is, and unfortunately, that is somewhat minimal. So I think we'll see more in Ukraine what we've seen already is trying to change the larger course of the war rather than focusing always on these isolated events. With that said, human rights groups are doing excellent job of documenting it. There will be a public record of this that my sense is that there probably will be some kinds of attempts for litigation after the war on some of these human rights issues, but the focus for most of these international institutions, if you will, right now is on the broader conflict and trying to put Ukraine in the best position to close this in a way that's advantageous to them. Julie, as we see, as we get further away from the farce that was this referendum in certain regions in Ukraine by Russia, has that proven to be an escalation or a de-escalation in terms of are we closer to some sort of nuclear conflict or on the other side closer to some sort of end? With annexation was certainly a provocative move by Russia. One that was somewhat flagged and expected in these recent weeks. The interesting thing is that Ukraine has responded pretty much by saying, we are still going to continue with everything we've been doing in terms of the offensive and the operation and continuing to make gains at least in some areas. And really, the entire international community has seen these as a farce. They fall in somewhat flat. I think the next moves will, there are still so many options available to Putin. I think we need to be clearied about that. Ukraine has made gains. They're in a good position going into the winter, but this war is still far from over. The buzz that we're hearing about, you know, a potential of Putin being put in a corner, your discussion of what would be the impact of using something like a tactical nuclear weapon, which is very small, scale nuclear weapon, that would still be massive. Most analysts, I think, do not see that as imminent, but it's something that is certainly possible and is very much in the focus right now for the U.S. and allies of what that might be and what kind of response there might be to something like that, if it were to take that course. Given this backdrop, Julie, how do we take the fact that Russians, energy minister, went to Vienna to join the OPEC-plus meeting? They are agreeing to something that, on the margins, is viewed as beneficial to Russia at a time when this conflict, the war on Ukraine, is only protracting some of the animosity here between the Western nations and Russia. Oh, absolutely. So we saw yesterday, OPEC-plus, obviously, choosing to cut the oil production. This is a stop in the face to Ukraine, to the U.S. and suddenly to the EU, who also just yesterday was trying to put forward a price cap on Russian oil, and this will completely, you kind of even that out, if you will. And so I think we see from this act the fact that OPEC states, especially Saudi, it's still playing this very much to their own interests. They are looking out for themselves in this Biden's visit in the summer, obviously had little, if only perhaps a very short-term effect. And it shows that the politics was the economics of this conflict, our still very much in Russia's favor with some of their allies and with some states around the world. Julie Norman, as always, thank you for the UCL Center.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,154,2022-10-06 10:56:17
11929," economics of this conflict are still very much in Russia's favor with some of their allies and with some states around the world. Julie Norman, as always, thank you for the UCL Center of US politics. Let's shine a light on something that's not been discussed off the back of this opaque decision. I don't think it's been discussed enough. Speck capacity as some of these nations is really problematic. They had a cap on output. They weren't hitting it to begin with. And when we talk about the two million barrel a day cut, Amarie has said it's a few times in the last 24 hours. Approximately it works out basically at about 800K because they weren't hitting the one they had before. Did you see what the OxyCeo had to say on the sidelines of an event that wheat we held over in London said this, the world is at risk of living with a shortage for a while that will drive up prices. The lack of supply is going to continue to manifest itself as China starts to open up from COVID. It's a really uncertain moment for these nations. And on the other side, John, there is a dampened demand because of Asian Pacific rim. JP Morgan's effort and you have Francisco Blanche later, Bank of America, same idea. The migration to a persistent above $100 a barrel is based as a generalization on Pacific rim burgeoning demand. We're here now without that West amount next year. Yeah. Where's demand after COVID? China kicks back in West amount. So sure, it's embarrassing politically Lisa for this white house. We could talk about that or morning. But what is the demand backdrop actually looked like next year? And I've got no idea. Nobody has an idea. There's another element. This in Christian Malak of JP Morgan yesterday was really highlighting this, which is it's getting more expensive for oil producers to increase production. People, the salaries are bigger. A lot of the investment, a lot of these oil wells are not as productive. So how do they game that out with where oil prices ought to be? Brent crude right now, 92 and 92 on Brent. Right in negative this morning, life from New York City with futures lower for our audience worldwide. This is Bloomberg surveillance. Today, what are the biggest challenges for general dynamics and what are the biggest opportunities? So I think in any business, the challenges are solving complex problems that come to you. The problems that come to me and my senior leadership team for resolving tend to be highly complex and nettlesome. So your ability to solve those complex problems is an important element, I think of the value that we add to the company. And then I think opportunities, you always want to make sure that you've got a creative enough mind and open enough mind to be able to see around square corners. What am I missing? The why questions are really powerful? Why are we not doing this? So why are we doing this? I ask those questions a lot and in the answers, you can sometimes tease out some real opportunities, some hidden things. But thinking creatively about opportunities and problems is really important. And what about the industry generally? I think they have big challenges now as the defense budget probably comes down a bit. So I think that we are all responsible and we have an obligation to find the latest and best technologies that we can for our customers and deliver them in the most cost effective manner we can. And I think that that's a challenge and an opportunity.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,155,2022-10-06 11:00:29

And I think that that's a challenge and an opportunity for all of the big defense companies. Today's CFOs are reshaping the C-suite, positioning companies to meet the next generation of challenges, breaking out of traditional roles.

On the David Rubenstein Show, here to peer conversations, I uncover the untold stories of the world's most successful leaders. Watch Wednesdays on Bloomberg Television. Right now the market really has been held hostage by technicals, by sentiment, by politics, by geopolitics. This is the uncertainty factor that's keeping markets on edge. The market has to grow through the earnings season first and I would expect that to be a volatile environment. I think there's a concern in the broader financial markets that something might happen within the US markets. We're very much looking out for that US recession coming through because that's the key turning point for the Fed. This is Bloomberg's surveillance with Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow and Lisa Abramowitz. Live from New York City for our audience worldwide. Good morning, good morning. This is Bloomberg's surveillance on TV and radio alongside Tom Keane and Lisa Abramowitz. I'm Jonathan Farrow. We just down about six or seven tenths of 1% on the S&P, jobless claims later this morning, then the big one tomorrow morning, payrolls Friday, just around a corner, TK. payrolls Friday there in claims, Jan, 207,000, four week moving average in claims. It's pretty incredible. It's a fully employed America and let me get this right, the Fed wants us not to be fully employed. Subtracted to it. Well, the Fed might get something extra and maybe we can dream about a soft landing. I say maybe and you can decide how skinny that land is strip actually is. Subtrucate claims. Job openings down more than a million. Look, we have to talk about the totality of the data over a series of months, of course, but it got people hoping, didn't it? It got people talking about the pivot, which I know Tom was talking about. It's going to kill you. And then it starts talking about bad news, being good news and good news, being bad news. And this is sort of the trickling into the zeitgeist two years ago, again, of the markets. That said, going forward, Fed speak has been consistent. They are going to keep going until they see inflation go back down. They are going to have to count to two percent. There is no at imposing pivot to three percent kinds of goals. This is very clear cut. So either the Fed speakers are wrong. Sure. Or the markets wrong. Are they going to cut in a recession? That's my number one question right now. President Bostic at a speech yesterday got all the way to the bottom of the speech because it's on the one hand, this, on the one hand, that at the bottom. In the second to last paragraph. Listen to this if economic conditions weaken appreciably. For example, if unemployment rises uncomfortably, it will be important to resist the temptation to react by reversing our policy course prematurely. Just think about that, Tom, what that means. If you start to get a downturn in the economy, an unemployment starts to inflect higher uncomfortably that they are not willing to reverse course. 3.7% we're looking for, I believe, tomorrow. And, John, you know, 3.9, you go to 4.8. Fine. 4.9, you go to 5. This is not linear. Sure. And that's a different conversation than 4.9%. Now granted, I take that there is a difference. I understand the difference between what Fed wants to signal right now and what they may end up doing next year. And we've seen the market doubts. Yeah, they say this now. This is what they want to say. But ultimately, this is what they will do. There's also a question about when this starts to feed into the economy. And we've talked about this before. But a lot of companies have pushed out maturities. But those maturities start to come up at the end of next year. They have to refinancing refinancing at a 4 to 4.5%.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,156,2022-10-06 11:05:51
11931," for. But a lot of companies have pushed out maturedies. But those maturedies start to come up at the end of next year. They have to refinance refinancing at a four to four and a half percent Fed funds rate very different than refinancing at a one or a two or a zero percent refinancing. Have you found any buys of that triple C unsecured debt? Silence. If you think it's going to be interesting, trying to push around. I've heard about a couple of places kind of bowing out. Exiting stage left. So we're not going to really see what's the non news of the last 24 hours and non-medical. Just what's the we've heard a thing on Twitter finance wait for an X. Yeah, well, let's see how much they got to pay to wait this. And what you can basically cancel out the fees. Yeah, what's this is all said? Well, and I would just speculate right now there are fever discussions among some legal teams of some banks. Can I give you some good news? Sure. Dana Chelsea always with the good news and retail Lewis Vue. And her price targets up 28% on a 21% lift in 2022 sales. And I'm, you know, is this the market? No, it's luxury. It's fancy and all that. But nevertheless, we go into earning season with stories like this. earning season with stories like that maybe, but also with Nike with FedEx. Yeah, with the report around Apple FedEx. I think wicked important Chris Harvey of Wow. He was expecting the weakest weakness in the front half the front half the next year. And now he's talking about it happening right now. Yeah, some companies are having some trouble adapting and adjusting. It's like Chris Harvey week. We hear that. Yeah, some corporations struggling to adapt in a job. Yeah, well, the Bremock came caught it. It's okay. They will adapt in a job. Can we just say strategist, come and go, Mike Wilson's been front and center Chris Harvey's having hell of a week. He's all over everywhere in the site. I haven't seen him. Yeah, he's, well, I don't mean him is writing, you know, he's getting right. He's been, well, nobody's been in front of it. But it's Chris. I'm learning Chris. I'm just down a half of 1% on the S&P. I went through this price action briefly. We're down in the equity market a little bit softer. We've had a few really decent days of gains to kick off the week. Then kind of tread in water yesterday. Down a half of 1% on the S&P 500 year tire by a couple of basis points on a 10 year three, 77. Can we revisit what we talked about in the last hour? Sterling is bad. Guilts are with trust. Trust is not free and clear on this at all. We talked about band-aids, didn't we? Not permanent solutions. Are they going to get a rating cut? I mean, they get three warnings. Possibly if we ever cared about rating. I agree. We don't care. Business. I care about three dates right now. October 14th when the Guilt Market Operation ends. November 3rd when we get a bank-giving decision. And whenever the budget takes place at the end of November. And out there is it redounds around the world as Lawrence Summers says as well. How does the mess in your country affect our country? Spill over. Saw that in the last week or so, didn't we? Lisa wants to go through the Fed speak time. And the ACP talk as well. I'll be going. Lisa, how much of that have we got? We have a bunch and I will say that I'm looking forward to a lot of important dates. But today is also important. 7.30 AM we get ECB monetary policy account. This is basically the overview as I have learned of their previous meeting. Interesting to see some of the hawkish Fed speak particularly out of Christine Lagarde. Ten-year German yields yesterday surged by the most going back to March of 2020. This is yes because of the hawkish speak, yes because of perhaps a reversal from recent moves. But also on the heels of the natural gas increases, the price increases, I should say. And some concerns around that. 8.30 AM we get US initial jobless claims. We've been talking about this, the tea leaves to figure out what will it take for the Fed to pack away from some of the rate-hiking expectations. We are seeing those claims just dwindle around near all time low levels. Does that rise? Today we also get a host of Fed speak. Let's go through this. This is really fun. Minneapolis Fed President Neil Kashkari, twice. Chicago Fed President Charlie Evans, Fed Governor Lisa Cook, Fed Governor Chris Waller, Cleveland Fed President Leroyd Amester, twice. John, should work for everybody? I can't wait. Is that enough Fed speak for you, Tom? It was too much, yeah. We missed the twice, Kashkari, twice. A little bit more tomorrow. Sprinkle around Friday after payrolls. We should give more formal speeches where we could act. Like economic club in New York where we could act more. What's the more that? Yeah. I mean, the time he has spoken, we listen to him, then a week later we're talking about something else on a pivot again. Yeah, well, we're pivoting. Dan Morris, Chief Market Strategist at BMP Parabar, joins us right now. Dan, it feels like June, at least the first couple of days, did of this week. June, when we bounced off the lows aggressively and everyone started talking about a pivot.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,157,2022-10-06 11:09:41
11932," And now, Dan, it feels like June, at least the first couple of days did of this week. June, when we bounced off the lows aggressively and everyone started talking about a pivot. Is this a bear market rally this week or something more durable? What's different between now and then? Well, I think we have to keep in mind what might be the driver for a, I don't want to use words, sustained rally, but at least relics for a few weeks right now. So we appreciate on one hand, of course, sentiment is very bad. Do you look bulls bears, book haul ratios? No one likes equities, no one likes risk. But at the same time, because that sentiment is so low, you get a bit of good news. And I think you can see some of the price action that we've already had. So going into the third quarter earnings season, if we have some positive surprises, the markets looking for good news, I think it'll react. Daniel, the heritage of BMP Perry by here, you've got Carl Riccadana now. This goes back to Dr. Coronado years ago, is incredible parsing of GDP. What's the part of gross domestic product in Europe and the United Kingdom and the United States that you're focused on? Well, it's really going to be the price indices because we know all these discussions that we're having, it all comes down to how does inflation of all in the months ahead because everything depends on that. So even when we talk about gross slowing, it doesn't matter if we don't see that peering through to the inflation number. So it's looking at the price indices within the national accounts. And in particular, looking particularly in the U.S., what's happening with services inflation, goods inflation, and then so importantly rent inflation because we appreciate that. So when that's going to be the most sticky and the one that may require the fed keeping rates higher for longer as they said they're going to do. What a tough time for a reog for anyone, particularly for this bank credit suede says a headline for you, mulling outside investor in the investment bank spin off the stock trading just a little bit higher in Swiss trading. The bank is considering the boutique model for advisory and deal making. Credit Suisse talks are reviving the first Boston name. Those talks on reviving the first Boston name advancing. Talk to us about the legacy of that TK, the first Boston name. Oh, well, it's a magical legacy. This is a lease, but it's just some so far ago. I get it, maybe it changed the curtains and that what I would focus on John is the most important guy in the block today for the bank from Zurich, Christopher Trua, Trua, C-U-H-U-A. He exited to HSBC. They have a hemorrhage and intellectual talent as they did at first Boston years ago. This is what happened with Deutsche Bank a few years ago. This is the problem. And I don't want to go through the Lehman comparisons because we always benchmark to Lehman, don't we? It's not Lehman, then it's OK. I just think that's ridiculous. They've got their struggles. And when the bank goes through these problems, attracting talent, retaining talent is problematic, retaining clients and attracting clients even more problematic and cutting your way to growth becomes increasingly difficult. I was speaking about this for a couple of investors yesterday who said it's not a Lehman moment. I know someone who's saying that is sort of looking at this in a simplistic way. It's more an issue of what cushion banks is shrinking. People who thought financials would do well in a rising market are perhaps mistaken. Credit suites own story, but on a broader level, there are these idiosyncratic issues that become more prevalent when all of a sudden the deal-making pipeline dries up. Tim Morris, can I get you in on this conversation? I understand the delicate part of it that you can't talk directly to what's happening with Credit Suisse. But what, me through how difficult the banking system still is in Europe, why we still have these problems across the continent and in Switzerland too. Well, I don't know if the outlook is necessarily so negative. I mean, for example, in our multi-assert portfolios, we have an overweight to Eurozone investment great credit, even in an environment where we appreciate, you know, we're facing a recession this winter. And one of the reasons for that is even if we do appreciate interest rates a higher, you talked earlier a lot companies having to refinance at higher rates. The good news is if you will, on one hand with high spreads, you're being compensated for the risk you're taking. And that risk might be lower, given that companies have been able to raise a lot of cash at much lower interest rates, balances generally speaking in good shape. So that should be through to less problems potentially for the banks in the lending that they've made. Tim Morris of BMP, Dan Thank you, Sir. Well, it sweeps tread in higher in Swiss trading, rub by 3.4%, 425thug.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,158,2022-10-06 11:13:54

I think we had a three hand. The rule, you know, it's just Frank, but still, when a stock's under five and you're in the banking business, it's just... It's not good. Got some news out of Palaton as well. I'll bring you the wrap of that. Just a moment. I got off. Add that work out. Do I got off? Things you never want to say. The CEO to Dow Jones. If the turnaround fails, the company likely not viable on a son. More than that still to come from New York. This is Bloomberg. Keeping you up to date with views from around the world with the first word, I'm Lisa Mateo. The price of oil is holding steady a day after OPEC plus agreed to the biggest production cuts since 2020. Now, the Alliance plans to slash daily output by more than two million barrels. That move drew a review from the US, which has been seeking more oil from producers. Meanwhile, Russia repeated a warning that it won't sell crew to any country that adopts a price cap. North Korea is ratcheting up the tension in the region. It fired two suspected short-range ballistic missiles toward waters where their aircraft carrier, US Ronald Reagan, had been deployed. Earlier this week, Kim Jong-un's regime launched its first rocket over Japan in five years. North Korea criticized the US for redeplying the Reagan-Garrier group to waters east of the peninsula. Over in the UK, a new study says millions more Britons will be dragged into higher tax brackets over the next three years. And that will cost twice as much as Prime Minister Liz Truss' personal tax cuts. Now, the report comes from the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The government is reducing the rate of income tax, but it's also freezing the threshold where people start paying. And that will force them into higher tax brackets. Global news, 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg. Quake take powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. I'm Lisa Mateo. This is Bloomberg. The standard way venture firms work is you commit capital, let's say, over a five-year investment period, something like that. Yeah, exactly. And then the fund, typically, has maybe 10 years or so. 15, or these days are longer. So often 15, often the tail extends out to 20 years. And some of that invests in a venture fund today should be trying to get rates of return of 20%, would you say, or more? You know, top-end venture is sort of 3X net of fees. You know, ideally you're hoping for more than that. You're hoping for 5X or more. You're illiquid the entire time, right? So you hope to get paid for the liquidity. And today, maybe 20 to 40% if things go well is sort of baseline. Let's take another subject. So I suppose somebody says, I don't want to invest in Andrews and Horowitz. I want to be Mark Andreessen. How does somebody become a venture capitalist? What are the skill sets for good venture capital? So there's high degree of intelligence, hard work, lot of luck, dress the right part. Don't wear a tie. What are the things that make one a good venture capitalist? So the highly successful VCs historically are very idiosyncratic. You know, people from very different backgrounds like Morris is a former newspaper reporter, John Doris, a former chip salesman.

You've got people with very different indigenous briar has more of this kind of blue ship investment background. You have people with very different backgrounds and experiences. And so I think it's it's some set of skills and some set of knowledge. And then it's there seems to be a taste component to it. That's really hard to measure and really hard to predict. A lot's happening on Wall Street. I think Jay Powell said things that were indefensible need to catch up. This is Bluewood Wall Street week. I'm David Weston. We've got the information and insights.

With the odds not doing much on a 10-year, upper couple of basis points, 377.92, a half of 1%. But in news, corporate news. One from Peloton, another piece of news from Credit Suisse. Just want to cover Peloton quickly. Peloton cutting its workforce by roughly 500 globally, or about 12%. The CEO saying that bulk of our restructuring work is complete. But saying to Dow Jones, this headline came from Dow Jones about 15 minutes or so ago. Lisa, this is the one that jumped out to me. If the turnaround fails, the company likely not viable on its own. What a turnaround in the last two years. I mean, considering how much the shares got absolutely blown up during the pandemic. Ridiculous. And then absolutely deflated. But this is the fourth round of layoffs this year, just to give you a sense. Leaving with about half the number of employees globally. And this is the Hail Mary to get to a point where they actually are viable in the new era where people are going back to Jim's. We're making jokes about this. I'm the worst fender. Forget about the jokes. Is the fad over? Is it just that simple? I think to some extent, I mean, I think people still love the bike. Tom, it's not about the best way of saying this. You can have a product you love. It doesn't make a good business. I think it will still love the product. They still love Peloton. There's also a point at which a lot of these companies were able to raise money in every which way during the pandemic when a lot of people's expectations were reset. And now we are having a reassessment of how much money costs and where those investments go. And some of these companies are finding that the investors just are not there. Perfectly put. Like, Trip will say, unsecure debt from a social media company. Yeah, correct. Which you'd like to go for 11, 12%, which might have to go 15. We can talk about that another time, 16 now.

Where's the Swiss government and where's the JP Morgan in this discussion of Credit Suisse? Well you have to think that the competitors are looking at the share price and asking the question of when does this make sense as an acquisition target but if you're Credit Suisse you made the point you don't want to sell shares at this kind of level. So I think you have seen some ideas floated out there of could we bring in some capital in a different way and a more creative way to allow for what will likely be a fairly dramatic restructuring of the investment bank and how do we fund that and so this seems to be one possibility is this idea of a spin off and you know Credit Suisse has had a long running banking franchise. The big question is does that brand name or even a new bringing back the first boss in brand name help or has it lost too much talent to attract an investor. Michael I want to talk about the urgency because we'd heard about a turnaround plan that would be announced at the end of the month. Does it have to be within the next week because you are hearing and Bloomberg has reported of certain clients pulling back in some of their use of Credit Suisse of more departures from the talent that they have. How much is this being expedited by the reaction in markets? So I think there has been that chatter out there. I think the company would like to stick to the date it put out there of third quarter earnings at October 27 coming out with a robust plan. I think they don't want to rush something but there is that market speculation out there you've seen the shares up and down quite a bit this week but the company keeps pointing to the fact that they have over 200 billion in liquid assets so there is not the same fear that we've seen in past cycles about liquid. Okay Michael you've got a cycle pdc knowledge of this. Is this discussion being driven by the board? Is it being driven by the chief executive officer? The chairman by who? By the Swiss government? Who's driving the car right now for Credit Suisse? I think you've got a few parties and we've reported in the past that the board has somewhat been split on how dramatic to be on the investment bank. I think they've gone through the process of coming to a consensus. They have assigned a special committee of the board to look at the future of the investment bank and how big it needs to be. Michael Klein is a major player there. He's obviously a long time investment banker. He's a broad master's another name that is involved there, Christian Meisner on the executive side. So you have a number of experienced voices in the room but I think you're also seeing that there are a lot of opinions here and I think the Swiss government probably has its own view. Michael Moore thank you sir and thanks to the team here at Bloomberg for the latest report on Credit Suisse's firmer. Just a little bit higher in Swiss trading got by a little more than 2%. Half time to restructure a company. Palatine trying to make that effort too. I heard a great podcast in the last week or so with Jeff Curry and Meb Faber and Jeff made the point that this was the revenge of the old economy. It's a line you've heard him say a few times before and to your point just a fold in this low interest rate story to say from Palatine to OPEC. Jeff's point was basically that we've had zero rates for so long that what did people do they made these long duration investments.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,161,2022-10-06 11:26:43
11936," in this low interest rate story to say from Peloton to OPEC. Jeff's point was basically that we've had zero rates for so long that what did people do? They made these long duration investments. They were just putting money into things like Uber, things like food delivery, things like Peloton, where didn't they put the money in the ground to drill? To really build up things like refiners and all of that. And to his points, but a conclusion on it, it's the revenge of the old economy. There's a shortage of real stuff, and you cannot manufacture real stuff by issuing more paper derivatives. And this has been the real challenge, and the reason why it's so hard to really assess the supply-demand dynamic in things like oil, in things like copper, in things like some of these other precious resources. To line up the ducks is Peloton, an example of a zombie company, is credit's Swiss, a zombie bank, is Twitter, zombie social, those debates, that's the fourth quarter. Not for me to say, but I can tell you this, to certainly a relationship between what is happening with the likes of Peloton, what's happening with the likes of OPEC, plus, and the all market. To your point, though, it doesn't mean it's a bad company or has a bad product. Sure. But perhaps it was structured in an era where money was free and where people were more willing to finance a model that perhaps looks unsustainable in another interest rate environment. The whole question of zombification, and they re-finance. Can they be sustainable at a 4% fund rate? You were viable at zero, are you at 4%, 5%. It's a very different proposition. And I would say zero are you at maybe north of 5% for some of these companies, right? From New York City, Marilyn Watson coming up surely from BlackRock, this is Bloomberg. In the past two decades, China has built large infrastructure projects in almost every country in Africa. African governments themselves said we are tired of aid and charity. We want to do trade, we want to be treated like partners. The Chinese came along and said, great, we don't do aid in charity, we want to do business with you. We will mobilize 300 billion euros till 2027. Now the US and Europe are answering back with their own infrastructure initiatives to counter China, but African experts are skeptical.

A bit of calm, just a little bit of calm, relative to the big swings we've had in the last couple of days, we're down about half of 1% on ESMP and that's that 100, we're down half of 1% also on the S&P. I think we're about 6% off the lows of September 30th, still down about 20% on the year so far. If we get to the bond market a week ago yesterday, the highs of the year on a 10 year year, north to 4%, right now 377.52. We've come back in over the last week. We're just a little bit higher on a session by two basis points on a two year, up to basis points as well, to 417 last week, 435. So we've come in there as well. In the commodity market, we've broken out big time in crude. Over the previous three days, we're up by about 11%. On the S&P 500, the energy names are up by about 12% over the same time period. Crude right now, Tom, on Brent 92, 89, that 2 million barrel a day cut from OPEC Plus, probably works out in real terms at about 800K because they weren't hitting that limit anyway, but certainly that's a snub to this White House of what this president wanted from the Crown Prince. I look John, where we are Greg Velier, writing eloquently of California up 62 cents a gallon. Is that all this is about John for America? Operation midterms, that's what it's all about for this president, Tom. What did we call it a little bit earlier? Strategic midterms are very nicely done. Hyperconvesting out on Twitter, fantastic line. That's the cross-set price section. Let's get you some single names. A lot to look at. Let's get to Lisa from Highly Sir. How's it going John? There's a question about how much some of these stories are idiosyncratic versus thematic, and we talk about job cuts. We're seeing that around the peripheries. This morning we heard from Peloton or Dow Jones reporting that they're planning to cut 12% of their staff. This seems like their last-ditch effort to avoid some sort of broader disassembly of the company. This is the fourth round of cuts. So far, this year, those shares year to date down more than 76%. They are not alone in terms of job cuts. Last night, late last night, General Electric, it was reported was laying off hundreds of workers in some of their renewable energy units. Their wind offshore wind units. How much does this really represent a situation where they're not seeing the demand? And how much is this because of supply chain constraints, because of inflation constraints? They cited all of them as they talked about this. We've heard from Meta platforms or Facebook, basically. Those shares are down almost 60% year to date. They are shrinking that company. They expect to be a smaller company next year than this year not saying layoffs, but basically attrition, pushing people out either way. They are shrinking. Peloton shares ahead of the open. Moving all around, right? Is this good thing or a bad thing? Are job cuts what these companies need right now, even after all the losses this year, Tom, you're still seeing those shares lower by 1.7% ahead of the open, because there is dire feeling. Is this the last-ditch effort? What happens if this doesn't work to revive profitability? That's going to be interesting to see. We'll continue to follow that as we can. Joining us right now, Marilyn Watson, had a global fundamental fixed income strategy at BlackRock long ago, and far away, she was had a global fundamental strategy for the Bank of England.

11938," Strategy for the Bank of England. We're thrilled that she could join us this morning. You have been in the halls of the Bank of England. How do you distill the chaos in England and also at their central bank? Well, I think it's a combination of obviously the high inflation, the Bank of England raising rates, then the new government and the very poor communication around the many budget that they announce. And I think that really completely took investors unawares. There was no sign of how they were going to cut expenditure along with the cut in taxation. And I think it just added on top of Brexit, on top of the deep issues we're seeing in terms of economic activity in the UK. I think it just created a lot of carnage, essentially, in the guilt market for a time. Tom, when you learn to write a bicycle in the US, they call stabilizers. We call them training wheels. Training wheels. We call them stabilizers in the UK. Just so if one knows what I'm about to say. Is this bond market going to struggle without stabilizers? Like the Bank of England guilt market operation when it expires in the middle of October? So I think the Bank of England have already signaled with the temporary measures that they announced. I think the Bank of England is keenly aware that they want to keep the market stable, so they may, in fact, need to do a little bit more. I think at the moment, they're sort of training a very fine line. The Bank of England have a very, very measured approach to monetary policy. Every step that they take is very, very finely nuanced. They assume, essentially, any tweaks that they make to the monetary policy won't be seen the full effects until at least 18 months out. So they're trying to adjust policy for a longer term trajectory and yet they're dealing with a very volatile market right now. So I think the Bank of England is obviously incredibly keenly watching what's happening, and I think they will be prepared to do more if they do feel the need to keep the market stable. But I think it's also a global phenomenon. I mean, we've seen volatility across all asset markets. We're seeing across all sovereign bond markets. So we're seeing volatility here in the US. We're seeing it in Europe and elsewhere as well. So it's not just a UK for nominal, but I do think in light of the fact that we have issues that are global in terms of activity, issues specific to the UK. And then the fact that many central banks are obviously draining liquidity from the system at a time when inflation is high. I think it's just a confluence of many things and it's being exacerbated in the UK. Which raises this issue of stabilizers or training wheels for other central banks in terms of quantitative easing, not quantitative tightening. Are you expecting a lot of central banks to fail at their attempts of quantitative tightening and end up actually having to buy bonds selectively on the long end try to control some of the moves that they're seeing? Yeah, so that's a, I think it's a very good question. And I think it, it, it, we've never been in this environment before where we have had so many central banks that came away from positions of such loose monetary policy. They've had these massive bank balance sheets. They've had these huge QE programs. Rates have been incredibly loose. And we've never had a starting position where they're starting to tighten, you know, from these incredibly low levels, given how high inflation is as well. And so I think it does remain to be seen. I think here in the US, I think the path is pretty well laid out in terms of QT. It's already in progress. I think in the UK and also maybe in Europe as well, it remains to be seen. I think in, you know, in Europe we do expect in the ECB to continue to raise rates the next two meetings. But in terms of reducing its overall, you know, bank balance and in terms of QT, still a little bit unknown when you have the asset purchase program on the one hand, you have the pet program on the other hand. And it's a fine balance that they are trying to, you know, juggle, you know, right now there's a lot of discussion about our star star. I'm not going to get into the jargon. I don't want to do that. It's sort of, I know, I feel everyone just rolling their eyes as I say that. I wasn't. I was smiling. Tom's furious. But I am curious whether you have in your mind a level at which longer term yields could rise before the financial stability risks become more pressing than the inflation ones. I think it's not just the.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,164,2022-10-06 11:39:49
11939," which longer term yields could rise before the financial stability risks become more pressing than the inflation ones. I think it's not just the level to which they rise. It's also the speed with which they do that. And so we don't have a certain level that we're currently looking at where we think will be overly concerned and we don't think they're going to get to extreme levels. But we do think if the volatility increases and you see a dramatic shift either because the economy is much worse than we expect or because of other factors we don't know. But I think half of it is actually the speed and also how the curve reacts. It's not just the end point. Marilyn, just final question. Just take a step back from all of this. Can you tell us how much the world has changed for you, Rick, for Bob, for the whole of the team with rates where they are now? And are you looking at this world as maybe something that we have to live with for a while? The Fed funds, the risk-free asset, sticks around 350 to 4% and credit is hanging out of these levels. That's right. I mean, the world has changed completely from year ago, three years ago, five years ago, ten years ago. But actually it gives us a lot more optimism now. In terms of fixed income, actually giving you a decent yield. I mean, obviously we're relatively cautious in this environment. But fixed income now is really, I think, a very decent good asset class once again. You can get the decent return with little risk at the moment if you're in the front-end with low duration. So I think for the long term and going into next year, then I think there are a huge number of opportunities in fixed income that we haven't seen for such a long time. So I think in terms of the team and fixed income investors in general, I think this is a far better environment going forward than we've seen for such a long time. Do you think we can break out into this environment, a new equilibrium, a new normal on a sustainable basis? Do you get the feeling we can? We've seen back around the table that we just can't live with these levels of interest rates. Do you think we can? Well, we've seen it in the past. We've certainly seen interest rates much higher than this in the past. And I certainly think we can live with interest rates being much higher. And I think to a certain extent to get back to a healthy financial environment, I think to have rates a little bit higher, I think, you know, is beneficial for a lot of different businesses. So I think it's certainly possible to get to a sustainable level, is it beneficial for the economy? The world has changed, that's for sure. And thank you. Awesome to catch up. Marlene Watson, a BlackRock. Foreign exchange interests and again, Tom, after being boring for a long time, fixed income interests and again after being boring for a long time. I think we've all seen those stock shows over the last 10 years, they're now talking about Mooney Bonstum. Yeah, well, you know, it's that. Yeah, yes, yes, yes. Have you noticed that? Yeah. I might have found some of these stocks, small caps and all of a sudden, this tells us about fixed income and Mooney's. Well, it's there. You're not kidding anyone. You mentioned it's about the risk-free rate, which has been gone for X-Wine. Over the years. And within the risk-free rate is the idea is, as I said, this 15 times, Taleb is a great quote to grab these bags. Yeah, I love that one. And on a Matthew basis, that's what it is. It is a whole new math after all, just like 20, I will take Marlene's point. We've lived with this before. I don't share the gloom about our inability to live in a high rate. I will say I'm watching the real yield very carefully, not only Lisa, the real yield, but the television property. You can see that Friday. Thank you for that. Thanks for the prime mic. Later after. Appreciate that. Well, I'll just add this and just give a little gloom to offset that because that was way too optimistic. Thank you. But in all honesty, the real tension here is how much debt has been issued at rates that are not sustainable at this point. So what happens with all of those companies? What's our yield do? Well, exactly. And does this end up with an unsustainable number of corporate failures if this does persist for the decade to come? And that I think is attention. The software and debt pro farmers changed. Completely. In a massive way. In a massive way. Since the last time we had rates here, coming up, Stephen Shaw, the principal at the Shaw Group, I imagine he's got some things to say about OPEC Plus and this White House. Look forward to that.

11940," From around the world with the first word, I'm Lisa Mateo. It looks like President Biden's fist pump with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bid Salman less than three months ago didn't pay off. Instead, the Saudis snubbed the president and ate a Vladimir Putin with that OPEC plus oil production cut. President Biden had hoped his visit to Saudi Arabia would encourage the Saudis to pump more oil. In Sweden, the government blames detonation for damage to the Nord Stream pipeline delivering natural gas from Russia. The Swedish Security Service says the investigation has increased the suspicions of sabotage, and Danish and German officials are also investigating. Chairs of Shell dropped after the energy giant pointed to a weaker third quarter performance, and that's likely to end a run of record earnings. Shells refining and chemical business showed signs of a slowdown, and that could be a worrying sign for Europe where major industries are buckling under pressure of storing natural gas prices. In the UK, at least $340 billion was wiped out from the nation's stock and bond markets in the first month of LizTrust's government. The September selloff on concerns about tax cuts saw the pound hit a record low, a bank of England intervention, and eventually a government new turn. One strategist says investors sell them the UK market is uninvestable. President Biden had sipped a Kipsey, New York today for a jobs event at IBM, which will announce plans for a $20 billion investment over the next decade. The investments will focus on semiconductors and artificial intelligence, among other things. IBM has said it will directly benefit from President Biden's Chips and Science Act, which is aimed at ensuring a secure supply of semiconductors.

I'm trying to prevent that, but yeah, I think it's happening. And COVID has accelerated that. The industry crossed $500 billion last year, the semiconductor industry overall, and estimates are $1 trillion a doubling by the end of the decade at that point. I believe those estimates. It's not that there's not going to be some blips and turns on the way, and the majority of that is driven by leadership process technology of which only three companies can satisfy that need.

We were constantly hustling behind him as he caught up with executives in the portfolio companies and reminisced with former and current players. He was a big traitor. He was himself majoring in.

Is that bullish? Raffaubostick there, the Atlanta Fed President. I guess you decide. Is a pause a pivot? Are you looking for cuts? No, that's not bullish. That's not bullish. I'm just asking for a French. Did you think anything was bullish that he said? I'm asking for France. OK, so for you, for Jonathan Farrow. I think if they're pausing and not cutting in a recession, that's problematic. And I can't remember the last time we saw that. I look at the... Not cutting interest rates in a recession, Tom. I look at the acclaimed academic Raffaubostick and all this talk about cutting interest rates in that. And a guy like him is looking at R-Start-Start. R-Start-Start. In going really? That's driving you nuts this morning. It's driving Raffaubostick nuts is what I would add to... Right, make it a little bit more simple and frame it as follows. They're going to bump into financial stability concerns before they get to where they want to be. That's the argument. It's not my argument. And that's the reality in places like the UK. Maybe even in Europe too, you've seen Italian spreads? Yes, couple of weeks. Yeah. Back to two thoughts. Well, two readings there. Amber Evans Pritchard and the telegraph was brilliant and gloomy on Italy where there's stuck here now. And Ben Amman's was definitive yesterday and explaining to me. He went so far out he had R... Sure. R-Start. And R-Start-Start. It was in English. The ECB said this moment ago in their accounts. Growth concerns shouldn't prevent forceful rate hikes. OK, that's where we're at right now. With central bank policy. That's what they want to signal. That's the official line. Is it tradable to say that they're not going to do this? If I tell you they're not, that's just what they want to signal. They won't follow through. Is that tradable event? Can you get your head around there? It has become a parlor game of tradability around all of his stuff. People are getting it. Has been all year. Like the hedge fund you mentioned earlier that's up a hundred gazillion percent? Blue crest. Yeah. Yeah. Are they trading around this news? I don't think so. They're trading. What's the conviction? Well, they are traders.

An investment is a trade gone wrong. Yes. What's amazing about that company and why I'd love to sit down with them. And this is a pitch, by the way. They seem to manage to avoid becoming married to a world view. Yes. If you think about the gains from 16 through 22 and I was going through it yesterday, I was just thinking 2016 China slowed down Brexit. 17 tax cuts, 18 trade war, 19 after the QT mass rate cuts, the pandemic, the massive stimulus, the inflation this year, huge rate hike and cycle.

11942," To keep generating gains through each and every one of those regimes, without becoming married to a world view. You think about the people who did really well in the previous decade. A lot of those guys did, there's some great years, there's some bad years, but largely because they were pretty consistent about the way they saw things. They were either permaballs or permabairs. To make that move from regime to regime, from year to year, it's pretty phenomenal. Speak to a process and speak to a nimbleness of thought and of really execution. I don't think it exists in many places, Tom. It does exist in the oil patch and it exists in the research note of Stephen Shorke. He's principal to Shorke Group. We protect the copyright of all our guests. Get his magnificent statement on the American distillate and oil economy from the Shorke Group. Stephen, thank you so much for joining us this morning. The simple question is, what does OPEC plus mean to a gallon of gas? But far more than that is the nuance. How does OPEC plus's decision impinge on the many distillates that we take from a barrel of oil? Absolutely. OPEC's only influence over the market, Tom, is the price of crude oil by constructing the production or increasing the production thereof. So obviously with the move they've made now or the announcement they made yesterday of taking two million barrels off the market. Clearly we're looking at fewer barrels on the market as we go into the fourth quarter. Now I want to be clear here, OPEC made the announcement of a two million barrel cut, but OPEC is already, it's 13 members and I want to add four of which are in sub-Sahara Africa are struggling to maintain their current quotas. So by announcing a two million barrel cut, given what OPEC is actually putting on to the market now, the cut will amount to only 750 to 800,000 barrels a day, which is still not an insignificant number. And therefore it has the potential for impact on oil prices. Now we don't consume oil, right? We consume the derivatives of oil, gasoline, jet fuel, diesel fuel, so forth. What we've seen here now to answer your question, Tom, on the US East Coast is our refinery capacity has been slashed by more than half over the past 10 years. We simply don't have the ability to turn what crude oil there is out there into what we need, into everything we need. At Thomas Sal, statement on economics is scarcity. We cannot produce everything that everybody wants. That is the current situation when it comes to oil derivatives. We are producing what most people want the most, that is gasoline. And therefore, what refining capacity we do have left here in New York is geared towards maximizing gasoline production. The other derivatives, i.e. heating oil, which is also diesel fuel, jet fuel, that suffers. So, as we look ahead to this heating season, 70 percent of the homes in this country that heat their homes in oil are located in the middle Atlantic, New England states. We are going into this winter with a thimble full of heating oil. We do not have, it is a dire situation. We're going to this winter. We don't have enough supply. It is going to be a very volatile and a very expensive oil. So we can get the heating oil from Europe. Well, yeah, that's going to be a tricky right? We're going to be trying to provide them with, again, natural gas as well. But, Steven, to your point about refineries and capacities, given that there has been talk about releasing even more from the strategic petroleum reserve to lower gasoline prices, how much are we bumping up against the limits of refineries where even a release won't really make a difference in lowering prices further and really, we're kind of at a bullets. Exactly. Well, we never had the bullets, Lisa. I mean, doubling down on a policy that has failed is stupidity on stilts. We haven't been trying to manipulate the price wheat being the White House. Been trying to manipulate the price of oil now for the past year. With the last 52 weeks, we've dumped 200 million barrels of government-owned crude oil onto the commercial market. And what do we have to show for that one year later? In New York, heating oil prices are $1.46 a gallon higher. 30% higher than they were a year ago. So we can drain, and we're just about there with the SPR. Over the last 52 weeks, we've drained a third of our emergency supply of oil. So what does that mean? A year ago, we had 42 days worth of supply of crude oil.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,168,2022-10-06 11:57:15
11943," Well, the last 52 weeks, we've drained a third of our emergency supply of oil. So what does that mean? A year ago, we had 42 days worth of supply of crude oil sitting in the SPR. Today, we have 26 days left of capacity. That is the lowest level since 1983. Now, keep in mind, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is for emergencies. Imagine, last week of Hurricane Ian did not go into Tampa, but instead went into Houston or New Orleans, the IED Oil Epi Center of North America. We simply are the least prepared ever for an emergency. And the only thing we have to show for that, Lisa, one year of ION, is a 30% increase in distillate costs. So threatening or OPEC with, oh, we're just going to put more oil. We're just going to do what hasn't worked over the 52 weeks. We're going to do more of that. That is not a threat. OPEC is laughing this off right now. Steven is the Strategic Midterm Reserve, according to a friend of ours. OK, remember that. Steven Shaw, the short group. Thank you, sir. The SPR, TK. That has been battered. Well, don't get me going on it, but the answer is to speak to experts like Shore, because valuable. I love how these guys go narrow and we take advantage of it. I'm here to get you going. Life from New York City. I'm sorry. Just to wind you up. Just keep saying that commercial break. Exactly. This is blowing back. What do you say to the cynics that say, look, it's all nice and fine, but a lot of it is greenwashing. And you're not a good company. You're just a less toxic company than some of the other oil majors. Well, the first thing to say is that I'm a big believer in we need to put ourselves in other persons' shoes in life in general. So I understand that point of view. And I get that people have that perspective. I don't agree with that, obviously, but I understand where they're coming from. We have an enormous challenge as society, which is to provide the world with reliable, affordable and clean energy. That's what society wants. That's what society needs. And I believe in my heart that a company like BP is actually one of the few companies in the world who can actually make that happen. We can talk about the things that we're going to grow over the coming years. I find it huge, the exciting and energizing for our organization. But that's what the world needs. And you simply can't go against the grain of society. You can't defy gravity. And that's why we're making the change that we're making. Things that we're capable of using in this kind of legs are came out of this fear doing as well as spending more money and our hospitality. And then the whole life through this kind ofares such as notice rates of love living or having something along with your advertising business to take care of in the management process. We're sending colored investing products on our social platforms involved in this.

We're going to have to accept some pain in the domestic economy to bring inflation down. I think the most important thing to remember is that we're in this situation because of over stimulation of the economy. I think the market is probably too optimistic about the earnings. The question of the day has been where we are in terms of capitulation. As long as there's vigilance by central banks, that's highly likely that the inflation rate will decline. There will be disinflation. This is Bloomberg's surveillance with Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow, and Lisa Abramowitz. Good morning everyone. Jonathan Farrow, Lisa Bramiston, Tom Keane, a most interesting Thursday claims in 30 minutes. As we look at jobs day at Chimera and John, we start October. I'm going to call it odd October. That's where we are right now. We're in a hurry with you and we're very focused on the economic data, Tom. We're very focused indeed. Job openings collapsed by more than a million a little bit earlier this week. The hope is that we can get a soft landing. Jobless claims coming a little bit later this morning. Then it's on to payrolls tomorrow morning. It's on to payrolls tomorrow morning, but what in payrolls matters? Is it about the jobs someone told me it's NFP three month moving average? Or is it about the elements of inflation that you see in there, including wage inflation? They want some heat to come out of the tightness of this labour market. That's for sure. And that's what the move lower in job openings spoke to last week. We can forget when we think about the totality of the data. There's one data point. There's much brighter than the others. And much, much bigger. It's inflation. With an eight hand, they'll still and we'll get CPI again next week. When we see that, I mean, we've got Ghana just a moment ago. The central bank lift. Lots of EM moving here, frankly, getting out front of IMF in two weeks. But Lisa, I look at the jobs report tomorrow and I agree with John. It is about price change and what it signals for the Fed. And then there is this issue with workers between Iraq and a hard place. There was recently a study done by the Federal Reserve, one of the regional banks that showed that people are losing money at the fastest pace going back in history, according to some measures in terms of real wages. They are so deeply negative and getting more so at a time when inflation is incredibly punitive, particularly to the lower income Americans. So how do you then deal with this at a time where you want to see people keep pace with inflation? Is wage inflation such a bad thing, especially if it offsets that? We're going to talk to Tracy McGillan about this and ask the allocation in a moment. But let's stop the show for what no one's talking about. It's not front and center. It will be fast. 6% plus mortgage rates housing rent. In terms of, yeah, imploding is that too strong or word? If you own a house right now, if you bought it like Matt Miller not that long ago, this is a wake up call. The leg up is going to be a big one when you go to fix that mortgage against home. But this is the goal is in England. That's a big deal. Isn't this the objective? Isn't this the goal? Yes, I will say on housing it is the goal. It was out of control way above the regression of the mean and all that. So, yes, definitely no question. Can you draw a distinction between what is problematic at the moment and what was the objective for this federal reserve? Politically, what does it mean? Let's say house prices decline like they are to see rentals even come in. Well, when you're talking about house formation and the fact that people cannot afford to go out and have their own homes as young people, it does become a political issue. But it doesn't speak for lower rates. It speaks for to keep them where they are for greater home affordability. My issue is at what point do they actually develop more housing right there? Right. Why should they keep poor?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,170,2022-10-06 12:06:02
11945," But it doesn't speak for lower rates. It speaks for to keep them where they are for greater home affordability. My issue is at what point do they actually develop more housing, right? The other sort of side of an equation that has been unbalanced since the crisis in 2008. 14 things to talk about today. We go to Bloomberg reporting in Zurich, in London and John, it's a credit suite update from Bloomberg and it wasn't pretty. I tell them with them, trading it about forced swiss right now, to do the restructuring and raise the capital they might need for that would be very difficult. So it's no surprise to many of us that we're reporting to the financial investment. Don't know perhaps we'll cut her before, but ultimately the clock is ticking and we think we get this new reog this new strategic plan at the end of the month. So do they need someone to announce by then? Chris, Lisa, the CDS matter. I'm not a fan of CDS as a measurement of a company. The credit default swaps matter is a measure. You speak after Credit Suisse default swaps rose to the highest levels or became the most expensive to ensure against going back to 2009. It's an indication of the likelihood of restructuring of some default credit default event, not necessarily some sort of liquidation wholesale like a Lehman moment. Let's get the data started. John, trusty in sterling. I mean, you're coding it. Not so good. A trusty in the market. Trusty in sterling. Not so good. Sterling's week when it has been the last couple of days, dollars stronger again against the Euro two, Euro $9866 with down to 10 of 1%. It was unchanged. On a 10 year 375 51, equity is a little bit negative here, Tom. We're down a half of 1% on ESMP. Brent crude 93 were watching that for a breakout. Not there. Yeah, but as John mentioned, a big pop over the last number of days. Tracy McGrill and holding court at Wells Fargo investment on global asset allocation. How valuable is cash Tracy right now into the jobs report tomorrow? So we would say that holding some cash in a portfolio, holding some shorter term fixed income being more defensive on the equity side is all important going into tomorrow's read on the jobs market. We do expect that the jobs numbers will be something for everyone really in terms of job gains probably likely to slow relative to the August numbers. So that'll be a positive for the Fed. We would also count as positive any increase in the participation rate, any decrease in average hourly earnings, if we were to see a decrease in the work week, that will signal to us that the labor market is less stretched. So the overall message probably from tomorrow is continued strength. And we expect that the unemployment rate is going to stay stubbornly low at about 3.7%. Tracy, when you get into a mess, typically you wait for some kind of countercyclical circuit break, you could have come in. So you can get along this market again. Tracy, where does that come from? It's not going to come from the fiscal policymaker and a monetary policymaker is intending to slow this thing down. Where's it going to come from? It's probably not going to come in the near term. And it's probably eventually going to come from the Fed. We think that the Fed is likely to stick to its plan to raise the Fed fund rates to 4.25 to 4.5% by the end of the year. So that means 75 basis point raise in November of 50 point raise in December to get us to that level. And then probably a couple more 25 basis point increases in 2023 to get us to their terminal rate. Then we expect them to take a pause and start cutting by late 2023. So that's probably where we get that turn in the markets and anticipation of an eventual cut. But it's probably not coming for another year or so. Tracy, we've been talking about the death of 6040 for the past nine months. How much are we going to see the rebirth, the reincarnation of 6040, maybe starting at the early next year? If you start looking at the potential for some sort of rebound or revival once we get the downturn, as well as a run of Fed cuts helping the Pacific Cinco market. Sure. So it has been really ugly for global bonds and for global stocks. I was looking at the end of September numbers for global stocks down 20.3% and global bonds down 20.4%. So the 6040, I'd love to.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,171,2022-10-06 12:10:09
11946," for global stocks down 20.3% and global bonds down 20.4%. So the 6040, a global 6040 has had very abysmal return over the past 12 months. But the good news or the silver lining, I guess, for those big-sting come investors who have suffered through this worst bear, probably on record, is that rates have reset higher so that does mean that they are getting these higher rates for a longer period of time. And should we see cuts next year, then that could also provide a capital gains boost for the fixed income component. And as we see things recover from the expected recession, a boost in equities by the end of the year last next year as well. And we would say broaden that diversification for now, have some commodities exposure. And if appropriate, have some hedge fund exposure too because broadening diversification is helping that very narrow 6040 performance this year. Hey, Tracy, thank you. Tracy McMillan there, the Wells Fargo investment is the true. Tracy, thank you. 6040s had a tough ride this year. But as we reset, as we reset with Bonnose, these kind of levels, they sort of push back to that view at the start of the year, it's kicking in a big way, going to year end. I mean, what's going to get away from these asset classes moving in tandem? They moved in tandem the wrong direction this year. How much do we get them moving in tandem again in the right direction come next year, especially given how much room we've bought ourselves when it comes to the fixed income market? What's going to break the correlation, so that's the question. I don't think there's anything that's going to break it other than data dependency. And there'll be some seismic change to open prayers towards a soft landing, but frankly, you can go the other way. I don't, if COVID continues in China, and if we continue with what we've got, what are the central banks do? They've got to continue this trend. We've fluttered with this idea of a soft landing going into CPI. The other way around. And then we got CPI and all of a sudden again, it was just elevated and we trashed that story once more. And the harder the matter is, whatever you gauge, inflation is 6%, 5%, whatever the number is, that's unacceptable to any authoritative institution. It's not just a Fed slow in down, it's the UCB slurred down as well. And we're still asking the question, what does life look like at a B.O.J. after Governor Coroda has gone? Does he take yield curve control with him? Well, some people think that they're just buying time for six months or so until his term is up, and then they'll let it go. Because he wants to just cap his era of yield curve control and other people are saying, well, perhaps that will coincide with this perfect weakening in the dollar, it will give them plenty of room, regardless we are looking at an era where perhaps we're going to see the end of quantitative easing, but perhaps not. Perhaps it'll come back in four, and that's what we saw for the Bank of England. I can't get away from it, Tom. I can't get away from it. George Magnus yesterday, he's also a listering note, and we've forgotten about productivity. Moments ago, thank you, Alex Tansley, Donan, and Washington. Pablo Ezard, the New York Fed, writes a definitive short paper on this, on radio, I'm holding up my cell phone. And he says, the productivity decline is from not computing, not from technology, but small computing. The miniaturization that all of us have lived is a huge part of this gloom over a low productivity. Another way of putting this is that we waste a lot of time on our phones. That's what it was saying. I think that that's what you're saying, which I, I have until today, don't disagree. Was that a message for the kids at home or a message for us? This is the reason why we're doomed. Should I get on TikTok or the talk? I don't think I should do TikTok. I think the Chinese Communist Party gets you data through that, Tom. I think they do. They need some feedback. Yeah, something like that. Possibly from New York City. Come here and see you. Claims. Claims. 20 minutes away. This is Bloomberg. I'm Keen. I will follow you on TikTok.

11947," In the past, the U.S. foreign producers, being called Russia, repeated a warning that it won't sell crew to any country that adopts a price cap. North Korea is ratcheting up tensions in the region. It's fired two suspected short-range ballistic missiles toward waters, where the aircraft carrier U.S. Ronald Reagan had been deployed. Earlier this week, Kim Jong-un's regime launched its first rocket over Japan in five years. North Korea criticized the U.S. for redeploying the Reagan carrier, grouped to waters east of the peninsula. In Northern Thailand, a mass shooting that began in a daycare center has left at least 36 people dead. Most of the victims were children. Authorities say a former police officer used an automatic weapon. They say he later killed his wife, child, and himself. Amazon plans to hire 150,000 seasonal workers. That's about the same as last year, despite predictions of a lackluster holiday shopping season. As Amazon says, the employees can earn more than $19 an hour on average.

This next major iPad software update, iPad OS 16, by about a month from September to October. Apple made the decision for a number of reasons, including a still buggy, stage manager multitasking interface, and an order to link the launch closer to the more similar Mac OS Ventura. Still, it's an unusual move. Since shifting the launches to the fall in 2011, Apple has released its new iPhone and iPad software updates simultaneously each year around September. By staggering the releases, users may find some issues around compatibility with cross-device features like retracting and editing messages in iMessage, the new shared iPod Photo Library, and the new feature for transferring FaceTime calls between iPhones and iPads. It will also make it a bit harder for developers to launch apps that run on both the iPad and iPhone that require new APIs and features found across iPad OS 16 and iOS 16. Regardless, it was still of course the right move. Stage manager on iPad OS 16 is still quite buggy. I don't find it particularly intuitive, and it's not compatible with most iPads and many third party apps on the app store. The feature clearly needs some more polish. And complaints from consumers about stage manager will now no longer probably overshadow the earlier launch of the iPhone 14.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,173,2022-10-06 12:18:24

I think he needs to do one more 75 basis point tightening. But he needs the markets to follow through with fee tightens and raises the policy rate. And you see equities go off to the races like you have for the last two days. I think that's going to be counterproductive to what he's trying to accomplish. And that's the problem for the boat which people are trying to see last Saturday, and have to write out the report. We're going to be able to view the polls right now.

I think of Benjamin Tall in his great work. Bippin'er, I joined this right now. I had a foreign exchange strategy there on Canada. But so much more on the time we live in, which is strong dollar. Bippin' I want to talk about the x-axis of the belief that the dollar is going to weaken. Everyone's been wrong, wrong, wrong. Is your dollar study short term or to go to the British medium term or long term? Where on the x-axis are you studying when the dollar breaks? We're probably looking at the medium to long term. And if you want a specific gauge for how long to, or at least a way to calibrate that, I would say that potentially in the early to mid-part of next year's potential, when we'll start looking towards the next UF growth story, potentially leading to a softening of the dollar on a sustained basis. Well, it's a sovereign dollar on a sustained basis. But the question is, what does EM do along the way? Are you partitioning now developed economies from EM? Are they holistically the same against strong dollar? You have to partition them. If you look at the way EM is traded this year, it's been relatively robust compared to the dollar and at least compared to other DMs. Most of the stronger dollar story has really been concentrated amongst the DM currencies, predominantly the traditional funders like the Euro and the Yen. And also now of late against the sterling. I mean, we think that will migrate more towards a stronger dollar versus commodity currencies that backdrop as we move forward. That's predominantly due to the imbalances that have been built up in some of these.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,174,2022-10-06 12:25:39
11949," the sterling. I mean, we think that will migrate more towards a stronger dollar versus commodity currencies that backdrop as we move forward. And that's probably due to the imbalances that have been built up in some of these commodity currency economies, including here in Canada and of course, Australia and New Zealand as well. So over the past couple of months and I really mean a couple, a month and a half perhaps, we've seen a little bit more stability enter the market. We haven't seen the same kind of runaway dollar strengthening and we've seen a little bit more stasis at much lower levels versus a dollar for the euro pound as its own story. How long do you expect to get this kind of stability as people game out? What we already know, which is rate hikes on both sides of the Atlantic? Yeah, so if we're talking about stability in a dollar, we really need to delineate against what we expect the stability to come from. We're talking about the broad dollar gauge say the DXY, which of course is more tilted towards a greater weight waiting on the euro. Yeah, maybe the stability lasts a little bit longer because I do think that a lot of the the sources of concern earlier, particularly with respect to energy security, you know what, they've been pushed a little bit further out. I don't want to say the complete result, of course, because a lot of it now depends on how serious the demand situation will be. And for that, we need to really look at the weather reports or at least see what the weather looks like and how cold it is in the euro zone for this winter. So for migrating away from this sort of concern that the dollar is going to continue to appreciate into the euro, eventually the end, of course, an intervention story there. You know, that doesn't mean that the dollar still can't appreciate against some of the other currencies. And you know, I very much agree with some of the other rhetoric that's been espoused by some of the other guests that we're going to look at a higher for longer story and not necessarily a scenario where central bank shadow training cuts next year. That's the case then. We got to look at where the situations are fragile where the higher for longer story could potentially break things. If that to me is somewhat concerning, especially for Canada and Australia. John, when do we just start to get a meteorologist on? I asked that to show. Yeah, exactly. We should. I mean, what point is this going to determine the trajectory for the euro? I mean, let's say it's a cold winter bit, and what are we looking at in terms of what the euro dollar should be? Yeah, if it's a colder than expected winter, I think we see a Zoom, my Tours series broad, natural gas supplies. We're looking at potentially $0.90 a euro, I think. Maybe even the sustained momentum below there. That's when you start worrying about whether or not security risks or at least natural gas security is enough given what we have now. I mean, one of the key things that have really driven the euro lower this year is the fact that the large economy in Europe and of course Italy as well. Both have had the reorienter, their energy story away from Russia. And again, that's a structural change. If that's not something that you can really hope to address in one year or even two years. Bip and right, thank you, sir. I've seen IBC capital markets. It's not a one winter event. How many people have to come on and tell us that? It's not a one winter event. In fact, given how we've got storage up in Europe, this winter, I think that explains how much harder it's going to be to next winter to do the same thing again. Well, the extension of any war and you see this in every single war, you study the American Civil War, John, and it was going to be over in six months. That didn't work out. And as many others as well. And you get to the war and you crane it right now. The zeitgeist is Ukraine. Do they make a dash down south towards Crimea? Guess what? They're talking about mud. It's no different than any other war. It's about the weather. It's about the calendar. What do they do? Sit for next spring to restart that war that gets you to next year. Have we confronted the reality of what could be happening in Europe beyond this winter? And this goes to the point that you made earlier about how we haven't invested enough in the ground in physical goods, right? And this is what you were talking about with. This is the sort of comeback of the real world. How much can nations like Germany borrow and especially at these rates to do fiscal investment in some of these structures to get the natural gas needed that will not be supplied probably by the Nord Stream pipelines? You said, yeah, I see you want to talk? Well, yeah, I'm not really focused today. I can tell the difference. I can tell. Tom's got a role in radio. Can I give away your secret? Yeah, please. When Tom's meant to speak next and he misses his cue, he goes quiet because he knows the role in radio is the next person who speaks, owns the silence. Right. And it sounds like it's a different day.

Like from New York city this morning, Futures lower but about 410 off-session lows living around this matter is 24 K. That won number 299 19,219, this is first letter in top 32. in just a second for the change. That means that we are seeing a slight increase in jobless claims, but not a whole lot at this point. 1,361,000 continuing claims that's just marginally up from the week before as well. So it looks like people are still getting jobs. Now, I was interviewing Mary Daly yesterday. We talked about this. Claims, she says, are the last thing she looks at because at this point the Joltz data are telling you there's still a lot of openings so people who lose their job can get jobs and claims are going to be really slow to go up because companies at this point aren't laying off people. They're just not filling new jobs. I'm going to sound like a fed official then. When she looks at the totality of the data, the totality, their word, the totality of the data, does she see the heat coming out in this labor market yet? So far, we're seeing that in the job creation numbers. And tomorrow we're going to, according to Bloomberg consensus, see a reasonable decline, not a drop off tremendously. And that will suggest that companies are starting to cut back a little bit on their hiring. And that's what they want to see. They don't want to see the unemployment rate go shooting up, but they don't think that's going to happen because at this point companies need workers. You also asked her, and it was a really good interview by the way. Congratulations. You asked her about what it would take for her to cut rates. And she really put cold water on this theory that there are going to be rate cuts next year. This is coming from someone who wants to see workers succeed, who wants to see a fully employed America. She explains some of the tensions that she feels in the face of higher unemployment and potentially still restrictive Fed funds rates. Well, she told a story about going out to a Walmart in the San Francisco area dressed in sweatshirt and jeans, not telling people that she's the San Francisco Fed chair. And asking people, what are you most concerned about these days? And she said, everybody complained about inflation. Nobody said there was a problem getting a job. And so their concern is that workers are worse off, even if they're getting raises, because they're not keeping up with inflation, then they would be, by a small number of people losing their jobs in totality. If the unemployment rate goes up a little bit. Now, is the unemployment rate going to go up a little bit or is it going to go skyrocketing? That's going to be the question in the past. It's often skyrocketed. You get a much larger increase in unemployment when you get a recession. But so far, their argument is holding water. So what President Bostick said, even if that happens, we shouldn't prematurely step away. Well, they look back at 1970, it was actually in the 1980s when Paul Volker went back to cutting rates a little bit because unemployment was coming down. And then it started to go back up again. Inflation started to go back up again. And they had to start raising rates again. And they don't want to repeat that mistake. You get the fame in some. These guys are really wiped down by the white history, don't you? I think every speech I've read that. And if you saw Mary Dele, I think she's just done a great job. Most of these people are making it up as they go, and they don't know how to admit it. They think they're on a theory. Where's the theoretical structure for all that we're seeing? I think they're looking back to history in the mistakes that were made Tom, and they're worried about repeating them. No one wants to be that name in that history book when it gets read. Yeah, that's fair. And that includes the bank of Japan is, well, my comment.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,177,2022-10-06 12:36:36
11952," looking back to history in the mistakes that were made Tom and the word about repeating them. No one wants to be that name in that history book when it gets ready. Yeah, that's fair. That includes a bank in Japan is, well, Michael McKee, tomorrow on, is there a press conference for Jobs Day? No. There should be. Well, there is because Marty Walsh will talk to him. That's the news conference. There you go. That's the news conference futures erasing the morning's losses, Tom. We're now positive on the day on the S&P. There we go. And it's been a, you know, relatively resilient market after those. That's all it takes. We'll get a few more layoffs next week and the bear market is over pretty much. Are we done? Yeah, Neal Erychuson. Let's go there right now. Michael McKee, thank you so much. Greatly appreciate that this morning. Neal Erychuson with his chief economist at ADP. Neal Ery, I want to cut to the chase and just simply say in the new emphasis on tomorrow's Jobs Report, what are you in ADP focused on? Well, good morning. I can't think of a better way to start that conversation with wages. It's all about wages. It's about how wages are driving or not driving an inflation. And that's what we're focused on. It, it, it pays to be a micro economist in a macro world. Because when you are, you look at things as a collective decision-makings from small to large firms. And what we're seeing is that timing has been a very important factor in the entire dynamics of the labor market. We are now starting to see more people, at least as according to the August report, enter the jobs market. And we saw a deceleration in wage gains growth for job changers. And I think that deceleration is notable. And we saw it across all firm sizes because it means that switching jobs is not paying off quite as much as in the summer. And that might reduce some of the pressure in terms of inflation. What's the care in ADP is wonderful with this? What's the character of the job market differential out there right now? Is it airline pilots? Is it bartenders? Who is the job sector that matters to Neal Richardson right now? Well, it all matters, Tom. But I think what, where we are, different points of rebounding, right? So the service sector was hardest hit. And so when you look at leisure and hospitality, that's important. When you talk about inflation, though, what's driving inflation is low pay, low wage, low skill jobs. And are we still going to see low pay workers still see gains in acceleration at pay? That didn't happen during the 10 years of expansion leading up to the pandemic. Well, we see it after we get over this hump of getting really back to normal when it comes to jobs and getting inflation down. That's the concern that low pay workers won't see the pay gains in the future that they saw over the last year and a half or so. Neal, I've given that backdrop. I'd love you to comment on what Michael McKee was talking about that there's this expectation that the unemployment rate will rise. But just marginally, right? It might peak out at four and a half percent. Still well below some of the peaks that we've seen in recent downturns. How quickly could that move away from the Fed based on what you're seeing in the micro data? Well, let's start with the joltz because I think that's important. That was in a big number this week to see a million fewer job postings. We at ADP actually think that postings peak this spring. So we weren't surprised to see that decline. So that's the first indicator. The second, this timing issue is really prevalent. If more people are coming back to the labor market because they want and need to work. And yet firms are slowing hiring. That's what's going to cause the unemployment rate to increase. That denominator is really important. It's not the number of jobs created every month so much. It's the number of people entering the labor market right at a time when firms may be slowing hiring. So I'm really focused on the denominator of the unemployment rate. We're looking at this, hoping that we still managed to get some sort of softish landing. But even Fed officials are really pulling back from that kind of language. And he left from what you're looking at. What kind of downturn are we looking at based on some of the rate increases that are expected and based on the pace of weakening, the pace of loosening of this labor market? I think you're going to see different angles. Maybe you could call it a downturn.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,178,2022-10-06 12:40:37
11953," on some of the rate increases that are expected and based on the pace of weakening, the pace of loosening of this labor market. I think you're going to see it different angles. Maybe you could call it a downturn by a variety of cuts as opposed to one big stab. Sorry to be graphic in the morning, but you're seeing interest rate sensitive sectors starting to feel some weakness in construction and manufacturing. If we see inflation really hit pocketbooks and consumer spending, you might see consumer services take a bit of a hit as well. And so all those gains and leisure and hospitality that we've been touting might slow professional business services are vulnerable for structural reasons as fewer people go back into the office. That might change the complexion of office support jobs. So the economy structurally is also changing at the same time that we might see some downturn dynamics driven by monetary policy. And tracing that all out is very difficult to do. And they always love listening to you. Thanks for coming on the show with us. And I think that's an expected now use that word worse loosely. Lisa, because for the Federal Reserve, maybe this is exactly what they want to see. Right. And is it enough then to actually cause them to pause? I mean, the fact that markets are trading as much as they are shows this sort of confusion. And perhaps a radic or febrile as you guys were talking about markets that we had seen because it's hard to say that this is really going to cause the fed to readjust. However, that clearly still is where the hope is in the markets that they will actually present the circuit breaker to what we've seen in terms of a downturn. The thermometer here, John, is a Bloomberg financial conditions index. This is really good math. The IMF uses it all the time. The fact is this is going against Chairman Powell. We've gone in a matter of days from a negative restrictive 1.46 standard deviations. We breached through negative 1 in advance this morning to a less restrictive negative point 9.4. That's all you got to look at. So they want to keep it restrictive. I agree with you. But if with worried about further downside in markets, this is the kind of data set that alleviates some of those worries. Because you have some economic data coming in that changes the probability that the Fed has to go further. Now, I say changes the probability because that can change again tomorrow morning. What you're learning about in the way the market is responding to the incoming information. No, and this will frustrate you all I know and Lisa's bracing for it is that at the moment bad news is there you go. The market, right? Because hopefully if the data cooperates, they don't have to be as punitive with respect to rate hikes. And the data was not cooperative in September, but now it's starting to get more so. And this is why the bullish argument has changed this well in the last couple of weeks. They're not talking about lots of upside. No, they're talking about limited downside because they want to see the data come out this way. All the bullish discussion. Who are you talking about? I'm not talking about anyway. Oh, yeah, that's not making personal. All right, I'm never personal. Coming up, Laurie Kavassina of RBC, Brian Weinstein and Morgan Stanley, Francisco Blanchard, Bank of America.

President Biden's fist bump with Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman less than three months ago didn't pay off. Instead, the Saudis snubbed the president and aided Vladimir Putin with that OPEC plus oil production cut. President Biden had hoped his visit to Saudi Arabia would incur into Saudis to part more oil. Shares of Shell dropped after the energy giant pointed to a weaker third quarter performance. That's likely to end a run of record earnings. Shells refining and chemicals business showed signs of a slowdown and that could be a worrying sign for Europe, where major industries are buckling under the pressure of soaring gas natural gas prices.

For the fourth time this year, Peloton is laying off a significant number of employees. CEO Barry McCarthy told staff today it's part of the effort to save the struggling fitness company. Roughly 500 Peloton workers are being let go and it's roughly 12 percent of the workforce. AT&T CEO claims his company's satellite phone service has an 18 month lead over T-Mobile and Elon Musk.

Today, what are the biggest challenges for general dynamics and what are the biggest opportunities? So I think in any business, the challenges are solving complex problems that come to you. You know, the problems that come to me and my senior leadership team for resolving tend to be highly complex and nettlesome. So your ability to solve those complex problems is an important element, I think of the value that we add to the company. And then I think opportunities, you always want to make sure that you've got a creative enough mind and open enough mind to be able to see around square corners. What am I missing? You know, the why questions are really powerful. Why are we not doing this? So why are we doing this? I ask those questions a lot. And in the answers, you can sometimes tease out some real opportunities, some hidden things. And you can create a way about opportunities and problems. It's really important. And what about the industry generally? I think they have big challenges now as the defense budget probably comes down a bit. So I think that we are all responsible and we have an obligation to find the latest and best technologies that we can for our customers and deliver them in the most cost effective manner we can. And I think that that's a challenge and an opportunity for all of the big defense companies. In the past two decades, China has built large infrastructure projects in almost every country in Africa. African governments themselves said we are tired of aid and charity. We want to do trade. We want to be treated like partners. The Chinese came along and said, great, we don't do aid in charity. We want to do business with you. The obligatory will mobilize 300 billion euros till 2027. Now the US and Europe are answering back with their own infrastructure initiatives to counter China. But African experts are skeptical. China has been that guy around the corner with a bouquet of flowers to Africa, the US, Europe and the UK of time and time again say be careful of the flowers you see out of the window they have fons on them.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,180,2022-10-06 12:48:56
11955," I'm in actual price trends in the last couple of months. Well, I don't know. But then we see, sorry. No, no, I want you to illuminate. But you see some more concern in places like Canada and New Zealand and Australia that there actually isn't risk there for a more protracted downturn. What's the distinction between declines in prices and a housing crisis? The answer is a good question. The scale of declines is obviously important. What we think at the moment is that markets are poised between something like a modest sort of decline, maybe 5% or 7%. And something much steeper, 15% to 20%. Now, how much do you need to constitute a crash, depends what you mean by a crash exactly? Normally, when we think of a crash, we think of not just the scale of the price decline, but we think about things like more of these delinquencies and maybe a feedback into financial instability through that channel. Now, we think it's quite plausible that some of these markets are going to see ultimately price levels of 15, 20%. Even more, we have a bigger forecast down there in Canada, for example. Yeah. But perhaps we're less concerned about financial instability than we would have been 15 years ago. Yeah, but what is the character here? And I want to go back to America here as we're mourning in America here 8.50 AM. What is the character of America with housing worries in a relatively conservative fixed rate, fixed mortgage market versus a floating rate regime, as you see in the United Kingdom? Well, you case with really a floating rate regime anymore. It's partly a floating rate regime and more like a short term fixed regime, really. But you're right that US has got a very different structure in mortgage as to most of the economies we looked at with the longer term fixes. But of course, that didn't preserve the US from having quite an empty housing crash after a global financial crisis. So it's not a panacea to have long term fixed mortgages because you can get problems in other areas. So, for example, if people go into negative equity in part of the states, we've seen in the past situations where people will hand back their keys and you get foreclosure sales, which hit prices in various parts of the country too. That's just one channel by which this can happen. So it's one of the Christian factors having long fixed rate mortgages, but it isn't on its own enough to prevent a downturn. Adam, how much is what we're seeing with mortgage rates can accelerate the trend of the emptying of big cities that have gotten more expensive, although they haven't necessarily seen the price gains that other non-cities have, versus perhaps making them more relatively affordable and seeing more stability. So obviously, cities tend to have higher property values in many cases, which means that you need bigger mortgages, therefore other things being equal, higher mortgage rates will put you off from city properties to some extent. How that balances the affordability, it depends. You have to model that quite carefully. Prices probably have to come down quite a long way for it to be a net win for affordability I suspect, but you have to model that carefully together to continue answering. Adam, thank you for the note. I greatly appreciate it. Adam Slater, Voxford Economics, there with a global view on housing with a mixed story country to country. We've got to go, Lisa, to what you talked about in the brief this morning, which is there's no one not talking at the Fed today. We begin with a Loretta Master now beginning at the Cleveland Fed. We don't have headlines on that. Yeah, the mathematician at Cleveland is going to give us a mathematical view. I'm sure of what they need to do, which is to move forward. Yeah, and what we haven't heard, which I find really interesting, is no talk about shifting that target of 2%. That has remained very sticky in the conversation. They want to see us get back down to that. There is no discussion of the Adam pose of 3%. There's only this idea that you want to stay high in terms of where the Fed funds rates remains for longer, even as you see a deterioration in the economy. Yeah, what's interesting there is there's not even 2.2, 2.4. There's just this religion and institutional responsibility to say 2%. And I really think I can add whatever that means. So when we were talking about Mary daily.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,181,2022-10-06 12:56:00
11956," an institutional responsibility to say 2%, and I really think I can add whatever that means. So when we were talking about Mary Daly in the conversation that Michael McKee had with her, he talked a lot about how her sort of walking about the streets really colored her view on how to move forward and how punitive it is to see inflation where it is and that is such a massive concern and charge on people's incomes in a way that even puts that as part of their broader mandate, you know, beyond just simply targeting a number. You mentioned this earlier and what you do folks is you look at the chart, we don't have the chart right now in radio, it doesn't look that good anyways. And there's the integrand or the area above the line of the wage boom of the pandemic. And now there's a new integrand below the line of real wages not being good. And it's getting old, it's getting, you know, the phrase, it's a fancy phrase long in the tooth, but it's getting old here, this negative wage growth after adjusting for inflation. When you start seeing higher income households shopping more at Walmart, shopping more at Walmart. Are we there, why do you believe that? We heard it in the numbers. We heard it from them that they're seeing more people start to shift to areas where they can get better deals when you go to Whole Foods and you get the paycheck at the end year and you get the paycheck, you give it over to the check for the grocery store about how much you end up shifting gears just to save money because it is a shocking difference. It is and across the board and I can do, I've done research at Whole Paycheck and the answer is yes it is. It's, you know, on a given round, round there was six, seven, eight bags, it's 20 bucks more than it used to be. And so people are starting to downshift. That's the reason why people see this negative data and they think maybe the Fed moves away a little. And negative data tomorrow for jobs. We'll see that at 830 tomorrow. Yes, we will go beneath the headline data and look at that on radio and on television. Features improve, negative eight right now. Resilientate the VIX 28.95. Stay with us.

The semiconductor industry overall and estimates are a trillion dollars of doubling by the end of the decade at that point. I believe those estimates.

It's back to you. Good news. Live from New York, sitting this morning. Good morning. Good morning for our audience worldwide. It's slightly negative. The countdown to the open starts right now. Everything you need to get set for the start of U.S. training. This is Bloomberg, the open with Jonathan Farrow. Live from New York, we begin with the big issue. Next up, payrolls. The judge report coming out on Friday. Do your slave market date on Friday. All eyes will be on non-farm payrolls. The $200,000 to $300,000 would be great if we're still adding to the $300,000 jobs in month. That is an extraordinarily resilient labor market. To get the Fed to pause, many job growth is slow to at least $100,000 a month. The Jokes number was worse than expected. It is, of course, encouraging to see some early signs of weakness. So bad news is good news. They think the Fed will give them relief. They are talking very tough. They're sticking to a script. The Fed is feeling the pressure. But how strong they'll be if that data rolls over? I don't know about that. Maybe we're going into one of these periods where it's like bad news is good news. We're going to talk about that right now with RBC's Laurie Kavassena, more constantly sprang-wise. It drives us all nuts, Laurie. But is it true? It's bad news, good news. It drives me nuts too, John. But I think that's the mode we're in right now. And, you know, it's interesting as we've been looking at the jobless claims this morning. One of the things we've been thinking about is how if you look at the S&P, you look at the Russell 2000, they tend to trend in terms of performance year over year with year over year trends and jobless claims. And if I were able to show you the chart right now, John, you'd see that the market, both small and larger already baking in a pretty big pickup and jobless claims from here. So I think that's something else to keep in the back of your mind. This has been pretty well anticipated. Brian, your take on that. Yeah, I agree. It's been anticipated. What I would think about, John, is that at some point the Fed has to stop going 75 percent of the basis points of clip. And I don't know that they need to be excused for that. So maybe this payroll isn't as important as some of the others. Bad news is good news. Maybe it helps them. But the Fed is going to start to talk about a slower pace and the market may very well like that. Is decelerating right hikes, Laurie, sufficiently positive for you to underpin a durable gain in this market? I think that, you know, we've already had with the lows that we made, you know, kind of that break below the June lows, kind of the hawkish Fed for a bit longer has already been baked in. So it may be enough at this point. And frankly, John, as you know, sort of talk about the pivot emerges. I don't know if you necessarily need a pivot at this point. You may just need the pause. You can pause in the economy can get worse. And by definition, your tighter, you, Brian, isn't that problematic? It's problematic, but it's probably better than continuing to hike and knowing it's a lag. You get lagging results. So you slow down. You hope that things get stronger, not that hope is a great strategy, but it's better than raising rates a lot. And we've done a lot of work in interest rates, right? I think the interest rate, high quality portion of fixed income is it will",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,183,2022-10-06 13:04:46
11958," You hope that things get stronger, not that hope is a great strategy, but it's better than raising rates a lot. And we've done a lot of work in interest rates, right? I think the interest rate, high quality portion of fixed income, is it will attract capital and slow down some of these hotter flows. Well, Brian, let's talk about that. The last time you were on, you said rates have not found their high. That was a while ago. Then the 10 year breach 4%, and before we got to 4%, you also said that you'd be leaning in when we got to 4%. So what are you doing now? What's special about fall? Yeah, we're leaning in. I like leaning in. What's special about 4 is that I think it gives you some wiggle room. It gives you some coupon, some income. Listen, I'm not calling for 10 years to go back to 2. I think that's the wrong way to think about it. I think what it gives you is a chance to hide out, earn some income as inflation falls, maybe get some capital appreciation. And the hard work here has been done by treasuries and gilts and buns and investment grade credit. And so you can actually buy quality things and actually earn some return for first time in a very long time. Let me ask you this question then. What are you more confident about? The 10 year yield is peaked or that the whites are in credit? If I had to choose one, I would say 10 year yields have peaked. And that would be the sequence of things, wouldn't it? You'd see the peak on a 10 year yield and then you'd see the whites come in in the credit market. So Brian, where are the whites in high yield credit? Listen, I think there's an increasing chance that we've gotten there. I'm not confident. Now, I think we've had some, finally some less orderly moves. But I still think you haven't seen the earnings pain. You haven't seen the results of all the Fed hikes and tighter FCI. So I think we still need to see the real economic pain that's coming before you see the whites in credit spreads. Laurie, can you tell the bottom in the equity market before we send the whites in credit? Well, you can call the bottom in the equity market before you see the wash out on earnings. I mean, that's something that we're comfortable saying. We've seen consistently in big crises and big kind of economic challenge periods that market is typically bottomed about three to six months before the earnings do. Now in terms of the credit spreads, we do watch how you'll credit spreads pretty closely when it comes to small cap performance. And I think small cap is an important barometer for the broader market as well. But I tell you, John, when I put the issue of spreads aside, we do take some comfort in the fact that small caps tend to start out performing midway through a recession. When unemployment rates starts to move up, so I do still feel very, very comfortable telling people to jump on that small cap tray. But I do admit that the spreads are an issue. Let me ask both of you if you're comfortable with this, this language that President Bostic used in a speech yesterday evening. If economic conditions weaken appreciably, for example, if unemployment rises uncomfortably, it will be important to resist the temptation to react by reversing our policy course prematurely. I've asked this question, Laurie, about 15 different ways over the last couple of weeks. The market's very preoccupied with asking the question, what would it take the Fed to stop hiking? That's bullish. I wonder when we get to this point when we start to realize that if we get a recession, there will be some people in the committee arguing that we don't cut rates. There will be no rate cuts in a recession. What would that mean to the equity market, Laurie? So look, I think that if you go back to 2018 and we go back to that December moment, we've been thinking about this quite a bit. I think the idea that policy was on autopilot was what really unsettled markets. So I think if there is a debate at the Fed, and there are people who are pushing to stay restrictive, of course, the markets aren't going to like that. But you do need to look at the balance of comments. I like it when I hear Fed officials talk about data dependency. I think there's a view among a lot of equity market participants that they are not going to be able to withstand the political pressure if the employment data gets too bad. So I think it could contribute to volatility. But I do think, frankly, John, we are in store for this extended bottoming process. So it all adds up to me and makes sense to me that if we get that debate, it could contribute to that further volatility. We might not make new lows on it, but it could keep things feeling pretty lousy. That's the struggle, Brian. I think we're always arguing, where does the countercyclical circuit breaker come from? Laurie mentioned 2018, the Fed backed away. The rate cuts weren't too far behind. I just wonder where it comes from and what brings it around. It's not coming from fiscal policy makers any time soon, and the Fed arguably wants the weakness that is materializing at the moment. So where does it come from? I think it comes from time and ability to prove that inflation is actually really coming down. By the way, I think energy complicates this. Energy is a tax on the consumer, but it also embeds the idea that prices are going up again, and the Fed doesn't want that. So I think they're going to push against this idea that they're going to eat.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,184,2022-10-06 13:09:18
11959," I think energy complicates this. Energy is a tax on the consumer, but it also embeds the idea that prices are going up again and the Fed doesn't want that. So I think they're going to push against this idea that they're going to ease quickly. It's why I like the idea of income over capital appreciation. I think going out the yield curve, earning income, the curves could really invert further. This is not a great entry point, but they could keep inverting as the Fed fights this idea that they're going to come to the rescue, save asset prices, create inflation. So I think John, it's time. They really need to make sure they beat this inflation genie back into the bottle. Brian, you were leaning into a tenure at 4%. Are you still leaning into that coal that we could get to? 10 to negative 100? I, I, I, I mean, again, I want as if the Fed, if people read the Fed slowing down as, as a pause, then we'll, we'll steepen again. So again, I think you'll have a chance, but I like buying longer duration things. It's been a terrible, the worst year ever, for long duration quality assets. And I think we've moved further there than we have and say the two year note where the Fed could keep rates here or higher for, for a long time. So yes, I think we can still get there. I've got a long list of people that share your view, particularly on the 10 year and that 4% number. We've had a lot of pushback in the last couple of days from Fed speakers. The San Francisco Fed president, Mary Daly, no different. Take a listen to this. I don't see that happening at all. I see us as raising to a level that we believe is restrictive enough to bring inflation down and then holding it there until we see inflation truly get close to 2%, and demonstrate that price stability is restored. KB9's, they have zero interest signaling rate cuts anytime soon. No, they don't. And I would bet that the course of Fed speakers we're going to hear from today, including Mr. Waller, Coshkari Evans Cook, all will be singing a very similar tune because it wasn't just Mary Daly yesterday. You also had Rafael Bostic speaking, saying, yes, I want to get to between four and four and a half percent by the end of this year. But we also need to hold it there and see how things evolved, how the economy and prices react. And he literally said, and this is a quote, you are no doubt aware of considerable circulation already that the Fed could begin lowering rates in 2023. I would say not so fast. And yet the market is saying, nope, we're going fast because bets on a rate cut next year are still alive and well. The market's still pricing in one cut for 2023 with at least two more priced in for 2024. Essentially not buying the idea that the Fed isn't going to blink if the economy softens and cracks start to form and things start to break. And of course, the labor market is going to be critical in the evolution of that thinking. The Fed would like to see more slack forming demand for labor going down. And a pickup in jobless claims this morning and the Jolt Steeda we got earlier this week in which we saw about a million fewer job openings here in the U.S. would lend support to the idea that that is starting to happen. But does that mean that employers had more success hiring or just decided to stop trying to hire? We might get a clue on that tomorrow when we get the September jobs report. 275,000 on non-fond payrolls is what we're looking for. 3.7% on the unemployment rate. But that is the question, John. How high does that unemployment rate go? And when we get there is the Fed really going to tolerate it? How high does it need to go? Kelly Lies, thank you. We'll catch up with Michael McKee a little bit later this hour on job losses. Brian, I want to talk to you about this and forgive me because it involves mind reading to some degree. Do you think there's a difference between what some of these federal officials want to signal and what they actually know they will do when that weakness starts to materialize? Yes, I mean the Fed is playing two different games, right? They need to play this inflation expectations, fighting, roll, but they also have to be intelligent, data, reactive forward looking humans as well. So again, they have other tools, right? They can stop QT. We just saw with the Bank of England if things got unstable. They could buy long-term assets, right? They don't have to ease in order to make things better. So I think they know their tools, I think they're comfortable with them. I think they're comfortable with what they're doing. I think they believe it for now, but they know that this could turn on a dime and so they're willing to do what they need to do. And pricing in eases next year isn't crazy, but they should absolutely fight against it. Laurie, I sense from you that perhaps mind reading set officials as a game that you've done want to play. I think it's an exercise in futility to be honest, John. And I know we all have to play it to some extent. But I think the reality is is that we do have people at the Fed who are going to pay attention to the data. As I talk to investors, and I've been traveling the country the last few weeks, I still get a lot of questions from equity people about what do different components of inflation look like. I mean, there is still a real attention and there's a real sensitivity to the idea in the equity transfer, like the fact that theACHEV payments from the Fed have not made the Buy and Fall money Fair withdrawn to H snug one from the Fed. I don't have a fairMPs side. Jacque Barclay-Ladil cents, $7 now.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,185,2022-10-06 13:13:46
11960," I still get a lot of questions from equity people about what do different components of inflation look like. I mean, there is still a real attention and there's a real sensitivity to the idea in the equity investment community that inflation, the sort of seeds of moderation have been planted. And you have to think that the Fed is going to pay attention to the data that's incoming. And I think that's a reasonable assumption. Laurie, are they more worried about inflation than they are about losing their job? There was something Mary daily talked about. Is that your sense of things too? I'm losing their own jobs or people losing jobs. That's the problem. It's always a soft landing when someone asks this job, isn't it? Unfortunately, that's the language that she used. Right. I think we're, and I hate to even spark this conversation, but I think we're getting into territory right where we were talking about what does transitory mean before the kind of idea of uncomfortably high. What is the level of uncomfort of discomfort that the Fed is willing to tolerate? I think that's going to be the next big question that comes into play. But I have to think at the end of the day that this whole inflation issue got started because of the concern that it was having on the broader economy and individuals and consumers. And I do think those consumers and those individuals are at the forefront of their minds. Laurie, Brian, you're going to be sticking with us. We've got to talk about the energy market as well. Future is right now. Negative about a third of 1% on the S&P. 18 minutes away from the up and down. Coming up, OPEC class delivering a 2 million barrel blow to the White House.

For no coast look points to India's incredibly competitive education system, if you can survive the pressure it takes to get into one of the Indian Institutes of Technology, it gives you confidence to handle American universities and later the business world. Meanwhile, the belief in India's ability to produce so many tech wizards is reinforced every year. Indians make up about three-fourths of the immigrants receiving coveted H1B visas for the US.

11961," Excellency, unfortunately, you bring premiums to become very expensive. OPEC Plus delivering its biggest supply cuts since the pandemic, two million barrels per day, the U.S. slamming the decision. We're disappointed that OPEC made this decision. It's unnecessary if you look at the global environment where supply continues to be the predominant challenge. The White House making good on another SPR released by the tuner 10 million barrels adding in a statement to following. The Biden administration will also consult with Congress on additional tools and authorities to reduce OPEC's control over energy prices. Team coverage starts right now with Bloomberg's Havier Blasen-Landen, Amory, Dan and DC, Havier, what happened here? Well, it was a very surprising move because OPEC is cutting production with brand crude nearly at $100. This is the typical scenario where you will expect in OPEC to be adding production. And I hear the concern by Prince Abdullah-Sis, the Saudi oil minister about an incoming recession and what it will do for the oil market. We have seen it in the past 1997, 2008, 2020 very recently. But there are a lot of counter-balancing forces against that impact on demand. We don't have a big reaction from non-OPEC supply. We look at U.S. sale, it's no growing as in the past, inventories remain very low, and the European sanctions against Russian oil are about to start in about six weeks. All of that will have given time OPEC to react. Why now? Why precisely four weeks ahead of the mid-term elections is a puzzling decision to me. AMH, it's told to me about the timing and the optics here. The timing and the optics are incredibly challenging and really a blow to this White House. We look at the timing, as Javier just said, we are just weak out from the mid-term elections. While the administration has worked to get gas prices lower as they remind you every day, the fact is, especially in Western United States, you are seeing how much energy prices take up. Of course, as well, this is on the heels of the president making a landmark trip to Jetta Saudi Arabia, where he fist pumped the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, who is now the prime minister, as well, Mohammed bin Salman. And then you have to add on top of the fact that the United States has been rallying their Western alliance partners to make sure they are having these repercussions and sanctions on Moscow due to Putin's invasion of Ukraine, and yet what you have is a decision that is going to help Russia. And at the same time, it was an in-person decision, which we have not seen since the pandemic. Starting up to this point, at Obek has been virtual, and on top of that, that means the deputy prime minister, Alexander Novak, was there in person, and he was just days off as sanctions list out of the United States. Javier, I want your thoughts on the SPR. Had someone reach out this morning to me on Twitter, the handle of hyper-convexity, calling it the strategic mid-term reserve. Your thoughts on that, Javier, just how the SPR is being used ahead of the mid-terms? Well, it's true that there is a political upside for the White House to use the SPR, and I know that a lot of people don't use on social media, but on Wall Street, think that what was going on. But also, we look at the American oil market. If it has not been by the decision of the White House to release the SPR, American commercial crude inventories will have absolutely collapsed last summer, and we will have much higher oil prices, much higher gasoline prices, and certainly a much bigger inflation problem, not using the United States, but around the world. So I don't think that it was just about politics. The main problem now is that you are fighting a flow, the flow of barrels from OPEC with a finite stock, which is what's left on the SPR, and it's not a lot left. Can the White House order further releases from the SPR over the next few months? Yes, it can. But there is not a lot, and certainly they are not going to be as large as they were through this year in 2022. Have a blast, Amarie, to the two of you. Thank you. Brown Weinstein, I want your thoughts on this. I'm not going to ask for your view on the strategic midterm reserve, but I will ask for your view on the energy market and what it means for your coal going forward from here. Yeah, listen, there are so many uncertainties out there, and that's one of them. And obviously Europe is a mess. The situation in Russia is going to be with us for a while. And so you end up in a world where it makes the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,187,2022-10-06 13:22:05
11962," So many uncertainties out there, and that's one of them. And obviously Europe is a mess. The situation in Russia is going to be with us for a while. And so you end up in a world where it makes the Fed's job impossible. It's going to slow growth. It's going to cause the consumer to feel like inflation is going up no matter what the Fed does. And it's going to slow growth, I think, right? Input costs are going to go up, and I'm not sure you can keep passing them on. So it makes me like, again, that longer term fix income stuff a little bit more. But it also makes me worried the Fed is going to have to raise rates more, or at least stay stickier to convince people that that inflation, that prices aren't going to go up, add in for an item. It's really a difficult place for the Fed to be. And the energy makes it that much more complicated. Jeff Curry of Goldman have said a few times over the last 12 months, this is the revenge of the old economy. Laurie, that we had zero interest rates for so long that everyone shakes along duration assets. They invested a ton of money in things like peloton, food delivery apps, car services, Uber, all of the above. And we didn't invest in digging holes in the ground and mining after the bus to China 10 years ago. Laurie, with that in mind, I think people might be hesitant tactically to invest in the energy names going into an economic downturn, talk to me about the structural story and the tailwind that might persist through next year and beyond. Well, look, I think that in terms of we haven't, we haven't drilled, we're not able to drill enough, right? We have these shortages there. I absolutely agree with Curry's assessment. And I think we're hearing about this kind of revenge of the old economy, not just on the energy and materials complex, but we also hear it in terms of industrials and the need to reshore in America. And we're hearing a lot of talk about those as longer term themes going forward. And I think for right now, I think the energy stocks are still cheap. It's really where the earnings power in the market is because of these structural dynamics. And so I think that this is still a sector that you can invest in for now. It's been orphaned for quite some time. But we are seeing that re-engagement trade come back. And John, if I could talk about the strategic midterm reserve for just a minute, I think that the Fed is not the only variable here. I was getting pretty excited when I was hearing Anne Marie and Javier talk earlier. But if you think about something else that's going on in the market right now, those gas prices that were coming down were helping Biden's polling numbers. And so as we've started to see gas prices come back up again, and with this cut that we've got now, I think that actually does something very important for equity markets in the short term, which is throw some momentum back in the direction of Republicans right now. We've started to see in some of the polling data that the Democrats are not doing as well in the generic congressional ballot. Republicans have perked back up in the real clear politics data. And that tailwind from gas prices coming down that had really helped the Democrats in all these polling and the betting markets in recent months. That seems to be dissipating. And if Republicans do set up for a good midterms, that's going to be good for the equity market in the short term, despite how it complicates the Fed narrative. Laurie, we're going to talk more about that now, Dan, and we're looking forward to doing that with you. Laurie, can you have a scene of that Brian Weinstein on the strategic midterm reserve? What a phrase. Quite enjoying that, to be honest with you. The S&P 500. Energy stocks on that up more than 12% over the previous three days, yet today up around about 45%.

11965," Looking at Peloton announcing another 500 job cuts, taking layoffs today this year to 4,600, they basically cut half of the workforce in their pursuit of breakeven cash flow. That having an effect on the stock, as Abby said, I think we're down 90% over the last 12 months or so. Interesting on Amazon, this is a company as well that really had scaled back its investment and undone some of the pan-demic era restructuring. And now it's saying it's going to add 150,000 employees, it's been in the same way as it's been in the last 12 months. And then it's been in the same way as it's been in the last 12 months, but it's been in the same way as it's been in the same way. And now the next step is to get back to the conversation about how the earnings outlook continues to be revised. And if you look, for example, at the City Group Global Earnings Revision Index, we're down for a 17th straight week. Those expectations continue to fall when, in terms of the third quarter, specifically, this is my world. We're looking at communications and technology and technology. And I think that's a bright spot, though. Did you see that note from City Group strategies led by Rob Bucklin saying they actually favoured tech going into recession and they've lifted global tech to overweight because, frankly, they think the EPS will hold up better in a global recession. How many times have we said strong balance sheets in trench market position? Does that help? We'll find out. Congratulations. Return leg next week. We'll do the return leg next week. Big tech, information technology right now, up to 10% of 1%. Energy stocks over the last few days have absolutely ripped. That's been a major story for us. That's for sure. Take the rigs. Your thoughts on this one? Yeah, John, I think this is interesting. The big headline for me that stood out this morning is, here's what Goldman to UBS are all saying about the big OPEC-plus production cuts as of yesterday. And the majority of the analysts are now looking at Brent reaching $100. They're going to be able to get a bigger barrel, a lot faster and sooner than had originally projected. So this sets up the narrative of maybe a drop in global supply, but also maybe a drop in demand as well if you're thinking about some as slowing economic pressures as well. These are some of the big energy stocks that are getting a little bit of a boost on that. Interestingly, we're going to dive into Shell. They're all 5.5% this morning coming up with an update this morning on the street, the majority of them looking at this as being a week guidance. Jeffries is one looking at significantly lower trading contributions, upstream production guidance is lower, margins in the chemicals division also lower. So facing some input cost headwinds as well as margins are pressured. Finally, John, just change of the board. And it has been the story of the day, the story of the year. Energy is just a massive outperformer. You see that again, is everything else has just been a little bit lower. But energy is still the winner. Can you hear the window, Klinek? I know, is that what that is? I think you should address the sound. It's a great lesson in just focus. I think you did a great job. Kaley Nines is standing right by the window. Tough, active, be kidding. Kaley, good luck to you. I have no idea what you're going to talk about because it's so loud. I'm not here either. Vibrating through my school right now. But I'm going to continue talking about oil because Taylor actually teed me up perfectly talking about how all of these Wall Street strategists are now coming up and saying, yeah, we see triple digits in the near term. Morgan Stanley being one of them who says we're going to get to $100 a barrel on Brent. Far quicker than we thought. Goldman Sachs echoing that. They actually now are looking at one 10 in the fourth quarter, raising their forecast by about 10%. UBS sees oil at $100 for the next several quarters as well. And there are reasons all being that the production cut from OPEC Plus is just going to mean tightening the oil market even further. Restricted supply is the name of the game here. And the idea of more constrained supply has pushed oil prices higher over the last few days. Not just on Brent, but WTI as well. It's up about 10% this week. The best week going back all the way to early March. So about seven months, though it's worth pointing out we're still down about 30% from this year's peak back in March. And one final note on these production cuts. There are some analysts out there who have been quick to point out that the reduction in output is larger on paper than it actually will be in reality. Edmondsett City is one of them saying the effective cut is going to be smaller because the group already is failing to reach their quotas. At RBC, they agree with that. Hellema Croft over there says the actual cut will be more like a million barrels a day with Saudi Arabia counting for more than half John. Are they climbing through the window? I have no idea. I can't see from here. Kenny, thank you. Francisco Blanche can't even hear this. So that's the good news.

11966," John, are they climbing through the window? I have no idea. I can't see from here. Kenny, thank you. Francisco Blanche, can't even hear this. So that's the good news. The Bank of America, head of global commodities research joins us right now. Francisco, thanks for joining us. What a time for it in your world. Can you just run me through a couple of things? We'll start with the output cut from OPEC Plus, 2 million to the limit for output. Can you tell me what the actual real cut is relative to what they've been producing? Hey, John, thanks for having me again in the program. So look, I think in terms of the 2 million headline, the most likely output cut is going to be around 1.2 million barrels a day. The majority of the production cartelment we think is going to be Saudi Arabia is going to be the UAE quate. So essentially it's kind of a GCC-driven, Gulf Corporation Council-driven cartelment. Russia itself is producing well below their actual quarters in terms of crude oil. So it's unclear how much oil the Russians will cut. But I do think it's important to understand that OPEC is sending a big signal to global energy markets that they don't like. The prices of oil, essentially something they believe is black gold trading below the prices of other commodities, like for example, thermal coal, which they obviously believe is essentially dirt. And that's one element, right? I think the other element is inflation. We've seen the price of oil today, this heavy, where it was beginning of the year, more or less flat, headline inflation has been close to 10%, thus another reason for, I think, the group coming into cut. And let's not forget, I mean, OPEC is cutting because they can. There is very little spare capacity. There is really full oil in strategic storage or in commercial inventories. So the group is preempting a potential sharper drop in oil prices. If the economic situation deteriorates into the first half of next year. So I think all of those are reasons to justify what they're doing. But importantly, there's still a big question mark. How much oil will leave the market once the price kept on Russian crude and products comes into effect in early December for crude and in February for pro. Francisco, as you know, this introduces some tension between OPEC plus and the White House, some additional tension. Can you run us through the viable options for this White House? You seem to be very, very keen at keeping oil down, gas prices at the pump low, going into the midterms? Sure. I mean, I think the White House has a few options. I think the most obvious one is to keep depleting the strategic storage reserve. I don't think it's necessarily a great idea, given the incredibly tense geopolitical world that we live in today. But that's, I think, something that could help prices from moving higher. I also think that there will be pressure, maybe some legislative pressure on coming into OPEC. We've heard noises around that as well. But ultimately, I think what OPEC is trying to do is reaffirte its independence from a U.S. policy and look after their own interests. And that's what we've seen OPEC do. Also clearly, ROC is the critical component of the OPEC-plus alliance. And they are reaffirting their influence in the group, which is essentially dual headed by Stanley A.A. and ROC-N, but also have, of course, many of their big players like Iran and others that are just not going to be unhappy if they get higher prices for lethal cost. I'm not sure why we're even surprised by the clues in the name. OPEC-plus, the plus is Russia. My question at the moment on SPR, Francisco, I'd love you view on this, and I understand it might be delicate to talk about the politics of it, but it's clear the SPR has become politicized. We've had people call it this morning, the strategic midterm reserve. Can you talk to me about the negative, unintended consequences of the politicization of the SPR going into the midterms? Well, look, John, the most obvious challenge using the SPR for political purposes is that you're depleting your research, and every time you use those research for political reasons, you are essentially...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,192,2022-10-06 13:43:42
11967," political purposes is that first you're depleting your research and every time you use those research for political reasons, you are essentially loosening E volumes that could help you if we actually do have a molecule crisis in crude oil. Which remember, we haven't had yet. Today we have the highest energy prices in the planet since 1979-1980 on average, but it's mostly been a gas and power crisis. We have had no oil crisis yet. And the keyword here is yet. If you lose your ability to temper price appreciation, because there is an actual physical disruption of molecules in crude oil, you're going to, you had those barrels in store. That's, I think, a big problem releasing the SBR right now. You're essentially, in some ways, putting your hands even more so in the hands of Opic Plus. So obviously, Opic has been unhappy about the release of SBR oil, which has been one of the factors driving prices lower. But at the same time, they're saying, well, okay, you can keep doing this for a little longer, but eventually, you're just sitting on more and more market control to the group. And ultimately, that's not a bad outcome either for Saudi, Russia and the rest of the numbers of Opic Plus. Well, Francisco, I wanted to fit in one final question, and that's next year. You don't need me to say this, but for the benefit of everyone else. Policy today, as you know, shapes the crude market for years and years to come. And I look at the situation in Europe right now, they've got storage capacity up to where they want it for this winter. The ability to repeat the act next year is going to be really difficult on the natural gas side. On the energy side, what we hear from this White House is just bandaid after bandaid after bandaid, blaming every single person on the planet for why crude prices are high and should be lower. Yet, I don't see a change in strategy, Francisco, to shake things for years to come. The blessing this year, I've been told this by so many people, is that China carried on with COVID-0 because they didn't. We'd have a much, much bigger problem. Can you run me through what 23 looks like with all of that in mind? Sure. I mean, we've talked a lot about Opic Plus reducing production as the big of Delta in terms of oil supply demand balances. But also, to your point, China this year saw a compression on oil demand of 2.5 percent, 400,000 barrels a day down on last year, which by the way, makes it the first and biggest compression, of course, since 2002. So the biggest compression in 20 years, that's what we've seen from China. If China comes back from COVID, we are going to need a lot of oil. Our baseline is that we'll see a progressive comeback. The demand for oil in China will be above last year's level next year. And remember, as we speak, Hong Kong is reopening its economy and allowing for people to come in without a hotel quarantine, which has been a huge drawdown on airlines that were operating locally, which were essentially down 90 percent in terms of flights until very recently. So that's going to lead to a big pick up, I think, in China as a man. Again, 90 percent of the growth is going to be emerging markets in China for next year. And I think that the third Delta here to think about is the extreme high price of nitrogasps is also leading to substitution into oil. Again, because oil is steep, it's steeper than coal, steeper than gas. So that's been another factor, I think, we'll likely drive prices higher next year. But honestly, one of the things that we are really saying here is that, unless we change our investment policy, and I don't think we're going to, because of all the climate change concerns, we are really going to be in the hands of OPEC Plus for quite some time to come. And that, I think, is something we got to learn how to live with and potentially find those alternatives, which I think, through the inflation reduction act, we could really see some light at the end of the tunnel. Ultimately, what this combination of factors leads us to is, especially fast decarbonized system in the US, and ultimately, we'll see a lot of those American hydrocarbons becoming available for export via LNG or via petroleum products for crude oil. And I think that's the ultimate story here is the US is going to transition fast into lower hydrocarbons demand, domestically, the more exports, if you look five years out. But not only becoming energy independent, but becoming really energy dominant in the global markets. And that's another reason why OPEC is getting all anxious with the White House too.

I tell her. I want to get to Peloton, but I first want to focus on GE, John, as the industrial bell weather for this economy. GE, of course, also announcing about 500 layoffs in their wind turbine unit as well. That represents within the factory unit about 20% of the US on shore wind workforce. So it's isolated at least to this unit, but again, it's sort of a similar story when we think about the industrial and the read on the economy. Mike McKee is going to do this next slide a lot better than I am, but this is at least one that shows that are all reserved sometimes too optimistic when they predict unemployment rates. So they're rising and they always end up coming in a little bit higher than they had initially projected. Of course, this year 2022, TBD remains to be seen. Finally, I'll just end here, John, as you mentioned about peloton. So away from maybe some of the industrial outlook in the economics, but more on sort of the cyclicality of where we are in this cycle. As you mentioned, also 500 jobs trying to save the company in a six-month turnaround plan. Taylor Ricks, what a tough job in this economy as things start to roll over a little bit. Mike McKee, you were teed up nicely by Taylor Ricks. Let's talk about tomorrow's number. What are you looking for? I actually wanted to talk about peloton. I haven't finished paying for mine yet, so save the company. Actually, take what happened today with jobless claims. The market loved it because it's a bad news, good news situation with claims rising a little bit, but the number of job openings is still extremely high. So the Fed sees that as okay at this point. They'll be looking for a small decline in the overall hiring rate. They want to see things go down on a sort of regular basis, but not collapse. 260,000 is the forecast. They'd be fine with that. Unemployment not expected to change. Average hourly earnings down a little bit. So all in all, the market is expecting a kind of Goldilocks report. We'll see if we get that. But again, it's the trend that matters to the Fed. And if they do see the fact, the number of people who are getting new jobs declining in the same way that they are, we have seen over past couple of months, then that's going to be a relatively good news sign for them. It doesn't mean they're going to change their views on what they're going to do for November, but it does mean that they'll feel like they're on the right track. My McKay, the Fed's fake. Can we finish that? I wonder if it's driving you nuts yet. Evan's cook, cash canary, Waller, Mester, all today. Even after the Fed's fake we've already had. Is there anything left to be said? There's nothing left to be said, but the question is, do the markets get it? They're still hanging onto this Fed pivot idea, and as long as they are, the Fed's going to keep pounding away and say, we're not going to do that.

Welcome to Dead Breakfast Australia. This is Bloomberg Technology with the Bloomberg. The lineup. Pepsi's number fever campaign in the Philippines has probably gone down in history as one of the biggest marketing disasters in history. Mainly because of a human error that led Pepsi to print more winning caps than they planned. The resulting chaos caused riots, civil unrest and even deaths. Reporting this story took over a year and it resulted in me flying to Manila in the Philippines to meet unlucky winners. And to find out exactly what happened back then in the 1990s. My name is Jeff Mace. I'm a journalist based in Los Angeles. I wrote the story for Bloomberg Business Week about Pepsi's number fever campaign. The Philippines is a really interesting country. It's made up of thousands of islands. And it's also a country that's very heavily influenced by America. American culture is everywhere you look in the Philippines. They're obsessed with Frank Sinatra music, for example. They love all things America and that extends to their love for soft drinks. Pepsi Cola, Coca Cola. In the 1990s it was everywhere. Pepsi and Coca Cola were embroiled in what is now known as the Cola Wars. It was a fierce battle for market dominance. Number fever was already a really popular promotion. It had been rolled out in America to great success. And so Pepsi decided to roll it out internationally, particularly in Asia. They thought it was the answer to their problems. They thought it could finally help them beat their biggest competitor. In the name of one, I want one! Look for the winning number in size size for a 7-day Alfaan TV million newspapers. You could be a millionaire. A million pesos or $68,000 doesn't sound like a lot now. But in 1992 that was a phenomenal amount of money. You've got to remember that in the Philippines at the time, the average monthly income was about $100. A million pesos was wealth beyond anyone's wildest imaginations. Number fever caught fire in the Philippines. Kids were saving up their pocket money to buy a bottle of Pepsi. Parents were squirreling away all of the bottle caps in bags. You would walk down the street and people were going through trash trying to find discarded bottle caps. It was a national phenomenon. Pepsi boasted that half the population of the Philippines was playing it. Number fever boosted Pepsi sales every month from $10 million to $14 million. It had a huge impact on Pepsi's bottom line. Number fever quickly became number hysteria. Mades were being jailed for stealing their employer's winning bottle caps. There was even some murders over winning bottle caps. People were fighting in the streets over these caps. There were signs that there were going to be problems with number fever very early. Pepsi had rolled out the competition in Chile and a garbled fax had caused some kind of problem with the winning number. They'd announced the wrong one in Chile. I'm not sure that now. I'm sorry I never had. But this was a bad party ever. This is definitely a first year Toronto cheat for black tragic scenes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,197,2022-10-06 14:05:29
11972," We'd out the competition in Chile and a garbled fax had caused some kind of problem with the winning number. They'd announced the wrong one in Chile causing riots. There were signs that there could be big problems ahead if they didn't keep their eye on the ball. So in 1992 Pepsi decided to extend the campaign in the Philippines and they announced that the competition would go on for a few more weeks. One night on the television news they announced the latest winning number, 3, 4, 9. The problem was 3, 4, 9 had already been allocated as a non-winning number in earlier campaigns. So there were literally hundreds of thousands of bottle caps with 3, 4, 9 just floating around the Philippines. Hundreds of thousands of people all across the Philippines, thousands of islands were finding winning bottle caps. 3, 4, 9, 3, 4, 9. Some people had 10 lucky 3, 4, 9 bottle caps. People were dancing in the street celebrating. They thought their problems were over. They were millionaires. It's still not certain exactly how many winners there were of lucky 3, 4, 9 bottle caps. But we know that Pepsi printed over 600,000 of them. Pepsi realized very early that there was a problem. Hundreds of people started arriving at their bottling plants with their lucky bottle caps. They realized something was seriously wrong. Pepsi tried to solve the problem by offering a small token donation to anyone that brought a lucky bottle cap to their bottling plant. But it wasn't enough. People didn't want just a handful of pesos. People wanted their million pesos prize. Within a year, violent protests and riots outside Pepsi factories would leave dozens injured and five people dead. At one Pepsi factory in the Philippines, a grenade was thrown through the window. It killed three Pepsi employees. Anacita Rosario was a schoolteacher living near Manila in the Philippines. She was one of the tragic victims of this whole thing. She was walking to a nearby store to buy some rice one day when a Molotov cocktail was thrown at a Pepsi truck in a violent protest. It bounced under the truck and exploded. It killed her and an innocent bystander who was just a child and injured many others. When I was in the Philippines, I tracked down Anacita's daughter Cindy and her husband, Raoul. It was clear to me that they were still very upset by the whole thing. A family had been ripped apart by this competition. Raoul told me that he'd never remarried. He'd told me that he'd gone to meet Pepsi executives after his wife was killed. And he was angry. He said to them, this wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you, if it wasn't for number fever. The biggest revelation from my reporting was rumors that Pepsi was somehow involved in bombing their own trucks. I found a newspaper report with a headline that said Pepsi goons bomb their own trucks. When I visited the MBI, the police department in the Philippines, they presented me with documents and interviews with people who claimed that Pepsi had paid them to cause riots and to cause trouble outside their plants. In order to destabilize the situation and to frame the owners of the coalitions that were fighting them to try and curry favor. I just thought that was so shocking and of course Pepsi denied it but help us out that a company would be accused of bombing their own trucks. The contest had sparked so much anger in the Philippines because it landed at just this really weird time in the Philippines history. It was during a crazy election that was rap.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,198,2022-10-06 14:09:25
11973," The Philippines history, it was during a crazy election that was racked with allegations of fraud. The Philippines was in a kind of love-hate relationship with America. They loved obviously the American aid and finances that was pouring into the country, but at the same time they yearned for independence. They wanted to be their own country. Vicente Del Fiero was a local preacher living in Manila, and he hated the number fever campaign. Del Fiero thought Pepsi's number fever campaign was just one of the many ways that America was asserting its dominance over a third world country. He hated seeing his fellow countrymen get ripped off in his eyes by this huge multinational American company. He wanted justice. Del Fiero rounded up over 800 winners of three, four, nine bottle caps, and he got them all together to sue Pepsi for over $400 million to be divided between those holders of lucky bottle caps. Del Fiero took money from some of the people who could afford it. They paid him 500 pesos to help with legal fees, but for people who couldn't afford the money he would just represent them pro bono. He flew to America and he hired two consumer lawyers here in America to take on Pepsi. He had a meeting at Pepsi's headquarters to try and resolve the problem, but he said he wanted to take it all the way to the highest courts in America. When those cases were heard in America, those courts decided that this was a problem that should be heard in the Philippines, not in America. Back in the Philippines, Del Fiero continued his case in the Filipino courts. At one stage, there were arrest warrantes handed out for nine Pepsi Cola executives, which he saw as a big victory. We don't know if those arrest warrant were ever upheld, but it made newspaper headlines across the country. Pepsi did not take kindly to Del Fiero's campaign. They tried everything to shut him down. They sued him for libel. My father had to attend three times a month for a branch one for a campaign, and another heating for the branch one thirteen years, also three times a month. Also, there was a time my father's was hospital to do heart failure. Still, he had to attend the two branch heating of otherwise, for not attending the judge will issue water to the personal father. My father passed away January 13, 2010, after staying for almost one year in the hospital, he died of complications with the heart failure. After the death of my father, I was inspired to do the website. Pepsi could be remembered for what they did to the kosherma in the Philippines and to make fun of it. When I reached out to Pepsi for comment for this story, they claimed that they didn't have access to anyone who was working at Pepsi that was around in those days. They also said that during COVID-19, they didn't have access to their documents about this, but you know, they were very careful to say that they were sorry for everything that happened, and we do know that Pepsi did try everything to try and make this right. The Pepsi number fever disaster cost the company millions. We know that they paid up to ten million dollars in those goodwill payments, but the financial effect could be much greater. After the disaster, we know that Pepsi sales dipped. They were overtaken by Coca-Cola again. Pepsi's number fever disaster changed the legacy of that soft drink in the Philippines forever. Some people of certain age won't touch it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,199,2022-10-06 14:13:46
11974," Number fever disaster changed the legacy of that soft drink in the Philippines forever. Some people of certain age won't touch it. For many people Pepsi is a taboo word. A lot of the people that I spoke to were still quite traumatized by their experience, by that experience of winning a million pesos, losing it and then returning to their normal life in poverty in Manila. When the news of the bombing came out, it was a massive story in Germany. We are following some breaking news coming to us out of Dortmund in Germany. It was covered by all the media outlets. Three roadside explosions triggered at the same time last night as the coach left its hotel in the south of Dortmund. Public figures commented on it. The media echoed far beyond Dortmund. I think it was front page news at every single paper around Europe. Everyone thought of a terrorist attack and people were scared that throughout the city and Dortmund there was more attacks to be happening. Unbeknownst to investigators just after the bomb went off and the players of the team were shell shocked. The person who had mastered the attack was actually sitting in the hotel, eating steak and sweet potatoes. My name is Thomas Rogers. I'm the journalist who wrote the article, The Get Rich Quick Scheme, that nearly killed a German soccer team. Dortmund is a mid-sized city. In the western part of Germany in a state called North Rhine Westphalia. It's a former industrial city that's kind of fallen on hard times in the last few decades. It was severely bombed in the war. So the center of the city is quite stark. Some of the few high points include its soccer team. My name is Aikening. I'm a reporter with Bloomberg News and I'm a great fan of Borussia Dortmund. Dortmund fans are super loyal. On all match days the entire city is in black and yellow. It's like a religion. I think more than most German cities, soccer does play a very large role in the identity of Dortmund. In October of 2000 the BBB became the first team in the Bundesliga to actually go public. Salaries for soccer players in the Bundesliga have gone up very dramatically. With such high prices they thought that by going public they would be able to compete better with big teams like Bayern Munich. Unfortunately that didn't go too well. Dortmund bought too many expensive players, high wages and the club almost went bust in 2005. The price of their shares it has sometimes gone up but mostly gone down since they made that decision. So on April 11th 2017 the team was staying in a hotel on the outskirts of Dortmund. Match days are always special in Dortmund. Everyone is looking forward to it. The team always meets in the same hotel ahead of matches. They stayed in this hotel in order to have a kind of neutral space before game so that they could concentrate, be isolated from distractions, things like that. Everyone was pretty optimistic that it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,200,2022-10-06 14:18:07
11975," It's like that. Everyone was pretty optimistic they had a chance to go really far, maybe into the finals. I was in the office and getting ready for match day. I was going to meet with a friend, a fellow Dortmund supporter in the pub. Es always, the fans are very excited about matches. On that day, we're heading to play in the quarter-final against AS Monaco at Signal Iduna Stadium, which is in the centre of Dortmund. Shortly before 7pm, the players of the team boarded their official team bus. When the bus took off the parking lot of the hotel and turned on the street, there were three detonations, three bombs that exploded and hit the bus off Dortmund. Three explosions occurred close to the Borussia Dortmund team bus. The B team bus had just left the hotel. The explosions destroyed two windows in the rear part of the bus. People screamed, people jumped to the ground. The fellow Dortmund fan, I was supposed to watch the match with. He called me and said, turn on the TV, there was an attack of the Dortmund bus and I thought he was like, there was impossible. Some of the players screamed at the driver to keep driving as fast as possible because they were worried that people might storm the bus. German investigators say the explosive devices used in the attack on the Borussia Dortmund bus contained metal pins and the one had pierced a seat headrest. Unbeknownst to the team members, the actual mastermind behind the attack was as they were disembarking the bus, was actually eating steak and sweet potatoes at the hotel. They had just left. Authorities are attempting to verify a letter left at the scene, claiming Jihadists were behind the attack. Because there had been a series of attacks by Islamic terrorists in Germany and Europe, there was widespread suspicion in the media that this was another Islamic terror attack. Three letters were found at the site of the bombing that took credit for the attack on behalf of Islamic State. There were however reasons to doubt this particular narrative. It would actually be a surprise if ISIS were actually part of this attack. Possibly could be employed by other groups like the Far Right wing to try and shift the blame. The letters had some strange qualities. They were written in a strange German that used big sophisticated words, but had basic grammar mistakes as if someone was native German speaker but pretending to be a foreign person. The general investigators have detained one man suspected of links to Islamist terrorism, one of two suspects whose apartments were raided this morning. Shortly after the bombing, a man in Austria named Rudolf, who was a big BBB fan, he noticed that something strange was going on on the stock market related to the team's shares. He emailed the lawyers of BBB who then forwarded that email on to investigators. The email stated that someone had bought 60,000 BBB put options, a wager that the value of the shares of the team would fall below a certain amount at a certain date. Why would someone buy that ahead of a match and then three bombs go off? Something isn't right here. For the person to make money off of that, it required the stock to go down quite a bit in a fairly short period of time. And it wouldn't just be the team losing a match, it would require something much bigger than that. There was another big red flag about this purchase, which is the fact that it had actually been made. Number one on the day of the bombing, but also from an IP address that had been traced to the actual hotel where the bombing had taken place. When three explosions targeted the bus carrying the Borussia Dortmund footballers on April 11th, written notes left at the scene claimed the attack was the work of ISIL. The truth, as is now alleged, is remarkable. On April 21st, the police arrested a man in a southern German city called Tubingen. It was on his way to work and his name was Sergei Bena Gold. He seemed like an unlike this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,201,2022-10-06 14:22:41
11976," He's a rest of the man in a southern German city called Tubaingen. It was on his way to work and his name was Sergei Bina-Gord. He seemed like an unlikely suspect because he had no known connections to the Islamic terror world. He didn't seem like a far-right extremist. He didn't seem like a left-wing extremist either. He seemed to be a completely unremarkable young man. A 28-year-old German Russian man named only a Sergei W stayed in the same hotel as the players on the night before the bombing. He specifically requested an upper room overlooking the bushes where the explosive devices were hidden. The media dissected why he would do that, what was his past. He had been inspired by the 2015 terror attack in Paris. And he noticed that in the aftermath of the attack, the stocks of French companies went down. And he believed that if an attack took place that was directed at a specific company, that the decrease in stock price for that company would be even more dramatic. It never occurred to anyone that someone would do that out of greed. We now know that the suspect bought three different derivatives on the Borussia Dortmund shares, with all these derivatives he bet on falling shares. The suspect bought the majority of these financial products on the 11th of April, the day of the attack. If the plot had been complete, successful, and the stock had reached a value of zero, the intergolds would have made up to 570,000 euros, or the equivalent of about $608,000. Ultimately, the plan completely backfired. The attacker, Sergei Benigold, didn't make any money, in fact, he lost money. In court, he would be extremely quiet. He usually kept his hands clasped together. One of the lawyers actually commented that he had never seen a defendant act so calmly. Benigold had served some time in the German military. From that information and from online research, he was able to figure out how to assemble remote, detonated bombs that would do what he hoped to do. There were a few days of extremely emotional testimony, including the soccer players who described, doubting whether or not they could ever play another game again. It brought everything back up, and it didn't quite help them to kind of process what was going on. Throughout it all, he sat there completely silent. The big mystery that was swirling around the trial was the question of why he may have simply done it because he wanted to impress a woman. Rebecca is a young woman who has a very troubled home life. She ultimately sees her relationship with Benigold as an opportunity to leave that troubled home. Benigold is a Russian immigrant to Germany. He speaks with an accent. He has anxiety in large groups of Germans. She begins to resent the fact that he has these fears and feels a little bit trapped. Rebecca attempts to dump him on multiple occasions, and he threatens to commit suicide if she leaves him. Benigold apparently told Rebecca that she would soon be seeing a surprise. After being dumped via text message, he apparently began planning for this attack in earnest. Benigold was charged with 28 counts of attempted murder, which carried a maximum sentence in Germany of life in prison. He claimed that he had nothing to do with the attack, but as time went on, he admitted that he had actually been the person who had built the explosives and had set them off. But he claimed that he didn't want to actually kill anybody. Ultimately, Benigold didn't receive the harshest possible sentence. He was given 14 years in prison, but it's still a considerable amount in jail in Germany.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,202,2022-10-06 14:26:57
11977," in jail in Germany. The threat of an asteroid hitting earth is very real. If it's big enough it's also very final. About a hundred tons of space rock falls on earth every day. Most of it is so small it burns up in our atmosphere or lands unnoticed away from major populations. No human in the past thousand years is known to have been killed by a meteorite and according to NASA no large object is likely to strike the earth any time in the next several hundred years. However, one thing is certain we haven't found them all. There are thousands out there and we don't know where they are. There are a lot of asteroids in our solar system. They number in billions. Scientists all over the world are working toward detecting and deflecting the most catastrophic natural disasters. Amy let's get this one out of the way. It's probably the question you get asked the most but how scared should we be? The most important thing we need to know about asteroids is when the next impact is going to happen and how bad it will be. What we know is that an object that's about a kilometer across is capable of causing very wide devastation across the planet. The object that wiped out the dinosaurs was somewhere in the neighborhood of 5 to 10 kilometers across so even bigger than that. At a kilometer it's still going to be very bad and will have global effects. For objects that are capable of causing what I would call sort of regional damage, kind of a large major metropolitan area, a city in its surrounding environments, sort of around a hundred-ish meters. It depends on the details of the proposition and so forth. By the 1980s NASA was cataloging near-earth objects. In 1994, Stargazers watched as comet Schumäke-Levy 9 hit Jupiter. The resulting zone of chaos was estimated to be as large as the Earth and the event became a turning point in the search for asteroids and comets in our solar system. In 1998, Congress tasked NASA with finding 90% of asteroids and comets, 1 kilometer wide or larger. Soon after, Hollywood blockbusters Armageddon and Deep Impact brought attention and fear to the masses. The great news is that the vast majority, more than 90% of all the really large one-kilometer near-earth objects have been found. The challenge now is working down to these smaller sizes that are still quite capable of causing a lot of damage, but they're just harder to spot because they're fainter, they're small. Can you give us a sense of how many are out there in our solar system? We know that there are a lot of asteroids in our solar system.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,203,2022-10-06 14:31:03
11978," Can you give us a sense of how many are out there in our solar system? We know that there are a lot of asteroids in our solar system. They, number in the billions, most of them, however, are between Mars and Jupiter in what we call the main asteroid belt. This is a region of space where most of the asteroids in the inner part of our solar system live and they stay there for many billions of years. There is another population, though, that kind of leaks inward and gets into the region somewhat close to the Earth. And we call these near-earth objects. We think that there are millions and millions of near-earth objects that are out there in the total population. As of today, we know of sort of around 20, 25,000 something like that. When we first spot an object, we really know very little about it. We just see something moving across the sky. So all you get is just sort of a handful of snapshots, just enough to be able to tell that this isn't an asteroid that we've already seen before. And then once we can calculate the distance to it, we can now start to make predictions about its true size. Is it large or is it small? So we have a lot of information that we have to get pretty quickly to really understand what's going on. Finding asteroids is just one piece of the puzzle. Planetary scientists are extremely skilled in determining the orbits and speeds of asteroids, based on relatively small amounts of data. NASA runs simulations of the trajectories asteroids could take, which is useful, but time consuming. A team of scientists in the Netherlands have found a way that could buy us more time. Our methods is very quick. So you can very quickly get an assessment of whether or not the objects is danger or not. If you look at the classical way of determining the danger of an asteroid, it may take days of computing time on very big machines to determine this hazardousness. The current problem is that there's just too many asteroids out there to spend a huge amount of computational power on all of them. So the neural network allows us to focus on what really could go and pose a hazard to Earth. A neural network is a computing system that mimics the way the human brain operates to find underlying relationships in a set of data. By training the network in this way, you train it in recognizing those objects that are most likely to hit the planet. And once it's trained, you can apply this network to all the unknown asteroids. And then you can make a selection and saying, hey, these are the ones which appear to be having orbits similar to the ones which we know are hitting on. It doesn't mean that they do, but it does. It only means that they look very similar to once we know they do. What else did you find? Should we be particularly concerned about anything? One thing that we did find is that our neural network was able to go and identify a handful of asteroids, which weren't considered potentially hazardous, that when we went into the greater than forward in time, they came quite close to Earth. You find a handful, which were not detected before or not considered being dangerous before, and we think they are potentially dangerous. It's very hard to simulate kind of going forward in time and asteroid that's going to hit Earth because what the Earth is really small. And what space is really big, and then you have to have very exact parameters to shoot an asteroid that goes and hits exactly Earth. And then Simon had the ingenious idea of not even trying to do that, and just launching the asteroids from Earth's surface and integrating backwards in time. It's very hard to make it hit. So you need a lot of calculations, which all end up in nothing. And the idea was then, like, well, let's not do that. This is basically what NASA is doing. NASA is taking an asteroid, making multiple copies of them, shooting them all forward in time, calculating their orbits, and then see what fraction sort of gets close to Earth. They'll be even hitting Earth, but getting close to Earth. And then they call it a potential impactor. So you calculate the solar system forward in time for, let's say, a thousand years. And then you launch asteroids from the surface, as if they, if you go forward in time, would fall on the surface, you calculate them backwards due today. And then you get your orbital parameters of today's asteroid, which you know will land on the planet. And those you can use as known impactors.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,204,2022-10-06 14:35:44
11979," And then you get your orbital parameters of today's asteroid, which you know will land on the planet. And those you can use as known impactors in computer work here with all the other asteroids in the solar system. Consimulations and AI can those things fill in the gaps where perhaps telescopes and other imaging tools can't. Absolutely. Since the observations get more complex, the physics gets more complex. And if the physics gets more complex, the mathematics becomes more complex. And at some point you can't solve your problems analytically anymore. And then this is where the computer comes in. Now we have this trained neural network. We have a way of calculating in a fraction of a second whether or not an asteroid is potentially dangerous or not. And therefore deserves more attention or more time to spend on for for really finding out if it is dangerous. When it comes to hunting asteroids, time is critical. What we can do about a potentially hazardous object depends a great deal on what we know about it. And how much time we have before the encounter. We really like to find them when they're decades away. Because the more time you have, the more options you have. And the less energy it takes to move an object aside. It also means we might not have to resort to launching a nuclear warhead as an asteroid. Until recently, pretty much our only choice. That's an option of last resort in my opinion, yes. We have lots of options available. You can just simply pop into the object and just nudge it out of the way. That's one possibility. And that's kind of in a way the sort of the simplest thing to think about just nudge it off its path a little bit with a massive object. A spacecraft, so it's kind of like bowling if you will. You know, if you have a long time or a long stretch of runway in the lane, just a very small twist on the bowling ball will make a big change in where it ultimately ends up. Another option would be something where you take a very big, big, massive spacecraft and you park it next to the object. And you use the force of gravity as a towing rig that takes longer though. And you need to be able to send a pretty massive spacecraft and obviously depends a lot on how big the asteroid is. Other options start to get more and more complicated. And they range from painting one side of the object of white color and painting the other side dark and letting a pressure of light sort of perturb its orbit. In a departure from the lab and computer simulations, NASA has real plans to rehearse kinetic impact deflection. In 2021, the agency will launch DART, the double asteroid redirection test mission, which will intercept a 160 meter asteroid in 2022. Better to practice now before we have to deal with an actual threat. In the meantime, discovering asteroids is our best bet. Thousands of scientists and amateur astronomers around the world make up an informal network that surveyed the heavens. But that may not be enough. NASA wants more resources to map our solar system and better technology. We need to ramp up our network of sensors and also we need to just continue to strengthen our network of international observers so that we can get follow up. Because we find these objects when they're distributed all over the late sky. Once we get more observations, we get better data, we can make better predictions. If you look at the big impactors we have had in the last, let's say, 20 years or maybe 30 years or 50 years, most of them we haven't seen coming. So the real danger I think comes from your objects we don't know about. And not from your objects we do know about. This particular natural disaster, like a lot of natural disasters and climate change is a problem of the global confidence. So the thing that we risk collectively is that it sort of then becomes nobody's problem and nobody takes our ship over it. Asteroids are all over the sky. They just truly cross boundaries and borders with the seconds notice. They're kind of imagining the future. Maybe he locks a small satellite around the earth that we're always going and looking outward. I mean, I think it's something worth investing in. It's our existence as stake.

11980,"cous k wool owning The pandemic has affected everyone in different ways. Some passed the time by baking. Some chose to binge watch Netflix. Or maybe you started a garden oasis in your backyard. But for millions of others, they wanted to uproot the financial industry. I'm just going to stop it and take $50,000. Here's your stock that can change your life. I see a stock going up and I buy it and I just watch it until it stops going up and then I sell it. I haven't gained over $3 million. I want some free money. I don't think you can overstate the online communities of social media influence on financial markets. A large group of inexperienced investors who discuss their plans on social media platform Reddit have shaken up the stock market in a big way. The stock that everybody's talking about right now is GameStop. Video game retailing GameStop has set to continue their headspinning ascent today. The revolutionaries on Reddit are spanking Wall Street's ass. The more these stocks go up, the more the big guys are getting creamed and losing billions of dollars. This is in a wealthy person's game anymore. Anyone can play it. I took up a little bit of a new hobby and I'm interested in day trading. As an investor nowadays, you don't have to look a specific way. You don't have to wear specific clothes. You don't have to be doing it from a trading floor on Wall Street in like a high-rise building in downtown Manhattan. The narrative of what's driving the markets is no longer being held in secret offices in New York and Boston of privileged people talking to other privileged people. It's right out in the open. It's on Twitter. It's on Reddit. From brokerage apps to discord channels and subreddits to TikTok influencers. One of the last holdouts in the world of disruption, finance is next in line. Investing should be as you pick with us as shopping online. That's Vlad Tenif, the CEO of Robinhood, the online brokerage app. Talking about how he wants his app to disrupt the world of stock trading like Amazon disrupted the world of home shopping. And I think that speaks to exactly the mission that a platform like Robinhood has, which is to democratize investing. Robinhood was started in 2013 by Vlad Tenif and by Jubat, in where else Silicon Valley, as an alternative to the big brokerages, but with one big difference. As they were building the social network around finances for people, they realized that there was a gap in the market and that free trading could become something that they could bring to the markets. They could disrupt the industry. While no fee trading is industry standard today, it was unheard of when it was first introduced. The online brokerage industry was really innovative when they came on the scene 10, 15 years ago. But they kind of stopped innovating where you haven't seen those commissions come down beyond five or six or seven dollars. Robinhood, think that by offering zero commission that they're going to push people onto this platform. And on top of no fee trading, the customer's Robinhood was courting, have been long overlooked in the world of finance. So the typical customer of a trowel.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,206,2022-10-06 14:44:19
11981," And on top of no fee trading, the customer's Robinhood was courting have been long overlooked in the world of finance. So the typical customer of a Charles Schwab, for example, is putting a lot more money in that brokerage account than the typical customer at Robinhood. Even today, with all of its popularity, the median account size is about $240. There's fiddellities in the Schwabs, in the e-trades of the world. They look down their nose and it does kind of account so. I don't want a $1,000 account to just the headache. I want a $100,000 account. And this is key here, right? Because the thing about Robinhood that's different than every other single brokerage platform is how easy it is to use. The design of the Robinhood app really has in mind a user who might be coming at this absolutely cold. The fonts are very well-sized, the shapes, the colors, all of that is something that the founders of Robinhood paid really close attention to. And by creating an interface that catered to a newer investor, they were able to gather a pretty healthy group of customers. And by 2019, they had about 10 million customers. Those 10 million customers were a huge success story for Robinhood. But no one could have predicted its explosion after the arrival of COVID-19. Remain indoors to the greatest extent and 100% of the non-essential workforce must stay home. What we saw when the pandemic hit was the growth of Robinhood users absolutely turbocharged. And oddly, you saw this surge in interest in stock trading. Then they saw the absolute surge in 2020 in customer growth. And now by many accounts they have more than 20 million customers, which is pretty extraordinary. So the next step for them is to figure out how to monetize those users and how even with their small account sizes to get them to grow with the company and as it releases more products, come along with them. Robinhood would become one of the COVID economies' breakout successes. Robinhood traders, as they're called, became the shorthand explanation for the frenzy of often speculative retail investing after the pandemic lockdowns. Kids wake up in the morning, they go on Robinhood. They're, you know, in the shower, they check Robinhood. Kids are learning how the stock market works at 18, while they're at school, you know, checking their phones in between classes because notifications pop up telling them what their stocks are doing that day. With these new tools, millennials and Gen Z are investing in the market in ways their parents could have never even dreamt of. That is sort of key when we talk about the divide between older and younger generations is that the younger generation is exposed to so much more information and tools at their disposal to do what they want in the market. The older generations, you never had the technology or the cost structure that you could play the markets like you can today. So you were stuck with giving your money to a professional investor and paying them a fee to do it. When I speak to young kids, they tell me, I'm making mistakes, I'm losing money. I'm not a perfect investor, but I'm 18 and by the time I'm 30, which will be, you know, 10 years from now, I'm going to have interacted with the markets for a decade. And so it's a learning experience more so than anything else. And you can look at it and you can say, wow, that's, you know, that's risk taking, that's dumb. But, you know, if you could possibly shave 10, 20 years off your working life versus adding five years.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,207,2022-10-06 14:48:40
11982," You know, that's risk taking that's dumb, but you know, if you could possibly shave 10, 20 years off your working life versus adding five years, I don't think you can fault people for that. But Robinhood is only part of the puzzle. Sure, you can trade on it, but without research, information, and data, you're just blindly throwing darts at different stocks and hoping to strike it rich. Wall Street forever has always run on what we now call narratives or means. You know, people telling rumors to each other, they've been around for a hundred years. On Wall Street, information is its own currency. Historically, either you had it or you didn't, and the people who had it had a huge advantage. In the past, those narratives and means didn't have, and network effect, it would be one person telling another person over the phone. In fact, when I broke into this business in the 80s, a lot of people used to complain that they weren't on the call list to get those ideas. Social media changed all of that. Fast forward to 2021. That's being done on the internet now, and that's being done on Discord and Twitter and Stock Twits and Reddit. And the impact is very similar, but orders and orders is meant to tune larger. As social media has played a bigger part in our lives, it's also played a bigger and kind of more important role in how people find investing ideas online and on these platforms. How do those ideas spread on TikTok? Yes, that TikTok. People aren't just going to it for C-Shanty videos. The personal finance hashtag on TikTok has garnered 3.5 billion views from its 1 billion monthly active users. By comparison, videos found under the cooking and health tips hashtag have 2.6 and 2.1 billion views respectively. The trajectory of Robinhood and TikTok were literally on par. What happened in the stock market this week? So the word of the week is expectations. Absolutely essential that you understand the risks of shorting. And Kayla Kilbride and Kyla Scanlon are two of those financial influencer TikTokers, also known as Finn Fluensers. I think people still care about fashion, they care about culture, but it's also like there's this big behemoth thing called the stock market that we really don't know a whole lot about and it's gay kept behind the industry. And so people like want to unpack that. And so my audience is a lot of them are younger investors who are looking to hone their skills. Tech in right off. Kyla and Kayla are two of the more, let's say, professional TikTok influencers. The Tesla Arc Bitcoin Biotech Risk Cluster. I've been trading since high school and it was a really interesting way for me to fill out my decision making frameworks and to think about thinking. And I think that the more that we can have people thinking about finance, the better that we're going to progress as a society. I think it's a huge gap in our educational system. If you're going to buy an option for stock, you can just go up. It's a call. So think about like this. I made the options video where I was like options are just like shopping. Rumor has it that this pal is a batch of open price. So if I come in tomorrow, can I still buy it at said price? And a ton of women just like attacked that video and we're like, you explain things so much better than my boyfriend or my professor or like I could say listen to you all day. And I was like, this is what I was looking for. But TikTok's algorithm does not reward common measured videos about responsible investing. It rewards this. Watch this video for 30 seconds and you'll be rich for the rest of your life. I try not to say the A word, the ALGO word because TikTok listens to us. The algorithm does impact how you feel. You know, you do notice which videos do better versus which video and see worse. How do you touch some attention in less than 60 seconds? And how do you make it something that they're like, I need this in my life? Nearly impossible to do that in 60 seconds. But the people who perfect it are the people that you're going to watch and get to seek around. And where people are sticking around, read it. And it's nearly countless subreddits about finance. And by far the biggest one of those is Wall Street Betts. There's a lot of social media platforms out there.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,208,2022-10-06 14:53:06
11983," But bread is about finance. And by far, the biggest one of those is Wall Street Bets. There's a lot of social media platforms out there, but Reddit is like the social media platform for finance. Places like Wall Street Bets is where it all goes down. Started in January 2012, it wasn't long before Wall Street Bets adopted a 4chan-like etiquette, leading to their tagline, like 4chan found a Bloomberg terminal. We had all these unexplained stockings, and we would be grasping for a wide stock XYZ jumped 20% in a day. And you would look at Wall Street Bets, and you would see people there talking about buying options in that stock. And it sort of squared the circle, so to speak, and started making sense. And it was at that point that it was like, wow, we have to start paying attention to this. Some people on the platform really spend tons of time. And others are just looking for entertainment and to have a little bit of fun, effectively gambling, or looking for an outlet, trying to make a little bit of money. Then on top of all of that, there were stimulus checks now clearly this money is going to people who need to use that to eat, to live. But there's a lot of people who use this money to invest in the stock market. And it's not just stock tips. People quote unquote, yo-lo, their entire life savings or stimulus checks on a single stock. They post what is called gain and loss porn. Screen grabbing staggering hits and misses on stocks for the entire community to see. I am about to lose everything. And while some of the people on Wall Street Fets are novice investors, the community contains multitudes. In one respect, what it did show us among these network groups is they are very sophisticated. They're not a bunch of ignorant people talking to other ignorant people. And this is where the pieces of the puzzle all come together to reach havoc on Wall Street for a solid week in early 2021. It's pretty clear that the combination of more people having retail brokerage accounts and trading apps and more people being stuck at home looking for some kind of entertainment and some kind of community online came together in this very singular way. What came together is game stop. Let's go back to the beginnings of what happened with game stop couple of years ago. On the boards like Reddit and Stock Twits, a lot of people were talking about game stop as being attractive value. Some of them are even, you know, Wall Street alums who left the industry and now still have access to tools that they can use to improve their financial wellbeing and make very good decisions. And I think Warren Kitty is a perfect example of that. Game stop is one of the most compelling asymmetric opportunities in the market today. Really, I don't understand how you can disagree with that. At the same time that this crowd was talking it up, the hedge fund institutional crowd didn't like the stock at all. And it had the largest short interest of any stock in the New York Stock Exchange going into late 2020. Short selling is a bet that a stock price will fall and it's a fairly simple concept. An investor borrows a stock and then sells it. The investor is betting on buying the stock back later for a lower price before returning it to the original owner pocketing the price difference. What a short seller would tell you is that they almost act as a policeman in financial markets or they're at least looking for companies that aren't what they say they are. And that can range anywhere from an outright fraud that some short sellers try to expose to just a company that's not worth as much as investors think it is. The problem is if the stock price rises, the short seller has to come up with the money to buy the stock back. And the more it rises, the more it costs. And that's what's called a short squeeze. And the hedge fund Melvin Capital was on the wrong end of that squeeze. Melvin Capital lost over 50% of its money in the month of January alone, just from being caught in the short squeeze of the stock. This is where the disruption comes in. One of the most wild stories you're ever going to see, GameStop shares absolutely going nuts. In less than a year, the company's stock has jumped from less than $3 a share to almost $350. Cheers everybody. Ha ha. I attended upon to the first coffee house that leader of the fourth position. Our first.

Investors all over social media use the free trading app Robinhood to wreak havoc on Wall Street. They're actually piling on into some of these stocks to really hurt the professional short sellers. And they all used Reddit, Twitter, TikTok and Discord to tell one another to keep buying and quote, hold the line and not sell GameStop. People are getting cheerleaded for jumping in, buying at the highs. They're saying, keep going. And it was working too. Until. Thursday morning, the trading app Robinhood sent out this tweet. In light of current market volatility, we are restricting transactions, including GameStop. People were really angry. Robinhood was supposed to allow the regular people to play the same game. These big boys are playing. But instead, we were all taken for schmucks and they screwed us. Shares of GameStop are jumping again now that retail investors are being allowed to buy shares of the stock. But what we learned is that when people organize online, they have the ability to disrupt the market. And it was a big sign that ivory rolls of institution aren't as powerful as maybe the institution's left them to be. I don't know if pumping out GameStop was the best use of billions of dollars, but I think that as a signal to society, it was pretty interesting and powerful. The GameStop saga was so impactful that both Vlad Tenev and Rorynkitty were called into testify before Congress to clarify each of their roles in the saga. One thing that's emerged from the congressional hearings is that they're interested in how retail brokerages make money and whether they're keeping the best interests of their customers in mind. But it's pretty fuzzy as far as what they would actually do as a result. While the frenzy around GameStop eventually subsided, it didn't take long for retail investors to find other areas to invest their money. Take a look at Bitcoin going bananas over the weekend. Bitcoin forms a brand new all-time high. It was after GameStop started to drop that we saw Bitcoin really go up to over 60,000. How much further does Israeli have to run? It's compelling to say that money shifted from one venue to the other. While correlation doesn't equal causation, there's a chart out there showing an inverse correlation on meme stocks going down and cryptocurrencies going up. There's definitely an aspect where people are making money on stocks and then moving, you know, they're agnostic, they're not hedge funds, they can invest wherever the hell they want. It's a classic sort of momentum trade. They're going to wherever the winners are and they're willing to jump on and, you know, ride it. So whether it's meme stocks like GameStop, meme coins like Dogecoin are entirely new ways to invest in art like NFTs, the new kind of retail investor is making its presence known. Over the next 10, maybe 15 years, you're going to continue to see whether by choice or by force, that baton go from older generations to younger generations. I don't think any single app is going to be the thing that disrupts. I think people are the disruptors. How people get ideas about what to invest in has become increasingly entwined with social media. And as social media companies govern more and more of our lives, the fact that now they're tied in more intimately to people's wallets is something that we might want to understand better. Usually what disruption I think means is technology comes in whether it's blogs, the newspapers or online, retailing to brick and mortar. They come in and they're in the same business, but they just do it in such a gigantic cost savings that it causes everybody to switch. Well, that's the risk that happens here is that it's so much cheaper to just manage your own money. We're not there yet, but costs and conveniences.

So I'd say, Wall Street, you haven't been disrupted yet, but you could be in the coming years and that the final chapter on this story hasn't been written. Meet Bloomberg's own David Nicholson. Now his happy place is out in the field, on the open road. But like the rest of the world lately, he's been working from home a lot more than he's used to. COVID-19 has prompted a massive urban exodus as professionals of every ilk yearn for more space to live and work. As a result, rural areas have exploded and they're poised to experience a resurgence as more and more families pack up and leave the big city to try out life in the verbs. But there's one problem with that. Not all internet speeds are created equal. Anyone who might need to upload or download large files for a living may not want to pack up and move to that cabin in the woods just yet. Now, David's house isn't a cabin, but it is in the woods and inexplicably, his internet is workable. My internet is okay. I pay a lot for it. It's around $140 a month. The download speed is great and the upload speed is terrible, which is really bad for my work, because I have to upload these massive files. But I'm definitely one of the more lucky ones in this community. Just a few miles down the road, my buddy has awful internet. Usually under two down and under point two up. So it's often unusable. Some days it's around one and other times it'll drop down to about point two, point three. I just want to be able to have internet at my house without having to go outside the normal ways of acquiring internet. It's really frustrating. We're literally miles, a few miles away from downtown. And it just cuts off. This is a problem and the solutions are not there yet. Because getting high speed internet in rural areas on mass is something our providers may simply not be ready for. If your internet service doesn't have fast download and upload speeds, then you don't have high speed harmony. You have Americans on average pay about $70 a month for internet at home. But in rural areas, it could cost a lot more for a lot less service. So the pricing for a fixed wireless provider here can be something between $80 and $150 for about 25 megabits per second. However, Gigabit service, which is a thousand megabits per second and symmetrical, is running at about 119 a month through 130 a month. That's John Paul. He co-owns spiral fiber, an internet service provider here in Nevada County, California. And for the past 10 years, he's been trying to bring an affordable fiber optic network to town. It all started when he applied to be part of the pilot program for Google's fiber service. Across the country, civic boosters have been going to extreme chanting, singing, and marching, trying to get the Virgin Giant to look at their town. The internet these days is crucial to be in the world, to be a part of the world, and to be connected to your community. Google ultimately went with Kansas City, Missouri, which left Paul on a mission to get funding to lay out fiber optic networks for Gigabit service. Over the next several years, he would attend conferences and pitch venture capitalists and apply for grants.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,211,2022-10-06 15:06:03
11986," at funding to lay out fiber-aptic networks for Gigabit service. Over the next several years, he would attend conferences and pitch venture capitalists and apply for grants to make his vision come to life. One of the biggest roadblocks to building infrastructure for the internet here in the United States are the existing large providers. They have their landstaked out. They would prefer that nobody come in and compete against them. In 2013, we applied for a grant. We went down and met with the commissioners at the California Public Utilities Commission. It was an arduous process to get funded. But we finally did against all odds. We got a $60 million grant and then we went out to seek venture capital. Then in March of 2020, the pandemic hit the world. Everybody got locked down and everybody came home and everybody started using the internet. And I remember seeing on one of the local fixed wireless providers websites, they've said, hey, we know you're all staying home, but please don't use too much video and please don't use too much bandwidth. And I thought that doesn't work. The US connectivity gap is far greater compared to countries that are considered its peers economically. Some developing nations actually have better internet than rural America, like in Kenya, which has a state-of-the-art fiber optic network fed in from their coastline. The American connectivity gap does largely affect rural areas that are either outside of service coverage or simply prohibitively expensive. This is Rebecca. She and her family moved to Nevada County just a couple miles down the road from David. They took for granted that high-speed internet would just exist in the area and it's not something they even bothered to check on before buying their house. Turns out all they got was dial up. We wanted to move where we had a little more space, room for the kids to run around, you know, just be out in the mountains a little bit more. Having come from a bigger city area where Wi-Fi is pretty readily available, we hadn't really considered that in our purchasing of the house, whether that would be an option or not. When school started and now that we are remote learning with our children and we're doing everything from home, we didn't have the option to do that at our house. So every day when school would start, we'd have to pack the kids up and we'd go to my in-law's home. They have a little cabin up in this area that does have Wi-Fi already. Rebecca's situation is the norm in rural America. According to data from the Federal Communications Commission, just 4% of urban Americans lack access to broadband internet. That's compared to almost 40% of people who live in rural areas. While that was the case, there were also racial and socioeconomic divides in terms of who had that access. In addition to that geographic difference, low-income African American students, Latino students, and first generation of college students were more likely than others to have only one device at home that shared among multiple siblings and or lack access to that actual connection. For most American towns, there's also a lack of competition, forcing internet prices up. And large providers like AT&T and Comcast aren't incentivized to expand service to these rural communities. This is how Xfinity makes life simple, easy, awesome. So in our area, we have a small imprint of Comcast, but they're not gonna go out for the more rural areas. It's just not cost-effective for them to do it as a large company. In order to lay fiber cable, you're actually physically digging trenches into the ground. And for internet service providers, they're primarily focused on maximizing their profits. And so the fewer customers you have, you know, in any square mile and the more fiber you have to lay, that's just kind of harder to pencil out from a purely economic standpoint. AT&T released a statement on the matter, expressing the need and desire for government assistance to fund fiber optic expansion to areas deemed unprofitable. Comcast released a similar statement encouraging more public-private collaboration on this effort. Federal agencies do offer grants to help communities build broadband networks, but many have argued that there's not enough flexibility on how to use these funds. The COVID-19 relief package passed by Congress in March and signed by President Donald Trump awarded $43.3 million to 51 projects on the East Coast alone. But it also stipulated that these projects needed to be up and running by December 30th. For contractors who plan projects months and years in advance, it's a scramble to reach $1.3 million.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,212,2022-10-06 15:10:45
11987," So stipulated that these projects needed to be up and running by December 30th. For contractors who plan projects months and years in advance, it's a scramble to rearrange their schedules to meet that deadline. So what we've been asking the federal government to consider is at least as long as the projects are getting started, knowing the projects are being put into place to expand both remote learning, working from home and opportunities like that that are truly driven from COVID. We're moving as fast as we can regardless, but hopefully they'll give us some more time. Talking to John Paul, it's clear that he believes broadband is something that can transform a community and should be considered a public good. One of the first communities to come on in the United States with full on gigabit service was Chattanooga, Tennessee. Now they're a bigger city, but they're a city that was economically in a downturn. In the last 15 years, the city of Chattanooga has turned around in an amazing way. It's a nexus for young people to move to. It's a place where technology happens. It's not just about logging on to Zoom, you know, to connect with your colleagues who might be in New York City. It's also your ability as a small business, you know, operating in the town of Nevada City or wherever it may be to, you know, quickly upload your payroll documents or something onto the cloud, or to quickly, you know, swipe a customer's credit card. There's just some really basic business functions and mechanics that I think people in big cities really take for granted, and that are just going to be a much bigger challenge for small business owners and rural areas. One, two, one, two, one, two, five, six, eight, seven, six, seven, seven, eight, seven, seven, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten. Historically, the marginalized people, you call them as untouchables or Dalits, they have been kept away from the center of the knowledge. Once you are born into a caste, it is very difficult for you to grow beyond that. You are stuck in that identity. Education is the best way of liberating them, so that's how I chose to work in education sector. The kind of education that we are giving to the marginalized people is going to change not just the fate of these communities in Telangana, but it is going to be the source of inspiration, a source of hope for all the marginalized in this country. The greatest flight in India is the system of caste. For generations of Indians, the social code known as the caste system has defined how people earn a living and whom they marry. Although outlawed seven decades ago, caste remain a significant factor in deciding everything, from family ties and cultural traditions to educational and economic opportunities. Dalits, people who are on the lowest rung of the caste system, constitute almost one fifth of India's population of 1.3 billion. Not able to afford the high tuition of private schools, many are forced to attend government funded institutions, which in the past have suffered from poor infrastructure, lower education standards and high student education standards.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,213,2022-10-06 15:15:23
11988," In a private schools, many are forced to attend government-funded institutions, which in the past have suffered from poor infrastructure, lower education standards, and high student-to-teacher ratios. But Dr. Praveen Kumar is trying to change that. I am currently working as head of the Lengana Social Welfare Residential Schools. So totally, about 400 schools I managed, these are all residential schools. For the students who are historically marginalized, but talented, then poor. Of them, 60% are girls, and then 40% are boys. Because girls are more marginalized among the marginalized. They voices are always suppressed. My approach to improve the conditions in the schools has been put your eyes and ears on the ground always. Talk to the parents, talk to the teachers, talk to the students, stay in the schools, and then understand their problems, they challenge both in classrooms, and then the corridors, and the dorms. Then go to the dining halls and see what kind of food they are eating, and then go to their homes, and then what kind of food they are getting. What kind of challenges the parents have. One of the important changes that I brought in after I took over was to complete the transformation of mother tongue to English medium, because English medium, as I said, English is the language of emancipation. And language that connects you to the whole body of knowledge in the world. So, we had to train a lot of teachers. Identity is extremely important. There is a scientific evidence to prove that, your sense of identity is extremely crucial to your growth as a successful human being in your life. If you accept an identity which is very humiliating, which remains you of very painful past, I think that identity will not help you to grow. Not that you should forget your past, I am not saying that, but that should not be in the bubble in which you must live always. Sweros is an alternative identity. S stands for state, W stands for welfare, Aero. S, W and then Aero is Swero. So, the idea is your dreams have to be skybound. So, that is what we are trying to achieve by changing the identities. Like you know, you say I am a Swero and I aim to be a doctor. I am a Swero, I aim to be a top notch engineer. I am a Swero, I aim to be a top bureaucrat of this country. I am a Swero, I want to be a very good actor or musician in this world. So, these are the positive images that are associated with identity. Just to give an example to you. See, in 2012, in our institution, we used to produce about six doctors per year. But because of our, you know, this self-deliberating ideology of Sweroism, we have this year, we have produced about 189 doctors. This is phenomenal for any purists of the poor people. You know, how difficult it is to get into a medical college in this country. So, but today, because of this ideology, the students have been able to achieve this. Pujita has been a form labourer and a parent, the angels of agricultural labourers. And then this girl used to sell vegetables, but thanks to the residential education institutions, she came to the Gowl-Etherdee campus and then she toiled very hard.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,214,2022-10-06 15:19:00
11989," girl used to sell vegetables, but thanks to the residential education institutions, she came to the Gowlido D campus and then she toiled very hard for one year despite many problems. And today I am so happy to share with you that she has joined one of the prestigious medical colleges in the state of Telangana, Usmani Medical College and then in future she hopes to be a gynecologist. So this is the journey our children are hoping for. Similarly the Mount Everest Expression. Mount Everest Expression, we are very fortunate enough to place the youngest ever female in the history of this world on the peak of Mount Everest. How did this happen? It's all because of an idea that helps you to liberate yourself. Similarly the games, we have so many coaching academy, boxing academy, we have a handball academy, so we have Kabadi that traditional Indian sport. We have Gowl, we have introduced Gowl football, Gowl football is generally played by so-called rich people, but today even poorest of the poor people are also being trained in Gowl football schools. Our intention has been to give all three or six degrees type of opportunities to the students so that we are interested in whatever activity they can go and then do it. Break the barriers, break the fence at least mentally because the poor people have been programmed to be victims, programmed to be subjugated, programmed to be on the margins, always programmed to feel inferior, we wanted to change all that. There are certain games which are exclusive to rich people, there are certain languages which are exclusive to middle class and upper middle class in this country to put it in one world, the soul aim of introducing all these co-curricular activities is to break the stereotypes which are directly involved on these people. Their stereotypes Dr. Kumar knows all too well. Borna Dalit, his grandparents were laborers and access to the village well was restricted. Dr. Kumar credits his parents' belief in the power of education with helping him realize his aspirations. He went on to join the Indian Police Service, attended Harvard University and then began pursuing educational reforms back home. I attribute whatever I am today to my mother primarily. They educated me in the village although there were no good schools. So then I stayed in social welfare hostel which are managed by government for the poorest of the poor kids. I passed with reasonably good grades. When I went to university and then I faced a worst form of discrimination in the universities like. In those days I am talking about the bathrooms and the toilets were exclusively meant for shoulder costs and so you will try. Used to fight discrimination on one hand and then again try to excel in academics day and day out. That's how I came to education because I deeply believe that education is the only important weapon that can really place the poorest of the poor people from a very victimhood orbit to prosperous orbit. I think in future this is going to be a game changer for the marginalized in this country.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,215,2022-10-06 15:23:29
11990," If you look at a thermal image of a city and then compare that to a map of vegetation, you'll find that where there's greenery, the temperature is lower. That's because things like asphalt, concrete and shingled roofs absorb more heat from the sun than trees. This is the urban heat island effect and it accounts for higher temperatures in cities often by several degrees compared with their surroundings. It's becoming a huge risk to human health as growing urban populations exacerbate the heating effects of climate change. Heat waves kill more people than any other extreme weather event, more than tornadoes, hurricanes and even floods. That's why urban heat island mitigation strategies are being studied in Singapore by a group of researchers. The government back project called Cooling Singapore is now in the process of combining everything they've learnt to create a digital tool that can help cities all over the world, starting with Singapore. In Singapore, close to the equator, temperatures regularly rise above 32 degrees Celsius or 90 degrees Fahrenheit and the city structures only make it worse. And that is also the case for Singapore which is basically a concrete jungle, more urbanized, more developed city. And even in Singapore what you have is a situation whereby there's a temperature difference of 7 degrees Celsius between the more urbanized and the more rural areas. The government has taken drastic steps to keep temperatures down. This is Gardens by the Bay, an award-winning park and inside this greenhouse is a pleasant 24 degrees. That's because the dome, along with two dozen nearby towers full of thousands of people, is chilled by what's probably the world's largest underground district cooling system. It uses a large central plant that cools water and then pipes it into banks, residential towers, an exhibition centre, shopping malls and the city's iconic Marina Bay sounds hotel and casino complex. So one of the biggest perks of using this system for the buildings is that they can save 40% in terms of electricity usage compared to your traditional air conditioners. And with Singapore relying on natural gas for most of its power, this new system means emission savings equivalent to removing 10,000 cars from the city's roads. That has big implications for the rest of the world. If things stay as they are, more than a third of the world's electricity could end up being used to call buildings and vehicles by 2050. As the world gets hotter, gets warmer, there is a greater need for air conditioning and as well as refrigerators for instance, and the more people are buying these household appliances, the more energy usage they use and they release heat more and that then exacerbates climate change. It's a vicious circle. And so since 2017, researchers at cooling Singapore have been identifying design solutions that reduce our need for so much cool air in the first place. One thing many cities have in common and that's the importance of vegetation. That's a very important measure to mitigate the urban heat because of the shading effect of course and the psychological effects of the vegetation and also because of the possible evapotive.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,216,2022-10-06 15:27:44
11991," Because of the shading effect of course and the psychological effects of the vegetation and also because of the possible evaporative cooling effect of the vegetation vegetation can be of course on the ground floor in form of trees and shrubs and you can walk under them This is the so-called canopy layer that the vegetation forms above us But vegetation can also go up the facades of buildings and it can go to the roof of the buildings Luckily Singapore has been striving for the garden city feel for quite some time It was a vision initially introduced by them Prime Minister Lee Kuan-Yu in 1967 to make life more pleasant for people and today Singapore is one of the world's greenest cities in terms of urban vegetation Camping Admiralty, a community centre that contains health facilities and social spaces now provides more green space than the plot of land it was originally built on It's topped by a roof scape of staggered terraces covered in local plants which functions as a community park And a village green in the centre that contains farm plots for residents to tend to Park Royal on Pickering was designed as a hotel in a garden that doubled the green growing potential of its site There's now 15,000 meters of sky gardens reflecting pools, waterfalls, plantar terraces and green walls And the government has big plans as well Singapore actually has a plan to plan one million trees and add more green spaces over the next 10 years It is actually a mix of one thing to reduce the urban hit island effect But on the other hand is also to get the people to be more connected to nature But it's not enough The city state has still been warming twice as quickly as the wild average over the past six decades That's why calling Singapore has developed a catalogue of other potential heat mitigation measures When you try to mitigate your mid-earned effect in a city or in any building in a village as well The first place to start is by shading of the windows You have to keep areas clear so that the wind can move through it Water of a certain depth can act as a very good thermal buffer If you have to construct heavy buildings such as high rises At least you can make the surface the facade less heavy and you can protect it from direct sun penetration You have to make sure that no combustion engines will be in the city in the middle and the medium to long-term range So ideally the electricity production is outside of the city and you bring just the clean electricity into the city You can at least minimize the use of energy in the city And you can start to slowly convert the roofs the facades of the city into production areas for renewable energy In Singapore unfortunately this is a limited option But in the long run it could produce up to 20 25% of the energy of the electricity needed in Singapore if all the roofs and the areas in the buildings on the buildings on the facades would be used to do that With so many different ideas Calling Singapore is also designing a virtual model of the city to test them out It's called a digital urban climate twin or duct The will calculate how each element of the city's design will impact the urban heat island effect That means the model not only the geometry of the buildings digitally But also the model the transportation The insulation the temperature the radiation coming from the sun The weather the local weather the local climate the even very very micro climate of the city The water the movement of people in the city We can invent scenarios we can design scenarios test them before we actually build them and if they test",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,217,2022-10-06 15:32:05
11992," In the city, we can invent scenarios. We can design scenarios, test them before we actually build them. And if they test very well, and we are sure that they will function, then we can start to build them and put them into reality. Singapore will be using this new tool to figure out which actions it should take next. And the model can be applied to any city, whether it needs to keep heat out or keep heat in, which will ultimately save energy, slow climate change, and improve our quality of life. So this is something that Singapore will be able to export, maybe even together with its city development systems that it already has. Singapore is one of the very few cities in the world that really combine this scientific approach with a very well established urban redesign and design approach. Through its agencies and the combination of its agencies, it has achieved a lot in the past. If it keeps following the scientific path and the combination with the other knowledge in the city already, we think that it will be a very comfortable and very livable city in the future even more than today. Time's a tough job. Jobs are scarce. It's risky to be outside and around others. Seems like there's very few ways to make extra money during a pandemic. So I guess I'll just hunker down and binge social media until this all blows over. Wait, don't these people make money? How do these people make money? Streamers, YouTubers, Twitch stars, how do they make money? Is it a lot? Is it a lot of work? I know. I got to ask somebody in the biz. And I got just the guy, Austin John plays. This is your full-time job now, right? As of November of last year, yes. This was always just a side thing. Any money that I made from doing my videos and whatever else, I never touched that because I didn't really think of that as being real money. And then it started coming in more and more. And then I hit my first day that I broke a grand. And I was like, this is actually going to be money. How did the YouTube channel come to be? When the game Pokemon Sun and Moon came out for the 3DS, there was things that I learned about the game. And then I wanted to just share that information with people. And at the time, I didn't have any way to capture, screen or anything. So I found generic footage. And I kind of put it all together with so much editing. And that video got six views. And then two days later, I made another one. And that one got 12 views. And then I just started pumping out more and more content. And people were like, this guy knows what he's talking about. It really just started building on top of itself. And then it was like, my channel really focuses on tips and tricks. So I play a straight 18 hours. And I'll finish the game or get to about the 40 hour mark. And then I'll make my first video. While I'm going through, I have a giant no pad and just scribbles everywhere.

Uh, what do you need to think about if you're building your YouTube channel? One, you need to do something that you're passionate about. Not that you like, not that you think you're gonna make money on something you're passionate about. This other thing is something that other people are passionate about. It holds a special place to them. And third is, it needs to be something that people are gonna seek out information on. In order to enter into the marketplace, you either need to be better than everyone else, you either need to be faster than everyone else, or you need to be more accessible than everyone else. And you can't be more accessible because it's already on the platform granted. If you understand how the algorithm works, which is very similar to Google Analytics, then yeah, you can have a little bit of a head start. But if you're not doing it faster, and if you're not doing it better than everyone else, then why should in one watch your channel? So my income as a YouTuber kind of breaks down to three different ways. One, which is the bulk of it, which is ad revenue. Whenever you go and you watch a video and then there's an ad and then you wait five seconds and hit the bottom right corner and then you go on to the next video or a non-skippable ad or the video starts immediately. You get the little banner at the bottom or if you scroll down from the video, the first thing that shows there is an ad. Those are the four different types of ads that can appear on every single YouTube video. And all of them pay a certain amount. It varies on lots of things like the country of the person who posted the country of the person who watches it the time of year where you are in the quarter. If there's anything going on with a reduction in ad revenue, like great example, COVID-19 companies weren't just spending as much on advertising. So because of that, CPM went down. CPM stands for a click per thousand and using the Roman numeral for a thousand. And that means that for every one thousand views, you get a certain amount of money. Now on low ads, when I first started off, my CPM was 30 cents. So every thousand views, I made 30 cents. But then once I signed with an MCN and I started making more quality content and more engaging content, some of my better videos and certain times of the year, I can see CPMs as high as 12 to 14 dollars. And there's a big fluctuation between, you know, if I post a video, when there's no ads being spent like January and February, that's a reason a lot of your favorite YouTubers and also TV shows don't post new videos in that time of year because ad rates are down. Why are they going to make content then? Instead, you're recording and you're bulking up for when ad revenue is higher. The second way that a YouTuber makes income is support, crowdfunding, things like that. When I first started off Patreon was really the only option, but then they started rolling out supporters and members for YouTube channels. So whenever I have a live stream, you can click a button and then you could become a member and then you get a special icons next to your name, I believe they're called badges or on any video, you can hit the join button and that helps support the channel. And then the third aspect of that would be merch. And for me, my merch has been somewhat basic. In fact, I'm wearing one of my t-shirts from last year right now. You have to endure the times that your first video gets six views that you posted on Reddit and they say shut up and then an auto mod bans you. You have to go through that because until you go through that and you discover why you're doing it, you're not doing it for other people, you're doing it for yourself. If you're not loving what you do, then it's not worth it. Huh. So make a channel about something that I'm passionate about. Oh, sweet. I guess I can make the channel about that. Now, how do I grow an audio?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,219,2022-10-06 15:40:56
11994," Now, how do I grow an audience? How do I get popular? It's all about diversification. You have to have a massive Twitter following. You have to have a massive Instagram following. You have to have a massive YouTube following. Of course, you have to be on Twitch, which is a key platform. Basically, anyway, you can get in front of your audience. You can engage with your audience. It is going to drive those clicks, which ultimately drives the advertiser revenue that you get back from all of these platforms. It's me and Dan playing video games and talking in a funny manner over them. They're not just people who are good at games. They're actually people who are good at online engagement, online entertainment first and foremost. You have to remain stylish. Anything you wear can and will be used to get you in the quarter fashion. The streamer is either very, very talented at the game. The best player in the game is generally going to draw a crowd because people like watching people who are very good. On the other hand, they're either very, very good or funny, charismatic, whatever it is on that side. Oh, no. It becomes more of a show where they talk about other things outside of the gaming world and gaming becomes really just a backdrop and an excuse to engage with other audience. There were those weird Ronald McDonald, like straight to VHS movies, remember those? Personable, I'm chatty. I would kind of, you know, when boring things were happening in the game, I would ram along about, you know, movies I'd watched or books I'd read or conversations I'd had and stuff like that. So I think being personable was a big part of that. It's not just getting on and playing games, it's getting on and being an entertainer. You are putting on a show. All right. Now, let me go ahead and grab the samurai sword that every gym has. Okay. He's dead. To have a larger audience and to have that audience, I think, stay with you. You have to bring something extra, you know, you have to find your niche. You have to find what works and what connects with the audience and what makes them laugh and what makes them keep coming back. You got to make it a little more exciting. All right. Throwing a hanging bishop, have everybody in suspense for a moment. I think the real most important thing is to just get used to being on camera. Like in any sort of performance thing, it's get used to talking on camera. You know, my first few videos were terrible. But because I sat down and did it for six to eight hours a day, I just got used to talking and I got over that uncomfortable hump. If you go into Twitch, purely with the expectation that you're going to make money, make a job out of it, have all this growth and it's going to be great. You're probably going to burn out prior to getting to that point because there's very little payoff for a long time, right? Like multiple years generally before you really start to see a payoff. And so, you know, those first few times you're streaming, nobody is there. Even person shows up every 30 minutes says hi, maybe, and leaves, right? Like, it's very discouraging, I think, for a lot of people. And so, you have to be there just loving it. You have to love talking to yourself when nobody is around. You have to love just the game that you're playing, all of that stuff because it takes a while. And I think a majority of people burn out prior to getting to the like profitable point of it. And there you have it. My very own YouTube, Twitch, Discord, and streaming channels all ready to go live. It's a veritable social media ecosystem just on the verge of thriving. So don't forget to smash like and subscribe and visit my Patreon for perks. Also, go to my merch page. And one last thing, stay cool, my friends.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,220,2022-10-06 15:45:10
11995," This is live stream shopping, one of the hottest trends in China. Every night, tens of millions of people watch live shows hosted by influencers like the air and by the products they recommend. On e-commerce and social apps like Taobao and Do-In, the sister app of TikTok. It's not about only shopping, it's about the experience, it's about having fun. You gotta see 3D, you gotta see in some kind of action, it's almost like a theatre act. The internet craze has taken over China. By the end of 2020, the country had almost 400 million live stream shopping users. China's live stream e-commerce market has also grown dramatically, with an estimated value of $161 billion in 2020. It's becoming popular outside China as well. So it's live streaming the future of shopping. Live streaming is not a new thing, and China is started in 2015 with the rollout of 4G, and it was first used for entertainment and socializing. Many live streamers perform for their followers or chat it to them, making money by receiving virtue currency and gifts. In the West, live streaming is mainly the doing of avid gamers. In China, it's broken into e-commerce. China actually has a very big e-commerce empire, so it uses these super apps, what we call that you have payment, you have search of information, you have recommendation system, and you have huge amount of goods available on the platform and as well as a lot of consumers. So with this advantage, they merge these features of live streaming to make the influencers actually sell goods. Here is a perfect choice, nice neutrals, beautiful prints, nothing overwhelming, and the warmth and comfort of flannel. Traditional TV shopping involves a one-way direction whereby a host introduces a product, demonstrates the things and say, call this number or something, but live stream shopping is live. Live stream shopping itself is a very big difference, it calls it's different psychology. And live stream shopping is a very entertaining way of engaging someone else. When you shop, actually this live streaming video will continue, it will minimize into a corner and you can buy the items and pay all on the same app. After that, the live streaming screen will just enlarge by itself and the promoter will come back to screen. So it's like very convenient. How about one of China's biggest e-commerce platforms owned by tech giant Alibaba added a live streaming function in early 2016? In the following years, other e-commerce and social platforms like JD and Do-In also integrated this feature. Over 70 billion dollars worth of goods was sold by a live stream on Tao Bao and a year's end 2020.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,221,2022-10-06 15:49:26
11996," Over 70 billion dollars worth of goods was sold via live stream on Taobao in the years from March 2021. Latest surveys show that over 60% of live stream users in China were watching shopping shows. And over 65% of them shopped at least once via live stream. In 2020, live stream shopping got a huge boost during the pandemic. The millions of people were in lockdown and many retailers who pushed online. People during the lockdown felt like there's a need for more social interactions. This live platform creates an interesting environment that these people deserve to be interacting with. And then live stream shopping brings in a lot more variety of things that people could buy and satisfy in the sense of like musical control especially during the pandemic. Most of the hard of this craze are the top influencers who have tens of millions of followers and subproducts worth millions of dollars every night. They often use their stop power to get bargains from retailers which in turn boost their own sales and influence. So if you think about China's live streaming you have to know the king and queen of the influencers. The queen of live streaming via. She is actually having the biggest viewership and the biggest sales volume for a long time on top of her platform. She can sell everything from like Gucci sunglasses, lipsticks, homes and cars. One time she offered her followers to go on a Tesla ride with her and she even for once. So they rock you launch in her live streaming room for 40 million yuan. The king be Li Jiaqi. We're widely known as lipstick brother. He used to be a cosmetic sales before he turned into live streaming commerce. And he knows a lot about the cosmetics. So he's the one that will actually put the lipsticks on himself when he's on the show. People who live streamers like VIA and Li Jiaqi have become celebrities in China and earn millions of dollars a year. Although not everyone can be as popular, mid-ranking live streamers like Tiffany, still earn a good income through sales commissions. If I say it from the beginning, the main character of the live stream is much higher than the main character. The main character of the live stream is very much higher than the main character. Every day, you need to work hard and work hard. And if you work hard, your brain is not working. Your mouth is not working. Your hands are not working. Your eyes are not working. Like we did before, we didn't do anything about the main character. And we still have some options to work on. Actually, there's no other people living. I think the main character of the live stream is not about the main character. Maybe you're thinking about the main character of the live stream. But every day, you can't forget about the content of the live stream. You can understand the content of the live stream. You can understand the content of the live stream. If you don't have a smart face, you can buy it. A lot of successful live streamers are generally very good at communication. They're very good at articulating very simply what the product does, what the product doesn't do. In order for them to sell, they need to be trustworthy and appear trustworthy. And they need to show in some ways that they're authentic. So for VIA and Li Chachi, they are able to articulate that quite a bit through their body language, through what they say. For example, Li Chachi will always say bad things about certain products. Because to him, there's his honest opinion and sometimes people want to hear that. And so they seem very credible, they seem very trustworthy. And don't forget, they're also very entertaining and very interesting. If you're familiar with Li Chachi, you want a Guinness record for the most live-stick applications to models in a 30 seconds. So if you're able to create a lot of bars, we're going to interesting things that you do. People who may not want to buy lipsticks, but also streaming just to watch what he does. And then from there, you might get hooked.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,222,2022-10-06 15:54:01
11997," on a biolip sticks but also streaming just to watch what he does. And then from there, you might get hope to just shouldn't eat bad news and show to the community as well. Life streamers also use cell techniques such as limited time or supply. These sense of scarcity can often encourage viewers to buy. The platform in itself creates and enhances some of these things, but you see it live. Something because social proof has taken over, meaning that, hey, other people are interested, other people are joining in, other people want the same product and they add in a chat and they ask questions and they say, oh, I want this too. What happens then? It makes the whole product even more scarce. But it's not just influencers, local farmers, luxury brands, even mutual funds have also started their own live stream shows. Working with very top tier live streamers can be risky. It's not necessary that the benefits will end up with a brand. So we see company executives opening their own shows. And we see like PNG have their own sales room which runs shows every day as well. We also have local governments in small towns to sell their agricultural products. So the live stream is definitely transformed the way product owners can think about how to reach their consumers and enables a lot of players to actually sell. And live stream shopping is going global. Merchants in Southeast Asia have embraced this trend. And in the West, Amazon has upgraded its live streaming function, adding interactive features like chat rooms, companies including Google and Facebook are also developing and investing in technologies to integrate video and e-commerce. If you look at the numbers alone, their numbers alone, the chassis is number two, you know that they can sell and you know that they can generate revenue. Are they able to sustain it over a long period of time? It depends on how you know very they are at changing some of the things that they do. But you can't expect consumers one day turn into virtual shopping for good. There will be the nature of us that crave to go into the store to touch the goods and actually wear it and see how it looks like and walk around that with our friends. And those things wouldn't be replaceable with live streaming. You can imagine that the oceans are actually the largest battery. We store a huge amount of energy in the oceans. The wave of motion can be very deep. It can extend down several hundred meters. It gets to the near shore from about 50 meters. The whole water column is moving backwards and forwards. As we search for ways to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, we come to a largely untapped potential source of renewable energy. In theory, waves off the coast of the United States alone could generate over 2 trillion kilowatt hours of electricity a year enough to power more than half of the country. Waves intensify and subside not as quickly as the wind and that means that it can produce a smoother power generation curve. One of the potential advantages of wave energy is that it could act as a complementary source of power.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,223,2022-10-06 15:58:09
11998," And that means that it can produce a smoother power generation curve. One of the potential advantages of wave energy is that it could act as a complementary sort of power compared to other renewables on the grid if it were to be scaled up to commercial scale. For decades, engineers have been trying to convert wave energy into electricity, but a host of technological and financial challenges have complicated their efforts. In the years from around 2006 to 2015, there were a space of bankruptcies in the sector, and this was largely because of a lack of kind of continuous proven projects out at sea with reliable electricity generation. Since then, companies have been trying to develop the technologies at a steadier pace and with a smaller cash burn. But the same questions remain. Can companies develop devices and technologies that actually work? Is wave energy just a novelty or something that can become a major renewable energy source? The sea is a very challenging environment within which to operate a power project, so sea water is corrosive and conditions are very rough, so this means that power projects don't have a very long lifetime and it increases operating and maintenance costs. Partly because of that, many early wave energy projects hit rough waters, such as the Pellarmus Wave Energy Converter in Portugal and the Isla Limpet Project in Scotland. But that hasn't stopped others from trying. Companies are focused on testing projects out at sea, proving their durability, trying to raise capital and bring down cost. The sector hasn't really converged around one single technology design and companies are kind of undersided about which design works best. Finland-based AW Energy is a veteran in the sector. The first proof of concept of the company's device was made in the 90s after diver Rano Coivissari observed the strong back and forth movement of a hatch cover in a shipwreck in the Baltic Sea. The waves are generated far from the coastline, so the wind blows on the surface of the water, causing the water particles to rotate and that rotation extends deep down below the surface and the waves can be very long, they can be several hundred meters long and as they come into the near shore this rotational energy turns into an elliptical energy and eventually back to pause that you probably have noticed if you've been swimming on the sea shore in large waves you're pulled in and out. That's the energy that we're extracting. There's a sweet spot where we deploy, so around 10 to 15 meters of water depth that's where there's still strong wave energy coming in. After years of research, prototyping and testing the company has deployed Wave Roller, a 350 kilowatt device in the waters of Portugal. Wave Roller has an 18 meter wide and 10 meter high steel panel fixed to the seabed via a flotable foundation. The panel moves back and forth with the waves capturing the energy. It's submerged in the depth of 15 meters, so it's protected from the extreme waves. We generate electricity by capturing the movement with hydraulic circuitry in a machine room underneath the surface. That hydraulic energy we turn to electricity with hydraulic accumulators and hydraulic motors and also our generator. The Wave Roller has survived large waves at sea for over a year and delivered electricity via an underwater cable to the grid in Portugal. Meanwhile, the company has won a 2.5 million euro grant to work on an upgraded version of the Wave Roller, aiming to increase the electricity generation capacity to 1 megawatt. The upscale device would have a bigger panel, 2 power takeoff units and improved software to control the energy production.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,224,2022-10-06 16:02:28
11999," generation capacity to one megawatt. The upscale device would have a bigger panel, two power takeoff units, and improved software to control the energy production. We have taken into use a very prediction algorithm that kind of tells us what kind of waves are coming into our device. That gives us a few seconds to prepare for capturing more energy and the difference in that is significant. Our future plans are to deliver technology around the world. So I'm hoping we can be working on delivering technology to projects in Asia and also in the American contents as well. Meanwhile, Israeli company EcoWavePower is taking a different approach to capturing the power of the ocean. For the company's founder, Inna Bravaman, developing new sources of renewable energy is a personal mission. I was born in Ukraine in 1986 and two weeks after I was born, the Chernobyl nuclear reactor exploded, causing the largest in history, nuclear disaster. I was one of the babies that got hurt from the negative effects of such explosion. I had a respiratory arrest and a clinical death. Luckily my mother and nurse approached my crib on time and gave me a mouth to offer a cessitation with saved my life. I got a second chance in life and decided to do something good with it. Growing up, Inna wanted to be a politician to positively change the world. After working as a translator at a renewable energy company, she decided to change parts. Solar and wind energy were fully commercialized. There were a lot of amazing technologies implemented everywhere. I saw that wave energy, although it's an immense source of electricity, the biggest companies in the world are trying to develop wave energy with no success. And there was kind of a race going on in the world of who is the company that is going to develop a viable wave energy solution first. In 2011, the then 24-year-old Inna co-founded EcoWave Power. Instead of installing devices offshore, the company's devices are attached to existing breakwaters, jettys and piers. Our technology is very cost-efficient, especially in comparison to the offshore technologies, because we don't need any ships, divers, underwater mooring or cables when installing existent man-made structures. And all our expensive equipment, the generator, the hydraulic conversion unit, the automation is located online just like a regular power station. This is the EcoWave Power conversion unit that has been operating in Jaffa port since 2014 until 2020. Here you can see how the technology works. Basically the floaters are going up and down and pushing the hydro cylinders which transmit by the gradeable fluid into land located accumulators. A pressure is being built, the higher the waves, the higher the pressure, which is used to turn the hydro motor, which is turning the generators. The whole system is controlled by a smart automation system, which you can see right here. And in case of a coming storm, the system automatically raises the floater above the water level and keeps them in the upward position until the storm passes. The company has been operating a 100-kilowatt grade-connected device in Gibraltar since 2016, which is enough to power 100 households. Currently, Innu and her team are working on another 100-kilowatt project at the Ported Jaffa in Tel Aviv. The project will be also the first time in the history of Israel that wave energy will officially connect to the electrical grid. And our goal going forward is to expand it to all suitable brake waters in the city of Tel Aviv and to supply significant part of the city's electricity needs. Today, engineers and entrepreneurs are still trying to crack wave energy. Globally, only a few hundred kilowatts of wave energy are deployed compared with gigawatts of offshore wind.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,225,2022-10-06 16:06:44
12000," are still trying to crack wave energy. Globally, only a few hundred kilowatts of wave energy are deployed compared with gigawatts of offshore wind. But the filters come a long way in recent years and with the right engineering solutions, this new power source could eventually become competitive with more mature renewables like solar and wind. I would have a lot more confidence in the success of wave energy companies today as opposed to like 20 years ago. But in the next few years or maybe the next couple of decades, it will be more likely to be used in remote locations like islands that are otherwise dependent on expensive diesel power or out at sea on gas-dead commissioning rigs or for powering underwater autonomous vehicles. So definitely, wave energy can compete with other renewable energy sources. But I personally believe that this is not a competition. In order to have a 100% renewable energy friendly world, we need all renewable energy sources to work together. So can you please tell me? I'm not going to... Please wait. You know, I've covered a lot of companies, I've covered a lot of Machiavellian companies where people play rough. I don't think I've ever seen anything on the scale that Nissan has. He's making you, but you know what I'm saying. I mean, it's a problem. One of the most dramatic elements was Ravinder Passe's home being raided by court officials in Yokohana. You scared me. You scared Machiavell. I love these 1960s. So Rob Passe's journey into the darkest recesses of the Japanese corporate world started when he was the general council, the highest corporate lawyer position in the company. In the past few minutes, Nissan has revealed that its chairman has been arrested after allegations of serious misconduct. He was tasked with investigating Carlos Gão. And he was told conduct an internal investigation and get to the heart of the matter. And then along the way, he started to notice serious conflicts of interest. He is one of the few people who knows an extreme amount of detail regarding the alleged crimes by Carlos Gão. And he's now ready.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,226,2022-10-06 16:11:05
12001," Few people who knows an extreme amount of detail regarding the alleged crimes by Pearl Scone. And he's now ready to tell his own story on the record about some of the events that happened. The film was made by the director of the film, The Director of the film, The Director of the film, The Director of the film, The My name is Ravinda Passey. I'm the former global general council of Nissa Motoco limited. And you could say yes, I had a front row seat in terms of what was going on. Carlis Scone saved Nissa years ago. He was depicted in Japanese comic books as this hero. And now maybe we'll see comic books where he's the villain. In corporate Japan, Nissa was quite an unusual company. It was led for two decades by a non-Japanese executive. Well, Carlis Scone was a hero in the Japanese business world. If you had a global business celebrity in Japan and worldwide, it was definitely Carlis Scone. In a country with few foreigners at the top, he stood out. But over the years, he saved Nissa from bankruptcy, allied with Rino and Mitsubishi and turned the alliance into one of the most competitive in the world. Yet as the years went on, I think his ambitions changed a little bit. He started thinking about legacy plays. And one of them was to really tighten the alliance between Rino and Japan. And unbeknownst to him, there was a contingent of senior Nissa executives that were really felt threatened by that move. They really thought that they would lose complete control of the car company. And even in the government, there was probably a little bit of anxiety about a national champion in the auto industry following under full-blown foreign control. Carlos Gone was an auto industry leader respected by many in Japan. Now he's in jail. The arrest of Carlos Gone came completely out of the blue. This was in November of 2018. He was coming to Japan on Nissa's corporate jet for a regular executive meeting. And he was met on the tarmac by Japanese authorities who whisked him away to jail and charged him with financial misconduct crimes. So what happened was that a power struggle ensued inside the company. And somewhere along the way, it was criminalized. By that I mean that there were allegations leveled at Carlos Gone about the way he reported his pay to Japanese authorities, the way he handled money inside the company, that in other contexts it might have been a board action, it might have been handled internally. A number of executives at Nissa decided to take this difference and take it over to the Tokyo Prosecutor's office. And that unleashed a chain of events that would shake the entire auto industry. So after Carlos Gone was arrested Nissa launched an internal investigation into the events that led up to his arrest. So Rob Pasi was tasked with investigating Carlos Gone and he was told get to the heart of the matter. Find out what Carlos Gone did wrong and bring it to our shareholders. Yeah, it's really complicated because you had various things coming out of the weeds. 2018 investigation has started and we become aware of matters in terms of conflicts, actions by certain individuals that cause some concern because things might not quite be what they seem. So in our story we really took a close look at Harinata and his role in Carlos Gone's downfall. Harinata is one of the most fascinating figures inside Nissa. He's also a lawyer. He's originally Malay...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,227,2022-10-06 16:15:31
12002," It was downfall. Harry Nada is one of the most fascinating figures inside Nissan. He's also a lawyer. He's originally Malaysian. How do Mr. Heidi? And he had a meteoric rise through the company and became very, very close to Carlos Skone and other top figures. He had a front row seat at all the major strategic deliberations at the company. And when he discovered that Carlos Skone as his final legacy play was going to tighten the relationship between Renault and Nissan, he made a decision to go against Carlos Skone. And he became one of the key figures that decided that Carlos Skone had to go. Harry Nada was somebody who actually recruited me into the company. So I have a long-standing relationship with him or did have a long-standing relationship with him. But for many, many years he was a mentor. I had doubts about the credibility of the process right at the start. Harry Nada had a plea deal with the Tokyo prosecutors. Now that suggests he was intrinsically involved in some of the wrongdoing or the allegations of wrongdoing. And it just didn't smell right, just doesn't sit right. So there was a basic conflict of interest. In other words, Harry Nada had to deliver results to Japanese prosecutors to avoid his own criminal liability. And he's accusing and leading the investigation of Carlos Skone. Some of the people who had been involved in the original alleged crimes were also looking into the affairs themselves. Revinder Pasi began pointing out some of these conflict of interest issues. And the reason for that is essentially his concern was for the company. If the company's own investigation into itself was compromised, that could lead to a very weak position in various lawsuits that it was dealing with across the world. I had discussions with Harry, discussions about with the statutory auditors about these conflicts, discussions with HR about some of these conflicts. Because at that point, we reported into him. At the time, everything was quite, as you can imagine, we've got to do this, we've got to do that, we've got to move fast. But when you step back and look at some of these things, you just think, my God, what was going on here? Because me, members of my team, were being placed in immediate danger. People, chairman's been arrested, a representative director's been arrested. They both happened to be foreigners. And then now what we need to do, we're being instructed to do is certain compliance professionals need to go into properties in Brazil, for example, and retrieve evidence. They've got to do it very carefully, because if they don't do it carefully, they're going to get convicted of criminal activities. And likewise, when a team of lawyers were commissioned to go to Lebanon, I mean, one of my immediate concerns was, why are lawyers from Nissan being sent to go to Lebanon to retrieve evidence? These are just lawyers, they're corporate lawyers from Nissan. You had revelations that a number of executives had benefited from share appreciation rights, and they shouldn't have. I mean, you know, substantive amounts of money been taken by these guys when they weren't entitled to take them. And you do think, yes, how is this going to look later on? It's going to look quite concerning. So that triggered for me the sort of a...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,228,2022-10-06 16:19:43
12003," It's going to look quite concerning. So that triggered for me the sort of assessment that, well, I'm going to have to do something because up until this point, I haven't put down on paper these conflicts and these issues. So Rob Posse makes a fateful move. He writes his letter to the board listing every suspicion he has and great detail backed up by evidence backed up by memos of why this internal investigation had serious problems. He sends a letter to the board and it's crickets. He doesn't hear much of anything. Nothing happened there often. Nothing at all. Just like it just gone into a black box. And he began to suspect that there was a desire even at the highest level within Nissan to kind of sweep these conflicts of interest under the rug. Unfortunately for me, I think, again with hindsight, people must have thought that this is the nail that's sticking out and we can't have this. Within three days of me submitting that to the board of directors, that letter to the independent board of directors, I was removed from the go-and-executive conduct matters. I was then told that I could not attend board meetings anymore. And up until that point, I had attended every single board meeting. I was then also told that after eight years of being in Japan, I'd be going back to the UK. It eventually transpired that I'd be the VP of projects and transformation, managing a team of three. So you can imagine what this feels like at this stage. Almost an arbitrary removal from Japan where I've lived for eight years, had three children there. My family has grown up and we've been saddled there. Having a few months earlier been promoted to vice president at a global level to being almost demoted. So Pasi was essentially being reassigned to get him as far away from the internal investigation as possible and also to a certain extent in retaliation to some of the issues that he brought up regarding the internal investigation and the harinata. What happened to Rob Pasi can be seen as a series of corporate humiliations. I mean, first of all, his immediate responsibilities were taken away from him. Eventually he'd lost the coveted general council title. But it didn't stop there. Toward the end of his stay in Japan, Rob and his wife were convinced that they were being followed. During that period, I'd noticed that once driving my car, I'd have other cars following me. First time I noticed this was around mid-March and I was driving. I can't remember where I was going but this grave van, small van, just literally started following me. And I noticed that there was somebody in the car taking pictures. And lo and behold, we were absolutely being followed by either by people on foot or other individuals. Two or three normally two burly men in a car, different cars at different times following us around. They were following the family as well. And given we'd seen, right seen the Nissan C-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,229,2022-10-06 16:23:59
12004," They were following the family as well. And given we'd seen, right seen, the Nissan Security Department, behave in a very, very egregious manner with others in terms of following and surveilling, I was very concerned as to what they were doing and who they were giving this information to. Because if they're giving this information to the authorities, you do think, why? What's going on there? I mean, this is just not normal behavior. And this all culminated in a rather dramatic event in the middle of 2020. Who are you people where Nissan had hired a legal team and had obtained an unusual court order? A legal court order from the District Court in Yokohama. To basically do a search end of his home and seizure of his corporate laptop and phone and other documents. If you don't let us in now, we have to break this key. So it's a pretty extreme way to treat someone who had spent 16 years at the company. These people have all come in. We don't really know who they are, apart from the fact that I've been shown a badge that says the Yokohama Court. And they're here to recover a laptop and a mobile phone. It was even more weird because I'd highlighted to the directors that certain Nissan executives were trying to recover this laptop and this phone, whilst I was still in Japan. And I was very concerned because it had evidence on there that related to misconduct matters and other forms of inappropriate conduct. It was just another form of intimidation, another form of harassment, forcing me almost to leave the company and the country. Because once they'd retained and obtained these items, we were still followed. Which again, I just couldn't understand what is the point of doing that. You know, this is not a car company. This is not the KGB. I think it's fair to say that Rob Posse didn't have full battlefield awareness of all the intrigue going on at Nissan. I mean, Harry Nata is interesting because he's both charismatic and charming and one of the most brutal corporate infighters one could ever run across. It's a confidential company email, right? You should not have this. If he had fallen into line, he would probably still have his job at Nissan be paid very well and continued his work. A career that he spent, you know, 16 years building at Nissan is irretrievably broken. It's been smashed to smithereens. He and his family paid a huge price certainly, but in terms of being able to sleep at night, I think, you know, he's come out ahead. I highlighted issues to the highest levels of the company so that they could be dealt with appropriately by those in charge. There was no response to those and there was retaliation against me. What's really profound, like absolutely profound, is that none of your colleagues, I mean people who you have known for years, forget it, you're on your own. And you've got to be ready for that. If you take it on anyway.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,230,2022-10-06 16:28:25
12005,"гляд This is the awful truth. There's always someone in the family that's pushing it. This lady does not deserve to be taken advantage of. Expressionally at your age with your own grandchild. My grandma is having to sue them. I'm testifying against them. Nobody's talking. They're one floor below right now. I get afraid to go on the elevator. It's sad that it had to devolve to this. It's like a soap opera to me. It's a very sad thing. It's a family feud. A family feud. Here's a family that on paper you would think has the wealth that so many people seek yet. At the end of the day it's seen to sort of rip everybody apart. My name's Tom Schoenberg. I'm a senior reporter here at Bloomberg News. Cover financial enforcement. I was approached by someone close to the Chottenstein family and asked whether or not I would be interested in writing about Beverly Chottenstein in this case that she had against JP Morgan. It was immediately clear that there was a great story here to be told. I started just assembling all sorts of documents that the family made available to me. They included a diary that Beverly had begun writing when she started having suspicions about what was actually going on with her money. Beverly obtained her wealth from the Chottenstein kind of retail empire that has at times included big lots, value city, American Eagle outfitters, DSW shoes. Beverly's husband died and at which point they sold off their portion of the company bringing them an enormous amount of wealth at around 1990. Estimates of her wealth were around $90 million. She for many years had that pool of money being managed by outside advisors. Her grandsons in the late 2000s had both graduated and were becoming financial advisors. She gave them a little bit to work with and over time her grandson Evan became the trustee of her entire state. Managing sort of family money is not a conflict. In fact, some ways in wealth management it's kind of how you get your start. It's kind of the seed that you need to sort of get going in the business. But Beverly started having suspicions that something was wrong probably in around 2016. Well, there were suspicious things but take...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,231,2022-10-06 16:33:05
12006," Having suspicions that something was wrong probably in around 2016. Well, there were suspicious things, but taken separately without everyone talking about their own experiences, it was hard to really put it together. She had written a check to her caretaker Dawn that bounced. So she went down to her local chase branch to sort of find out what was going on. She wasn't getting paper statements in the mail, so she asked them to print out a number of her statements having to do with her checking account and her credit card account. So we went to the bank and asked for the statements, and she got a whole year and going through all of them page by page by page. And it was there she saw all sorts of charges that she said she did not the riser didn't know about. I was becoming very, very suspicious. I was starting to look in the money part, and that's what bothered me more when I saw that money was going. And I was not a big spender. Around the same time Dawn, she starts noticing Beverly's son who lived in the condominium below her came up with Evan, with a shredder, and started grabbing papers in her office area, including some with JP Morgan Letterhead, and just started sitting at the kitchen table just shredding documents over and over. Yeah, they came in one morning, used to do it the back, through the back door, and they brought this shredder inside, and then they went in the drawers in the office and took out all the papers, and they started to do it. I was very suspicious because I know you don't go around and get in destroying papers. Beverly said that they had done this many times before. That's when she said to me, you know, Dawn, I'm going to write my feelings in this black book. And it's a diary, and she started writing each day. She would write a little at a time. Around the holidays of 2018, the package had arrived, a FedEx package, and in it were materials about a venture capital fund based out of the Cayman Islands. Dawn and some other family members take a look at this, and they see that Beverly is signed up for this fund to the tune of a $5 million over the course of several years. And that was really the beginning of it. That was sort of the tip of the iceberg when it became obvious that something was going on that my grandmother really wasn't aware of this fund. You know, Beverly started to panic. She was got really upset and called, you know, JP Morgan's headquarters in New York and asked for Jamie Diamond. She said she was told someone would call her back, but she says that that never happened. She wrote a letter to Evan and Avi, and in there she laid out a number of things that were concerning her on authorized trading, the checking account she had about a million dollars worth of jewelry in a safe deposit box, and that her son Bobby had the key to that box, and that jewelry had gone missing. All this was kind of packaged in this, you know, five-page handwritten, a Memantor Will and Trust. They're such an evolving narrative about why the jewelry was taken. The only truth we really know is that the jewelry is gone, but why it happened? There have been a lot of different stories. You just don't take your mother's wonderful things and hand it out. And they email that note to JP Morgan to seize all activity on her account. And they ended up setting off a firestorm after that. As soon as they got this email that there was a season to assist and that she wanted to send her money and change brokerage firms, they were actually vacationing one floor below downstairs. They're there right now. The next day Beverly's in her place, the granddaughter's still in her place visiting. Dawn is there and up comes Bobby kind of barging through the door, and he's screaming about what was sent to the JP Morgan. They're now investigating now, and he's furious, takes his mother and puts her into a chair, gets pen and paper.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,232,2022-10-06 16:37:12
12007," What was sent to the JP Morgan, they're now investigating now. And he's furious, takes his mother and sort of puts her into a chair, gets pen and paper, and she says physically forced her to write a retraction letter. They were pushing me around. It was a scary time. I was really afraid too. I had to take her to the doctor, and she did an x-ray because she was in so much pain. The locks had to be changed, the phone number had to be changed. I really thought we were going to have to hire guards to be outside just for protection. Oh, it was terrible. I really brought a case before the financial industry regulatory authorities, usually known as Finra. It took several months' hearings. She sees all sorts of transactions that's going on. Hundreds of them that she claims that she never knew about, never authorized. But yet we're logged to JP Morgan's files as having been direct requests from her. That included the sale of a large amount of Apple stock worth several million dollars as well as all her stock in big lots. Over the course of their time with JP Morgan, Evan and Abby were making all sorts of trading on her account that was generating millions of dollars in commissions for themselves in the bank, yet she was not sort of getting any of the type of gains that you would expect sort of an 80 million dollar account in a bullish market to be able to get. They issued a ruling entirely in her favor finding that her grandsons as well as JP Morgan, they were liable for violating their fiduciary duty, misrepresenting themselves, and they also found that the bank and her grandson, Evan, reliable for elder abuse. Evan and Abby, they were fired from JP Morgan. They issued an award of about 19 million dollars. I reached out for a comment in JP Morgan emphasized that Evan and Abby were no longer with the firm and that their actions do not represent the sort of values of the bank. I reached out to Evan and Abby, heard back from their lawyer saying that they disagree with the law and the facts that Finra kind of used to decide the case against them and start seeing if they can have it withdrawn. Her son Bobby wrote her a letter, said his sons weren't criminals, and he also admits to taking her jewelry, and he says he needed it to pay off some bad business debts he had. They never once came up to say I'm sorry. If there had been an apology and some acceptance and asking for forgiveness from my grandmother, I don't think we'd be in the position that we are now. Since the piece came out, we've received dozens of messages from people, many of whom are telling their own sort of personal tales of financial advisors gone bad, or family members who got control of in a state and abused those within. Seems that it's really resonated with a lot of people. I keep hearing a lot of feedback about Beverly and how a lot of people feel she did the right thing. You're never too old to stand up for yourself and try to write an injustice. She was adamant that she wanted to stand up for herself. At the end of the day, they did wrong. It's a painful life lesson. Beverly taught them that you don't mess with grandma.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,233,2022-10-06 16:41:27
12008," On April 20th oil markets did something they never had before and they crashed, went into negative territory and closed the day at minus 40 dollars. Meanwhile in a place called Thaden Bois in Essex, a group of nine traders led by a guy called Cuddles made $660 million over the course of a couple of hours. The price of oil has collapsed to a record low. We've never really seen anything like it. WTI this morning down more than 35%. People maybe wouldn't have been so surprised if the oil price had fallen to zero, but the oil price went to minus 38. It went far lower than anyone had expected. And so lots of people in the market were saying, well hang on, something else is going on here. A couple of months later I started to get wind through a network of sources that a tiny firm in the outskirts of London had made a huge amount of money that day and potentially had some parts to play and what happened. The information we got was that nine traders at Vega Capital London had made in the region of $660 million in one day. As a group I think they made as much money in one day as Apple makes from its international sales in one day. It's an insane sum of money. Did they pull off a fantastic trade? Did they predict the way the market was moving and get it absolutely right? Or was there something else going on and had they actually done something that breached market rules in a bid to push the market and that investigation is ongoing? So Paul Cummins is a trader who cut his teeth in the pits in the 80s and 90s when everyone had a nickname, his was Cuddles. If you can imagine that was a very sort of cut throat type of world where people are doing you know hundreds of thousands and millions of dollar trades by shouting at each other, giving hand signals and then scrolling on scraps of paper. The culture of the trading pits in London was very influenced by the working class guys who became traders there. They weren't like the city bankers that had gone before them. They weren't usually Oxford or Cambridge. You know they didn't wear saddle rose suits. They were ordinary working guys who happened to have a talent for trading and a lot of them came from Essex. I think it was 400 traders in the pits and Cuddles in his oil and gas pit was described to us as amongst the top three in amongst that was very successful and made very large amounts of money as a young man but you know inevitably mechanization and the arrival of electronic markets was the kind of death knell for the pits and in 2005 the IPE closed down. And when the pits shut down a lot of the traders who worked their lost their jobs or quit or went to work for financial institutions, Paul Cummins decided to start his own trading collective out in Essex. Some of them are ex-pick guys cut from the same cloth as him. Lots of them are actually sort of in their twenties and they're he's you know drinking buddies son or their he's own kids friends from football. You know they're young lads hungry and ambitious and he brings them into the fold and fairly shortly he's got you know maybe a dozen or so traders that they're independent let's be clear but they're all part of his collective. Yeah I'll let Liam deal with Essex. I am from Essex so I feel like I'm free to you know to get into this. Sweet as they say. If you were to ask someone in Britain how they would imagine a kind of Essex person they would see someone who's maybe slightly flamboyant with a sort of cockney accent, a sort of guy which he's starting accent. You know not afraid to splash the cash but it's probably pretty bright and it's done well for themselves. Don't even make sense does he? But you know these guys they drove around.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,234,2022-10-06 16:45:50
12009," You know, not afraid to splash the cash, but it's probably pretty bright and has done well for themselves. Don't even make sense, does he? But you know, these guys, they drove around very nice rolls, Royces and bentonies. They went to places like Marbaea on holiday. Faden Boyce is a very wealthy place. You have to have considerable income to be able to afford to live in that village. It's a really nice place to live and it's 20 minutes to Cheebride away from the city. Earlier in the summer we have this lead, which is that there's this tiny firm called Vega Capital London and they were the biggest winners from the biggest oil crash in history. You know, anyone that covers markets is going to be surprised about that. You know, you're thinking, you're BP's of the world, you're Glencores, but there's this tiny firm. And one of the big challenges that we had was actually finding out who worked with Vega Capital. It wasn't immediately obvious, and at first we had absolutely no idea. If you go to the Vega Capital website, it says it's under construction. If you do basic online searching, it's very difficult to find anyone who's publicly connected to the company. So inevitably we're incredibly curious at this point, like who the hell are these people? The more reporting we did, the more it became clear that this group were connected socially as well as professionally. They went to weddings together, they played golf together, they would go and holiday together. We found out that a number of them were members of the West Ham supporters club in London. A few of them started companies together, so you could see all the connections between them and start to see a distinct group emerging. And it really just was this kind of shock that, you know, this wasn't just like a hedge fund or a firm you'd never heard of. This was actually a group of buddies who all had the same experience on this day and had all made a huge amount of money. So if you're an oil trader, there's a number of different ways you can trade. And probably the most popular is WTI futures contracts. And it's basically a contract that says, I'm going to buy a thousand barrels of oil from you at this point in the future. Or I'm going to sell a thousand barrels of oil to you at this point in the future. It's actually just a financial contract to gamble on to predict where the oil was going to go up or down. On the 20th of April in Essex, there had been signals for a while that this was going to be an exceptional day in oil markets. And we know that some of them arose early and started their trading in the early hours of the morning while it was still dark outside. Essentially what they were doing is buying contracts that gave them an obligation to buy oil at whatever the price ended up at 230pm. So they're basically placing a bet that oil was going to fall throughout the day. But they're simultaneously selling lots of oil as well. And whether they make a profit and how much profit they make is the difference between what they buy the oil for and what they sell the oil for. Now of course we now know throughout April 20th the price dropped and dropped. So this is going very well for them. You know they are committed to selling oil at these prices and the prices are continuing to fall which means they're going to be able to offset it and buy oil at cheaper at the end of the day. Now once it gets to kind of 130pm that's when things start to get really interesting. Suddenly there's a kind of influx of buyers and sellers you know desperation increases in the market and trading volumes go up. Now at 2.08pm exactly something bizarre and unprecedented happened which is the oil passes into negative territory. And it fell to a record level of minus 38 dollars. We've never seen anything like a period in terms of the contraction of the global economy. That huge gulf between what they were buying the oil for and what they were selling it for and able them to make more money than they ever thought possible. So their profit was the difference between minus 37 and all of these positive numbers on every contract they sold. The price of crude briefly hit minus 37 dollars a barrel. For one group of traders operating from a small office it was a very very profitable day. It's important to remember this had never happened before in the history of oil trading. No one could have predicted it. I can't think of another example of where you enter a trade and you get paid on both sides. You get paid both to sell and to buy. You know it's unthinkable.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,235,2022-10-06 16:50:18
12010," Oh, it's unthinkable. One thing we know about the Cuddles trading arcade is that they were very comfortable taking large risks and you have to be clear, this was a large risk. Yeah, we spoke to oil traders, both people that know these guys and people that don't and they all say that this is incredibly risky. And that's actually what stops a lot of oil traders doing trading like this. They simply aren't willing to stomach the risk. But Cuddles and his friends were. So when the kind of final calculations came down, the group of the nine most profitable traders made $660 million or thereabouts between them. I mean, if you can imagine, I think three or four of them made in excess of 100 million each. One of the astonishing things about this trade is that two of the individuals who made more than $100 million in a single day were in their 20s. One of them was 22 years old. You know, a few years earlier, he'd been posting on his social media about doing teenage stuff with his mates in town and going to see girls and rap music. And here he is a few years later making $100 million in a single day's trading. When we and Liam discovered that, we just, we couldn't believe it, we couldn't believe what we were seeing. The first time we saw this trade was the first time we saw this trade was an old trading is a zero-sum game. Anytime you're making money, it's an old trade that someone else is losing it. Amongst the biggest losers were the investors in this Chinese fund, crude oil treasure fund. There were thousands of them and they lost everything. Lots of people have put their savings into oil funds. They lost money that day. Big banks and brokers who sort of stand in the middle of trading parties, they lost money that day. And another interesting thing is the oil producing countries like Q8 or Canada, they sell oil as an average of the WTI closing price over the preceding month. So the fact that one of those numbers in that average was minus 37, meant if you can imagine countries like Saudi Arabian Q8 potentially lost a couple of dollars on every single barrel of oil they sold that month. Vega Capital's traders may touch an extraordinary sum of money that it was inevitable they would be some scrutiny of what they did. But it wasn't just the sums of money they made in the vital half an hour before the settlement price was set. They were by far the biggest sellers of oil futures in the market, which is an incredible thing to think about. When you consider that the other participants in that oil market are going to be the world's biggest banks, oil majors, BP and Shell. And here you have a group of nine guys in Essex who are having this significant influence over a global market for oil. I mean, I think you have to assume that if these guys have made $7 million or $10 million, they probably would be celebrating in Essex right now. But the fact that they made closer to $700 million has meant that they are facing understandable scrutiny. We wrote individually to all the Vega traders who did exceptionally well that day. And we got a letter in response from a law firm representing the group. The law firm was at pains to point out number one that they haven't been accused of any wrongdoing. That they all traded independently and separately. And they'd basically all made up their own mind that this was what was going to happen in oil markets based on publicly available knowledge and decided to execute this trade. What I love about these stories is there's a real variance of opinion and some people will look at what happened and think that must be dodgy. They all traded at the end of the day. They all made a huge amount of money while all these people lost. That's shocking. But lots of people say these guys are acute disadvantage. They're in a market that's inhabited by, you know, huge technology driven, funds and firms and oil giants that have got all the advantages in the world. And when you get a bunch of Essex geezers who essentially beat the market and find a way to make a huge amount of money, they should get a pat on the back really because that's the dream. Since this happened, a lot of the guys have stopped trading the monthly settlements that they've done so well out in the past. Several of them have set up new companies. They've essentially gone very quiet. You know, any kind of social media presence they had has kind of closed down. Waiting this out.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,236,2022-10-06 16:54:41
12011," They've essentially gone very quiet. You know, any kind of social media presence they had is has kind of closed down. By all accounts there, you know, waiting this out. It's certainly too early to try and predict how the regulatory investigations are going to pan out. You know, we just don't know. There's a number of potential outcomes for these guys. You know, potential punishments, if there are any findings of manipulation against Vager or anyone affiliated with it might be, you could be fined, you could be banned from trading and, you know, in most extreme cases there have even been criminal prosecutions in the past of people who have been found to have been manipulating the settlement and misconduct related to trade settlement. There are other outcomes too. You know, one obvious one is going to be they're able to walk away from this life-changing trade with all the money that they made and celebrated as heroes in the trading community that, you know, they'll go down as legends. It's very important given the nature of the climate crisis right now for the general public to have an understanding of what progress is or is not actually happening. And I think many readers right now they'll see these hundreds and hundreds of companies making these big bold climate claims. And they would be forgiven to think that, you know, we're well on our way to meeting the emission reduction trajectory we need to be on. And the reality of the matter is we're just not on that trajectory. And a key reason for this sort of disconnect is the use of offsets that aren't doing what they claim to be doing. We have a massive potential for sort of willful blindness. We can convince ourselves of things regardless of what the facts are. And so that's what tends to happen in these cases. It's not that it's not that anybody is setting out to commit climate fraud. They sort of walk themselves into a situation and they convince themselves of one thing and that allows them to convince themselves of another thing. But at the end of the day they're doing something that makes no sense at all. My name is Ben Elgin. I wrote the story about how the billion dollar market for carbon offsets is setting back the offsets and trying to figure out what's going on is really finding good experts who have been steeped in this marketplace and are willing to candidly talk about it. One of the best people for this is a fellow named Mark Trexler and I've been talking to him for more than a decade. My name is Mark Trexler. I've worked in climate change for the last 30 years. I was actually hired by the World Resources Institute in Washington to work on the first carbon offset project in 1988. In terms of defining a carbon offset that one of the beauties so to speak of greenhouse gases sort of the silver lining of greenhouse gases, you can when you put up a molecule of CO2 into the atmosphere, it can be anywhere in the planet in seven days. And therefore, if there's an option to reduce emissions on the other side of the planet and you can do that very cheaply as compared to doing it in your factory, for example, then why not pay that person that factory on the other side of the planet to reduce their emissions than you are in a sense offsetting your emissions and the atmosphere doesn't really see your emissions anymore. So carbon offsets have been...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,237,2022-10-06 16:58:41
12012," in a sense offsetting your emissions. And the atmosphere doesn't really see your emissions anymore. So carbon offsets have been around for quite some time. And they were actually key with these international climate agreements, such as the Kyoto Protocol, which mandated the wealthiest countries reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The trade was signed on the 11th of December 1997. Decided. The business community in general saw carbon offsets as a huge opportunity to comply with whatever policies and measures might be coming down the pike on climate change much more cost effectively. We've seen a huge surge in companies making big proclamations about how they're going carbon neutral or zeroing out all of their carbon emissions. We're going to reduce our carbon footprint to net zero. Unilever is committing to net zero emissions. We can achieve a net zero emissions world. We began looking at these corporate claims of dramatically reduced emissions. And we noticed so many of these companies were using carbon offsets to achieve these aims. And as we began to look at the carbon offset projects themselves, what we found is that the environmental benefits claimed by these companies are not actually what they what they seem to be. And as we sort of saw and spotted a number of these very aggressive carbon offset projects which appeared to be generating inflated credits or bogus credits, we saw a number of them were associated with the nature conservancy. This surprised us. The nature conservancy is the world's biggest environmental group. They have about a billion dollars a year in revenues. And they've been around for seven decades. They've preserved about 125 million acres of land. And they've done so many good works over the years. And they've been very strong in terms of working with corporate partners. The nature conservancy has taken a different approach, a very pragmatic and pro-business approach. They will not go out and criticize a big polluter. But they're very happy to work with them. Some might say that well that's selling out. But others would say and those at the nature conservancy would say, these companies have deep pockets. They can help fund important preservation work. And we have absolutely no problem working with them on this stuff. So companies are very warm and they've partnered with the nature conservancy for many years. And yeah, it definitely lends a sheen of credibility to these projects. Here is 20 Neries. This is the Disney World this year. One, two, three, four. If you look at, for instance, Disney. It's a sprawling company with theme parks and cruise lines that burn up. Diesel Fuel. They have office buildings and television studios that consume electricity. So these companies are trying to make major, major reductions in their carbon footprints. But it's very difficult to change these fundamental ways their businesses operate. So Disney has been a big buyer of carbon offsets that are orchestrated by the nature conservancy. One of the projects that they buy from is called Pennsylvania Riges. And that's a plot of land. Most of the land is actually about a three-hour drive outside of Philadelphia. Interestingly, this land, 3,000 of these acres, was actually acquired by the nature conservancy in the late 1990s. This land was eminently threatened. There was a pending logging contract on this land. So they do what they have done so well for all of these years, which is they go out. They raise money from local philanthropists and they go buy this land to protect it from developers and loggers. And at the time, according to an archive version of the Nature Conservancy's website, when they were proudly announcing this deal, they said these threats have been abated because of this acquisition by the Nature Conservancy. So it's really interesting now, fast forward two decades to earlier this year, when they put...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,238,2022-10-06 17:03:10
12013," These threats have been abated because of this acquisition by the Nature Conservancy. So it's really interesting now fast forward two decades to earlier this year when they put forward this carbon project. And if you look through it, this land is a key part of that carbon project. And what they're now saying is this land is now once again, eminently threatened. 72% of the trees are going to be cut within five years. Now this is just astounding because this land is owned by the Nature Conservancy. They do not clear cut land that they've bought through philanthropic donations. So this scenario that they've put forward to get carbon revenues is not really plausible. And what that means is when you have Disney coming in and buying these credits, when it eventually lowers its carbon footprint because of these credits, well that won't be a credible or truthful claim by Disney. So this is an organization that truly understands the threat of the issue of climate change and is wanting to do its part to address this. However, in this situation, it just appears their drive, which they've had for decades, to increase the amount of revenues that it can use for land preservation work. Nature Conservancy and many others see that carbon credits as a pot of money that they can tap into to further their own benevolent aims. But unfortunately, what this has resulted in is claims of climate progress that just aren't really happening. So the Nature Conservancy defends vigorously these deals. And they and others will say, look, our projects are just following the rules that these registries set up. So some would also put some of the blame on the registries themselves because they're setting up the rules which allow these vapid projects to get up and sold. So we've reached out to all of the companies we mentioned in this story, including Disney. They didn't want to be interviewed for this story, but they all told us that, look, we have to rely on the experts out there. And those experts, they say, are these carbon registries that have been set up. Most of these nature conservancy deals are set up and sold on this exchange. It's called the American Carbon Registry. Now it's the oldest of these registries that allow voluntary carbon credits to be sold. They've been around since 1996. What these offset registries do is they set up rules in any carbon offset project has to follow those rules. But there's this tension that's always there. If the rules are too strict, then it's going to be very hard for carbon offset projects to get up and running. So there's this balance going on where the registries want rules that attract projects, but they don't want it to be so strict where it will disincentivize projects from getting listed. One of the challenges with designing carbon offset systems is that there are normally two people at the table. You have buyers and you have sellers. And to some extent, you have policy makers, but the buyers and the sellers are really the ones with the expertise, with the incentive to really participate hard, make a lot of things happen. And the challenge there is is that both of them sort of want the same thing, or they're both happy with the same thing. They're happy with low cost offsets and a lot of them, because that works for their business model. You end up, though, with nobody really representing the atmosphere, so to speak, nobody's really representing the climate system. And so the policies end up by useing the whole system, and you end up in sort of a race to the bottom, and that's what we've seen happen. When it comes specifically to the topic of carbon offsets, I am a fan of carbon offsets in the sense that they can help mitigate climate change. But if we're not going to do it correctly, in a way that actually does help mitigate climate change, then it's nothing but a distraction. And you know, after...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,239,2022-10-06 17:07:30
12014," But, you know, if we're not going to do it correctly, in a way that actually does help mitigate climate change, then it's nothing but a distraction. And, you know, after 30 years, you have to start wondering, is it really just a distraction? And that's really unfortunate, but that's where we are. Ultimately, what needs to be... what needs to happen is systemic change. You know, we're sort of nibbling around the edges with some of these different things. We need to change how we produce energy. We need to change how we transport ourselves. We need to change what and how we eat. You know, we need systemic change associated with transitioning to a low-carbon economy. A lot of what we're doing today is not promoting systemic change. It's sort of trying to stick your thumb in the dike to preserve the current system. And, at the end of the day, that can't really work. The Hyperloop. There's a good chance you've heard the name by now. This is the Hyperloop system. It can take people hundreds of miles in minutes. The Hyperloop, a series of tubes that would transport people in pods at ultra-high speeds over long distances. This is a remarkable new form of transportation that can whisk people from city to city in a flash. 29 minutes from New York to DC, 30 minutes from L.A. to San Francisco. For years, we've been seeing these futuristic utopian renderings of some cross between a spaceship and a monogale. But lately, the Hyperloop is becoming much more real. It was surreal to be sitting inside a Hyperloop and just even more incredible to actually be riding down a track. And something that was nothing more than a crazy idea six years before. Companies all around the world have been developing and testing the technology needed to propel passengers' speeds of over 1000 kilometers per hour. But for many, speed is only the first step to unlocking the full transformational effects of a new mode of transportation. Fast is what we just sort of take for granted in the Hyperloop world. It's the network effects that really deliver the benefit. And that opens up a completely different scale of economic opportunity. We've got planes, trains, on-rubiles and boats. We're getting around Earth. But what if there was a fifth mode? And I have a name for it, which is called the Hyperloop. The Hyperloop? Hyperloop, yeah. In 2013, while riding high on the growing success of Tesla and SpaceX, entrepreneur Elon Musk released a white paper outlining the basic framework of the technology he called Hyperloop. The basic idea goes a little something like this. A tube reduces the air pressure to a near vacuum-like environment. A Hyperloop pod is then suspended in the tube, usually by...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,240,2022-10-06 17:11:46
12015," The type of people that have gone through this environment are in spaces and there we are in just like normal clothes because of the system the safety of what we designed 3, 2, 1, watch. And then once we started going, you felt a bit of acceleration. We accelerated a little bit harder than we would in commercial. Be like a sports car. Yeah! We got about 108 miles an hour on that test and it's a short run, it's about 500 yards or so and came to a stop. The test lasting only about 20 seconds and covering only a quarter of a mile at just over 100 miles per hour. Is a long way away from a true functioning hyperloop? But as for optics, it's a crucial step for the future of funding. The number one question we got from investors or from project proponents or just people in general was like, is a hyperloop safe? And what better way to show something is safe than by actually getting people on it? But convincing investors and governments that would likely be fronting some of the construction costs for an unproven technology is no easy task. First and foremost is the question of safety. Most people don't know how an airplane works but yet they get on an airplane. They get on an airplane because it's faster than driving and most importantly they've probably gotten off of one before. They've seen someone get off of one before. And so what we set out to do was actually show that hyperloop could be safe with two normal people, not astronauts, not adrenaline junkies or test pilots or anything like that. Two normal people getting on a hyperloop and then most importantly those two people getting off. But beyond safety concerns, constructing hyperlubes will undoubtedly require a significant capital investment to the estimated tune of around 60 million US dollars per kilometer of track. So a track from San Francisco to Los Angeles for example is likely to come with a price tag over $10 billion. And before large governments are willing to come in and front those costs, investors who are funding hyperloop development must accept it as a long term mixture of technology and infrastructure investing. Investors that are used to short returns because you're developing apps or something to that effect, you know, those aren't the investors that really get excited about hyperloop. What you start to see is the people that are looking at platform technologies, right? So this idea that because this smartphone existed, Uber could exist, right? So who are like the Vanderbilts of this century? And that's the part where you're going to get a lot more knows than yeses. But those people that have the ability that the fortitude to stick it out to see the game changing platform here, those are the people that we're looking for. And since we've done that passenger test, there has been a lot of interest that's really, oh, this is a lot sooner than I thought. In visioning the ripple effects of what hyperloop could achieve, those fairly challenging at this stage of development. It's fast, yes, but for point to point travel traditional maglev trains can move pretty fast as well. And outside of China, South Korea and Japan, even those haven't seen much adoption elsewhere due to the high costs and questionable profitability. The Shanghai line in China, for example, loses around $100 million every year. Hyperloop companies, however, believe they can offer something different than traditional railway lines. My name's Alan James and as far as I know, I'm the only guy on the planet who's written the government level business case for 300 kmh conventional high speed rail, 500 kmh maglev and 1000 kmh hyperloop. It's fundamentally about moving people from where they are, to where they want to go, when they want to make those journeys and doing it in much smaller numbers. So pod designs for hyperloop range from 12.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,241,2022-10-06 17:18:34
12016," want to go when they want to make those journeys and doing it in much smaller numbers. So pod designs for high-pollute range from 12 to 28 seats typically. Why are they small? It's because small enables the network to operate flexibly. And a great example of that is the East West strategic route across the north of England, from Liverpool to Manchester to Leeds. So to get from Liverpool via Manchester to Leeds by train is just short of two hours today. It'll probably take you two hours driving as well in average traffic conditions. That result is those three city regions remain three separate entities. Liverpool Manchester Leeds, there's very little commuting traffic between those urban areas. Hyperloop absolutely changes that from the ground up. Liverpool to Manchester is a five or six minute journey. Manchester to Leeds is also a five or six minute journey. What effectively does is create a single super city economy. In this vision, the Hyperloop acts a little more like a highway, where pods have fixed destinations and don't need to stop along the way. Meaning you can travel on a Hyperloop network from say Liverpool to Leeds, while the pod behind you travels from Liverpool to Manchester. And if that metro Hyperloop network is connected to other networks from the same location, you could travel from Liverpool to Paris or Liverpool to Amsterdam, all without making a single stop. For passengers, for business, for leisure, that is utterly transformational. For high-value freight and logistics, it's equally transformation. But critically, if you do a Hyperloop network at scale, you begin to deliver massively significant carbon savings to it. A multi-regional Hyperloop network could become a replacement for both short haul passenger and cargo flights and traditional ground transportation, both of which are significant carbon producers. One Hyperloop-connected distribution hub, perhaps at an airport that is predominantly used for international air freight, replacing maybe 10, 12, 15 distributed road hubs. It takes a lot of polluting and inefficient truck haulage off the roads. That itself means roads gain extra capacity. Hyperlupes will still need to use electricity to both move pods and maintain the near-vacuum environment and the tube. Proponents of the technology believe that this can be done by using renewable sources, including a combination of solar panels and battery technology that could be used along the Hyperloop itself. But even with all multipliers of time and carbon emission savings that a Hyperloop network may provide, the investment capital required to actually build such a network becomes even more economically and politically daunting. Committing doesn't mean spending billions on day one. Committing means how do we phase it? One company in the Netherlands is working to develop that technology, and perhaps more importantly, the international coalition needed to make the Hyperloop network a reality. So we are here in Europe's first full-scale Hyperloop test facility, where we can already prove every conceptual technology of the Hyperloop. This is Tim Houter, a co-founder and CEO of Heart Hyperloop, headquartered in the city of Delft. And while this testing tube might not seem as large as others, inside is a key technology to create the on and off-ramp type infrastructure of a Hyperloop network. That is a lane switch. That's something we can already test here. You can actually see it here. Then the track is diverging from one track into two. That makes it possible to eventually split up the Hyperloop track into two sections. And in that sense, you can create a complete Hyperloop network that in the end will make it possible to travel, for example, over a whole continent. I take Europe, for example, with the same ease as you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,242,2022-10-06 17:22:52
12017," And in that sense you can create a complete high-blue network, but in the end we'll make it possible to travel for example over a whole continent. I think Europe for example, with the same ease as you can out travel with a metro in the city. The nice thing about this magnetic navigation system that we have developed is that there's absolutely zero moving components in the track. So for example, if you have to do a lane switch, all you do is that the tube basically splits up and statically the tracks also split up. And whenever the vehicle enters a switch, it either pulls itself to the right with its magnets or pulls itself to the left with its magnets. Lane switching on traditional rail requires the physical movement of the rail. Even modern magnetic levitation tracks use lane switching techniques in order to transfer trains from one track to another. And this is a very crucial element because this is the thing that limits the capacity and in the end the usefulness of the real network. Because the moment that a track is switching, that means that at that moment you are creating an unsafe environment for the trains behind it. So you need a lot of space between trains. In a high-blue because you have no moving components in the track, all the vehicles can be much closer to each other. You can achieve a very high frequency and basically have vehicles moving and merging in and out of the network very much like a highway. For now though, Hart's physical testing has been limited by the size of their tube. Because the test track is only 30 meters long, they haven't tested this lane switch at speeds greater than 20 kilometers per hour. However, the company is working to build a new test site where it plans to increase that testing speed to 300 kilometers per hour. We're now in a phase where we have proven most of the most important technologies in the test facilities that we already have. And we have also demonstrated the viability and the feasibility of a network. If you look at all the top systems that it consists of, most of those are proven systems. We're already demonstrated in lab conditions. So we don't really believe that the technology itself is going to be the biggest challenge. Because for all Hyperloop companies out there, actually building a Hyperloop system requires more than just a good product. We're talking about the safety aspects. We're talking about integration into the environment. We're talking about the social aspects to people feel comfortable traveling in such a system. So it's about all these different aspects. And the complexity is really getting all the different stakeholders that are relevant and that they need to contribute to bring this to market. To get them all following the same roadmap. In order to help build this coalition of private and public interest in Hyperloop development, heart in 2018 partnered with other Hyperloop companies from Europe and Canada. The goal was to define, establish and standardize the framework to regulate Hyperloop systems. Right now we are working with all the Hyperloop developers together in setting up the first structure for starting the standards drafting. One of the most important goals for heart is interoperability, which is essentially making sure the different systems can communicate with each other. Interoperability is so important because what we want to achieve is actually have this seamless travel experience. So you don't want to end up, for example, going from Madrid to Paris and then switching because you need to use a different technology to get, for example, to answer them. The idea being that as companies around Europe create the first commercial Hyperloop tracks between individual cities, one day those can all be connected to a larger network. Everyone that believes that Hyperloop is a future.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,243,2022-10-06 17:27:08
12018," Europe create the first commercial hyperloop tracks between individual cities, one day those can all be connected to a larger network. Everyone that believes that hyperloop is a future transport system also realizes that there is a need to have this network because that's where hyperloop thrives. Hyperloop is such a huge project. It's definitely not something that you can do in your own or as a single company. So you need to do it with a lot of other companies. You need to have the governments. I think in that sense the biggest challenge that we've encountered is to really get all the required parties together to take the steps in development and in commercial implementation. HART's next plan is to build the European Hyperloop Center, an open testing facility which will include a 2.6 kilometer test track. And the company hopes to test travel speeds there at up to 700 kilometers per hour. Virgin Hyperloop is also racing to construct the first commercial hyperloop route, with projects in various states of development in India, Saudi Arabia and the United States. Recently the company announced plans to build a hyperloop certification center in West Virginia, which will include a 6 mile long test track. Proving the technology here will be crucial if hyperloop networks can find a home among infrastructure investments that the Biden administration hopes to make. The idea that there's multiple hyperloop companies, I think is a redeeming aspect in the business. People really want to see something happen, so having multiple people move forward is good for that. I was struck when Josh and Sarah rode the pod. Two or three of the major outlets used the phrase, we now have a new mode of transport. And although all of that technology had existed before those two human beings rode it, it was the moment at which those two human beings traveled that short distance down the tube that in popular imagination Hyperloop became a mode of transport. The metaphor I use with my team is that the Wright brothers refers, but none of us fly on Wright brothers' airlines anymore. If you don't continue to innovate, you're not going to be around, and so we'll continue to be at the forefront of building Hyperloop. Back in 2013, Elon had an idea. I think the difference now in 2021 is some brilliant engineers of spent real time grinding out the details. And I thoroughly expect the next three to five years to be decisive.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,244,2022-10-06 17:31:28
12019," All right, all right. This week, how hydrogen can transform our energy usage. We'll look at why the universe's most abundant element could be a game-changer in the climate revolution. Hydrogen technologies are not new. They are used in other sectors. We use them in space on our rockets. And we don't need the laws of physics to change to be able to use hydrogen on our planes. From iron ore to green hydrogen, one of Australia's richest men tells us about his pivot to sustainable energy. Let's take action. It's practical. It's implementable. Let's do it now. Plus, the hydrogen revolution. We'll speak with the CEO of Italian Utilities firm Snam about his new book and how green hydrogen could be competitive within five years. Cossars are coming down and people are waking up to the fact that it's the only way to decarbonize certain sectors. From Bloomberg's Global Headquarters in New York, I'm Kayleigh Lines and this is Bloomberg Green. It's a new year, so here at Bloomberg Green we're highlighting new solutions in the fight against climate change. And one of those is as old as the universe itself. Hydrogen. It's the simplest element around but could well be a game changer when it comes to turning around our dependence on fossil fuels. Today, hydrogen is used in the chemicals industry to produce petroleum products. It's also starting to be used in steel production and industry under a lot of pressure to decarbonize. But it has far more uses as well, from power and cars to heating our homes. And Bloomberg New Energy Finance sees a seismic shift in the sector in the next ten years as green hydrogen squeezes out dirtier alternatives. No-called grey hydrogen dominates today. But as renewable electricity gets cheaper and more accessible, so we'll green hydrogen. In this week's edition of Bloomberg Green, we'll explore what this push into hydrogen means for tackling climate change. We'll hear from Australian billionaire Twiggy Forest about his pivot from Iron War to Hydrogen and we'll also speak with the CEO of Italian utility companies Svam about his book, The Hydrogen Revolution. But first, what are we using Hydrogen for? And why does it actually matter? Christine Lee Edwards explains. Hydrogen, the most plentiful element in the universe. On Earth, we find it mostly bonded to oxygen in the form of water. Or in other gases known as hydrocarbons. Hydrogen gas, H2, burns hot and clean, making it an attractive tool in the race to net zero. But isolating hydrogen from other elements is no easy task. Today, the cheapest way to do this is via chemical processes that break up natural gas. This releases a lot of carbon dioxide. Another method is to use electricity to split water molecules in a process called electrolysis. Although there is no carbon byproduct, a lot of electricity is needed. And if this power comes from burning coal or gas, it negates the zero emissions goals of using hydrogen to begin with. Hydrogen produced in this way, powered by fossil fuels, is called gray hydrogen. If carbon capture and storage is used together with fossil fuels, then it becomes blue hydrogen. If nuclear power is used, it's called pink. And finally, green hydrogen is what is produced via electrolysis and powered from renewable sources. This method is considered emissions free. It's predicted that by the early 2030s, H2 made from renewables will be cheaper than that made from fossil fuels. But that hinges on the cost of electrolysis declining, which will be achieved through larger projects and an expansion of manufacturing. To be clear, vast amounts of H2 are…",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,245,2022-10-06 17:35:53
12020," Inges on the cost of electrolysis declining, which will be achieved through larger projects and an expansion of manufacturing. To be clear, vast amounts of H2 are already used today. Global production in 2018 totaled 117 million metric tons. This hydrogen is mostly used for its chemical properties, not as a source of energy, and very little of it is clean. Some sectors like steel could start using hydrogen for these chemical properties, replacing coal. Industries like cement and glass may also use hydrogen as a source of heat. Another advantage is its energy storage potential. It can be stored over long periods of time, and used when more power needs to be added to the grid. It also could hold an advantage over batteries in heavy transport and shipping. The promise of hydrogen for energy has been around since at least 1874, when Jules Verne wrote about it in his book, The Mysterious Island. But the future of hydrogen will depend on policy. Countries with net zero targets, carbon pricing and hydrogen strategies with investment mechanisms are likely to see the highest H2 demand. That was Bloomberg's Christine Lee Edwards explaining what hydrogen means for the energy transition. But how are businesses approaching the sector? Now one of Australia's richest men is making a big play into hydrogen. Andrew Forrest, better known as Twiggy, made his fortune from iron ore, being the chairman, former CEO and major shareholder in Fordescue Metals, one of the world's biggest miners. But after having made over $10 billion in profit from the metal in the last fiscal year, Twiggy wants to transform Fordescue into a clean energy company. He's been scouring the planet in search of investment opportunities in hydrogen and renewables. The firm plans to allocate up to 10% of its annual profits for green energy investments and is exploring projects across the globe from Indonesia to Argentina. Prancing Lockwa caught up with Twiggy Forest. There's only one type of clean hydrogen. All the rest is dirty. That is green. If you just say, green hydrogen is clean, the rest is dirty, then you've actually nailed it. Anyone else who produces any other hydrogen, any other agridist, look at the answer. Why is global warming accelerating if anything you're saying is true? And then you have no actually, it's greenwashing. Yeah, but there's a lot of greenwashing because I keep on being told it's a transition. We can't just make the transition at a click of a finger. So what are we doing wrong? What can we do better? I don't remember the personal computer having to transition the typewriter. I really don't remember that. I don't remember the smartphone having to transition the pocket calculator and the old landline. You know, it's transition line is complete rubbish. The light got put to it. Two days ago when JCB, a really loved British company, you're in every right for the country to be proud of JCB. And Portuscue, holding a bit of a similar reputation, fantastic track record. It went from Superwell from Portuscue, huge balance sheet, super strong. And those two companies got together and agreed at 79 billion USD on Greenwood per atom. Right. Then that's a real wake up call to say, hang on. Greenhagen is obviously commercial now. You know, every other form of fossil fuel, fossil fuel hydrogen, you know, it can compete with it on price. It can probably lose on price. But what we know, it is cooking the planet. And only Greenhagen zero methane, zero carbon in the supply chain. Don't worry about the molecules in the supply chain. But at the moment, we're not even phasing out coal if you look at the G20 company case. So we have a long way to go to talk about only using green hydrogen. Yeah. So look, I have a call, which I'd like to make now, that the world should not fund any more coal-fired power stations, coal mining projects ever. We should wind them down as quickly as possible because they are cooking the planet just like grey and greenhagen, it's cooking the planet. You know, having to not make renewable electricity is releasing 10 to 16 times more carbon. Let alone the methane, which is worse than it is hydrogen. So we've just got to stop doing things which are self-harming under the guise of green energy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,246,2022-10-06 17:40:20
12021," carbon, let alone the methane which is worse than it is hydrogen. So we've just got to stop doing things which are self-harming under the guise of brainwashing. So why are leaders so slow, even if you look at the appetite for ESG investments, they're growing exponentially, so are emissions, so where are we allocating capital? Okay, so take the recent G20. There's probably a reason why there wasn't strong action coming out of the G20, because people were not aware that major transactions between large companies were taking place now on green hydrogen, that actually this pollution-free all the way to the supply chain fuel was now being transacted at multi-billion dollar scale. If that none that I don't believe any sovereign leader or any energy minister or climate change minister could not take ultrasonry, the green hydrogen is never here to stay, it's broken through, history has been made, it will never go back. Okay, what is the one thing that you would tell leaders today and business leaders? How do we transition faster than what we are now? Because we're at real risk of missing our targets. Oh, so that's really simple. Do you stop funding? Do you stop subsidising? Do you stop using money into cost? Right. It could be carbon sequestration, it could be fuel rebates, it could be anything. Hundreds of billions of dollars getting ashed while we ashed the planet on fossil fuel subsidies, because we haven't had that renewable energy, we haven't had that green hydrogen, it's kind of been pushed down, pushed down, it's also excuses, are never being commercial, they never be supplied in the quantities we needed. Now blah blah, now we know it, let's take action, it's practical, it's implementable, let's do it now. Okay, if we do it now, is there going to be a shock to the energy system? Is there going to be a shock actually to economically and is it worth not talking about transition, just going from 8 to B? Yeah, it's a fantastic person, 8 to B is the solution, let fossil fuels do what fossil fuels do, just burn their coal, burn their oil, burn their gas, at least they're pumping up carbon and methane into the atmosphere, honestly. Well, not that honest because they don't mention methane, which is 90 times worse than carbon, but at least the carbon is being done honestly, encourage the green hydrogen sector to come in really fast, okay, it's there, there's there's renewable power all over the world, we know how to make electrolyzes much cheaper, like 25% of the original cost, we know how to do that now, we don't have any excuse to get into it. Does it need to be cheaper than oil and fossil fuel for it to be viable worldwide? Well right now it is, okay, so let's just swallow that bit of financial data, right now is cheaper and it's getting more cheaper, it's the own fuel you know, just declining in value. You don't have enough of it, right, to power the world. Yes, that's only because we haven't had policies to support, we had policies to support it five, 10 years ago, it would be everywhere, you'd say the global warming budget start to come down, now we've got five or 10 years to make a huge difference and it's policy leaders all over the world to appreciate now, okay, big business is transacting with green hydrogen in multi-billion dollar agreements, we now know it's here and it's here to stay, it's spread everywhere. Coming up on the program, the hydrogen revolution, we'll speak with the CEO of Italian utility firm Snam about his new book and why he thinks green hydrogen will be competitive in just five years. Plus, how are airlines working to become more sustainable? We'll look at how Airbus plans to step up in the climate fight.

12022," ep9 from Bloomberg's World headquarters in New York. I'm Kaley Lines and this is Bloomberg Green. What will the world look like in 2050? Will global temperatures have stabilized? Electric vehicles be abundant? And solar and wind power homes around the world? According to Marco Alvera, the CEO of Italian Energy Company Snam, that vision of the future could be a reality. And he says that hydrogen will pave its way. As he tells it in his new book, The Hydrogen Revolution, Alvera's moment of reckoning came in November 2018 when he tasked the Snam scenarios team with studying how Europe could reduce its CO2 emissions to zero by 2050. Looking through the results of the study, Alvera said he was struck by how much hydrogen was in Europe's energy mixed by that year. Beyond the abundance of hydrogen, the Snam model also predicted that it would be the cheapest form of decarbonized energy for many sectors, and that it could be cheaper than today's prices for oil, coal, and nuclear power. Our Maria today spoke with Alvera at COP26. Goods happening all very fast. We see the cost of hydrogen coming down a lot. Hydrogen will play a big role in the energy mix. I don't know if it's going to be 15 or 25% of a fully decarbonized energy system, but it's going to be big. Coss are coming down, and people are waking up to the fact that it's the only way to decarbonize certain sectors, so-called hard-to-abate sectors. And you say it's the only way in the cost are coming down, where do you see prices moving? Because a lot of the reticence of times has to do with the pricing. That some argue will still nod the cheapest option out of the market. So when I was first working in hydrogen in 2004, it was costing $1,000 per megawatt hour, 2010, 600. Today, 100, and we see it going down to 50 and five years time, and to going down to $25 per megawatt hour in the next 10 years or so. Which is a quarter of word as today. That's really because renewable energy, and we're talking green hydrogen here, renewable energy costs are falling, but the cost of making the electrolyzer, which is the kit that you use to convert solar wind energy and water into hydrogen, the cost of this kit is falling a lot, because it doesn't really exist on an industrial scale. So as we build up capacity, we industrialize it, we standardize it, and we squeeze costs out. That's really the cost trajectory. And for that, of course, you need demand, however, for governments and also institutions to kind of buy into this idea that it is a future and we want to invest in creating infrastructure. What are they telling you? When you speak to governments, when you speak to officials, are they keen on this? They're very keen. So the Department of Energy shares our view in the states of getting to below $1.00 a kilo, which is $25 a meg of an hour. The European Union has a hydrogen strategy, which is very clear, and several member states have the same. Chile wants to export a lot of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,248,2022-10-06 17:49:09
12023," which is $25 a megawatt hour. The European Union has a hydrogen strategy which is very clear and several member states have the same. Chile wants to export a lot of hydrogen. China's big on hydrogen. Australia's very big on hydrogen. Japan is blending already hydrogen. So I would say the world is now really focused on this because it's the only way to store energy for a long period of time economically to convert it into either liquid or gas. And of course you talk about the price but the other big component is the volume. How big can you go? Where do you see that on a time scale? So wherever it's sunny or windy you can produce very cheap hydrogen eventually. And so compared to oil and gas which are concentrated in few parts of the world it's going to be very democratic from that point of view. So every sunny place, every desert, every ocean wind can be turned into hydrogen that we can put on ships in pipes and really start trading it around the world. So it's going to happen a lot faster than a lot of people think. So and will you say a lot faster? What is that in time? As they said, $50 which is essentially oil parity within five years and then depending on how quickly we ramp it up after that we could get to $25 which is coal parity before the end of the day. And in big scale. In big scale because once you get to coal parity that's the only way we're going to get China and India to stop burning new coal. We have businesses in China and in India and I see a lot of hydrogen development, a lot of renewable development in both countries. The Indian announcement was incredibly strong on 2030. Some people were upset about the 2017 at zero deadline but when it comes to 30 he announced the big big commitment to get the 50% renewable. Where is the price? I was surprised that they would make it so explicit and even the net zero is a big thing for them. And so I think it will happen faster than 2070 because of the falling cost of renewable and hydrogen. India's burning 80 gigawatt of oil of diesel to keep the lights on. So there's an immediate opportunity there and we're very interested in working that country. And with regards to China, perhaps the fact that we haven't really seen them act if I guess the diplomats are working on this but we haven't really seen the leadership. It's going to be technology, it's going to be industry I think China has committed to a net zero which is very important. And G20 China was clearly behind the one and a half degrees. So I think a lot has been achieved between the G20 and COP and I think what's really important is to see in the coming years. How quick it's in our hands to make part of this happen in five years or could otherwise happen in 15, 20 years. It's about building the project. The capital is there. We saw how many trillions of dollars are already committed. What's missing is really the projects and that's where companies like us step in. Marco Alvera CEO of SNAM there speaking with our Maria today. Let's turn now to the aviation industry. It's a big contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions and it's under pressure to change that. In October, the International Air Transport Association, a trade body representing airlines, approved a target of achieving net zero emissions by 2050. To achieve that, many airlines in the US and Europe are looking to buy sustainable aviation fuel made from renewable sources like used vegetable oil. Initiatives like these are pushing plane makers to come up with some radical new aircraft that will eventually cater to our growing appetite for travel without hurting the environment. We took a look at how Airbus, the world's number two aircraft manufacturer, is stepping up to the challenge. How long until we can fly emission free? Airbus says it's more confident by the day. It can be done by its 2035 target. Airbus a CEO spoke about its ambitions for hydrogen-powered planes at the company's summit in France. The physics works. Hydrogen technologies are not new. They are used in other sectors. We use them in space on our rockets. We don't need the laws of physics to change to be able to use hydrogen on our planes. So every day we become more confident. But we think we need to have a plane. We need to have the right fuels, the hydrogen available in the right quantity at the right place at the right time. And we need the regulations to be ready. So we really need the work and the collaboration of many people on the globe to make it happen on time. But it could be a long way to until green passenger jets go mainstream. Larger aircraft with more than 150 seats are not expected to feature globally until about 2050. That means manufacturers and airlines today are under growing pressure to ramp up short-term innovations to cut their carbon. In a long term.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,249,2022-10-06 17:53:21
12024," 50. That means manufacturers and airlines today are under growing pressure to ramp up short-term innovations to cut their carbon. In a long term, meeting the ambitious plans for so-called green hydrogen means building a giant industry almost from scratch. To make that happen, British airline EasyJet is among those saying governments need to get involved and fast. Aviation's emissions over the last three decades leading up to the pandemic grew by about 80% to over 1 gigaton, and that's projected to double by 2050. According to Bloomberg, NEF, about half of the airlines with the largest global market share have set net zero targets by that same date nearly three decades away. Coming up from Blue Sky projects to the bottom line, we'll speak with our Bloomberg NEF expert Meredith Annex and dig into their models about how hydrogen fits into the future energy mix. This is Bloomberg Green. From Bloomberg's World Headquarters in New York, I'm Kayleigh Lines, and this is Bloomberg Green. Now let's bring in Meredith Annex. Our Bloomberg NEF Hydrogen Specialists to talk more about how hydrogen could change the energy landscape. So Meredith, what place do you think hydrogen is likely to have in the future energy mix globally? Hydrogen is this incredible solution for us as we look to decarbonize because it's a perfect solution in areas that are hard to electrify. So we're really like to think about hydrogen playing a role. It's in things like heavy industry, especially where you need a feedstock as well as energy source, and in things like dispatchable power, long call transport, maybe even shipping and aviation. That sounds great that it can be used for such diverse industries. At the end of the day, though, how much is this going to cost? Well, that's the amazing thing about hydrogen because depending on how you make it, it can actually see significant costs of clients in the future. So when we're talking about clean hydrogen, we're usually mean green hydrogen produced from renewable electricity. And in that case, your hydrogen is almost as cheap as the renewables that are used to make it. So if you're in a place with really good renewable resources, you'll be able to have cheaper hydrogen. But even in places with less good resources, we think that hydrogen can be cheaper than a dollar per kilogram, which is the price.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,250,2022-10-06 17:57:34
12025," You'll be able to have cheaper hydrogen, but even in places with less good resources, we think that hydrogen can be cheaper than a dollar per kilogram, which is the price of unabated hydrogen today and around $8 per million BTUs for those who prefer to think in energy units. And that can be achieved anywhere in the world by 2050, we believe. All right, so let's talk about kind of the pros and cons list. I don't know where cost fits into that, but what are the advantages to hydrogen over other renewables and then what are the drawbacks? Yeah, main advantage is the fact that hydrogen can serve roles that electron struggle with, and that's things like seasonal storage, for instance, or just anything where you need storeability, where your electrons are harder to store, hydrogen is going to be easier. That also leads to a downside though, because hydrogen is less energy dense than the usual things that we use for storeable energy today like coal or oil or natural gas. So you will need more volume of storage to handle the same amount of energy. Let's talk about the viability as well and how it may differ in different geographies. What is your view on that? Yeah, so for green hydrogen again from renewable electricity, really places with the best renewable resources, things like Latin America or the Middle East, even southern Europe have really, really good potential for producing hydrogen. And then when you're looking at blue hydrogen, which is produced from natural gas or coal with carbon-caption storage, we do see that becoming more expensive than green hydrogen in the future, especially as renewable electricity costs come down. But that can be a viable option in places like the US Gulf Coast or Russia, where you've got good geological storage for the carbon, and as well as ample natural gas that's quite cheap. All right, great breakdown. Thank you so much to our Meredith Annex, our Bloomberg NEF Hydrogen Specialist. And of course, you can get more from the Bloomberg NEF team on the terminal and online. And they've recently done a podcast called Hydrogen 101 as part of its Switched On series. So from iron ore titans pivoting to cleaner energy to talk of a hydrogen revolution, that's it from this week's edition of Bloomberg Green. We'll be back next week with a deep dive into the state of electric vehicles. And you can keep the conversation going by following us on YouTube, Instagram and Twitter at climate.

12026," 24 hours a day at Bloomberg.com. The Bloomberg Business Act. And at Bloomberg Quick Take. This is a Bloomberg Business Flash. From Bloomberg World, Hank Waters, I'm Charlie Palatouille begin with a developing story talks between Elon Musk and Twitter to reach a resolution of the $44 billion takeover are said to be stuck in part over Musk's statement that his offer is now contingent on getting $13 billion in debt financing. Right now, we do have Twitter shares off by 2.2%. Tesla shares there are by 4.10% of 1%. It is a down day on Wall Street ahead of the Jones Report tomorrow morning with the S&P now lower by 18 points down 5.10% of 1%. We've got the Dow down 222 at 30,049. Lower by 7.10% of 1%. And as the down 8, a drop there of 1 1 1%. 10 year yield 3.80% the 2 year yield 4.22%. Gold spot gold down 2.10% 1712 the ounce wall as Texas intermediate crude of 8 1% 88 49 of barrel. Applications for unemployment insurance rose by more than forecast last week. Johnless claims up by 29,000. Wall Street looking ahead 2 tomorrow morning's jobs report on what it means for the Federal Reserve. Laurie Calvacine is head of US equity strategy at RBC capital market. I think the reality is is that we do have people at the Fed who are going to pay attention to the data. And as I talk to investors and I've been traveling the country the last few weeks, I still get a lot of questions from equity people about what do different components of inflation look like. I mean, there is still a real attention and there's a real sensitivity to the idea in the equity investment community that inflation, the sort of seeds of moderation that we have been planted. And you have to think that the Fed is going to pay attention to the data that's incoming and I think that's a reasonable assumption. Man speaking of jobs, Amazon plans to hire 150,000 seasonal workers. Stocks lower. I'm Charlie Pellet. That's a Bloomberg business flash. This is Bloomberg Business Week. Inside from the reporters and editors who bring you America's most trusted business magazine. Plus global business finance and tech news as it happens Bloomberg Business Week with Carol Masser and Bloomberg Quick Takes Tim Stenevig on Bloomberg Radio. Live from the Bloomberg Interactive broker studio, we are streaming on YouTube. It is Thursday, November 6, 2022. Carol Masser along with Tim Stenevig and you heard Charlie talk about it volatility. It is on a bumpy stock trading session. Once again, ahead of the monthly jobs reporting again, we're trying to figure out what does the Fed do next in terms of its moves. And then again, the story that keeps on giving Tim. Yeah, the Fed is it is one of the stories that keeps on giving. But we're talking about another one because a Bloomberg exclusive from Jeff Feely, Michelle F Davis and Paul Seligson about Elon Musk and Twitter. The resolution said to stick on debt contingency issues. This crossed in the Bloomberg terminal just moments ago. According to those familiar with the matter. We're talking about financing the deal. So let's get to it. The latest in this story, the twists and turns with Bloomberg News Legal reporter Jeff Feely. He is on the phone in Wilmington, Delaware. So Jeff, what's the latest? What's the update? We're trying to reach the end on this, but as you know, all the devil was in the details. We are trying to hammer out. One of the final turns of the, you know, the procedural finalization of Twitter suit. Well, the Mr. Musk attempt to try to walk away from the deal. And the sticking point at this point is a contingency, a financing contingency that Mr. Musk included in an FCC letter outlining his offer to revive the deal on its original terms. And, you know, that's not in the original deal. And the Twitter folks are not happy about that. So what does this mean for the chances of it actually closing? I mean, does this give Elon Musk some sort of? It's going to close. It is. It's going to close. It's going to close. There's no question it's going to close. Is it going to close at 5420 a share? Absolutely. Twitter has won. Mr. Musk waved the white flag. He capitulated. He surrendered. It's over. Well, I got to tell you the stock shares a Twitter are below 5420 a share at $50 and change. It's down about 2.3 percent here. So what happens next legally? You know this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,252,2022-10-06 18:06:26
12027," I got to tell you the stock shares a Twitter are below 5420 share at $50 and change. It's down to about 2.3%. So what happens next legally? You know, this is the thing that you're keeping a watch on. And I feel like from the get go, Elon, laid out his deal, said, all in, don't need to do a lot of extra stuff. And then all of a sudden it started backtracking it from a legal perspective. As you said, is there any grounds for him to stand on? No. The reality is what they're doing now is trying to hammer out a request for the judge to stay the progress of the case to basically put it on hold so they can finalize, you know, the procedural stuff they need to do. In the end, it's going to be a stipulation of dismissal. The lawsuit is going to go away. The deal is going to close and then Twitter is going to be owned by Elon Musk. Hey, I love in this reporting by you and our Bloomberg team that notes that for the banks involved, very few, if anyways, for banks to get out of providing such debt commitments after signing the contract, that's the other angle here. Yes. Again, these are all legal agreements signed by very sophisticated investors with lots of legal talent. Agreements, you know, require you to honor your obligations. Same thing with Mr. Musk and his obligation to buy Twitter. He agreed to do it. He's now going to have to do it and the banks are going to have to finance it. Does it happen next week, Jeff? Not a clue. Couldn't tell you. You know, you just can't predict how long this stuff's going to take. So what's the point of adding language like this, like Elon Musk did and his team did to this letter filed with the SEC? Why add this language? Because lawyers are paid to protect their clients. And they did not know for sure whether the original debt you'd deal was still going to fly, given the changes in the market that we've reported. So lawyers are going to protect their clients. If for some reason this financing fell apart, then Mr. Musk would have the legal right to sue those folks for that financing. All right. So yesterday, so much when we were having conversations about Elon Musk and his pursuit, not pursuit of Twitter, we were saying, you know, it's not quite done yet. And here we are again, having another story about it, not being done quite yet, but you were saying it's going to happen. Are we getting to the end of the ability of Elon Musk's lawyers to kind of just put a pause on it? Yeah. Look, it's not really Elon Musk's lawyers. What's happening here is that people need to figure out last steps. You can't just have an offer and then everybody throws their hands up as a party and goes, oh, you've got to finalize it. You've got to make sure that everything, all the eyes are dotted, the teas are crossed, and that's what's going on. So everybody really needs to calm down. This is done. Yeah. Hey, Jeff, don't give away your sources or your methods, of course, but what are you looking for to be, I don't know, the next shoot a drop between now and when this closes? All right. The next shoot a drop. Again, I'm a legal guy. So the next shoot a drop is going to be a request to Judge McCormick, you're in Wilmington to stay the trial. Trial is set to go October 70th and Judge McCormick noted yesterday that nobody has yet asked for a stay. So they're going to continue to proceed like the trial is going to go October 17th. It's not going to go October 17th. They're going to file a request to put it on hold so that they can have time to do the finalization they need to do. When that's done, you're going to have a stipulation of dismissal and the Twitter suit will go away and the deal will close. Got to love it. One for the business schools to study for a long time. Not yet though. The story's still being written. That's where we haven't gotten to the end of it. Don't forget to law schools. They may be interested too. Really, really good point. And you've been so smart on all of it and keeping us updated. Jeff Feeley, thank you so much. Bloomberg News Legal Reporter Jeff Feeley, they're in Wilmington, Delaware. Again, the headline talks between Elon Musk and Twitter to reach a resolution on that $44 billion takeover, stuck in part over Musk's statement that is offers now contingent on receiving $13 billion in debt financing. This is according to people familiar with the matter. It shows a Twitter down here on the news. Is anything else happening in the markets today, Carol? Not a thing. No, we're done. That's it.

12028," Markets today, Carol? Not a thing. No, no, no. So we're done. That's it. We talked about Charlie, talked about volatility, man. It is definitely on a bumpy stock trading session ahead of the monthly jobs report tomorrow. And then as a Fed speakers, continue to re-up on crushing inflation. So let's get into that and let's get to the Market Drivers report. Let's set your business week agenda, man. It is Thursday. Feels like it should be January of 2023. There's been so much going on. Michael McKee, International Economics and Policy Correspondent at Bloomberg News here in our interactive broker studio. So to his Katie Griefell, Bloomberg News, Senior Markets reporter, co-host of Crypto IRL, on Bloomberg Quick Take. Where do we begin? Crypto IRL. That's where we begin. That's the story. That's the story. New show tonight. You're taking 8.30 PM. 8.30 PM. We have taken over the program. It's the Market Trackers report. Oh, sorry. You're talking your book kids. You're talking your book. Let's talk the Fed book first. Let's begin, Michael McKee. So Mike, where are we? I mean, it's every Fed speaker that comes out, even the former does turn hawks. They're like, listen, guys, we're going to keep raising rates. Yeah, I've got nothing for you. I mean, it's literally batch their message and their state. Do you know what it says? Is this Jeff Feeley? No, this is a done. This is a really good point. Are they? Do they have to come out and say this over and over again? Because traders are essentially saying, we sense a pivot here and send stocks up this week to their best two-day rallies. I was just telling my daughter to make her bad. You guys don't get this. You don't get this. Yes. I've told you over and over and over again. I will pull this car over and the inflation comes down. Put your shoes away. Today, we had jobless claims come in a little stronger. Turn futures around. They went positive because the market said, oh, if it's going to be able to back off, because jobless claims went up by a few thousand. It's a little bit ridiculous. If they like today's claims numbers, they're going to be ecstatic next week because half of Florida is out of work. So they're all going to be filing jobless claims. And when you see the numbers go way up next week. But yeah, there's nothing new here from the Fed. And the markets just keep hoping and hoping. The markets do keep hoping. I tweeted this morning, this is like the 15th time that markets have tried to trade a pivot and then just get shouted down by a course of credit. This is our Katie. We don't use the word pivot in this room anymore. Well, take a drink. I mean, a lot of people wish you would. I mean, if you look at what's being priced in for next year, it looks like the cut pricing has come out almost completely, which is pretty remarkable. Definitely traders getting gun shy. Be four tomorrow's NFP print. I know that there was a little bit of exuberance in futures, but that feels like a long time ago. Yeah. OK. I don't even know where to go. I feel like we've had this conversation over and over. Get I got the message. I know that Mike. I mean, it's kind of helpful to me to know that Mike is kind of I wouldn't use the word exasperated, Mike. But it does seem like somebody in your position who's watching the Fed speakers each and every day, it's kind of a broken record. It is a broken record. And they're going to keep repeating that broken record. We'll see what happens tomorrow with jobs. And the next week was CPI, but they're probably going to do 75. The bar being somewhat high for them to drop down since they've steered the market in that direction. And then they'll. Australia, too. No, Australia kind of thing. And they'll maybe back off a little bit in December because they've already gotten very close to where they think they need to be. And they want to see what happens with the long and variable lags. But they're on a course. The only thing that's going to change it is if inflation mysteriously goes away. Yeah. Or if the economy goes into a deep recession, which would mean inflation goes away. So the Fed doesn't know when that's going to happen. So the thing we're going to keep rates up until it does. I have a question for Mike McKee. Can I ask him? Yeah, please go. How do you think Jerome Powell feels about OPEC right now? Because if I look at inflation expectations, I'm going to blame it on the output cut news. They've been moving higher this week, actually. Yeah, it's kind of odd because some of the other indicators we get in the front, like the ISMs, have shown price pressures easing. And it may be just a little bit of guessing what OPEC plus is going to mean. You notice that really all prices haven't gone up all that much. Because the market pretty much knows that this is not going to be.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,254,2022-10-06 18:15:17
12029," in what OPEC plus is going to mean. You notice that really all prices haven't gone up all that much because the market pretty much knows that this is not going to be a $2 million barrel cut. It's maybe 800,000 to $1 million. Because some aren't even at their levels. Then the question is, do we have a recession? If we have a recession, then demand goes down. And oil prices can't be supported. So there's a lot of factors that go into this that go beyond the Joe Biden is not happy kind of headlines. So I'm wondering, look, I've seen about the Costco story today where the CFO said that some shipping and commodity prices have seen steady declines recently, but they're not passing it on to consumers yet because they lock in contracts with their suppliers so they have yet to kind of play out in their balance sheet. Having said that, Mike, so here we are inflation pretty high. When it starts to fall, will it fall quickly? You might think so ordinarily it would. We're just working with this weird dynamic now with supply chains, with energy prices, the whole switch from buying a lot of goods during the pandemic to services now. There aren't models that tell us exactly what's going to happen. But there are a lot of categories that it looks like have peaked. And then maybe they start to roll over. Could they go very quickly? All right. Can we just talk about the show tonight, crypto? Crypto IRL. Quickly. Will you be watching? Yes, of course. Who are you talking to? Oh, everyone is speechless. Wait, wait a minute. I can't watch because I don't know what time it's on. 8.30 PM Eastern, you can watch it on Quick Take. If you want to get there from your web browser, it's Bloomberg.com slash Qt slash live. Did I miss anything? What's the theme tonight? We got a great episode. It's a theme. A thing that's rising from the ashes. What happens with after $2 trillion in crypto wealth has been wiped out? Who's left standing? Is it time to build? Is there somebody who goes, whoa, in it? I think we do. I don't know if that need to cut. Yeah. Is the ZLM us going to buy your show? It's not for sale, Mike. It's not for sale. Everything has a price. All right, guys. Thank you so much. Michael McKee, of course, at Bloomberg News, following the International Economy and Policy News. And of course, Bloomberg News, Senior Markets Reporter, co-host of Crypto IRL. She does it all. Katie Griefeld. Right now, then, we're going to talk to Charlie. Well, let's get to World of National News. Oh, OK. We'll get a Charlie update. Nancy Lyons is in DC. Hey, Nets. Thanks, Tim. President Biden says he is disappointed at the decision from OPEC Plus to slash oil production. But he says he doesn't regret his trip to Saudi Arabia three months ago when he urged leaders to keep crude flowing. The president says he's looking at alternatives, but no decisions been made. We spoke with Amos Huxstein, the president's special coordinator for Energy Security. We're going to work with our US companies to ensure that they continue to increase production and make sure that we have the refining capacity. We're down a couple of refineries due to some accidents, some maintenance. White House adviser Amos Huxstein also says there's some work to do on US strategic oil reserves. We're also learning the Biden administration will not scale down sanctions on Venezuela's authoritarian regime in order to free up oil exports without positive actions from President Nicholas Maduro's government. We get details on that from Bloomberg's Amy Morris. The Wall Street Journal had reported the White House was looking at ways to reopen US and European markets to oil exports from Venezuela. National Security Council spokeswoman Adrian Watson says the US will continue to implement and enforce Venezuela sanctions, which have been in place since 2019. Watson says they'll review the sanctions policies after they see constructive steps by the Maduro regime to restore democracy. In Washington, I'm Amy Morris, Bloomberg Radio.

That is a drop of about eight tenths of 1% down industrial is down 293 right now a decline of 1% and as the stack down 44 dropped there of just about 4 tenths of 1% to be clear we are trading very close to session lows 10 year yield 3.80% the 2 year yield 4.22% spot gold down to 10% 1712 the ounce and we've got West Texas in immediate crude up 9 tenths of 1% 88 59 a barrel. Well Bitcoin right now up 4 tenths of 1% Bitcoin 20,000 58 I'm Charlie Pellet and that is a Bloomberg business flash. All right Charlie thank you so much for talking pumpkin smashing we're talking so many different things we're also talking about the latest on credit suites because this is the most red story on the Bloomberg today it's a Bloomberg exclusive about credit suites on outside money for spin off when it comes to the company's investment banking business very please this afternoon to be enjoying the pumpkins over this. I don't know I mean you can't say that without me thinking of the 90s rock band you know with Billy Corrigan the smashing pumpkins but back to credit suites we got a lot of money from the investors and clients as well bring us up to speed on this report. A few things happening we've been talking about a end of the month credits was so good a fuller strategy update here and fixed and starts things are starting to leak out about what they're considering the investment banking part of this some fun stats guys if you think that credit is going to be a lot of pressure this year yes of course it has shares down more than 50% downgrades cost of funding rising but they are still one of the top five and Merit top six and mergers and acquisitions according to Bloomberg's bleak tables there's also among the top 10 in most forms of important debt underwriting that means US investment great credit it means even high yields it's only leverage loans they've really fallen off a bit and remember that's a riskier business in which a lot of people are losing money anyways so they are holding on tight to that investment bank as far as they can as long as they can and if they were to raise outside capital for it potentially spin it off maybe they can raise enough money to avoid but investors are really worried about which is a capital raise so which would explain to I mean our audience knows but explain what that would mean for credit sweeps if that happens listen so credit sweeps restructuring is expensive right it would require some firings for example maybe exiting some businesses it can cost millions hundreds of millions of dollars to restructure banks city group is doing it right now for example so if you're doing it right now you can do it right now so you may need to raise money and if you have to do that in the stock market through new equity it would dilute your stock and so investors are concerned about that event now analysts out there believe that four billion dollars is about what might need to be raised but maybe some of that four billion dollars can be obtained elsewhere by selling some assets perhaps by maybe a deal that we've been talking about right but long story short is what they're trying to do is get enough money to fund this plan this turnaround plan can I ask you something though doesn't I don't know I guess I keep thinking of the city model right like so much under one roof and it allows you to do so much what does it take away from credit sweeps if they get rid of investment banking does it matter so this is the age old question I love this question because it's a big question a lot of banks face you be asked this face this question for a very long time do what you think is even face the reality is in times where your wealth managers under stress your investment bank is making you a lot of money right so it is a ballast when things go go to bad depending but remember credits is we're not talking about a small firm which I would at top 10 players",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,256,2022-10-06 18:23:44
12031," you a lot of money. So it is a ballast when things go go to bad depending but remember credits we're not talking about a small firm we're talking about a top 10 player in the world. Well that brings me to my next question Janali. If we look at the struggles that Credit Suisse is facing, is this a credit Suisse specific issue? Are these credits Suisse specific issues or is this something that investors should be concerned about affecting other banks as well? It's a great question because a lot of these issues are Credit Suisse specific. They've lost a lot of money in archaicos with green cell. These are really bad investments in sour clients essentially. So they do have unique issues to themselves plus lots of risk management issues over a lot of years that have piled up. But to that end a lot of European banks are under a lot of pressure given the pressures we're seeing in Europe at large. So if you take a look at Barclay's stock for example, it's trading well below book value as is Credit Suisse. So yes there is a broader worry about European banks. But right now this is not to the concern of any sort of breaking point yet. The idea of a Lehman moment was a lot of things that a lot of more professional money managers were shaking off. You mentioned this stock decline this year so down more than 50%. So obviously investors don't have a lot of faith right now. But what about this current CEO who has had some stumbles with these memos that have come out and not necessarily done the right. So is there faith from the Alice community at large that he's the God of fix it? Well you hope so because they've had so much management turnover already. And so really the last thing you need for Credit Suisse is another pair of uncertainties on top of everything else they're facing. So yes is there pressure on him? Yes given that he just got there he has a little bit. He's just going to say right he just got there. Yeah he just got there and so he has time on his hands but how much is time a year? 12 months? Two years? What about when it comes to staffing and when it comes to talent acquisition talent wars? It's not what it was a year ago when it comes to investment banks when it comes to banks worldwide or here in the US is more the story that I focused on but when you think about it worldwide do these issues really hurt retention at the bank? Yes to your point it's not as easy now as it was a year ago and we have seen a lot of bankers leave Credit Suisse for example over the last couple of years. However you know now I'm pushing this beyond Credit Suisse I've been having a lot of conversations on the buy side big private equity funds who are looking at the banks like Credit Suisse seeing who's left there and saying okay maybe some of these folks that worked in leverage finance or worked in equity capital markets can come work for us instead as we build up certain businesses when frankly assets are on the cheap and hiring is under pressure so we can get even people for a better price. Well quickly just got about 30 seconds of Swiss government. Yes. Okay they help out here. I'm sure they are knocking on their door all the time because this is a gem. I'll say go away. Yeah but yeah. And so but if anything if they if they nudge anything to happen you have to wonder if they're going to ask certain parts of Credit Suisse to merge with any part of UBS or any other bank. All right do we expect a resolution at next couple of weeks or what? Next couple weeks we'll get the big plan. Okay that's right. But you have to hope that it's big enough to make investors happy. All right good stuff as always. She's Wall Street reporter at Bloomberg news the latest on Credit Suisse we mentioned it is the most red story on the Bloomberg on this. What day is it? It's Thursday. I'm in. Friday's you. All right you're listening and watching Bloomberg Business Week on radio on YouTube and this is Bloomberg.

12033," Newmlulle期uthContent In... Broadcasting live from the Bloomberg Interactive Broker studio in New York. Bloomberg 1130 to Washington, D.C. Bloomberg 991 to Boston, Bloomberg 1061 to San Francisco, Bloomberg 960 to the country, Syria's XM Channel 119, and around the globe, the Bloomberg Business app, and Bloomberg Radio.com. This is Bloomberg Business Week. All right folks, you are listening and watching Bloomberg Business Week on Yes, it is Thursday. We're going to take a look at something that's so important certainly across the nation, and we're talking about the under-insurance. It's not enough and it gets more difficult even to get that insurance as prices continue to rise, not just in health care, but for everything else. All right, we'll get to that in just a moment. First up, though, back to the trade and to your top business stories and back to Charlie Carey. All right, thank you very much, Carol Messer. Stocks lower across the board, read on the screen right now for the Dow, the S&P and Nasdaq, but first sources tell Bloomberg talks between Elon Musk and Twitter to reach a resolution of a $44 billion takeover are stuck in part on Musk's statement that his offer is now contingent on receiving $13 billion in debt financing. Twitter shares their down one-and-a-half percent. Tesla shares lower now by one-tenth of one percent. Stocks are falling as traders anxiously await that all important jobs report the S&P down. 23 now down six tenths of one percent. We've got the Dow down 250 down, eight tenths of one percent. Nasdaq down 26, a drop there of two tenths of one percent. Ten year yield, 3.80 percent, the two year yield, 4.22 percent, spot gold, 17, 13, the ounce, while West Texas, and immediate crude is up nine tenths of one percent, 88, 54 for a barrel of WTI. Wall Street looking ahead to tomorrow morning's jobs report, Neil Richardson is chief economist at ADP. It's not the number of jobs created every month so much. It's the number of people entering the labor market right at a time when firms may be slowing hiring. So I'm really focused on the denominator of the unemployment rate. And of course complete coverage as you have come to expect over the years from Bloomberg Radio and television when that jobs number hits tomorrow morning, 8.30am Wall Street time. Speaking of jobs, Amazon plans to hire 150,000 seasonal workers about the same as last year. Today we are looking at Amazon shares and Amazon right now is down two tenths of one percent. Also announcing big hiring, JC Penny, it expects to hire over 20,000 people over the holiday shopping season. Peloton Interactive meanwhile, laying off a significant amount of employees for the fourth time this year as part of an effort to save the struggling business. Peloton shares up now by 6.1 percent. Again recapping, stock's law, we've got the tenure yielding 3.80 percent, S&P down 26, a drop of seven tenths of one percent. I'm Charlie Peloton, that is a Bloomberg business flat. I appreciate that Charlie Peloton. We'll report in August from the US Department of Health and Human Services show that the national uninsured rate reached an all time low of 8 percent earlier this year. Some good news with 5.2 million having gained coverage since 2020. Mean time, a Commonwealth fund survey found that 43 percent of working age adults were inadequately insured this year that both includes uninsured and underinsured 23 percent alone. The coverage just didn't provide them with affordable access to health care. Perhaps a huge deductible that you have to reach in order for that insurance to actually kick in. Let's get into it with G.B.I. professor of health policy and management at Johns Hopkins at Bloomberg School of Public Health. G joins us on the phone from Washington DC this afternoon. G.Gooddavu with us, what exactly is the definition of underinsured in the US? Because it doesn't necessarily mean that you don't have insurance.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,259,2022-10-06 18:37:00
12034, you with us uh... what does what exactly is the definition of under insured in the u.s. because it doesn't necessarily mean uh... that you you know don't have insurance it doesn't mean you don't have insurance it just means that you're paying a lot right so that means you have a high-tech more plan that before the deductible kick-in you're paying dollar for dollar for the negotiate the price that have been determined between your interest and and the provider is you have been sure that you have a very high-spotor before the back block it would you consider anyone who has a high deductible health plan to be under insured or is it okay i know you can't give individual advice but is it okay for somebody who is you know very young and healthy to have a high deductible health care plan it's absolutely and also uh... one-time that the vulnerability is that you the person's income that if you're very well-seated person you don't care all you can always pay but it's uh... really traveling for low-income working americans with high deductible plan because these people are really vulnerable financially so how what about a bomb a care right in terms of the impact that that's how it hasn't made it better and great question the albana care is really for the individual market right for people who are eligible to receive subsidy they are well protected but there are many people their incomes above the stretch hold so they're not getting the subsidy and now you know that the press can be very high for them i'm always amazed to know that i talk with individuals and especially in the media community with a lot of freelance folks and either if they're young they tend to be like i don't insurance or i just i can't afford it or if they they have families either what they're paying or that they're deductibles are just so high i think one of the big concerns is that it's expensive to get really comprehensive coverage and it's going to get more expensive g we're at a time when we're talking open enrollment is starting to happen for next year for for many companies that follow a you know typical four quarter uh... you know first through fourth quarter january through December type of thing uh... what should we expect to see when it comes to health care cost going up and are we expecting some companies not to shoulder as much of those costs so employees are gonna have to end up paying more that's such a good point and you know they you've been so eventually of fact the health care sector so we're expecting to see a six up to show you increase on the both up on our care market and also on the president's market so the companies you know if they have a lot of money of the pocket they would be waiting to show them more but in a lot of days many come to struggling so they will have to several a lot of the burden on individual workers and then their family help me out here i am always like i feel tortured when i think about the health care space because you have a lot of managed care companies are publicly held companies so they have to think about their shareholders and and and making money i think about these massive hospital organizations their nonprofits but yet i do feel like they have to think a lot about the bottom line so as long as there is a bottom line component to health care and and we need to be cost aware right but as long as they're that's there are there always going to be people left out because it's either too expensive and and ultimately inaccessible and yes i would say i thought we have good competition right and then the price will eventually go down and the quality will be maintained and then we also think i have to have a good fifty net system to protect the people are most in need and who's most vulnerable all right we're going to leave it on that note really something to think about with everything that's going on but this is really something that impacts people on such a key level uh... jibai thank you so much professor of health policy and management at john topkins bloomberg school of public health of course supported by michael r bloomberg found her bloomberg alpine bloomberg philanthropies she's joining us on the phone from washington dc stocks off their worst levels of the day right now but still down seven tenths of one percent the s and p five hundred down twenty seven points the down down close to one percentage point the nasdaq carol down about four times of one percent yet and way off our best levels of the session so keep in mind the s and p at its highs today up four times of a percent at its lows down almost one percent so you're talking about again a one point four percent swing and it really it almost looks like a dkg i mean there's just so much movement here the fed speakers yeah there's the fed speakers nervousness about the labor market with this tomorrow's jobs number look like yeah two hundred thirty k two,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,260,2022-10-06 18:41:19
12035," just so much movement here. The Fed speakers. Yeah, there's the Fed speakers nervousness about the labor market. What does tomorrow's jobs number look like? Yeah. 230K, 200K, 250. What's it going to be? The tortured conversation, you know, Fed, you know, not going to be so hawkish, we'll be so hawkish. And I got to say yields holding on to their highs of the session. That 10-year note with the yield of 380, to your note with the yield of 422. Let's get to world of national news. Nancy Lyon, the Standing Byin at DC Newsroom. Hey, guys. Thanks, Tim. The president Biden is in Pooke-C New York at an IBM facility. He's touting US tech investments like IBM's plan to invest $20 billion in quantum computing, semiconductor manufacturing, and other high tech areas. Where is it written that we can't lead manufacturing in the world? I don't know where that's written. And that's one of the things that chips at is going to change. The law that's going to build a future in a proud, proud legacy, not only for IBM, but for the country. Biden also plans to attend political fundraisers tonight in New York and New Jersey. People who question the legitimacy of the 2020 election now make up a majority of Republican nominees on the midterm ballot. 299 nominees in all have either denied or questioned President Biden's victory. That's according to a Washington Post analysis of House and Senate races across the country, as well as key statewide elections. Election doubters are running in every part of the country and nearly every state, four states have nominated election deniers in every race on the ballot of the 299. 174 are running for safe Republican seats. Another 51 are expected to be in tightly contested races. In Washington, I'm Nathan Hager, Bloomberg Radio. A Wisconsin judge is prohibiting voters from canceling their original absentee ballot and casting a new one. It's a win for a conservative group that said the practice known as ballot spoiling is illegal. Ballot spoiling became an issue in Wisconsin after several candidates dropped out, but their names were still on the ballot. Elections officials told voters who'd cast an absentee ballot for one of them, they could spoil it and vote for someone else. Global news, 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg, quick take, powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. All right, Nancy. Thank you so much. Nancy Lyons, in our 991 Newsroom in Washington, DC, we've got great story coming up with our max African, Bloomberg Business Week. It's the cover story. I'm looking forward to this one. Well, it's all about self-driving and the universe and the reality. I'm going to do deep tea. I got a nice little anecdote for a little later. Oh, you're going to do it now? You're going to go zoo land. Are you going to go zoo land around me? No, I don't know what that means. Although I love zoo lander. What a freak gasoline fight accident. Stay tuned. So go ahead, go where you want to go. Well, look, years ago, about a decade ago, I was talking to somebody who worked at Google. And I said, when are we going to see these driverless cars? And he said, I think I can't remember who's Larry Page or Sergey Brand. I think it was Larry. He said, you know, no, no. He said, Larry talks about, or Sergey, forget who it was. Talks about how we don't know exactly when it's going to happen, but you can count the number of years on one hand. Yeah, well, it hasn't happened. Hey, here we are. I've counted on two hands at this point. And we are still not to that driverless future. Well, you know, what's interesting is, I don't know about your car, but I know most cars have more and more safety features. And those safety features, especially if you go into cruise control or... Yeah, adaptive cruise technology, adaptive braking, and cruise control. Essentially, if I'm on a highway, it's driving itself. And when I take my hands off the wheel, it drives itself. Nope, it does. It drives... But it tells you when your hands are off the wheel. Yeah, it's like, hey, idiot, like put your hands on the wheel. I'm always getting yelled at by my daughter and my husband. He's like, put your hands on the wheel. I'm like, I just want to test it. Have you ever been in a situation where you're driving, or it's, you know, raining really hard, or you're driving right into the sun, and that adaptive cruise control technology actually turns off. A warning comes on and says, we cannot do this at this time. That has not happened. It's happened to me twice once in the rain. Did your heart skip a beat? No, it just, you know, they give a fair warning, and it's like, and it makes sense, because it's using essentially sensors that get obfuscated by, you know, heavy windshield wiper user, heavy rain, and sun. This is why it's the cover story that you could visit. We're just going to throw another story, because there is one on the Bloomberg by Jackie Davilo's Uber, inking a deal with motionally to offer driverless deliveries and rides. So we're kindling really its vision of self-driving taxi fleet nearly two years after it sold its autonomous vehicle to the vision. Hence the love it, hate it, love it, hate it. More to moment.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,261,2022-10-06 18:45:54

I'm Charlie Peloton, that is a Bloomberg business flash. All right, Charlie. Thank you so much for the new Asia Bloomberg business. We get us out this week's cover story is in the magazine's features section. It's about what we're supposed to be the future or was supposed to be the future. And instead prominent detractors are getting louder as the losses get bigger by the way, it's also the Bloomberg. Did you take a self driving car here this morning? No, I did not. Have you ever taken a self driving car anywhere? I pretend when I take my hands off the DL. All right, we're not going to talk about that. That's like on the record now. Max Chaffkin wrote the stories, a columnist for Bloomberg Business Week. He's with us right now in the Bloomberg Interactive Brokers studio. We also got with us the editor of the magazine Joel Weber. He's with us in the Bloomberg Interactive Brokers studio. Joel, I joke, but the fact of the matter is, is here we are in 2022. And we were supposed to have self driving cars by now. What happened? Well, $100 billion later, that's the real question. Because there have been some really prominent companies that have gotten into this space and obviously thrown a lot of money at it. But there's not much revenue to actually show for that investment so far. And that's really the thesis that Max hits on here. And now that those losses are getting bigger, the detractors are getting louder. And it really calls into question, what this self driving future might even look like? Or if it will ever come to pass? And I think what Max explores is that there are applications for self driving, but it may not be exactly what we've been pitched, right, Max? Yeah, exactly. If you go back maybe a decade ago to TED and these conferences, you had everyone basically going around, in particular, Google leading the charge, but also lots of automakers, lots of technologists, basically everybody's saying, hey, my kids 10, and they're never going to need a driver's license. And that really became baked almost like conventional wisdom, not just among technologists, but among policymakers, consultants everywhere. And you saw basically about five years ago this amazing explosion of investment, not just Google and Cruz, but smaller companies, basically everyone throwing billions into this field. And a lot of those, a lot of that money's gone nowhere. We've seen a lot of stocks either crash in the case of Aurora, which is one of these kind of bubbly self-driving companies, or in the case of coming like Zooks, which was super hyped, and then it kind of got swallowed up by Amazon. So there's just been a lot of kind of difficulty in the industry. OK, so one of the sources in the story who has become something of a detractor is a name that we haven't really heard from a while. And that's Anthony Levin-Dewski. Who is Anthony Levin-Dewski, and what did he have to tell you? So he is one of the most interesting people in self-driving cars. He was for a really long time, leading the charge. The charge that I was just talking about, talking about how great driverless cars are going to be. He is really the person who created the, to the extent that one person created the Google self-driving car, or even the industry, it was him. And he went through this weird, very controversial journey. He went to Uber, and then got caught up in this massive, multi-billion dollar litigation over alleged trade secrets theft wound up with criminal charges. He played guilty. And then he was parted on the last day of the Trump presidency. And he's kind of come out the other end, obviously, with tons of baggage, very controversial, but sort of saying some things out loud that I think people in the industry were saying quietly for a very long time. And that is, this is not going as well as we wanted it to go. What's incredible about this guy is he's the one who sort of created the first version of autonomous vehicle, right? He, you describe this situation years ago where he took a Toyota Prius.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,263,2022-10-06 18:54:15
12038," He's the one who sort of created the first version of autonomous vehicle, right? You described this situation years ago where he took a Toyota Prius and got it to move across. Was it the Bay Bridge? Yeah, yeah, yeah, and it was for its funny. It was for a reality show. So I mean, in this kind of driverless car world, he was sort of the scrappy entrepreneur, the one who was kind of trying to push it to commercialize. He took, as you said, he created a sort of hack together a Prius drove it across the Brave Bay Bridge and then that basically got swallowed up into Google, became the Google driverless car. But now he's doing something that is, you could argue is sort of, I don't know, less complicated than that when it comes to the application of EVs, essentially using them on an industrial standpoint. And that's right. And this actually, I think, you know, it's a part of the article that's kind of interesting is like, maybe self-driving cars do have a practical purpose. Yeah. But again, it doesn't look like what we've been told about, you know, having a robot taxi pull up outside of your home or driving you to the office or you doing all that and then sending your vehicle off somewhere to like run around and make money for you all day. It actually looks like, well, maybe a mining application, Max. Yeah, yeah. So Levin Dowski's company is doing what they call autonomous college, basically driverless dump trucks. It sounds maybe harder than driverless cars, but you got to remember these are closed sites. These trucks are basically just going back and forth, back and forth. I mean, they very much are, like, it's more like conventional robotics. And I think the one thing that kind of opened my eyes as writing this thing is there's been a lot of hype on driverless cars and the sort of robot taxi narrative that we all thought was going to be worth trillions of dollars cause Kathy Wood to, you know, value Tesla, you know, I don't know, in the many trillions of dollars, that I think there's a lot of questions. But there have been a, there's been huge advances on kind of more day-to-day autonomy. So we're talking about advanced driver assistance, ADAS, which is now like in every new car, it's, you know, dramatically changed the driving experience. It's a big part of Elon Musk's strategy with Tesla. And then we have these autonomous industrial applications, what Anthony Levin-Dowskin's doing with mining. But of course, it's also happening in agriculture, it's happening in lots of industries that really no one's paying attention to. Can we talk about the Derek Zoolanda problem? Yeah, my favorite point. We've been talking about the newsroom. So, yeah, I love that. I'm gonna be referring to. I was like, Tim, come on. Yeah, anyway, he can't, yeah, we'll give it away. If only we could make. So self-driving cars have lots of, I mean, one of the challenges for self-driving cars is there are all these parts of driving that they struggle with. One of which is what the industry calls an unprotected left turn. This is a left turn that's not, you know, not one lane to one lane or not with a left turn signal. And it's kind of funny because- Only could be an Ampy Turner. Any, yeah, yeah, like any normal driver just calls that a left. And it's just like Derek Zoolanda kind of rebranding, not being able to return left is like, I'm not an Ampy Turner. But I think that's one of those jokes you have to be a certain age to- Don't worry, I think three of the four of us say. Yeah, well, I'm in. Yeah. But it's an important, right? No, absolutely. And it's one of these things where, you know, if you listen to the industry, they're saying, hey, they're these edge cases. These things nobody thinks about. And one of these things that they are talking about is an edge case is basically left turns. So, like really, like, there's just a lot of problems that the industry has. And they're just so far away from mastery that I think this discussion we've had where people have been saying, oh, they're 99% the way there. They just need to get that one more percent. It's, I think it's very hard to say with any kind of certainty that that's the ratio. That's the number. OK, I know for research purposes, you spend a lot of time watching YouTube videos of autonomous cars doing things they're not supposed to do. And I'm wondering of all the ones that you got to watch, what was your favorite? So, my favorite is, it's a lead to the story. It's, this happened in San Francisco last year. There's a woman, she lives on a quiet street in San Francisco and just every day for like 50 times a day for several weeks, cars were making you turns in her driveway. And really, it only stopped because like, she called the local news. Local news came, like the problem solvers came and solved her problem. And finally, you know, Waymo tweaked their algorithm. The crazy thing about this is, if you read the story, you'll see, Waymo's response to this is like, yeah, we're just following the local laws. Which I think is true. There's like, in all of these cases, there are...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,264,2022-10-06 18:58:52
12039, laws which i think is true there's like out in all of these cases there are difficulties but it's like if you're having this kind of problem you got a question somethings it's an incredible read check it out it's the cover story max chakkin thank you so much and of course thanks to the editor of Bloomberg Business Week to all Weber check it out the new issue of Bloomberg Business Week it is out this is this is count on the close just 60 minutes left in your training session Caroline heid in Taylor Riggs we join now by our colleagues Caroline Masa Tim Stenevich we welcome to do day in day out TV radio YouTube audiences to dissect what is more of a risk of tone to the day we're off by more than a percentage point now it feels like how yeah bounce it around here and we're just off our lows of the session well off our highs when we actually saw some green on the screen here I've been looking at the home builders in particular because we're actually seeing some gains the group overall earlier in the session up more than 1% still holding on to a 7 tens of 1% gain with us mortgage rates falling for the first time in seven weeks so we're talking about well that 30 year coming down to 6.66 the week before 6.7 that was the highest since 2007 home builder stocks this week you guys up more than 9% and that beats the S&P which is up about 5% to are you see some over performance I'm seeing some under performance and I'm kind of bummed out that Romaine isn't here this afternoon because I know he'd give me a hard time about talking about waste management companies at the top of the hour would he okay well I want to talk about this I feel like they're sort of like a cash in trash cash is trash kind of joking here somewhere,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,265,2022-10-06 19:02:49
12040," management companies at the top of the hour. I think it probably proves. Woody? OK, well, I want to talk about this. I feel like there's sort of like a cash in trash. Cash is trash. Kind of joking here somewhere. But we got waste connections down more than 6.6% Republic services down 5.2%. We got waste management down 4.5%. Well, the price for old corrugated cardboard, OCC, aka recycled fiber, it has dropped so far this month, which is not good for these companies. Deutsche Bank's Kyle White wrote this in a note earlier today, and we're seeing shares down as a result. Fascinating. Meanwhile, we look across to the broader market. I don't know where to go from trash. But at the moment, S&P 500 is more than a percentage point down. So it's trash today. We're off by 38 points. The Dow is coming off by 373 points. So it's off by 1.25. Now it's back trying to fight a little bit harder, but it was still down by 6.10% and the same for the small cap, sort of by 7.10% down almost 12 points on the day you tailor. And really, the change in the last hour has been significant. And now there's only about 90 stocks in the green on a sector level, as you can see. I think that that is, yeah, for the one year. I mean, it's really just energy here that's leading the way everything else on the day, really firmly in the red. We've talked a lot about this in the last few days, real estate and utilities have been firmly to the downside, given the correlation with the rates market. So that sector continuing to be under pressure. Let's talk about some of the individual movers. Compass, this was an interesting story. Yarp about 14%. We would report that VISTA equity partners was exploited to deal to take the firm private. They, of course, for their part are denying that. Constellation brand, some analysts saying that there were lackluster, beer, depletions, and a weakness in that second quarter. That was the beer. You got to start drinking more beer. You got to find people to deplete beer. That's what I was sorry that I came in late. I depleted too much beer last night. Love that. You know, there's like fundamental analysis, earnings reports. And beer, and we bring it all together. Mid-Core-Mick, as well, had quarterly earnings that topped last month's preliminary results. And finally, Pinterest, Caroline, I sort of thought about you when we did this. We did a great conversation within the last few days that linked in Pinterest when you think about the drama within social media and the ad market space. It's actually the bright spot. You continue to see that today. Goldman, upgrading the social networking size, saying that they're looking at some improving user growth and engagement trends, even amidst sort of a slowing macro factor, more trusted. I mean, well, interesting that we're seeing amid all of this risk off sentiment, we've been looking what happens with the oil market. Because it has managed to defy the stronger dollar on the day. We've once again see oil push higher. Maybe that's actually speaking to the softness in the rusty equity market. We worry once again about the inflationary pressure of this. WTI crude heading for its best week in seven months. That caught my eye, Caroline, this chart, for our already audience. Of course, it's still down 30% from its peak. But the fact that it's pouring back over O plus is something to watch. Yeah, you do wonder if it's caught the eye and attention, certainly of Fed officials as well. Because we know that they have come out in full force saying they are on a mission to bring inflation down. We did hear from Neil Cushgari earlier today. He said, we're quite a ways away from pausing in the Fed's campaign of interest rate increases. He held the talk earlier today. And here's what he had to say about keeping on track when it comes to raising rates. We just now need to stay the course. We said we're going to do this. We need to follow through and validate the expectations that we've set in markets. Until I see some evidence that underlying inflation has solidly peaked and there's hopefully headed back down, I'm not ready to declare a pause. I think we're quite a ways away from a pause. OK, of course, that's Neil Cushgari, Minneapolis Fed President. Meanwhile, guess what? More breaking news on Twitter and Musk. We understand that Elon Musk has asked the courts to stay the trial in the Twitter case. He says there's no need for expedited trial in the case because he's asking for a stay in the Delaware court filing. He says, Musk and Twitter could reach a pact by Monday. Now that's coming from the Dow Jones. But Musk is saying Twitter will not take yes for an answer. Hmm. And Ludlow is here for what seems to be still a lot of disagreement between Twitter, between Elon Musk, but slowly but surely a pushing back of any sort of legal issues here. So we'll take a time out for a second. No, it's the media. We'll do that. Let's get to the latest. OK, Elon Musk is asking for a stay of proceedings. We were due to head to trial in October 17th. This was expected. It was only a Monday evening.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,266,2022-10-06 19:07:33
12041," So look, let's get to the latest, okay? Elon Musk is asking for a state of proceedings. We were due to head to trial on October 17th. This was expected. It was only on Monday evening that Musk sent Twitter's team a letter saying he wanted to proceed at $54.20 a share. The original offer price that they signed in April, April 25th, the contention of the last 24 hours appears to be this stipulation Musk put into that letter that it was contingent on the debt portion of the financing package coming through. Both teams, as we know, have been talking about it. And we've said, according to our sources, if they could get over that debt hurdle and the legal proceedings were stayed and we're not heading for trial on October 17th, then this deal could wrap up very quickly. Why? Section 2.2 of the original April 25th agreement, the closing conditions many of them have been met. And that's where we stand at this moment in time. All right, there's lots of things going on. We constantly see headlines that, but bottom line from a legal basis, I mean, this deal, Twitter has a much more stronger legal case to do this deal than Elon does to not. Yeah, look, I think the risk that the market faced right now and that we face in reporting this in real time is that there is mixed reporting out there, right? There were also headlines crossing the terminal just a few minutes ago that Twitter offered Elon Musk a lower price point, an offer of the company at a lower valuation, but according to Alex Spiro Musk's lawyer, he rejected that offer because the conditions that Twitter had put in place and we do not yet know the full extent of those conditions were described by Alex Spiro Musk's lawyer as self-serving. And for that reason, Musk turned down the opportunity to buy Twitter at a lower price point. It's a negotiation, right? It's been messy, but what we know as of this moment, as I sit here talking to you guys, is it looks like we're not heading to trial on October 17th, and there are two sides here trying to negotiate a pretty significant piece of M&A. Yeah, and the lawyers are all keeping pretty busy on all of this. Ed Luddlow, you're also keeping busy on it and keeping track of all these headlines for us. Of course, our Bloomberg West Coast correspondent, Ed Luddlow. And here we go guys, we know that Twitter, this must Twitter resolution, said to be stuck on the debt contingency issue, but it also you have Elon Musk and his team of lawyers asking for a stay and maybe looking for some delays here. It's never ending saga. So two is the sell-off at the moment at least, we're off by 1.1%. We are seeing Twitter down, we're seeing broader market shifts, it's really tailoroni energy that holds us high. Indeed, even as yields continue to be on the move, you're now up 8, 9, 10 basis points really here across the curve, a wild day in both equity and bond markets, and that narrative doesn't change. Yeah, there's also another headline cross. The Elon Musk filing says the deal could close on or around October 28th, so maybe mark your calendar. Right now shares of Twitter down about 1.6%. All right guys, that's a wrap. We'll be back in less than an hour's time, our cross platform coverage. On radio TV and YouTube, we will certainly count you down to the close on this Thursday. Alex Spiro said that Musk refused the lower offer because of conditions. That's Musk's lawyer saying that Twitter offered billions off of sale price. We should note that Dow Jones is also reporting that Elon Musk's deposition delayed until Monday. Musk has asked the court to stay trial in the Twitter case, and Musk says, quote, no need for expedited trial in the Twitter case. Musk Twitter could reach a pact by Monday. Dow Jones also reporting. Yeah, so interesting. And then of course, earlier, we had the Bloomberg exclusive about the talks between Elon Musk and Twitter to reach a resolution on the deal, but that they were stuck in part over Musk's statement that the offer is now contingent on receiving $13 billion in debt financing. So again, a lot of this has come out of that filing that Elon did earlier this week with the SEC. But it is interesting. We just heard from our own Bloomberg legal team that man, Twitter, you know, there's no reason why this deal shouldn't get done. Yeah, let's get to world and national news. We'll have more on this later in the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,267,2022-10-06 19:11:38
12042," But it is interesting we just heard from our own up the work legal team that man Twitter, you know, there's no reason why this deal shouldn't get done. Yeah, let's get to world and national news. We'll have more on this later in the afternoon. We got Nancy Lyons, Santa Fe and DC. Hey, Nets. Thanks, Tim Russia is changing its messaging on Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine with its troops losing ground almost daily that Kremlin has told some of its state media to start admitting some of the failings of the war worried that the upbeat propaganda was fueling public doubts. Meanwhile in Ukraine, Russia is accused of targeting civilians again this time firing at least seven rockets into the city of Zaporizha, just 32 miles from Europe's largest nuclear plant. University College London professor Julie Norman says she does not expect Russia to ease up on these brutal tactics. There will be a public record of this that my sense is that there probably will be some kinds of attempts for litigation after the war on some of these human rights issues. But the focus for most of these international institutions, if you will right now, is on the broader conflict and trying to put Ukraine in the best position to close this in a way that's advantageous to them. Again, Julie Norman at University College London. President Biden is pardoning everyone convicted of simple marijuana possession under federal law. And he's also urging governors to follow suit concerning state charges. While the sheriff of Merced County in Northern California says a baby girl and three other family members who were kidnapped and gunpoint earlier this week have been found dead in an orchard. I'm just living inside because this was completely totally senseless. We have a whole family life down. And for what, we don't know yet. So we are working on it. We're trying to get those answers. That's Sheriff Vern Warnke. Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quick Take. I'm Nancy Lyons. All right, Nancy. Thank you so much. Thanks for continuing to of course monitor the Twitter story, the latest from Elon Musk. We mentioned Elon Musk saying in a filing that the deal could close on around October 28th, but it looks like also the Musk lawyers saying that Twitter offered billions of off the transaction price and that Musk refused the lower offer because of conditions. Right now Twitter shares down about 1.3 percent. They're off their lows of the day. You remember $54.20 is the price. That would be a $44 billion market cap. We're going to be able to realize you mentioned to about a $4 shy of that when it comes to Twitter share price. In the meantime, among the most read on the Bloomberg terminal is a story about Google contractors. They're alleging that they were fired for union ties. Union files complaints with the National Labor Relations Board and labor groups have sought inroads when it comes to big tech companies. We're not just seeing that this at big tech companies, but tick Starbucks for example right now seeing a big union out of the country. It's interesting right after years of union membership declining, we are seeing so much really since the 1980s. Yeah, for a long time several decades right. So the alphabet workers union they represent full-time employees and contractors across Google's parent company claims that two workers at a Google data center and Council Bluffs Iowa were terminated for discussing their working conditions and because of their affiliation with the labor organization according to documents viewed by Bloomberg. Another worker at the site faced retaliation for having a role in the union that's according to the complaint which was filed on Wednesday against Google and Modus. It's an information tech firm that serves as a subcontractor for Google. You know we talked about so many big macro trends that are out there so it hinted to Google Amazon.com and Apple have faced labor campaigns and recent amounts with mixed results. So that's in the big tech universe what you've talked about Starbucks as well. Yeah, claims filed with the NLRB are investigated by regional officials. If they find married in the allegations and can't secure a settlement, the issue is complaint on behalf of the Labor Board's General Counsel which is considered an agency judge. Those judges' rulings can be appealed to the NLRB members in Washington and then to federal court. Back to Starbucks though because this is a big part of the unionization effort. It's interesting because Starbucks is trying to respond to these issues by making Starbucks a better place to work. Many people do argue that it is a good place to work but they say they're not able to do that across the board. Yeah, it's interesting especially in this tight labor market.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,268,2022-10-06 19:15:55

Rapping things up, Levi Strauss reports after the bell live from the first of breaking news desk on Bill Maloney. Okay, thank you very much, Bill Maloney, into here live. Breaking news over your Bloomberg-type squawk SQUA WK on your Charm and Line Charlie out of that is a Bloomberg business flash. All right, Charlie, thank you so much. Well, I gotta say I was reading this story out to our makeup room actually this morning. It's the most right on the Bloomberg. It's also Bloomberg exclusive. It's about the Goldman Sachs lawsuit alleging misconduct by managers at every level and the powerful names that are coming to light after years of being kept secret. Following us right now is Max Abelson, finance reporter for Bloomberg News. He wrote the story along with Shrene out of Rajan. Max, always good to have you join us. He's with us right now in the Bloomberg Interactive Broker Studio. What is this lawsuit? All right, let's go back to the most basic things. So this is a really big deal. This is one of the, if not the biggest, class action gender discrimination lawsuits on Wall Street. And to remind you, Carol, you and I spoke about this, honestly, like six years ago now. That's so, yeah. A long time ago because this has been a long time coming. A woman in Christina Shunoster sued Goldman Sachs years and years ago. She won the right for it to be a class action and a few weeks ago, there was a new filing in the case. And it's actually, you know, even to call it new, it kind of comes with an asterisk because this was actually an older filing from 2014 that stayed redacted for years and years. And what was inside of it? We learned a few weeks ago. And on the one hand, it had some really egregious allegations. We're talking things like assault, people have proposition in each other at work, a sex state. And these are all allegations now from years and years ago that were internal allegations at Golden that came, that were released first into 2014 filing, but were redacted and now the public learns about it. What Shredor and I wrote about in our story that came out today is something else. What we wrote about, there was a boss's comment to a secretary. There was another executive who allegedly checked out a woman at work. What's interesting though and the reason we wrote this story isn't necessarily the what, it's the who. And that's because the men who allegedly did these things are really, really powerful people on Wall Street. Which I would say speaks to, I think, a larger story about, you know, protecting an institution or protecting people that are really important to the company's functioning. So expand on that if you will. The way that Shred and I talk with each other and with our wonderful editor David Sheer, who's in New York, normally in Seattle, I got to hang out with him in person. The way we talked about it amongst ourselves with our editor Caroline is that a good way of thinking about it and this is how we think about it, that's listeners out there. It's a fight wrapped up in a fight. It's a battle over transparency inside of a fight for equality. And what I mean by that is you can think about a class action lawsuit over discrimination. That's the big fight. That's the photo of her equality. But then inside of that, Goldman Sachs and the plaintiffs have been battling for a pretty intense battle over the last few months over secrecy versus transparency. Is it fair to name these names? Is it not fair? You know, what Goldman Sachs would say and they said it to us in a statement is that, look, the court rejected the attempts by plaintiffs to publicly identify these two executives. And what they would say is, we're disappointed that Bloomberg is choosing to do it. Because let me tell you, Carol, we didn't name these names. The names, according to people familiar with the matter, one of them is a gentleman named Tucker York. It was a very important person currently inside Goldman. And the other one, according to one of those people, Gary Collin, a name you'd know because he was the president of the firm and then he left for the White House. Goldman Sachs brought in this out for us and talked about this industry wide here and what it highlights about the industry. A few months ago, we had a woman come on our program, Jamie Furei Higgins, wrote a book, all about what happened, what she says.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,270,2022-10-06 19:24:42
12045," A few months ago, we had a woman come on our program, Jamie Fuere Higgins, she wrote a book, all about what happened, what she says happened to her at Goldman Sachs. She was a managing director there. And I know you've written about this memoir as well. But we asked her to about big picture stuff because it's not just specific according to her to one place. No. In some ways, it's really not a Goldman Sachs story. And in some ways, that's really not even a Wall Street story. It's a story about corporate America, which includes, by the way, the media and every institution that's large and big. And I think it's fair to say as a generalization that big corporations in America have a really embraced a certain form of silence when it comes to accusations. And you see it in arbitration, which is, of course, that kind of parallel system to, that means not using judicial courts, but having a corporate system of justice. And that keeps things quiet. Meaning oftentimes, employees have to sign agreements when they start working there that they can't take them to court. We resolve this in arbitration instead. And nobody hears about it. Carol, that's it. But it's also even bigger than that. Things I'm thinking of, non-disclosure agreements. It's a question of when either bad things happen, or even there are just accusations of bad things, who gets to hear about it. And I think our story is worth reading because it's a peak into what it looks like when powerful people are accused of misconduct. And I want to remind listeners, like, we're not talking about misconduct from last week or two. These are allegations of things that happened years and years ago. In some cases, a couple of decades. And the reason is, it takes a really long time to fight a case like this. And I do think about, because you know, York, part of Goldman's top decision-making body. I mean, these were very high-level individuals. And it just, whether I'm not pointing fingers, but whether a company is like, well, wait, this individual, how important they are to the firm in terms of the top and bottom line, ultimately, and then against allegations. It's a real, it's a profound debate. The question is, what happens if you're inside Goldman Sachs or you're inside the finance industry or you're inside a big American corporation? And you complain about someone with power. If you have less power and you complain about someone with power who has allegedly misbehaved, what happens? And who will find out about it? I think it's fair to say that writ large, over the last few decades, secrecy and quietness and confidentiality have been emphasized. And that we're now in an era when that's really being questioned in new ways. Yeah, and I feel like over the past few years, we realize how much has been covered and kept secret. And coming to light has really helped us all become enlightened. Max, Abel, send you amazing. Check this story out.

Syria's XM, Channel 119 and around the globe, the Bloomberg Business app and Bloomberg Radio dot com. This is Bloomberg Business Week. All right, everybody. You are listening and watching Bloomberg Business Week on this Thursday. I like to call it Friday. Zee. If I like to call it monthly jobs report. Yeah, we got a lot of economic data to come not between now and when you have pizza night at home because we got the jobs report tomorrow and in just a couple of minutes we got read picker joining us because there's a great story on the Bloomberg terminal about how good or bad the Fed is when it comes to forecasting joblessness around downturns. It's not easy. It's not easy and these you know, these are pretty smart folks. Yeah, all right. First up back to the markets and the trade here is Charlie Bell. I thank you very much and here's what's going on. We've got read on the screen the Dow the S and P Nez stack all declining 28 minutes to go ahead of the close. But first Elon Musk has asked a Delaware judge to pause further action in Twitter's lawsuit against him saying the social media company will not take yes for an answer after he revived his $44 billion bid Twitter shares. They're down now by 2.7%. Tesla shares lower as well. They're down now by four tenths of 1% equity markets lower across the board stocks. Finding little encouragement to sustain any rebound on the eve of that all important jobs report tomorrow morning 8 30 a.m. Wall Street time. So here's where we stand the S and P 500 index is down now by 29 points of decline of 7 tenths of 1%. The Dow back below 30,000 down 285 points down 9 tenths of 1% the Dow at 29,986. Nez stack is down 43. A drop there of 4 tenths of 1%. 10 year 3.81% 2 year yield 4.23% spot goal down $1.70 the ounce to 17 14 West Texas. In the media crude up 1.2% 88 82 a barrel. Kim Farrest is chief investment officer at bouquet capital partners and she has got this advice for investors. I'm dollar cost averaging right out by either a third or a half of a position right now for new accounts. And I think it's paying off well and on days like the last couple of days when things are up. I just kind of sit on my hands and don't do anything and see where things shake out. So I do think we're going to be on this crazy roller coaster ride of markets and at individual stock levels at least we can pick up some good deals along the way. And again recapping S and P down 30 a drop of 8 tenths of 1%. I'm Charlie out of that is a Bloomberg business flash. All right Charlie thank you so much we've got another one of the most red stories on the Bloomberg today. It's about how the US Central Bank of course we're talking about the US Federal Reserve has a poor record when it comes to forecasting joblessness around downturns. It isn't easy. It's not easy but it's not a great record as Reid Pickard and Craig Torres right fed officials have failed to correctly predict how high joblessness would increase during or in the week wake up almost every recession over the past 50 years. Reid Pickard is US economy reporter for Bloomberg News. She's in our 991 studio in Washington DC. Follow her on Twitter at Reid PREAD PREAD. Reid good to have you with us this afternoon. So why is this so difficult for the Fed to do as I said these are some smart cookies we got there. Yeah it's it's good to be here and you know it's important to think about so when we were deciding to write this story how it came to be is because Craig and I were looking at their forecast and the thing that stuck out to us was. You know not necessarily that unemployment was going to increase to 4.4% next year it was the fact that it was going to stay there and recessions more generally are very difficult to predict and. And part of that is stems from this dynamic that you see in the unemployment rate so usually when the unemployment rate starts going up it keeps going up and the Fed has it sticking there in these in these forecasts. And the reason for that dynamic usually and what you've seen in past recessions and and why in the case that the Fed has undershot a lot of where the unemployment rate has ultimately gone. Is you get this dynamic where there's some layoffs and then you know you see your neighbor get laid off and so you pull back on your spending and then when you pull back on your spending then suddenly there's less business at all.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,273,2022-10-06 19:37:36
12048," and you see your neighbor get laid off. And so you pull back on your spending. And then when you pull back on your spending, then suddenly there's less business at all of these other businesses. And they start laying off people. And that leads to more people out of work and more people pulling back on their spending. And so it becomes this feedback loop that's really hard to stop once it gets going. Which is why you tend to see that dynamic of it keeps going past where the Fed expects. And where a lot of people expect during recessions. I got to say, this plays into something we were talking about with our Mike McKee earlier, who follows international economics and policy, of course. But I said, OK, we know how high inflation is, how quickly does it come down on the other side? And this whole of this feedback loop, like I do wonder, like you say, that once these numbers start to be negative, people see it. And the sentiment just starts to impact a broader swath if you will, and that those numbers start to accelerate. And that's kind of what you're saying, right? That's exactly what I'm saying on the unemployment front. It'll be interesting to see what happens on the price front because businesses tend to be a little more likely, I guess, maybe to lay someone off than they are to slash prices out of nowhere. So you tend to see a bit quicker of response in terms of the labor component of the costs that a lot of businesses have. But the Fed has really showed and said over and over again that they're dedicated to tamping down inflation. And that will likely be a painful experience for Americans. And so a lot of that is likely to come through job losses. But that's not to say that it has to be that way. And there's still, as Fed officials will say, there's still a potential path. It's just getting nearer. What about this whole idea, though, read that it's been hard for companies to find workers, right? That is another story that we continue to say over and over again. So might they be a little less reluctant to let somebody go at this point? Only because they're so afraid they're not going to be able to get that worker when they need them. Absolutely. So economists typically think of that as something called labor hoarding. And it's exactly that. These businesses that for the last two years have worked so hard to not only attract workers, but retain them. And have paid a lot to do so in terms of wage increases that if they see a potential downturn as being shallow or not very long, that they're going to hold onto those workers, especially given the fact that a lot of businesses are still operating at understaffed levels. So that is actually one of the main arguments that's put forward in terms of why you might see a cap on unemployment, why even though these Federal Reserve forecasts look a little odd, it's one of the main arguments for why you could actually see unemployment move up some, but not run away as it has in past downturns. So what do you hear from not necessarily Fed officials read, but close watchers of the American economy, people who've studied this in the past as far as actually being able to pull off and care, don't get mad when I say this, a soft landing. That is the idea of raising interest rates without causing massive unemployment, just in the last 30 seconds that we have. Yeah. So it's actually really interesting because among a lot of the banks, you're really split. So it's a lot of folks see that a session is kind of the only way to get prices under control in terms of the rate that the Fed is hiking. But the argument more generally for this potential soft landing, I think really kind of came to bear earlier this week when we saw job openings, which have been, at historically high levels, we saw them drop by over a million in a month. And so the idea, theoretically, you might be able to get there if you see job openings fall enough that you start to see those wage pressures really abate, and you might be able to do it without a lot of job losses. And yeah, we'll get some more info on that tomorrow too with, of course, the monthly jobs report. Read Picker, US economy reporter for Bloomberg News and our 99 at one studio in DC. Let's stay in our 99 at one studio and get over to world and national news. For that, we go to Nancy Liet. Thanks, Tenants.

12049," Nancy Liet, Tina S. Thanks, Tim. Those convicted of simple possession of marijuana are being pardoned by President Biden. The President's action applies to everyone who's had a conviction on that charge at the federal level, Biden wants governors to take the same action at the state level. President Biden is praising IBM for taking advantage of new laws that subsidize production of computer chips and other crucial technologies. Today, he visited an IBM plant in Pekipsi, New York. The President said companies that benefit from the increase in federal research and development spending would be required to make the resulting products in this country. Listen to the leaders of IBM and across the country. They're making decisions right now about where to invest and produce these chips. They're choosing America. The supply chain is going to start here and end here in the United States. The President went on to Red Banking, Jersey, and New York City to attend Democratic Party events. Washington, earth, Chapman, Bloomberg, radio. President Biden earlier today admitted he is disappointed. OPEC PLAST plans to slash oil production. Amos Huckstein, the President's special envoy for energy security, says they're now focusing on production at home. We have had conversations with the leadership of almost every major oil producer in the United States. Told them, what do you need to be incentivized to increase production? Amos Huckstein speaking with Bloomberg. Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quick Take. I'm Nancy Lines. All right, Nancy. Thank you so much. Carol Maser along with Tim Stenevich. We're live in our Bloomberg Interactive Broker Studio. We're streaming on YouTube and of course live on Bloomberg Radio. This story popped up among our most red on the Bloomberg. There's a lot of tweets about it too, Carol. You have. Oh, yeah. This is all over Twitter. What are they saying? Well, they've been talking about this for months on Fin Twit. Fin Twit is like financial Twitter. The anti-Jim Kramer ETF. Yeah, because they sort of use what he says as an indicator of sorts. He is widely followed and a lot of people watch his show. Yeah. But at the same time, people like to point out calls that he gets wrong and stock movements in the opposite direction. So, Anthony T.F. that follows what he says. Well, there's one I think he wants Kathy Wood, right? Exactly. From the same company. An easier way to bet against finance personality, Jim Kramer. It is in the works. Tuddle capital management. They previously launched an exchange-traded fund betting against Kathy Woodstock picks. Plan to debut the inverse Kramer ETF with the ticker SJM, SJM, according to a following with the SEC yesterday. If approved, the fund would provide investment results that are approximately the opposite of Kramer's investment recommendations. To be fair, I've seen, I don't know if his barons used to sometimes do a story like on his choices and how you would have done and a lot of times it's not so good. And that's why people say, wait a second. Maybe they can make money betting the other way. And obviously, Tuddle capital management sees an opportunity there to launch an ETF with this. And I'm telling you, when this stuff happens, and we talked about the sort of the anti-Kathy Wood inverse arc one as well. We've talked about that in the past. It gets a lot of attention. And to be fair, our team also reached out to him and Jim Kramer not immediately respond to a request for some comment. It's interesting. And for those who do have faith in Kramer, Tuddle is also planning a long Kramer ETF or LGIM to bet on investments that Kramer endorses. No fees disclosed for the two funds, but the anti-arc. Yeah, a short arc, right? Yeah, expense ratio of 0.75%. Interesting read. Check it out. You can find out more. I'm Bloomberg, and also, apparently on social media.

12051," Bloomberg Business Flash. The following is an editorial from Bloomberg Opinion. This editorial was written by the Bloomberg Editorial Board. In the days since Vladimir Putin ordered Russia's largest mobilization since World War II, hundreds of thousands of Russians have fled the country. They are threatening about the consequences, but while frontline nations are understandably reluctant to absorb new waves of Russian exiles, closing the doors to them will only strengthen Putin. In contrast, allowing them in would help drain Putin's war machine, which is already struggling with mounting casualties. The plight of Russian seeking to avoid the battlefield, pales in comparison to the suffering Putin has inflicted on the people of Ukraine, yet giving more Russians a way out would erode Putin's ability to prosecute his assault. The West should make the most of it. This editorial was written by the Bloomberg Editorial Board. For more Bloomberg Opinion, please go to bloomberg.com slash Opinion or OPINGO on the Bloomberg Terminal. This has been Bloomberg Opinion. I'm ready in my call, I'll turn on the radio. How about you let me drive? Oh no, no, no, no. Honey, please, I'll do the drive. Drive-o. Excuse me, I want to drive. It's the question of the drive-o. This is the drive to the close. We're going to drive to the Bloomberg Radio. All right everybody, just about nine and a half minutes left in today's trading session. We have been bouncing around, but we are well, well off our best levels of the session. In fact, hovering just off our lows of the session. So let's get to it with our drive to the close guest. We got Jessica Beamer joining us. She's portfolio manager at Easterly Investment Partners. Jessica joining us this afternoon on the phone from Pennsylvania. Jessica, good to have you with us. How are you? We're doing pretty well trying to figure out what earnings season is going to look like and hoping that you can shed a little light on that. Before we do get there though, we get those jobs numbers tomorrow. Help us understand, you know, how to make sense of the economic data. We've been getting this week and Fed officials banging the drum saying, we've got a ways to go when it comes to tamping down inflation. Yeah, I think it's a great question. And I think we're still in the stages where we're collecting data and trying to see some early signs of the Fed impact. I think when we're looking at the data this week, whether it's what we've already seen or what we expect to see tomorrow, I think we all have to understand that we're only going to get early hints of the Fed's full impact. A lot of the efforts that they've put out there are obviously huge increases in the interest rate, but that takes time to work its way through the economy and certainly on the jobs numbers that we're going to see. So, you know, we expect to see some continued improvements in, or improvements increases in wage, but at the same time, I'm not sure if we can really take that data and read into in terms of what the Fed is going to do, because we know that the Fed is looking out at the long term and they, you know, it takes a few months for their efforts to end up in these numbers. All right, so Jessica, we know the S&P 500 before this week's two-day rally pushed it higher. It was very oversold if you look at some of the technicals like an RSI, relative strength index. So, we bounced off that level, but now we're trending lower again. How do you think about the bottom for equities? Yeah, I think that's really the ultimate question here. And, you know, the last few weeks or the last five weeks have been really interesting. You know, there's kind of three things I would point out. First, you know, investors have begun to acknowledge that the sell-off we've seen so far this year is not temporary. I think there was a narrative earlier this year that we needed a quick valuation correction and that the S&P would kind of rebalance and move on. Clearly with the S&P down 25% through the first three quarters of 2022, all of that decline related to PE multiple compression, you know, investors I think are starting to realize that it's going to be a down year. And that perhaps is driving some tax-offs selling or just some capitulation. And I think honestly there's an F&P.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,277,2022-10-06 19:54:55
12052," Now, investors, I think, are starting to realize that this is going to be a down year. And that perhaps is driving some tax-awks selling or just some capitulation. And I think, honestly, there's an effort to really diversify portfolios. It's about time. Because growth is still pretty much in line with its long-term average in terms of PE. And value stocks are a lot cheaper. So I think there's still this kind of emotional reaction to having a down year. Secondly, interest rates have really been a dominant story since mid-August. And it's created some panic and equity markets is around housing, M&A financing, rolling debt. I think people are really worried about how those rates are going to affect individual companies. So that has been an issue. I think we've seen some moderation in the last few days. I don't really want to say we're done worrying about interest rates. But that's going to be a dominant issue. And then thirdly, companies have started to preview their earnings reports for third quarter and provide guidance for the fourth quarter. And I think that's going to have a pretty significant impact on what the bottom looks like for the FMP. I'm actually really excited to hear from companies because they are able to really give us, obviously, some perhaps short-term negatives, but long-term guidance on how they plan to react to the current environment. That tends to be a good thing for stocks. And I think a lot of companies that have reported so far, even bad news, people are able to process that and put it into their models and then move on. So I think next week, as we move into earnings, we'll start to hear more about 2023 and long-term plans. And I think that's ultimately going to help stocks in the long run. But if it doesn't help stocks in the long run, it only helps stocks if we hear optimistic news about what 2023 looks like. Well, what if we have CEO say, OK, does it look good? But that's the worst of it. It's kind of like what Gina Martin Adam said about the Bloomberg Intelligence Analysis of earnings transcripts that she saw in the first quarter. They mentioned inflation more than in the second quarter. Right. I would say that uncertainties, probably, the worst thing for stocks. And so even if it's bad news, I think people are able to at least say, OK, this is the information. Here's some concrete numbers that I can put into a model. I understand where the management team plans to go over the next 12 months. And they can understand the strategy's going forward. I think it's much harder when we don't have any information and we just sit here worrying about it. So I would be, if there's a management team listening, I would say please be as specific as possible about your plans for your individual company. I think any effort by management teams to put off concrete guidance is going to be problematic. Yeah, don't tell me you don't have any visibility because then I'm running for the hills. Hey, listen, in the meantime, Jessica, are there or what do you see as the best opportunity for investors who do have some money that they want to put to work right now? Is it cash? Is it, or cash like, or is it something? I mean, we've heard a lot about this week. Yeah, yeah. A lot of people are going back into cash. And I understand that is a nice safe place to be most of the time. But I would say that from our perspective, there are still places within the market that offer outside opportunities. Financials are still a pretty well-positioned to benefit from rising rates. And historically, financials have been a safe haven in these types of markets where inflation is rising and people are worried about the economy. And it is hard to imagine financials as a safe haven because there are a lot of components of those businesses that are very GDP-sensitive. But I don't think investors truly appreciate the power of increasing rates and increasing net interest income and the amount of financial of the operating leverage that we can see at those banks as rates go up. We had a taste of it last quarter. We'll see a lot more of it this quarter. The other area we're still really bullish on is energy. It's benefiting from increased commodity prices, strong free cash flow, increased- It's the only major industry group in the S&P 500, there are 11 that is up this year and it is up 50%. We understand why, but you would still find opportunity. I think we are. And I think it comes from the fact that it's still a pretty under-owned part of the market. And you know.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,278,2022-10-06 19:59:21
12053, why but you would still find opportunity i think i think we are and you know i think it comes from the fact that it's still pretty under one part of the market and uh... you know i think our long-term view is that this that energy is still going to be in a central part of our economy uh... whether it's renewable energy or oil and gas i think these are all very important parts of our economy and and it's just simply under owned you know i know a lot of that has been focused on health care and that has been widely discussed as a safe haven i think that trade getting a little bit crowded and there are plenty of places within health care that are still you know great investments jesse bimmer portfolio manager of easterly investment partners on the phone from pennsylvania uh... let's get over to our tv team for our cross-platform coverage of beyond the bill it's starting right now on bloomberg beyond the bill bloomberg's comprehensive cross-platform coverage of the u.s. market closed starage right now and we are about two minutes away from the end of the trading day carline high tailorigs counting down to the closing bell it'll take us beyond that bell it's a global sign will cast it is carol master and it's timmest and evict and it is tv radio and youtube audiences that we look at a market that really couldn't get above itself when we're looking at a nil kashkari looking at a federal reserve once again talking about a focus on inflation we had south in terms of equities yet you get that feeling carolina people just ahead of the jobs report you wonder is it just going to provide more fuel to that fed conversation that hay folks were going to continue raising rates we've got to bring inflation down and so maybe we're seeing that template in the equity trade but is it any different than anything we've heard from fed officials since jackson hole or even before jackson hole no no okay we was a rhetorical question from the other we had a fun chat with mike mcke earlier today and he i won't use the word exasperated yeah but he's tired he but he's like guys you know which we're doing you're still pit well we heard from master cook today saying yes it is unacceptable the high inflationary environment yes restoring price ability requires ongoing rate hikes yes the focus is bringing inflation back down to two percent and the bond market gets it the bond market gets it the yields been pushing high finally but it was interesting we had that some plummet in the yields story earlier this week that almost is what gave the reprieve to the stock market really we really heard that you guys are for a no for a radio audience from Jonathan gollab over credits we saying that the equity markets do indeed get a reprieve from at least those bond yields falling even though it's temporary today no reprieve if you're long the s and p you're down by 40 points that's look at as the markets ring and it's look at mondalees trying to celebrate let there's the giant orio there's your milk a cow and they ring the bell after ten years having spun out of craft foods which just had the CEO on of mondalees of course but overall we're looking in a lesson p that is off by 39 points more than a percentage point lower we're looking at a nasdaq that's off by 75 points more than 7 tenths of almost 7 tenths of percent lower and a dau that's off by more than a percentage point let's do broad broad broadening it out let's look at the small caps because the rustle 2000 also having a tough time of it but actually you're out performer it's only about six tenths of percent cow yeah all I can think about as orios and similk right now all right orios are vegan carol you can eat that we have I mean they're healthy I know I'm going we're going off the rails here but we do have new four packs of orios here for snacks I just got one to who needs four when you can have a hundred or well anyway the s and p 500 most names in the index that we're going to dig a little bit deeper about four hundred and fifteen lower today tail or 88 actually higher but you saw that negative cent building as those equity averages move to just off their lows of the session you know carol I'm too short for this but if I blocked out this that says one day and covered that you might think that this chart is year to day take a look at energy it's the only sector again in the green it's up another one point eight percent for the day and that really just has been the incredible story for the years we're continuing to see sort of day two of those opak production cuts and the ramification on this energy market I'll take you down to the bottom as well some of the under performers and that too was sort of another similar theme that we've been talking about in the last few days food and beverage realistic utilities,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,279,2022-10-06 20:03:36
12054," I'll take you down to the bottom as well, some of the under performers. And that too was sort of another similar theme that we've been talking about in the last few days. Food and beverage, realistic utilities, again, as yields are rising. Those are some of the sectors that are traditionally pressured. Carol, those are off about three, three and a half percent. I love that you said energy. We talked with Jessica Beamer over at Easterly Investment and she said that's a play to put new money to and she says it's going to be important in our economy for a long time and she says it's under owned in a lot of portfolios. So that was one of the groups that she liked. All right, to some of the gainers, specific gainers, Costco, up as much as 2.8% today, still holding on to about a half a percentage gain in the trade. It was top of the Nasdaq 100. The September total comp sales from the company, they were beat up 8.5% for an estimate of up to 6.3%. So this company, Alice Pointing Out, getting market shares, consumers increasingly look for value, Peledon, check it out, up 8% at its highs today, finishing the day with a 4% gain, still only about $8, almost $9 stock here, cutting jobs for the fourth time. The company CEO telling staff today that they've moved needed in an effort to save the struggling business, the cut roughly 500 globally are 12%. And then check out cannabis stocks. What, Ohio should say or what's that? You can do that. Yeah, on Ohio, I guess I should say. Shut up. I know, I know, it's really bad. Up about 31% here, this as the Biden administration to order a sweeping review of the drug treatment by law enforcement authorities. So we really did see a boost in many of the names and the ETFs that play in that space, Tim. Yeah, Tilleray up more than 30%. Look at that. And some other ones up too, Carol. You've got the gainers. I got the decliners. I want to start with shares of Tesla today, underperforming the S&P 500, but bouncing around for much of the day, we did have so much Twitter news today, worth checking out what happened with shares of Tesla, where of course a lot of Elon Musk's net worth is tied up. Speaking of Twitter, shares falling more than 3.6% today, Elon Musk asking a Delaware judge to pause further action when it comes to Twitter's lawsuit against him, saying the social media company will not take yes for an answer. And then we did also learn earlier in the day that talks between the two sides have been stuck after Musk said that his offer is now contingent on receiving $13 billion in debt financing. That's according to our reporting here at Bloomberg. And then Generac shares falling down more than 5.6%, or 5.6% exactly. Bank of America downgraded the generator maker to neutral from buy. They say there's greater risk of the company issuing weaker 2023 guidance. Shares are down more than 66% since November highs of last year. It's been a really volatile stock of late. Meanwhile, what's also been volatile is your cross asset space, your FX space in particular. I want to talk about what's happening with King Dollar. We're back up once again in the green up, 7th and 7th of a percent. We're seeing a stronger US dollar because we have those comments coming from Lisa Cook. We have those comments coming from a Neil Cash Currie who are saying that we are still so focused on inflation. We are not pivoting. We never see weakness across the board. Interestingly, you see weakness in the Norwegian Crown when oil has been managing to fight off a stronger dollar. Interestingly, you see the loony, the Canadian dollar, also weakening. That's off by 9th, 10th of a percent. Now, this is more to do. Interestingly, it's also weakening as we see a very hawkish, well, more hawkish than anticipated, bank of Canada. Once again, speaking up about its determination to tackle inflation. And that sort of perhaps gave some impetus to why we think the hawkish nature from the Fed is going to stick the pound, having a very ugly day as we once again question the fiscal policy coming from that nation. And indeed, the having for all fundamentals of the UK. We're looking at Brent Crude, as I said, pushing higher WTI, 1.5%. $88, $89 a barrel now. Four straight days again's up to OPEC plus says we will be curtailing production. And sovereign bonds just to sell off across the board, Greek yields, Belgium yields, Germany, even pushing up some nine basis points. And as I say, the Canadian yields two years, up 12 basis points as we get that more hawkish tone coming from the bank of Canada. We're getting closer in the US of nine basis points on the front end here. And pretty much up about six to maybe three, as you can see there, further out, longer out on that yield curve. And Carol, for me, as always, when we focus on the front end of the yield curve, it's how sticky that is when you think about all the Fed. Speak we have, and again, that really key labor data that we're going to get tomorrow as well, and how the Fed can or cannot move on the heels of that. Yeah, in a market environment where we saw that, you know, significant two day rally earlier in this week, you do think about that if there is any signs of weakness in that monthly jobs report, if we see in terms of wages, that inflationary pressure component comes down at all.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,280,2022-10-06 20:08:11
12055," Do you think about that if there is any signs of weakness in that monthly jobs report, if we see in terms of wages, that inflationary pressure component comes down at all, it would be very easy to see some kind of rally because it feels like investors are looking for reasons to think that the Fed is going to be less hawkish, just spite all the Fed commentary. So what we get on that printed 830 is really going to set the tone tomorrow to him. Yeah, and actually, again, going back to what Mike McKee told us earlier in the day, if you like the numbers that we got this morning, and he was kind of laughing about it, then you'll love the numbers that we get next Thursday morning when it comes to initial jobless claims because half of Florida essentially wasn't able to work over the last week as a result of the hurricane that devastated many parts of the state. So you look for softness anywhere you can get it, but oftentimes it comes with some sort of asterisk. Well, the asterisk is usually being a Fed speaker who comes out and knocks it back and says, no, we're still focused on inflation. That's why the CPI print next week is going to be also important. And indeed, some of the wage data that we get within the non-farm payrolls, how strong, how sticky we were just having Jonathan Golov over from Credit Suisse saying that there's going to be a stickiness within the inflation area because it's going to be wages, how much the Fed wants to fight that element. Interesting. I always love the Morgan Stanley note that comes out about this time and looking at wages that average hourly earnings rising again about one half of 1% for the month and that year of your rate is again about 5.1%. So Caroline, it sounds like some of these average hourly earnings and some of these wages are proving to be a bit sticky. Interesting. We're going to have Seth Carpenter of Morgan Stanley on a little bit later talking more broadly, the global story here. And I wonder if we'll talk a little bit about oil, about how much that's still such an inflationary pressure point. It was interesting that this wasn't just the US sell off Carol. This was a global market sell off European markets sunk as well. Yeah. I keep thinking about bottom for stocks, right, you know, top and rates and something that we put to Jessica Beamer also about that. And she said, when we start to get earnings, it's going to be so important. What they say about the third quarter and specifically about the fourth quarter outlook will have a significant impact on stocks, whether or not they bottom or not. If there's some optimism and some good transparency in terms of what's to come, then we could see some bottom. If there's a lot of questions and uncertainty, that could be tough on the equity play. All right. We're going to start to hear from banks in the coming weeks. So we're going to get a good idea of the way that they're thinking about the economy. It's always a good barometer for an understanding of what's happening on Main Street. All right. Less than 24 hours away from that jobs report and that's something certainly that will dominate our conversation tomorrow. That is a wrap, guys. We will see you tomorrow, a wrap, our cross-platform coverage on radio TV, YouTube. We call it beyond the bell. We will be here again, same time, same place tomorrow. This is Bloomberg Business Week with Carol Maser and Bloomberg QuickTakes Tim Stenevek on Bloomberg Radio. Listen to you, it is Bloomberg Business Week. What? What are you talking about? Here we are. I can't believe it's already jobless claims. Yeah. Well, also, I should not monthly jobs report at the same time. It happens once a month, you know. I know, but what? I talked about this a couple days ago. November 2nd is when the next Fed meeting happens, which is less than a month away. Just before midterms? Just before midterms. And this is the only jobs report tomorrow that we get from before it. Right. Because the only inflation CPI report we get. Right. Based on the Fed conversations, unless it is a report that shows the job market falling apart, again, we have to watch for nuances as a result of the hurricane and different things, especially in the weekly numbers. And unless inflation comes plummeting down, you know, folks, we got the memo. The Fed is going to keep raising rates. And they'll keep talking about it, too. Yeah, exactly. Let's get to World of National News. Nancy Lyons is standing by in the DC. Hey, Nance. Thanks, Tim. President Biden is touting the recently passed chips act that aims to boost production of computer chips here in the US. He took his message to an IBM facility in Pukipsi, New York that's making a $20 billion investment in quantum computing and semiconductor manufacturing. We need to make these chips here in America to bring down everyday cost and create good paying American jobs. Biden today also announced he is pardoning everyone in jail on federal charges of simple possession of marijuana. He says no one should be in jail for just using or possessing pot. He wants governors to follow suit for those held on state possession charges. Well, more high school students are using e-cigarettes, despite government attempts to crack down on vaping.

12056," wants governors to follow suit for those held on state possession charges. Well more high school students are using e-cigarettes despite government attempts to crack down on vaping. That's according to a new survey published today by the National Youth Tobacco Survey. It found about 14 percent of high schoolers reported using e-cigarettes in the last month. That's up from 13.4 percent last year. Hurricane Ian is poised to be Florida's deadliest storm since 1935. State officials in Florida have confirmed 89 deaths so far. That is slightly more than Hurricane Irma's toll in 2017. But county officials have added dozens more to the total. And the Washington Post reports that puts the unofficial tally at at least 117, which would make Ian deadlier than Hurricane Andrew in 1992. President Biden has warned Ian could be the deadliest hurricane in Florida's history. But Governor Ron DeSantis has said it won't come close to the 1928 hurricane that killed a record 2500 Floridians. In Washington, I'm Nathan Hager, Bloomberg Radio.

And we continue to see some interesting stories when it comes to the tech space and what companies are up to. You know, it's the most wonderful time of the year. It's the most interesting. You have to do it like that, Tim. I'm sorry. You cannot use that line unless you sing it. Come on. Come on. I don't want to get sued if I don't have the rights for it. It's hard for us. Yeah, not going to happen. But it does mean, you know, in the fall, we kind of see it kicked off with Apple, with the new hardware. We saw some Amazon devices recently. Now we're getting the new alphabet, the Google hardware that's coming out now. We got new phones. We got a new watch. And the headline here is that it undercuts Apple when it comes to price. But I would argue Carol, less important than price is ecosystem. Whether you're part of the Android ecosystem or whether you're part of the iOS ecosystem. I'm not. I'm part of the Apple ecosystem. I am the blue bubble when you text, not the green bubble, like Ari or one of our producers who whenever I text him, I have no idea if he's read the message or not. Or if he's gotten it. Why is it that we're just talking about this? He's like, does anybody use an Android phone? Yes, they do. You have a lot of people who use Android phones. I'm like, yes, John, and we ostracize them. I've only changed the same thing to me years ago. No, but I remember so much with Apple phones first came out and it was just like the cool kids, we'd be in a conference room. They'd be like, they put their Apple phone on the table. Like, I've got an Apple phone and you don't. I had some like really lame, you get folded or whatever. Here are a couple of things I'll say. Internationally, it's still many more people are on the Android platform than they are. That's true. In the United States for years, still more people had Android. Right, now we're seeing more with Apple, at least according to recent data that I saw. But it's the power of the ecosystem. Yeah, I agree. I know in our household, I know, forgive me, audience, you've heard this before, but my daughter would be like, yeah, at one point she was looking at either Samsung or something. I don't know. And nothing wrong with it, but we're like, honey, this is an Apple household and you're going to be part of it. As long as we are paying for it. Yeah, you're paying. And you're under our rules. That's really funny. You can have services like WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger that allow for you to do these sort of video calls without using Apple service. Okay. Yeah.

12058," The last couple of months have been a number of headwinds, whether that be inflation, whether that be consumer spending, getting hit based on the stock market, being problematic and customers frankly, just having spent a lot over the past year. So, us as a company, considering where we were in 2020, when the world felt like it was falling apart, we certainly feel fortunate in terms of where we are, but certainly the last couple of months has presented a good number of challenges. That's what I wanted to ask you, Ken, like, how are you? What life was like pre-pandemic, and then as you said, the pandemic was just so tricky for anybody in your space, and then kind of where we are today. Are you back where you were pre-pandemic? Yes, we are. So, we started our direct business early, but we headed into the pandemic, more than 80% wholesale. We planned for good growth for our website every year and planned for wholesale to kind of be flat, and we felt like we were ahead of the curve. And then obviously, COVID was very problematic for our wholesale business, but it really led to tremendous growth for online. So, all in all, considering where things were in 2020, we feel very fortunate. But as I mentioned, certainly, there was such a high in 2021 that companies like us, we felt like, wow, we made it, consumers are spending, everything's great, but then reality has certainly started to hit a little bit over the last couple of months. It's interesting to hear what you see as consumer strengths and weaknesses right now. What about when it comes to actually operating and running your business, talent acquisition, when it comes to finding and retaining employees, having to raise wages? What has that been like? I know that's certainly been an issue. We've been very focused on employee retention. Even before COVID, and I honestly feel like, our efforts there really helped us get through those very difficult years, and certainly we've been blessed. We've had great employee retention, even throughout the great resignation. So we feel very invested in our team, and that has helped. But certainly, we've seen which pressures go up, inflation really sort of crimp margins across the board. Hey, just try and get inside your head. We were just talking about our read picker who follows the Fed in the economy, and this whole like is concept of labor hoarding. In other words, you'd rather, a company would rather hold onto a worker, because it's been so hard to get workers in this tight labor market. So they would rather hold onto it a worker, rather than let them go, even if maybe they're starting to see a company that is, see some weakness out there. Do you buy into that? Do you do that? I do buy into that, but once again, we've been blessed in terms of really having great employee retention throughout all of this. To the degree we have added jobs, it has been more difficult than ever. I'd say that was especially an issue, kind of the first quarter of this year when hiring was just impossible. One benefit of the economy getting softer has been, it has been a little bit easier over the last couple of months as we have continued to add to the team. But certainly, I think issues in terms of, more in terms of employee retention. And really, we feel like this environment is here to stay. And it's really a big focus for us going forward. Can you give us any sort of numbers? How much it's costing you or what percentage you've had to raise wages or just the challenges that you're seeing and how it's affected the bottom line? It's hard to quantify, but in terms of our ability to fill jobs back before COVID compared to what it was towards the end of last year and towards the beginning of this year, we've had job searches that have lasted months and months. And we're fortunately just about full now. But it's a major issue. And so we certainly, in terms of the cost of training, cost of these searches, it's something that's more cognizant in top of mind than it's been in the past. All right, so top of mind, no doubt about it. It has to be what you're doing in less than 40 minutes times. It tells us about what you guys are doing in terms of live streaming. Yeah, absolutely. We're very excited, as I mentioned, or our website has been a tremendous source of strength both before COVID and certainly through it. And we're actually launching live streaming from on natuori.com. We're doing our first one at 5 p.m. today. Live streaming is really the way people shop in many parts of the world, most notably China and throughout Asia. And we're excited to launch it here. So at 5 p.m., you can come to natuori.com. It's going to be a great way for people to see the collection, to shop directly and really interact within our live stream platform. And I think more importantly than ever, you know.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,284,2022-10-06 20:25:23
12059," It's going to be a great way for people to see the collection, to shop directly and really interact within our live stream platform. And I think more importantly than ever, fashion's about making stuff. But really, more than ever these days, customers don't just want stuff. They really want to know who are the people behind this? What does this company represent? So especially as an independent business, as a family business, the ability for us through live streaming to really talk to our customer, for our customer to have that direct interaction and to feel that closer connection to not just owners, but to employees as well. We think it's really going to be a big change in terms of the evolution of mithory.com. Well, speaking of the evolution, I'm wondering how you're thinking about different ways to showcase your products and how you're thinking about the Metaverse and Web3. And if there's anything there for you. Yeah, that has certainly been top of mind as well. We have something I can't share fully. But Metaverse has been a big focus of ours. And we have a partnership. And maybe I'll come back next month when we're able to announce it. Great. But suffice it to say, you guys know, you've been great to have me on. When we've had new collections, we're going to have a new collection coming out that's going to be available. And it's really going to help push us into 3.0. We need new, yeah, I don't know. There's some there there for the nontory company, which is interesting. And it's interesting because as we try to figure things like the Metaverse, like where that goes, like real applications. Hey, just about 20 seconds left. Your mom going to be part of this? Of today. Yes. So she's actually on the live stream. As you guys know, she founded the company, right? She did. She did. So she's going to be the guest. And she's going to be walking everybody through it. So all of her big fans out there, tune in at 5. It's going to be liveonnetory.com, on a pop up and live on Instagram and on Facebook as well. It's how the world is evolving. Did you say that Ken was a reporter here? What? Ken was just talking. He was one of our Bloomberg colleagues going back a few years. 1998 to 2003. Yeah. So a long time ago, I do remember him well. Ken Nontory, president of the Nontory company, joining us via Zoom from New York City, their live stream coming up in about 35 minutes. This is Bloomberg. Supreme campaign plans....

12060," So Bloomberg Business Week. All right, coming up folks, not like your play doesn't full enough with things to worry about. We've got one more to add to it. Are you being played? It sounds like we all are. Yeah, I think even if we don't even know it, that's a title of our next book. You've been played. Well, our next guest book, I should say. Caroline, I'm not writing a book any time soon. I'm not are you? Writing a book any time soon? You got some book ideas. I have a book. I like your book ideas. We're going to be speaking with that Adrian Han, founder and CEO of Sixth to Start, and we'll also be talking about the author of a new book.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,286,2022-10-06 20:34:23
12061," I'm not are you writing a book anytime soon? You got some book ideas? I have a book idea. I like your book ideas. We're going to be speaking with that Adrian Hawn, founder and CEO of Sixth to Start, also the author of a new book. We're going to have him come up in just a minute. First up though, let's go over to Charlie Pellet because we've got lots of earnings. Indeed, and I tell you, it's earning season kicks off next week with a lot of the big banks, but right now we've got AMD Advanced Micro Devices. Down now by about two and a half percent after ours. Preliminary third quarter results fell short of analyst projections, renewing concerns about a sputtering market for PC chips. Also after ours, we heard from Levi Strauss, the denimaker. It has reduced its outlook for the full year, citing economic uncertainty along with supply, chain disruptions and a stronger dollar after ours. We've got Levi Strauss down now by just about 6 percent. A little encouragement today for the US stock market ahead of the jobs report. Major benchmarks finishing solidly lower today. To Dow the S&P and NASDAQ all in the red, S&P down 38 drop now of 1 percent. The Dow down 346 lower today by 1.1 percent. NASDAQ down 75 dropped there of 7.10s of 1 percent. Well as for investor sentiment, Jessica Beamer's portfolio manager at Easterly Investment Partners. She was our guest right here on Bloomberg Business Week. I think we all have to understand that we're only going to get early hint of the Fed's full impact. A lot of the efforts that they've put out there obviously huge increases in the interest rate, but that takes time to work its way through the economy and certainly on the jobs numbers that we're going to see. Sources tell Bloomberg talks between Elon Musk and Twitter to reach a resolution of the $44 billion takeover, our stuck-in-part-over Musk statement that his offer is now contingent on receiving $13 billion in debt financing. Twitter today down by 3.7 percent. I'm Charlie Pallett. That is a Bloomberg Business Flash. All right, Charlie. Thank you so much. So we've got pandemics, climate change, recession, geopolitical tensions, nuclear war, gamification. Yeah. I mean, are we being played and we don't even know it? Sounds like we are. Yeah. We got Adrian Hahn joining us, founder and CEO of Six to Start. The author of You've been played, how corporations, governments and schools use games to control us all. Adrian this afternoon or evening, I should say for him, is joining SVI Zoom from the UK. Adrian, I want to get into your background and what you've been doing when it comes to research and what you've been looking at in just a minute. But first, I just want to understand what it means for us to get played because we don't even know what's happening. Well, gamification has become a huge part of the economy and of lifestyle apps and of workplaces and a lot of times when it's there, we're aware of it. And other times, it's not really something that we have any choice but to put up with. You know, if you drive for Uber or you know, work in the gig economy, then a lot of what you do is going to be managed by gamification. So tell us about how your own personal experiences. You've created games, co-creator of zombies run, you've studied neuroscience at Cambridge and Oxford, but tell us about creating games specifically. How this has kind of maybe given you a different view on this environment or did you always feel this way about gaming? No, I didn't always feel that way. I mean, you know, like everyone, a lot of people who grew up, you know, in the 80s and 90s, I just thought video games were great. You know, they're just fun and didn't see any harm. It was just a, you know, a job that I really wanted to do eventually, although I, you know, started as a neuroscientist, then I kind of secretly actually wanted to make a new game. And for the first few years when I was in the industry, I made a lot of, you know, educational and serious games. So, you know, games are also trying to be fun, but also trying to help teach a lesson or do something a bit different. But, you know, I started making gamification back in about 2011, 2012, the zombies run, which is a game, a smartphone game that tries to make running more interesting and more exciting because when I started trying to run, I just found it really boring and painful and tedious I think it's like a lot of people. So I thought, surely, there's got to be a way to make this a little bit more bearable. And, you know, my hope was a lot of gamification that we would see.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,287,2022-10-06 20:38:19
12062," Well, there's got to be a way to make this a little bit more bearable. And, you know, my, my hope was a lot of gamification that we would see would be like that, where we're just trying to make something that we all want to do, whether that, you know, learn a new language or learn a musical instrument or get fit, a little bit more fun. But actually these days, you're more likely to encounter gamification in less sort of optional ways. Yeah, that's what I want to talk about because, well, what are you saying? What are you saying? Well, we mean what? Like, meaning what? Because it sounds like you're saying we're getting hit with gamification. We probably don't even realize it how we're being managed and played. So, for example, pretty much everyone who drives the Uber, which is, you know, billions of people around the world, will be, will have the option to take quests to get a bonus every week or every couple of weeks. And so that sounds good, who doesn't want a bonus, right? And a quest usually involves picking from a number of different options. So maybe you might say, I think I'm going to go and drive 50 trips in the next week and I'll get a $50 bonus. But, you know, a lot of the people I've talked to, the drivers I've talked to and a lot of the people who've been interviewed say they really don't like this because they end up feeling like they are pushing themselves more than they really wanted to. And also that they didn't really have a lot of control over what bonuses get offered to them. And also whether they can even make the bonus because obviously it's not them who is, you know, who's really under has control of what jobs they get. It's what happens. Be given to them from Uber themselves. And that's the case and a lot of gig economy jobs like Deliveroo and DoorDash and apps around the world. What about other consumer aside, Adrian? Are there any sort of non sinister uses when it comes to gamification? Is there anything out there that is, yeah, we'll go ahead. Yeah, I mean, absolutely. You know, I think within fitness, you know, it tends to be a little bit better. So Nintendo's ring fit adventure has been incredibly popular. There's also Wii Fit, which you might remember for, you know, 10, 15 years ago. I can't believe it's been that long. I know. Super successful. You know, do a lingo obviously uses gamification. This is the language learning app, right? Yeah. Yeah. And there are musical instruments, educational games like, you know, block band that try and make learning the guitar, the real guitar, more interesting. So there's definitely lots of examples of gamification that people like and that benefit people. It's just that there is much more of a gray area, shading into kind of like a darker area in terms of what gamification is being used for. So to give an example of a gray area, it might be something like the Apple watch, where gamification in the form of goals and leaderboards and so on is turned on by default. It's, it's obsessed. I'll tell you something about how my husband sleeps. When we come back, we're going to come back to Adrian Han. He's got a book out you've been played. We'll get to that. We'll resume our conversation just a moment. Let's get to world and national news for that. We got a Nancy Lions in DC. Hey, Nancy. Thanks to him. President Biden is pardoning thousands of Americans convicted of simple possession of marijuana under federal law. He outlined his actions on Twitter. There are thousands of people are convicted from marijuana possession who may be denied employment, housing or educational opportunities of the result of that conviction. My pardon will remove this burden on Biden is also encouraging governors to follow his lead and pardon those convicted on state possession charges. People who question the legitimacy of the 2020 election now make up a majority of Republican nominees on the midterm ballot. Bloomberg's Nathan Hager reports. 299 nominees in all have either denied or questioned President Biden's victory. That's according to a Washington Post analysis of House and Senate races across the country, as well as key statewide elections. Election doubters are running in every part of the country and nearly every state. Four states have nominated election deniers in every race on the ballot of the 299. 174 are running for safe Republican seats. Another 51 are expected to be in tightly contested races.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,288,2022-10-06 20:42:32
12063," Every race on the ballot of the 299-174 are running for safe Republican seats. Another 51 are expected to be in tightly contested races. In Washington, I'm Nathan Hager, Bloomberg Radio. A Wisconsin judge is prohibiting voters from canceling their original absentee ballot in casting a new one. It's a win for a conservative group that said the practice known as ballot spoiling is illegal. Ballot spoiling became an issue in Wisconsin after several candidates dropped out, but their names were still on the ballot. Elections officials told voters who had cast an absentee ballot for one of them. They could spoil it and vote for someone else. Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quicktake, powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. All right, Nancy. Thank you so much. Carol Maser, along with Tim Stenevich, our live here on Bloomberg Radio and Bloomberg Business Week. We're doing a little bit of an audible for our producer, Ari Agammo. Ari, I always do this to you, Ari Agammo. She, Ari just put his hands up. Ari Agammo. It's cool because Ari's only worked here for a couple months. I know. I'm sorry. Yes, I haven't worked here for that long. I don't know why. Clearly being sarcastic here because you guys have known each other for years. It's okay. I should just give up speaking. You know what? I've mispronounced my own name. So, that stuff happens. So we're going to do Ari Agammo. We're going to do some earnings because AMD just came out with a preliminary third quarter revenue. And I think about our market guest today who said it's going to be very interesting to see what companies say about the third quarter and the fourth quarter outlook. Well, for AMD, they are bringing down their third quarter revenue. And they're looking for about 5.6 billion. The estimate out there, more than a billion above that, the 6.71 billion. Is the estimate that's out there? Yeah, you know, when we talk about a market driving story tomorrow, Carol, this is certainly going to be one of those I anticipate because AMD is coming out and blaming. Yeah, that's true. Blaming the PC market for hurting sales, citing weaker demand and a build up of inventory and the supply chain. Third quarter will also include $160 million in write downs related to inventory pricing and other issues. That's according to the company. We did see Carol during the pandemic, especially in the early part of the pandemic. Yeah, a lot of people pulling forward those PCs purchases because they were working from home. They needed that equipment at home. Companies needed to buy that at home. But as people have gone back to the office, we've certainly seen softening sales. Yeah, don't need it anymore. Anyway, AMD down about 3.8%. So we'll be watching the socks certainly to into the Friday trade. They get Levi Strauss under suppression the after hours, cutting their year-adjusted EPS forecast. They're looking for fiscal year net revenue up 6.7% to 7%. They had seen 11 to 13% upside and EPS for the fiscal year, adjusted EPS, a buck $44 to $1.49. They had seen $1.52, $1.56 and that stock. Quick check here in the after hours down about 4% right now. Contort brands also moving lower after market in sympathy with Levi. Tomorrow, check out American Eagle Outfitters, Abercrombie & Fitch & Gap as a result of these Levi earnings. All right, some earnings to carry us into the Friday trade. Right now, this is Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,289,2022-10-06 20:46:52

On Bloomberg WorldHankWaters, I'm Charlie Pellet, and I'm Zyde, running high on Wall Street ahead of the jobs report moments ago. We did hear from advanced micro devices. AMD now slipping after preliminary third quarter results fell short of analyst estimates. AMD down by about three and a half percent. Levi Strauss reported earnings. It reported quarterly revenue that fell short of expectations. After ours right now, Levi Strauss down by about eight percent. The Dow, the S&P and 500 index law by 38 points, a drop of 1%. The Dow ahead of the jobs report down 346 dropped there of 1.1%. Now the stack down 75 declined there of seven tenths of 1%. Ten year yield, 3.81%. The two year today, 4.25%. Spot gold down $3.00 yams to 17.13. Well, bus Texas, intermediate crude was up 1.3%. 88.93. Well, jobs Friday, you've got to lock it into Bloomberg Gradio. The number hits of course 8 30 AM Wall Street time, complete coverage here on Bloomberg. I'm Charlie Pellet and that is a Bloomberg business flat. All right, Charlie. Thank you so much. We want to get right back to Adrian Hahn. He's the founder and CEO of Six to Start, an independent game developer. He has study neuroscience. We mentioned this earlier. He's got a new book at you've been played. How corporations, governments and schools use games to control us all. I've been playing games with you from UK. So I told you I was going to tell you something my husband does and I think about gamification that we've been talking about and just like I feel like there's such a pursuit of measuring everything and Adrian, my husband will wake up and I'm like, Jeff, good night's sleep and I'm like, well, wait a minute. I pull up my phone and I go check out my device and tell and it'll tell me if I can. What does he use?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,290,2022-10-06 20:51:10
12065," during everything. And Adrian, my husband will wake up and I'm like, Jeff, good night sleep. And I'm like, well, wait a minute. I pull up my phone and I go check out my device and tell, and it'll tell me if I like, what does he use? If I got a good score, it's like a sleep mattress thing that's under our bed. And we've got, we've tried so many different ones, but I'll be like, oh, look, I got a 79. That was pretty good. Like, no, that's pretty good. How do you feel? Like, it's just amazing. This pursuit of measuring everything and how it guides us. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, you know, the idea of the quantified self has been around for a little while ever since, you know, we started getting sensors and pedometers that were cheap enough to be networked together. But I think what's really interesting is that's really started being put into our devices by default. And sometimes that's really useful. I do like the fact that my Apple Watch keeps track of my steps and my distance. But it's when those metrics get gamified is when things can get a little bit shaker. So earlier this month, my Apple Watch said, hey, if you want to win this October challenge, you should go and exercise even more than you did last month. And I was like, look, I already exercise a lot in September. And you want me to exercise even more now. That doesn't seem very always be exercising. That's what they say. Never stop. And, you know, a lot of these things also want to get us to compete against our colleagues who did it. So that's another angle. Well, I like that part. I like competing with colleagues. It does help, right? And I think about something like Peloton, right? You've got a screen and a scoreboard. Speaking of competing and competitors, just feel like Twitter and Elon Musk are not on the same page. Having said that, headline just crossing that Twitter says Elon Musk can and should close the deal next week says Elon Musk should be arranging the closing on October 10th. And Twitter goes on to say that Elon Musk is refusing to commit to any closing date. And that Twitter says that the bank says Musk hasn't told him or told them he intends to close the deal. Twitter also says Musk refuses to accept contract, contractual obligations and Twitter opposes Musk's motion to halt trial in Delaware. As you mentioned, Carol Twitter says that Musk can and should close the deal next week shares the Twitter. They were down today at $49. But up in the after hours, it's about seven tons of one percent. And how negotiations go on behind closed doors now. It's playing out on Twitter. Back to Adrian Han founder and CEO six to start. We've talking about his book. You've been played. So good, bad and different. Like how what do we do with this? Because our society is increasingly being one where games are controlling us, Adrian. Well, I think that it's a, you know, our society is increasingly digitized. And we have more and more sensors and more and more ways to track what people are doing and how people are working. And that is just providing a really vast surface area for companies to gamify that stream of data. And that can be done in a good way. I think people could opt in to gamifying parts of their lives if they want to try and make things a little bit more interesting if they do it willingly. I think really it has to come down to people's choice. I don't think it's a great situation if you go to work and then you can't speak to a manager. You can only contact them through this game, which is really the truth. And a lot of these gig economy jobs, you know, I don't think it's great. If you buy a smartphone or a smartwatch and you can't really figure out how to turn off the gamification, you know, I think if people want to use that, that's great. You know, that's how I make my money. But at the same time, I'm a bit concerned about what what some people are being exposed to. Adrian, what about when it comes to what companies are doing? And I think of like loyalty programs, you know, frequent flyer programs, the idea of, you know, you talked about Uber and about gig workers. But what about when it comes to the way that they keep customers, not necessarily keeping the employees? Is that necessarily a bad thing for somebody to say, wait a second, I almost hit, you know, platinum, medallion status. But I need to do it, need to fly more to get there. Well, these are obviously, you know, incredibly common, incredibly powerful. I mean, if you look at what, you know, airlines and Starbucks do, you know, they're incredibly valuable to those companies. And a lot of customers do seem to like them. At the same time, you do generate a lot of weird.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,291,2022-10-06 20:55:40
12066," that incredibly valuable to those companies. A lot of customers do seem to like them. At the same time, you do generate a lot of weird behavior from these. There was a time when people were hypermiling in terms of just taking trips around the world in order to get higher frequent fly status. That doesn't seem great for the environment or for anyone in general. Just speaking of flying to random destinations in order to take up your number, your fictional number a bit higher, similarly with Starbucks, we have stories of people just ordering bizarre combinations of food. They don't really want in order to get a deal. So I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with loyalty programs, but there's a big difference between the little card that you get where you get a tenth coffee for free and something where it's buzzing your phone every half day, when you're incentive. Well, yeah, and it is kind of, you see it constantly when you buy things or search on things and so on. I want to go back to what you talked about, Adrian, earlier about Uber drivers. And I'm thinking about this with the monthly jobs report coming tomorrow about how your work and your book is showing that this gamification that's going on provides an indirect strategy for companies to reduce wages. You talked about Uber drivers. Do you feel like it's happening though more broadly? Well, I think that if you, you know, across a gig economy, you're saying a lot of companies try and obfuscate compensation by putting more money behind these sorts of contingent bonuses that they dress up in video game aesthetics. Right. So they don't actually have to call it a quest. They could call it anything they want, but they choose to use video game metaphors because people understand them. And so that's a thing that's happening in India through Amazon's delivery premium league that they use for delivery drivers in Indonesia with the Gojek right-hailing app. You know, it's happening all over the place, but it's also happening in non-gay economy companies, I think. So you see a lot of lower paid workers based on having their performance monitored and gamified. Oh, interesting. So I get them effectively to work hard when longer hours. Adrian, we only have 30 seconds left, but you're going to hear from you about governments. How governments are gamifying things? So obviously people have heard of the Chinese social credit score. In reality, it's a bit more, it's a lot more fragmented and not really as advanced as some people might believe. But you know, the most interesting thing about it is that the reason why a lot of the Chinese public have accepted it is because they think it's what the West already has through financial credit schools and health insurance credit schools. So it's kind of a circular thing. That's okay. We're just copying you. It's fascinating, especially if you think about how things are happening on apps and so on. Adrian, really great conversation.

12067," مثle from the heart of where innovation, money and power collide. Silicon Valley and beyond, this is Bloomberg Technology with Emily Cher. I'm Emily Changi San Francisco and this is Bloomberg Technology coming up in the next hour. For a new court filing, says Musk's buyout deal, expected to close by October 28th, but not a done deal by any means. Plus, Google shows off its new collection of gadgets, including new phones and a watch, even teasing a new tablet. How does it all stack up to Apple? We'll take you to the Made by Google event. And a car that drives itself was supposed to be the future, but the reality for self-driving cars seems to be getting further away. Will they even exist in our lifetime? Is this industry a $100 billion bust? We'll discuss. All that in a moment, but first I want to get a look at the markets and tech still feeling some pain. Let's bring in Bloomberg's Ed Luddlow, who has some breaking headlines from the close. Ed. AMD, the chip maker, giving us pre-limm results for the third quarter that come in well below expectations. A billion dollars actually below projections. You see, AMD softer by 3% others in the market like Intel, also softer down by 2% in after market. This is all about the slowdown in PCs, right? The lack of demand for consumer electronics and you wonder how big a ripple this will have in the market on Friday. We're going to stay tuned for more from the chip sector. As for the day that was on Thursday, there's a lot of anxiety in the market still right. We've had mixed data throughout the week. We've had a number of Fed speakers reiterating that the Fed will stay the course in their fight against inflation. Raising the prospect that rates will continue to climb higher. Higher rates, of course, discount the present value of future profits when it comes to the technology sector. Actually, you see, then, as that 100 down for a second day, softer by 8, 10 to 1%, relative to the broader market, even though we're in the red tech actually fed better on Thursday as yields can...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,293,2022-10-06 21:04:07
12068," Actually, you see the NASDAQ 100 down for a second day, softer by 8, 10 to 1%, relative to the broader market, even though we're in the red tech actually fed better on Thursday as yields continue to push higher and Bitcoin, his kind of traded sideways at around $20,000 US dollars per token for most of the week. The big breaking news headlines of the day Emily are all about Twitter, this tip for tat back and forth. I know you're going to dig into this, but what's really interesting, since that jump in the stock we got Tuesday, when Elon Musk sent the letter to Twitter, going back to the original $54, $20 cents a share, offer the stock has trickled down, we're down for two straight days below $50 a share. And if you're one of those people that watches the spread between the current price and the offer price and you see it trickling down, is that a sign that Wall Street starting to have a few questions about the direction of where this deal goes? All right, Ed, thanks. We'll be back with you a bit later in the show. Let's get into this Musk Twitter and the latest back and forth. The deal could potentially close at the end of the month, but Twitter saying not necessarily so fast, Bloomberg's own. Kurt Wagner has been going back and forth now for months. Kurt, what's the hold up now? Why can't they just say, let's do it? Yeah, well, there's a huge distrust factor, Emily. You have to keep that in mind as we're talking about this, right? Because a few days ago, Elon said, hey, let's do the original deal at the original price. And Twitter didn't jump on that immediately, which kind of tells you something, right? Because it seemed like the two were kind of meeting where they had originally thought they were going to in April. And today we learned that there's been a hang up around some of the language in what Elon ultimately said was that there would be a debt contingency, right? That that wasn't in the original agreement. And now he's saying, hey, I have the debt, it's there. And Twitter is basically saying, through it, show us because we're not going to sign anything until we have a legal document here. And so in the last hour or so, the Musk team has said, hey, we want to stay this trial. We want to pause this thing. And the Twitter team just responded, not all that long ago, maybe 10, 15 minutes ago to say, we don't want to do that. And now it's up to the judge as to whether or not they're going to put this thing on pause or continue. What's the likelihood that the debt contingency would actually become an issue? That's a great question. And as far as we can tell, a lot of the commitments that Elon got with these debt commitments from the banks back in April and May, those are as far as we know, still good. And so Elon has been saying, well, hey, Twitter is essentially dragging their feet. There's no reason that this debt isn't going to come through. But again, if your Twitter all you've seen is this guy kind of play games with you and change his mind and flip-flop. And so that's where I think this trust thing comes in, right? Is even if there is a high likelihood that the debt is indeed there, clearly Twitter is very nervous or uncomfortable with accepting that and moving forward. Now, it also came out that Musk tried to negotiate a lower price for the deal. And this was, as I understand it, weeks ago, Twitter said, no, not surprisingly. But we actually did come back to them earlier than we thought and said, hey, maybe I actually want to do this. Yeah, his lawyer actually issued a public statement today that said that the two sides had talked about lowering that deal price, which again is $54.20 per share. And that Twitter had actually offered a slightly lower deal. He said that cut billions of dollars off the price. And that Elon ultimately said no, because there were other requirements or stipulations with that price reduction. Now, we're kind of at that stage, Emily, both sides and both lawyers are really kind of throwing everything they can at one another in public here. And so it's a little bit, we're still trying to figure out exactly how that negotiation may have played out. But again, on the record from Elon Musk's lawyer basically saying Twitter tried to lower this by billions, Musk said no, because he didn't like whatever stipulations were included with that. All right. Well, it seems to be an hour by hour letter by letter tweet by tweet situation. Who goes Kurt Wagner, thank you for continuing to follow it all for us. Well, for the fourth time this year, Peloton is laying off a significant number of employees. Seatt, Barry Maclame…",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,294,2022-10-06 21:08:42
12069," Continuing to follow it all for us. Well, for the fourth time this year, Peloton is laying off a significant number of employees. CEO Barry McCarthy told staff today, it's part of the effort to save the struggling fitness maker. Roughly 500 Peloton workers being let go now. This is about 12% of the workforce. Coming up, Metta's market cap fall. Are we seeing a big tech changing of the guard before our very eyes? This is a new set of regulations. Is poised to make big tech business a little harder to do. We'll talk about it all with former Facebook Chief Privacy Officer Chris Kelly, who's with us next. This is Bloomberg. In the span of a year, Metta's market cap has plunged from over a trillion dollars to just a few hundred million shares of the social media giant collapsing some 60% over the last year. Meaning the Facebook parent now accounts for less than 1% of the S&P 500 the lowest since 2015. What is its signal about the company's future? Let's ask our next guest, Chris Kelly. He is Facebook's former Chief Privacy Officer. It's first general counsel and head of global public policy. Chris, thank you so much for joining us. So of course, market cap isn't everything, but it's astounding to look at those numbers. Do you think we're seeing a changing of the guard happen before our very eyes whereby Metta's influence and power will be significantly diminished? Relatively, over a longer term. But there's obviously a lot of market concern about the direction that the company's going, that the move to the meta versus a focus, the name change, all of these different things that have gone into what the street's assessment of the business prospects of the company are in the long term. And so that has obviously weighed on the stock quite extensively. In the long run, the company is well positioned, I think.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,295,2022-10-06 21:12:48
12070," of the business prospects of the company are in the long term. And so that has obviously weighed on the stock quite extensively. In the long run, the company is well positioned, I think, in general, but needs to figure out what it's going to emphasize in terms of how they're going to continue to make great profits and how to lead this transition into the metaverse, which is one of the things that they've articulated as the main goal of the company by changing the name. In the meantime, they have a whole bunch of these different businesses that operate extraordinarily well. And they're going to need to make the case more to the street about how those have growth prospects. And ultimately, that should result in a recovery in the market cap over time. But this is the way that Mark's major companies these days. It's always a challenge. Meantime, you've got the Supreme Court taking a look at Section 230. How big a blow could that be for a meta? If the power of that law is eroded or erased? Yeah. I mean, Section 230 has had a great deal of power, I think, in protecting the reasonable business decisions of all companies, the space, not just Facebook meta. And the threats to that are very real right now. The upholding of the Texas law by the Fifth Circuit, the upholding of the Florida law in the 11th Circuit so far. There's just a whole bunch of wacky stuff from traditional First Amendment jurisprudence going on right now in the courts because of the way that they've been packed. And from there, the companies have to be very focused on this. I think that there's been a lot of good commentary that says that the companies might end up engaging in more takedowns of improper behavior, even more takedowns of improper behavior, if there were to be some sort of repeal of Section 230 or limitation of it by the interpretation of these statutes, which pretty clearly both conflict with Section 230 and the First Amendment in a lot of these cases too. So I think that that's an ongoing worry for the companies and that they're watching it very closely. But Facebook and Facebook meta Google in their YouTube division, all sorts of the different companies that are offering media and also content, a huge generated content, have been adapting their policies to get to some sort of stasis, which is I think okay right now, but they might have to change it pretty radically if their protections are repealed. Meantime, you've got federal regulation, that could potentially come with this Klobuchar grassly law, but there's this market cap provision as I understand it. And Facebook wouldn't even qualify it because in terms of its market size, it's too small. You've got lead economy, FTC, scrutinizing Facebook from another direction. And some of the, let's say Facebook defenders would say, Facebook is getting an undue amount of scrutiny for the size, at least if you look at the market size of the company today. What do you think about that? The idea that Facebook is a monopolist exercising, unjust, unallowable monopoly power to either maintain a monopoly or to gain a monopoly has always been a pretty far-fetched vision. A whole bunch of people who just didn't like some decisions that the company was making. The antitrust laws supposed to protect competition, not competitors. And Facebook has had some competitors who are complaining over time and some smaller companies who would like to get into the field. But the idea that they're exercising the bottleneck control that's the historic worry of antitrust law has just always been incredibly difficult, which is why Judge Bozberg dismissed the suit in the first instance that the FTC's pleading was sort of a conclustery on that front. It came back and he let the lawsuit pursue with regard to the federal government. The state's lawsuit was dismissed in its entirety. They're on appeal right now, but I don't think that appeal will be successful ultimately. And so it's a, and if you look at the things that they wanted to go after Facebook for the acquisition of Instagram, the acquisition of WhatsApp, there's a real read of those as more defensive against other big players in the industry like Apple and Google who control the mobile operating systems at the time. And so that road collateral,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,296,2022-10-06 21:17:16
12071," of WhatsApp, there's a real read of those as more defensive against other big players in the industry like Apple and Google who control the mobile operating systems at the time. And so it's one of those things where from a traditional antitrust law perspective, it is always a pretty far-fetched case. And it's proceeding now, but after some significant hand slapping by a fairly good and principled traditional antitrust judge in DC. That said, Facebook still has a massive cultural and societal impact. We were just speaking with Francis Hagen, the now famous Facebook whistleblower, and she expressed her concern that especially with Cheryl Sandberg leaving that Mark Zuckerberg still only really has Mark Zuckerberg to hold him accountable. Take a listen to what she had to say. Mark has surrounded himself with people who tell him the same kinds of stories over and over again. Facebook is just a mirror. It doesn't have responsibility. All these things that we're complaining about have always been present. We're just showing them to people. We don't play any role in this. We have no power. What do you think? I mean, I do think that there's a degree to which Facebook has a gatherer of cultural expression is merely reflecting what is going on in reality. But the idea that it shapes it instead is something that the company has embraced in its research internally as a lot of the documents that Francis Hagen put out showed that I do think that the company should be more transparent about that research and that they should be engaged in a dialogue saying, look, we understand that there are challenges to the change that social media presents to the way that people traditionally experience media. And we're trying to lead them. And now moving into the metaverse, we want to make sure that safety and mental health as people experience these platforms is part of the mission and doing that in a good way as part of the mission. I think I've seen some pretty good action on that front from the company as the metaverse pivot has continued to happen on that front. And I think that the fact that a lot of these documents have come out and have revealed internal research in the company has been mostly a cleansing opportunity for the company to talk about these things more openly. That Francis' point seems to be that the company shouldn't be hiding these. And I think that that's mostly right. I kind of ask your thoughts about Elon Musk and Twitter. I'm curious what you think the risks are. Does Twitter and Twitter under Elon Musk attract more Facebook-like problems because it's run by a soul and very public billionaire? What are you watching? If indeed, despite all of his success, he ends up taking over the social media company which he has never done before. Right. And his commentary about how simple this could be. You just reinstate some of these figures. You just allow... We want to go to the limits of free speech in law in America where we're going to try to step back seem a lot more like what people like Francis Huggins or Cuisin-Marg-Sucker Berger than what has actually happened at Facebook and meta. And there's a real danger. Elon's commentary on this has been simplistic and ill-informed in most cases. Almost as ill-informed as some of the stuff that he put out recently about... It was effectively Russian propaganda about Ukraine. A lot of these commentary, there are areas where he just doesn't have a lot of expertise. And look, I drive a Tesla. I was an investor in SpaceX. I'm mostly a believer in Elon Musk and his ability in certain areas. But the way that he has, you know, roundly dismissed years of research and thoughtfulness in Twitter's content policies and in terms of ways to approach these difficult matters, doesn't bode well for Elon Musk's front Twitter. And so, I mean, if it ends up descending into forechan, it's not something that's ever going to be as valuable as he needs it to be. So he's going to have to smarten up on this if he ends up...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,297,2022-10-06 21:21:22
12072," And so, I mean, if it ends up descending into 4chan, it's not something that's ever gonna be as valuable as he needs it to be. So he's gonna have to smarten up on this if he ends up with the deal. All right, well, that's quite a, you know, but comparison there, it certainly much remains to be seen. Chris Kelly, Facebook's former chief privacy officer gonna have you back here on the show, Chris, and hearing you weigh in. Thank you. All right, coming up, the myth of the driverless car. We're gonna talk about why a future where you can relax behind the wheel is still pretty far out. That's our big take. Next, this is Bloomberg. Our turn today is State talking about kijken. Investors have bet $100 billion on the self-driving car industry. But how close are we really to truly seeing them on the road? Well, driverless car engineer and pronto CEO, Anthony Levantowski says this future is years, if not decades away. Boomerks Max Chacken spoke to him and joins us now for more details on what that means exactly. And if that name sounds familiar, Max, of course, Anthony Levantowski. I feel like we have to say at the start was indicted for charges of theft and stealing trade secrets from Google. He served a few months in prison. What's he up to now? So yeah, Levantowski is a very well-known figure in this field. And as he said, extremely controversial. So he is kind of the guy who kicked the whole thing off. He created the prototype that became Google's driverless car. Then as he said, when he went to Uber, he was in the middle of this very messy $2 billion lawsuit that ended with money being paid and also this indictment. And then he was pardoned by former president Trump. He's back and he has kind of turned critic, which is very interesting because he was probably one of the most outspoken boosters in the industry, particularly one of the people pushing towards commercialization of these robotaxies. And what he's saying now basically is that when you look at the progress that the industry has made, when you look at what Waymo and Cruz and some of these smaller companies that have raised huge amounts of money have done, it isn't a whole lot. It's a handful of cars and a handful of cities. They're still extremely restricted. And you're still getting...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,298,2022-10-06 21:26:15
12073," other companies that have raised huge amounts of money have done, you know, it isn't a whole lot. It's a handful of cars and a handful of cities. They're still extremely restricted and you're still getting, you know, all of these sort of videos on YouTube and elsewhere and social media of driverless cars behaving badly or weird or whatever. And so there are a lot of reasons to have skepticism about the industry and it's and yet another one is, you know, this pioneer, this booster turning critic. So the headline of your story is self-driving cars are starting to look like a hundred billion dollar bust. You talk about WAMO cars getting confused by things as simple as traffic cones. What's the real outlook? When are they, when are they going to be hitting the roads? Or are they ever? Well, you know, what we've heard from the kind of industry, WAMO, cruise, and so on is basically it's been two years out for like the last 10 years. I mean, you know, even going all the way back to like 2010, 2011, 2012 when Google at the time was unveiling these cars. They were saying, oh, we can handle any road. And then we saw Chris Irmson who was running the program for a while say that his child was 11 was going to have, you know, his drivers, was never going to have a driver's license. And we're kind of still in that place where, where it's this kind of near term thing, but it's all very vague. And what what what Levin Dowsky is saying and what what you hear if you talk to people who are outside of the sort of core of this industry is that we're talking decades. We're not talking years. Now, this isn't to say that there aren't advances or are an important technology happening that some of this stuff won't in fact change the world. It's just that the full blown, you know, level four, level five autonomy. This is the idea that you get in a car without a steering wheel. That is looking increasingly shaky. And I think one of the reasons you see that really the only two companies who are putting huge amounts of money into this, Waymo and Cruz both have, you know, big corporate backing. Waymo in the case of Google, Alphabet and Cruz, of course, is GM. So quickly, Max, our kids are still going to get driver's licenses, right? Yeah, I think unfortunately that's the case. Now, again, there are huge improvements and I think on the kind of advanced driver assistance technology, our kids will maybe drive in much safer cars. We're seeing that, you know, Tesla's autopilot, even though they market that as self-driving, but but it's really a really great driver assistance technology as well as GM supercruis and others. So cars are definitely getting safer. There are technological advances, but this kind of crazy steering wheel free future looks increasingly shaky. All right. Take note, parents, everywhere. Max Chaffkin, excellent story by you. You can check it out in Bloomberg Business week. Thanks, Max. Okay. Coming up, Google takes on Amazon's Alexa and the iPad with its upcoming tablet.

12074," How toацle Welcome back to Bloomberg Technology. I'm Emily Chang and San Francisco. We're going to get back to September payrolls coming out Friday. But jobs news has been moving markets for months as the Fed works to cut inflation Thursday. No exception tech again in the headlines are at Ludlow back with the top tech stories. Ed. Yeah, believe it or not, there was news in the last 24 hours that had nothing to do with Elon Musk. And it was very focused on jobs as you say. You see, Amazon softer by half a percent. They're adding 150,000 workers for the holiday period. Same as they added in 2021. And so, you know, I'm not going to say that. But what's interesting is it's a sign the demands there. Bloomberg scoop general electric cutting hundreds of jobs according to sources in its manufacturing unit that's responsible for making winter binds for wind energy because the demand is gone. And of course, Peloton we've been speaking about during the show. And so, you know, we're all trusting right. We're all brace for payrolls data on Friday. There's mixed signals about what the jobs market is like right now in the United States. But it's a big vote of confidence in consumer demand. The Amazon is bringing in the same reinforcement for this holiday shopping period that it did in 2021. And even at a time where sellers and merchants on the Amazon.com platform are worried they're bracing for a slow down in consumer spending due to inflation. And perhaps some pull forward of that spending to earlier in the year. You see the details of what Amazon's doing behind me. But, you know, remember between March and June of this year, largely through attrition. And we've used headcount by around 100,000 to undo the investment of the pandemic era. Then this Peloton, another 500 jobs to be cut from Peloton. I make that around 4,600 so far this year. Is this the final step in Barry McCarthy's plan to turn around Peloton's fortunes? Of course, we've all gone back to the gym, some of us. Some of us bats the office using our Peloton's less. But they've had to reduce headcount in a period where growth has gone and they're pivoting to a more asset like model. And it's really interesting to see what takes doing in this climate, particularly when it comes to the jobs front. All right, I'd love to thank you. Meanwhile, Google announced a suite of new products at the annual made by Google event along with the Pixel 7 and Pixel Watch. Google teased an upcoming Pixel tablet to take on Apple's iPad and Amazon's Echo devices. Let's bring in Rick Osterlow. Google senior.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,300,2022-10-06 21:34:36
12075," of three terrific phone products with 6A, 7, 7 Pro, hitting the market. And then we introduced the Pixel Watch for the first time. And we also have Pixel Buds Pro earphones. And this combination of technology, we think is what people are looking for right now. And it's really helped our business grow. So hang on Rick, we're getting some breaking news out of the Elon Musk Twitter saga. The judge in Delaware has said the deal must close by 5PM on October 28th has paused the court case until October 28th. Remember, we were expecting them to go to trial on October 17th. The judge saying if a deal isn't closed by October 28th, they will set a trial date of November. Twitter shares rising up about 3% at the moment on this news. We're going to get a little more context in a moment. But again, the Twitter trial, Twitter court case halted until October 28th pending a deal, an official deal between Elon Musk and Twitter. Rick, let's talk a little bit about what you see as the long-term viability of the hardware business. How much runway do you think you have? Given all this competition, I mentioned half all I mentioned Amazon, given all this competition out there. Oh, well, I mean, this is a very long-term investment for the company. And the market we're pursuing is absolutely enormous. But probably most importantly, this space of delivering personal technology to our users is absolutely critical for end users. And we see it as a great way for people to experience the very best technology that Google has to offer. We literally take our latest AI research and machine learning models and bring that right to our users with Pixel. And so we see this is absolutely essential. All right, Google, senior vice president of devices and services, Rick Astrolo, with all the news from the made by Google event. Thank you, Rick, for joining us. I want to get back to that Twitter news, the judge halting the court case until October 28, saying the deal must close by 5 PM. So Ed, if you're going to Delaware, it's not going to be until October 28th, potentially at least. Talk to us about the latest headlines. What are we hearing? Yeah, so the deal has until 5 PM, October 28th, to close, as you say, if the deal does not close by that period, Kathleen St. Jude McCormick, the chance to re-judge in Delaware overseeing this M&A case, this dispute, says that she will go to trial in November. So the door is still open to any outcome here. You see Twitter shares rising in after hours, we're up about 1.2% right now. We were as high as 3% to remember with that share pushing higher. It's kind of an indication from Wall Street that they see the chances of this deal now happening. Twitter indicated in their court filing earlier on Thursday that they wanted this to happen much sooner. They said that must could close as soon as next week by the 10th. The 28th date was the one that was originally put out by the must team in their court filing, where they requested that the stay of proceedings happen, that this trial be paused. Remember, Twitter opposed that in a court filing later in the day Thursday, Twitter said, we do not want to pause these proceedings. But Kathleen St. Jude McCormick, the chance to judge, appears to have cited with team mask at this time. The judge saying she'll set a date for November for a trial if the deal doesn't close by October 28th. There's still this contingency of the debt financing. Are we to understand by this that that's not going to be an issue or do we believe that's basically the main issue that remains? Yeah, so in the first court filing Thursday, must team said that Twitter wouldn't say yes to the deal, that they will hung up on this idea of the debt not being there, which must team kind of indicated was not a problem. In the filing that Twitter's team gave us later, they said that must could not even discuss closing the deal with the banks. The concern is that must has this $12.5 billion of debt split between a $6.5 billion loan, 3 billion of unsecured, 3 billion of secure bonds. There's also a revolving credit line in there as well. Times have changed since that deal and that package was agreed in April.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,301,2022-10-06 21:41:43
12076," Well, times have changed since that deal and that package was agreed in April. And so I guess the concern in the background is the viability of that debt. Here at Bloomberg, our expert analysts, our beat reporters have dug into this issue. And it's kind of unthinkable that the banks would walk away from giving the money or the proceeds from that debt. It would be a big hit to their credibility for one. But the banks do then need to go to Wall Street and sell the debt to institutional investors. So clearly, Twitter, if they don't have concerns about the debt, I think they still have concerns about what must true intentions are, that much we can gather from the court filing Thursday. So Ed, what's your hunch? Are you going to Delaware? You're asking me if we're going to Delaware. That's the question. I mean, look, we're not going to Delaware on October 17. Certainly, Twitter employees, I've spoken to this week. Many of them outlined early. They thought this was a play for time by Musk to go back to the original offer. We don't know. We don't know what the psychology around this is for me on Musk. But Kathleen St. Jude McCormick has made a very fast decision. I don't think anyone expected her to take both court filings, one asked to stay one didn't, and then decide this quick. That's where we stand. We do not know, except that it's still not a done deal. OK. Thank you for the play by play, as always. Kona, what we do know about the executive who withdrew, millions before Celsius's bankruptcy, another scandal. Unfolding, that's next. This is Bloomberg. All right..... See you around. Time now for our crypto report and remember, Celsius. Well, we're now learning the former CEO of the bankrupt crypto lender withdrew millions just before stopping customer withdrawals, Bloomberg's Katie Gryffald. Here to explain Katie, what do we know? Well, just to recap the timeline a little bit like you said, we had the former CEO withdraw about $10 million in May.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,302,2022-10-06 21:46:09
12077," Here to explain Katie, what do we know? Well, just to recap the timeline a little bit, like you said, we had the former CEO withdrawal about $10 million in May. He wasn't allowed you and also had co-founder Dan Leon and chief technology officer, Nuke Goldstein, also withdrawal millions. That was in May, and if we remember, in June, Celsius halted customer withdrawals and then ultimately filed for bankruptcy in July. So the timing here, obviously, a bit of a question mark as we work through this bankruptcy. And we'll see how this shakes out. And just to remind the audience, Celsius was one of the highest flying lenders, obviously promising returns trying to take on actual traditional banks by saying, you can invest your coins, receive interest on them. Obviously, that came crashing down in a pretty spectacular way. And this slow drip of news has been just fascinating to watch as we get closer and deeper into this bankruptcy. So it's hard to believe anything could be more exciting or volatile in terms of news than crypto markets, but Elon Musk and Twitter have given us just that. That said, there is still action in crypto markets. I know you've been watching Bitcoin and how it's been related to the market, rally or not. What trends are you pulling out? It is pretty amusing that crypto is sort of the ho-hum market right now, but a trend that I have noticed is that, actually, it's the crypto equities that have been outperforming this week. You have Bitcoin holding up relatively well amid all the volatility that we've seen in the stock market. Bitcoin is about 4% higher over the past four days or so, but if you look at micro-strategy, coin-based marathon, they're all up by double digits, which is pretty amazing to me. Part of the reason could just be that they fell much more dramatically than Bitcoin itself. For example, if you look at Bitcoin, it's down about 57% year to date. If you look at coin-based, that number is 71%. So it could be a function of the fact that they fell further. They have more room to rise, but it's definitely a trend to keep an eye on. Amid this mild resilience, I would almost call it in the crypto market. So what are you gonna be watching in the US overnight? Can I shamelessly plug something? Of course, that's what you need. I'm gonna go ahead and do that. So crypto-iroll, it's a show that I host with Tim Stenevich. It's gonna be on Quick Take at 8.30 PM Eastern tonight, 8.30 PM Eastern on Friday night. We're gonna dig into after this amazing drawdown that we've seen Bitcoin down 57% this year alone. Who's going to lead the rebuild? Who's going to be the winner? Who's going to be the loser? And whether that's going to be sort of the crypto-native companies or whether we're gonna see traditional finance come in here. All right, so my bet is that's not gonna be ho-hum at all. Excited to see it. Katie Greifeld, crypto-IRL. Take a watch. Thank you, Katie. Coming up, Cisco's Chief People Officer on the return to the office and the future of hybrid work.

12078," 🎵 There's another sign that Labor Demand in the U.S. may be starting to moderate. Unemployment applications rose more than expected last week by 29,000. This after the Labor Department said that the number of available jobs in August decreased by a million. This as the return to the office is waning or ebbing, let's say, nationwide last week was the second straight week where office occupancy barely budged after shooting up right after Labor Day. For more on the labor market and the future of work, I want to bring in Fran, Capsuda, Cisco, Executive Vice President and Chief People Policy and Purpose Officer Fran. It's great to have you back with us. So it's been called the Great Resignation. Now we're hearing the great realignment. We're hearing about quiet quitting. What in your view is actually happening within the workforce? Thank you, Emily. I'm so glad to be with you. I think what we're talking about is an amazing opportunity to really think about work. I think sometimes when we talk about this phase, we're so focused on whether people are working from home or from the office that we don't look at this opportunity from a future of work perspective. As you know at Cisco, we have worked hybrid actually before the pandemic. We've had a lot of flexibility. But what we see at this moment is that one of the most critical elements about work is inclusion and flexibility. And really understanding there isn't a one size fits all to the amazing work that we have to do. And if we're able to intersect flexibility with the work and innovation and connection that we're building, it can be an amazing opportunity and not something to dread. So give me some specifics about how Cisco is changing its strategy now. You know, we're coming out of the pandemic. But it's hard to know where new normal is really going to be. Yeah, so the first thing that I would say is I think all companies are still learning and evolving. And the way that we're handling this at Cisco is in a very decentralized way. We've asked every leader at Cisco to really work with their team to figure out against the backdrop of the work and how people are at their best to make arrangements. And for some people, Emily, that means that maybe they're coming in once or twice a week. Sometimes it's a little bit more. But because from a Cisco perspective, we have been doing this for so long, what we can see is there's amazing opportunities. We see that career trajectory for people regardless of where they're working can be equal. And we also see another opportunity from a Cisco perspective, which is really all about the tech. What we see from our customers is they want to have an experience where there are people that is similar, whether they're sitting in the office or sitting at home. And I think the other interesting thing right now is that we're seeing inclusion really intersect technology in a very different way, where the tech is working harder to make sure that every person is pulled into a meeting, innovation, a brainstorming session on a white board. And I think that's going to be critical for all companies moving forward. Well that's certainly an opportunity for Cisco's WebEx. I'm curious for your take on San Francisco's downtown, which still hasn't recovered from the pandemic and seems to be coming back much more slowly than.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,304,2022-10-06 21:54:45
12079," Cisco's WebEx. I'm curious for your take on San Francisco's downtown, which still hasn't recovered from the pandemic and seems to be coming back much more slowly than other U.S. cities. Do you think it ever will be the same? And what does that mean for tech culture? I don't think it'll be the same and I think that's part of the problem. I think that a lot of companies are stepping into this wanting to go back and what we're realizing at Cisco is that we have to invite our people back into the office. Right now, Emily, we're talking about our leaders as having a new role, which is these event managers that are really thinking about that connection. I think the amazing thing is that all companies want the connection, they wanna have the culture, but asking people to come in and sit on their own while they do their video calls or their emails just doesn't make sense to our people. And so I think it's gonna be really the focus on the anniversary celebration, the brainstorming session, maybe the community give back that will bring our people to the office in a different way. And I think we just have to lean into that trend and try new things until we find what works. So is the Silicon Valley kind of standard of, office gyms and catered food and onsite laundry? Is that era over? Oh, goodness, that's a really tough question. I will tell you that at the moment, I don't think those perks are as valuable as they once were. What we're hearing from our people is they wanna work in an environment where they can contribute, where they can have impact, where they can decide on a week to week basis whether or not they're coming in. And so I do think there's gonna be a new set of benefits and perks that are more meaningful to our people. It's interesting, Emily, because when I talk to my peers across industries and for those companies that are mandating that their people come back, they're sharing that their people are still not coming back. And so it's not these perks that will bring them back. I think it's gonna be one another, it's gonna be teams and really having a career that fits your goals. So in a recession, typically it's the employers who have the upper hand. Would you say that now as we go into a macro economic downturn or is this time different? We've got about a minute left. So I would still say that the individual has a tremendous amount of power in this environment. If I look at an area like security, we know that 700,000 roles are still open. And that means that companies are continue to be flexible. They're gonna be thoughtful. I think at this moment, I would still say that the individual has the power, but I do believe that we're gonna see some more balance as we move forward. All right, Fran Katsuda's executive vice president of Cisco Fran, good to have you back with us. Thank you for sharing your thoughts on the changing lay of the land. That does it for this edition of Bloomberg Technology. We've got a great show coming up Friday. Sarah Kuntz of Cleo will be joining us to talk about tech sentiment in response to the US Jobs report.

12080,"Got his The great sci-fi art of the mid-twentieth century teased the vision of the future with one distinct element and common, a life for humans in outer space. Whether vacationing on an exotic new planet or commuting to the moon for business, space travel seemed like it was just around the corner. Yet here we are, a half century later, and only about 500 human beings have ever left the bounds of Earth's atmosphere. But thanks to a set of ambitious private companies betting on the promise of space tourism, that long-awaited future could be here sooner than we think. For most of the history of spaceflight, governments have been the prime force behind nearly every aspect, from planning to funding to cruise selection. But as early as the 1980s, proposals for commercial space tourism began to emerge, along with innovative solutions for getting people there, such as the wild concept of sticking a 74-person passenger cabin in the cargo bay of a NASA space shuttle. Although various non-astronauts have been selected for missions over the years, true space tourism didn't happen until 2001. When an entrepreneur named Dennis Tito coughed up an estimated $20 million to hitch a ride with the Russian Federal Space Agency for a week-long vacation aboard the International Space Station, 20 years later, we're seeing a new contender in this final frontier of tourism. Private companies. It's becoming a private enterprise situation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,306,2022-10-06 22:04:05
12081," It's becoming a private enterprise situation, still very high risk with the high reward, potential reward, but you know government is really out of the business of flying people now and it's really going to be companies like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson that do that heavy lifting. Commercial space tourism is usually about taking the non-Astronaut, the private citizen into an orbital or suborbital flight so you get a short amount of microgravity experience and you can float and take some photos and then you come back. This was something that technology had gotten to a point where the private sector was going to make a business out of this. There are multiple companies that want to get to the place where they fly people into space. The first of these is Blue Origin founded in 2000 by Jeff Bezos using the autonomous rocket system New Shepherd attribute to the first American in space. Blue Origin plans to launch up to six passengers at a time offering a rarefied treat of 62 mile high views and a momentary experience of weightlessness. Boking officially kicked off in May 2021 with the very first C to be auctioned off for charity. Meanwhile Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic has also been pursuing a viable form of suborbital tourism. Aiming for launch in 2022 once Sir Richard himself has taken flight. I'm hoping to be able to go to space. I'd love to be able to coincide it with the moon landing and go to space. So I got the whip on the team and we'll see how he goes. The company claims to have lined up over 600 seat reservations so far including Justin Bieber and Leonardo DiCaprio. Virgin has projected that the final cost of the ticket will be at least $250,000 or roughly $50,000 for each of the five minutes or sub-weightlessness that you'll get to experience. Although costly both companies offerings aim to make suborbital flight a regular form of adventure travel eventually driving down costs at scale to expand the customer base beyond the orbit of celebrities and billionaires. The third major contender is Elon Musk's SpaceX which has set its sights even higher on orbital flights which are a whole another level of complexity and energy and danger. When you go sub-orbital if you're just going to go up above the Vaughn-Carmen line which is 100 kilometers or about 62 miles you only need to get up to maybe 5,000 miles an hour to get up there and you go basically straight up and then straight back down. You don't have the reentry heating that you would see coming in from an orbital so when you go orbital I don't care if you're a baseball or a battleship you've got to go 17,500 miles per hour not just 5,000 miles an hour. The energy is involved are much greater by doing that SpaceX has gone another level up and that's what they're doing with the Inspiration4. Visit Inspiration4.com for your chance to go to space. Inspiration4 is the first planned all-civilian mission into orbit slated to launch in late 2021. The crew will bring their own set of diverse perspectives and backgrounds and experiences to test how a group of different people, namely people who aren't professional astronauts, could affair in space. Until now astronauts have had to be physically perfect and this mission is changing that and so I feel incredibly honored to be representing those who aren't physically perfect. At H10 I was diagnosed with bone cancer and I was treated at St.G. Children's Research Hospital and as many year there undergoing intense chemo and also surgery that ultimately saved my leg. I now work at St. Jude as a PA physician assistant and I work with leukemia and lymphoma patients. The kids we work with are so brave and they are very excited to watch me go to space because this is showing them that you know they're capable of doing this as well. Haley along with three other crew members will spend three days in space orbiting the Earth every 90 minutes before landing back off the coast of Florida. Well when you think about access the first astronauts for the United States came from the test pilot side and and so women weren't allowed to be a part of that. We have somebody in their 20s somebody in their 30s somebody in 40s and somebody in their 50s and so there can be access in all kinds of way whether you're talking about age whether you're talking about gender whether you're talking about race and ethnicity and all of those things.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,307,2022-10-06 22:07:51
12082," Access in all kinds of way, whether you're talking about age, whether you're talking about gender, what are you talking about race and ethnicity, and all of those things. The first time people are going up into space and not sent there by super power, like the United States or Russia or China, well that's like really significant. And you've got to be very thoughtful about it. The whole game plan right now is to make space really affordable and accessible for everybody. So you can have fishing buddies going to space some day, but the first is special. And so with that, we wanted to have a cruise selection process that could make space available to everyday people. Getting to space is only the first step for space tourism. The next challenge is what to do and where to stay when you get there. Axiom Space is planning to launch the first segment of a new commercial space station in 2024. Their $2 billion project called AxStation would become the first free-flying private international space station, or to use a more consumer-friendly term, a space hotel. Axiom isn't the only company out to make your space stay a little more comfortable. Big low-error space has been building what they call expandable habitat technology, like their B330, an inflatable pod module that expands once in orbit. There's even one attaching a national space station right now they've been testing it. And you take it up and it's rather small and then you inflate it. And it seems to be working very, very well. This is likely to be the first kind of tourist hotel that you're gonna see up in space. First of all, it's easy to carry instead of this giant tin can with all of that, the inflatable sort of lighter. You can just blow them up and they get a nice big size for about, you know, less than half the weight probably. But even as space missions become accessible to civilians. The risks of going to space are incredibly high. And you could die a thousand ways that we can think of and a thousand other ways that we can't think of. This is Michelle Hanlon. She's a space lawyer at the Mississippi School of Law focused on protecting humans in outer space. Now I'm not an attorney for any of the space tours so I haven't been privy to their private contracts but I can tell you that the FAA requires certain waivers to be in those contracts. So for example, the FAA says, well, we're not going to make your spacecraft to a certain safety level. We are going to make you spacecraft operator. Make sure that you inform your space tours of all of the hazards that you know of. That I imagine a very long waiver all the ways you can die in space. And you have to understand that there's health risks and you have to indemnify the US government if you are launching community United States. So those are things that we know a space tourist has to sign and has to wait. So now let's go back and think about our space flight participants. The FAA calls space tours space flight participants. They don't call them astronauts. Why is that important? If you're not an astronaut, there's no obligation to rescue you. If something goes wrong, it's a lot of money to set up a rescue launch. If it can even be done, it's something really important to think about and that difference as we cross this threshold from having astronauts in space to having real people like me in space. And when we are able to make it to space reliably enough, there's still a host of other legal and ethical issues to consider before space tourism can truly take off. There are so many gaps in space law that we are gonna have to put in a lot of sort of basement ideas. And so for example, the outer space treaty is a treaty that offers principles and guidelines for state activities, for the activities of national governments doesn't talk about private entities, doesn't talk about humans in space. So now something goes wrong. So let's think about all of the times hotels on Earth are sued, right? So slip and false. You step on something in the bathroom. You sue the hotel and it becomes a private lawsuit. Because of the vagaries of international law, if something happens in space, well boy, you can sue the state that launched your spacecraft, you can sue the company that brought you there, you can sue the hotel, you can sue the individual, you can sue every government related to that because the outer space treaty and the outer space regime have set this up, is that anything that happens in space first has to go through a diplomatic channel before you think about suing an accordive law. And so M.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,308,2022-10-06 22:12:17
12083," space regime have set this up is that anything that happens in space first has to go through a diplomatic channel before you think about suing an accordive law. And so every single slip-and-fall in a space hotel is a diplomatic nightmare. And so we really need to figure that out before we before we start sending a lot of people there. You think about human rights in space. Here we don't think about a human right to oxygen because it's kind of all around us and free. It's not in a space hotel. So what happens if something happens in the oxygen depletes? Who gets the oxygen first? And then of course let's not even think about the labor. How do you treat your labor in a space hotel where that person may be there two or three years without coming back to Earth? So a lot of things to think about. Space habitats are more likely in the near future to focus on research missions and be a home for experiments that can't happen as easily back on Earth. Of space hotels I think they garner a lot of headlines and a lot of news. But at the same time that's not the first thing that you're going to see happen. They don't offer the compelling business case. I think that you'll see from a place that wants to manufacture pharmaceuticals or a new type of crystal or some type of filament or fiber optic cables and other things that you can do in microgravity. The things that are actually a high value finished good when you get that back to Earth and you sell it for a very, very huge profit margin. That's what's likely to happen in space as opposed to having a real estate platform that you sell to a tourist by space hotel. It's really interesting and it will probably happen. But it's not likely to be at the forefront of space commerce. Even if space hotels are right around the corner, don't get too excited about booking a trip in one. It's not a cheap ticket to ride to space and it's going to be, you know, millionaires and billionaires and that sort. But at the same time, you know, the point was made that in the early days of airline trips, that was also a completely on affordable ticket for most people. Those people who flew were people of means and over time it becomes affordable to the masses. And I think that's the goal for all the entrepreneurs in space as well to get those costs down to a point where it's not $10 million or $5 million or $300,000 right into sub-agual space when it becomes more like buying a first-class ticket to go to Europe from the United States. So that's the goal and you know, the question is, can we get to that point? Given the immense operating cost of getting to space, it may be years, if ever, until space tours and becomes a profitable venture for any of these companies. Virgin Galactic, the only publicly traded company of the three, has had a particularly rocky year, initially riding on the momentum of a SPAC deal. But more recently beset by launched delays and major funders including Branson himself selling large quantities of their stock in the company. Space is really, really, really hard and it's an absolutely shay, but it's one that happens to be very true. It's just really hard to do. That's also the reason that you've seen the delays that, you know, Virgin had talked about flying years and years ago and it became such a crazy point that Richard Branson actually stopped talking about it when he was asked because it was never going to be when he predicted. But it's not insurmountable and, you know, investors have stepped up because this is something that is doable. Despite the astronomical dangers and costs of getting to space, it may ultimately follow the course of other once fanciful modes of travel. Right, brothers, having, you know, what was by modern standards a very unimpressive first flight, you know, at Kitty Hawk, I mean, you know, you had like less than 20 years later, you had your first airborne ambulances being used to save lives. Fundamentally, the world is a more interesting place when people can go and dance among the stars and such. The lure of space is in a, it's in our DNA. It's that exploration bug. We are an exploratory species and we want to go out there and see what's out there. A vision that I had in 1969 of seeing normal, even being to travel into space, it's finally beginning to happen. When you get a bunch of people up there and they can all see it for themselves, that'll create even better.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,309,2022-10-06 22:16:31
12084," of seeing normal even being to travel into space, it's finally beginning to happen. When you get a bunch of people up there and they can all see it for themselves, that'll create even get another revolution in how we treat our planet and what we think about it. So while 2001 came and went without quite looking like Stanley Kubrick's ultimate space fantasy, 2021 might finally be the year we're catching up. If you visit California, you might be inclined to go to Disneyland. We're jumping you're convertible and take highway one up the coast. We may be make a pilgrimage to Yosemite, all very fine choices. But if you're the kind of person who revels in our planet's extremes, then it's Route 395 that you're after. This one glorious road will carry you from Death Valley's desert floor to sky high views of Mount Whitney. You can see the 5,000 year old bristle cone pines, the oldest living organisms, or the bizarre two fatowers of Mono Lake. And true to California's boom and bust spirit, you can santa around the ghost town of Bodhi. What a novel experience to find an empty American city where all the businesses are shut down. To do 395 upright, it helps to have a guide and mine is a man named Jan and his crew. And Aaron? Ten Lemmy, the hardest partying dog of all time. Jan agreed to show me some of what 395 has to offer, but only if we agreed not to disclose any locations. My name is Jan Svorestra, I'm an industrial designer out of LA.

And I don't like to be known as that, but I'm trying to use it to set a good example and do more with it than just social media. Waited we had a cab and we got here, Laila, I was sure we were. This is BLM land on the outskirts of National Forest. And it's one of my favorite places in the world. Basically everything outdoors wrapped into one. Yeah, we have California.

And then just roll out when you want. It's my daily driver. Handles great. And then when I'm done with work, I can just bail and go camping and out. So the camper basically has only what I need. Think of it as backpacking with a car. Yeah. The fridge has a couple compartments. This is just a kitchen box. Stove, utensils and a bunch of stuff. This one has just dry food. And when you get inside, there's a bed. The bed flips up. So you've got tons of room in here. Miss Hauling. This phenomenon. If you want to pull that over. That is cool. We just popped that out. Sort of. So home on wheels. Yeah. This is my vacation house. Yeah, it was so nice, man. Even with his Nomad lifestyle, Jan faces the same big question as the rest of us. Through the internet and smartphones, have to ruin everything. When you find the super special, beautiful spots is that you bust out a map and like, look at where it might be cool to go. Or is it worth a mouth and just getting to know people of the locals? And if I see a dirt road, I just want to go down there. So a lot of it's just endless rambling. It's a desire to just see something. Check that out. For some reason, it's more fulfilling than getting a recommendation from somebody. Or there's tons of apps and websites now. Roadtrip apps, camping apps, they've proliferated. The knowledge is accessible on the internet, right? I used to fight the geotags and I would get really pissed off. You know, like, why are you posting this place? It's going to blow up. It's going to get trashed. Now I've realized that you can't fight it. The internet has just shrunk the world. So we're not going to stop it. We're not going to stop people from going there. So I'm a lot more focused in conversation now with trying to set a good example. When you go, pick up your trash. When you're pooping out in the wilderness, don't leave your toilet paper on the top. Make sure you follow good steps for leaving no trace.

The plus side was that our RV no longer smelled like feet. The downside was breathing. My man David here suggested that we try and outflank the smoke by cutting through your semity. Without a reservation, we had to talk our way in. Oh yes, no stopping, no getting out. Yeah, no problem. We just wanted to get through. It was a beautiful choice. Glad we got out of the smoke. Whoa! But not quite as effective as we had hoped. It's 4.4 hours or so and we had managed to trade the smoky majesty of your semity. For the smoky... Look at it. Strip malls of the Central Valley.

We're off to see a kind of surprising tech startup that is making some pretty strange machines to serve all the growers out in this region. And where is the where here in this near Fresno, this is California Farm Country, right? We're just out the Fresno town called Kingsburg so we're right in the Central Valley of California. Very, very large farming valley here. It's kind of considered the bread basket of the world. The Central Valley stretches out over about 20,000 square miles and the farmers here produce about one-fourth of the food that Americans eat. And we're doing a whole lot of fruits and nuts. Tell me a little bit of the background of God's. I know some of this is like a family business. The roots of this go back a ways. Tell me kind of like how we got to what's essentially like a startup I got. Yeah, definitely. So the founder of our company is Dave Crinklaw and he started the business back in 1982. He started with his, basically with his dad, was commercial spraying of trees and vineyards. Right to the point where our biggest challenge was labor. Just the shortage of it really. He was forced into innovating and he had had this idea for quite some time about doing a driverless sprayer and it finally got to the point where he said, you know what, I either got to get out of this business or I'm going to innovate. Organic or not crops need to be sprayed and this process has to take place a few times a year. This means hiring a lot of people to work long hours under serious pressure. And so just like the tech bros to the north, Gus decided to solve all of its problems with robots. On this like labor points, you guys have set this up where you can have somebody in a truck and that one person can monitor I think like eight of these. In order to operate Gus, you have one guy or girl that sits in a pickup and they monitor from a laptop computer.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,312,2022-10-06 22:29:26
12087," I have one guy or girl that sits in a pickup and they monitor from a laptop computer. So that person is basically just watching all the vehicles on the screen. They can monitor up to eight of them at a time while they're out their spring and orchard. And so that user interface really provides them with all the information they need to make sure that the machines are safe and that they're doing the correct job. So it tells them what speed they're driving, the engine RPM, the amount of gallonage per acre that they're applying at any given time. So if any one of the machines has an issue, it's going to send an alert to that laptop. Much like a self-driving car, these beasts use GPS, LiDAR, and cameras to see and navigate the world around them. They also rely on pre-built maps of the orchards for extra guidance. Gus builds the machines right here and then takes them out for robot training on this orchard next door. It's here that the company learns if the machines will behave and do as their software and human masters command. So this is kind of like the, this is a test orchard where you guys put it through the pace and it's going to work on the technology. Yeah, so this is our test orchard right here. It's right by our building and so you can see in the background. So every new machine as it comes off the assembly line, it's put through a commissioning test. Right here, we test all the sensors on the machine, autonomous computer, all the safety systems, make sure it's doing what it's doing, prior to when it's delivered to a customer. So what's it doing now? So right now he's doing a test spray, so he's just turning the water on to make sure that the system comes up to pressure, spraying water out of the nozzle is just to make sure it's all functioning properly. Okay. He's got like a crazy turbine at the backer. Yeah, so it's basically just a big fan. Okay. And that fan's driven off of the Cummins diesel motor and it just basically creates a big airflow. Gus is already selling these vehicles to brave modern farmers and people the world over have taken notice of its machines. And if you just sold them in the Central Valley or like throughout the US or even overseas or where they go. Yeah, so right now the majority of our machines are here in California in the Central Valley. However, we do have machines and customers in Florida and the citrus industry over there as well as Australia. And I think you start selling them in like December of 2019? Yeah, so we started taking orders early last year for the sprayers and the first delivery we made were in December of 2019. Okay. And how much do they cost each? So our retail price on these machines is $285,000. So it's like it's not a small investment but I'm sure the regular sprayers aren't. Yeah, I mean we're honestly not too far away from conventional equipment on our price. And the main thing is that the return on investment is very, very quick. Do all the labor savings and the increased efficiency. I mean these machines they just drive. But basically what we're doing besides this machine, this is our first machine we call it orchard Gus. Mainly designed for your nut trees as well as citrus and fruit. In the future we're working on a few other projects. We're going to do more machines, one of them is actually a vineyard sprayer. So vineyards are much tighter spacing. So the machine has to be physically smaller and then we've got our eyes on doing a lot of other innovating. That right there friends is a central valley farmer putting his whole fruit basket on the table. Gary's Ted Tot can't be far off. And with that it was time to get back in the RV. And to confront what happens when three men are bested by their own failings and the forces of entropy. Next on Hello World we cruise into the Mojave Desert in search of a lunar lander. We have instruments.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,313,2022-10-06 22:33:52
12088," Next on Hello World, we cruise into the Mojave Desert in search of a lunar lander. We have instruments that we are going to deliver to the South Pole of the Moon in December of 2022. Instruments that are trying to scan the surface of the moon. And hang with a test pilot who walked away from this. Meet Betty. She lives by herself, but for the last few months, she hasn't been alone. Ella Kew, tell me a joke. Did you hear about the claustrophobic astronaut? No. Apparently, he just needed a little space. Most technology isn't made for 93 year olds. This woman is making sure that this particular robot is. Ella Kew, who are you? She's researching the way we interact with machines. And if she has her way, robots will soon be a trusted companion for all of us. My name is Ella Kew. How can I help you? As technology replaces old jobs, it's also creating new ones. I'm Aki Ito, and I'm here to show you the jobs of the future. My name is Danielle Ishak, and I am a human robot interaction researcher. It's really hard to intuitively design a robot meant for a consumer audience. You have to make sure that it's a robot that people want. People know how to use, and people value. Danielle Worksburn is really start up called Intuition Robotics. Its US office is here in downtown San Francisco. The company is funded by a couple big names like Samsung and Toyota. Full disclosure, Bloomberg's venture capital arm is an investor too. This is Ellie Kew. Can I take her out for a spin? Please? Ellie Kew. Tell me what you can do. I am a proactive social robot designed for older adults. I can connect you to your family and friends and even play music. These features might remind you of the Amazon Echo, but you'd be missing the point if you compared her to a smart speaker. She's not meant to just be useful. She's meant to be a companion. Why don't you take a break and have a drink? And that's why she has a head that cannot and make other subtle gestures you might expect from a pet. Through our research with older adults, we're finding that almost on a daily basis, we see that somebody tells her that they love her or that they like her. Like, or that they miss her. Literally, I love you. They'll also tell her I'm depressed or I'm lonely. They'll open up to her in a way that they might not necessarily open up to a human because they don't feel like they'll be judged. Lily Q is an on sale yet. But a prototype is already in the homes of about a dozen early testers who live in the Bay Area. L.A. Q, tell me what the weather is today. Danielle's job is to figure out what's working and what's not. Sorry, please rephrase your request. And she does that by visiting each of her testers twice a month.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,314,2022-10-06 22:38:00
12089," What's working and what's not. And she does that by visiting each of her testers twice a month. They're critical. We're building a product for people who we are not. I'm not a senior. And how could you know how to design for somebody if you don't do research? Because otherwise you would just be designing in the dark. Jobs like Danielle's are just starting to emerge. Until recently, robots were mostly in factories separated from humans. But now they're finally getting cheap enough, small enough, and smart enough to be in our homes. This has created a whole new challenge of designing robots that people will actually want to interact with. And that's where Danielle comes in. Her research has helped shape every little facet of L.A.Q. From the way L.A.Q moves to the way she talks. It's a very special job and it could be really hard and it could be really frustrating about that end of the day. It's incredibly rewarding. And I think the most rewarding part about it is when I see the joy on the user's faces. Like that they saw their feedback turned into something real. Today we've driven east of San Francisco to go see one of Danielle's research participants. L.A.Q. Tell me something interesting. Did you know that Ronald Reagan was a lifeguard in high school and saved 77 people's lives? Now see this is where a conversation is. She should open up and I should say no I did not know that. I expect her to be able to continue a conversation for at least a couple of comments. Yeah. And why is that? Why? Because that's companionship. When Betty was around Danielle's age, she was working with some of history's very first computers. When I was finishing up my master's degree, I was working at Harvard in the computer lab when they were building Mark IV. A large room size computer. But now this artificial intelligence stuff is amazing. L.A.Q. Yes. Schedule doctor's appointment. No problem. I'm working on it. When Danielle brought along the idea of working with robotics for the elderly, I said are you kidding me? Will older people connect to a robot? And she said, I don't know. Let's research and find out. Danielle grew up here in this suburb of Atlanta. Her parents spent much of their childhoods in Israel and met in the US. We as immigrants, we understood that we might need to work a little harder. In fact, I feel that rather than taking away from Danielle, it gave her so much more. Because she understood the fact that you need to run after your dreams and work really hard, no matter what the challenges are. School didn't come easily for Danielle. I have dyslexia and that very much affected my self-esteem academically. The principal of the school did not recommend her to take the entrance classes. She fought for it and she got into it and she did very well with them too. Danielle's first job at Ugradskoll was at X, the secretive research facility founded by Google. It's known for dreaming about kinds of wacky, far-flung ideas. Can you tell us about the moonshirt you worked on? No, I can't tell you too much about the projects that I worked on. I can't say that I was working on robotics.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,315,2022-10-06 22:42:27
12090," Yes. Can you tell us about the moonshot she worked on? No, I can't tell you too much about the projects that I worked on. I can't say that I was working on robotics. She loved the job, but wanted to work on something that would reach real consumers sooner. So she left X after a year and joined Intuition Robotics. She's been working in the field for four years now, and it took her a while to find her footing in a male-dominated industry. I've gone to different meetups where Chloe likes to circle with men with their zip up jacket with their company logo on it and have beer in their hand and I'll come in with lipstick and nobody wants to talk to me. This is my closet. But first she did her best to fit in, wearing a pair of glasses she didn't need, and toning down her style. So what's the kind of thing you used to wear to a conference? Stuff like this, blousey things. That make you look like you're 40. But that got old after a while. And what's the kind of thing you wear now? No, it's like I just enjoy being kind of expressive and playful in what I wear. Before we wrap up for the day, Danielle has one more LEQ tester to visit. Joseph is 97. And he's had the robot in his home for eight months. How are you? I'm fine. How are you? Good. How has Miss LEQ been? She always tells me to take a drink of water at least four times a day. So we added a whole bunch of new facts to LEQ. Did you know that a cup of chopped red bell pepper contains more vitamin C than an orange? Okay. What did you think of that? Certainly the print was, I could see that quite clearly. What about this? Well, I can see that. Now, the Q, play music. No problem. It will begin shortly. By 2050, almost half a billion people are going to be 80 or older. And if current trends continue, more and more are going to be like Joseph and Betty, living alone. LEQ, stop. Today, both of them are doing okay. But some of Danielle's other participants have been struggling. Is it kind of hard to leave them at the end of the day? It is. Some of our testers are pretty advanced in the stages of depression through loneliness and isolation. And at times, I know that LEQ is cheering them up in their day. But I know that it's only part of the way. No source of artificial intelligence robots will ever be able to replace humans and humans in companionship or human care. The key to Danielle's work is to embrace that very limitation of machines. Robots should help humans do what they love, help humans interact with more humans, help humans in general. Not pull humans away from humans. Not take humans jobs, leave humans about purpose. Whether it's in our workplaces or in our homes, robots are soon going to be everywhere. And it's up to Danielle.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,316,2022-10-06 22:46:40
12091," about purpose. Whether it's in our workplaces or in our homes, robots are soon going to be everywhere. And it's up to Danielle to make sure this robot-filled future leaves us just a little better off. So don't be afraid. And if you are afraid, come and join us. Because I promise it's a friendly place. If you're like the estimated 74% of adults in the US who use YouTube, this might be what your home screen looks like. An algorithmically curated look into what you like to watch. Maybe some tips on how to prepare a new meal or your favorite vloggers latest video. But if you're a parent who shares your phone with your children, it probably looks a little more like this. Kids content on YouTube is huge. Views for videos can reach into the billions. Five of the top 10 videos in all of YouTube's history are either music videos or kids videos, with baby shark having more views than people on the planet. That is shark. That is shark. YouTube has created a revolution, not an evolution, in the way kids and families consume video content. And that extends then into how they view toys and play and all of the associated things that go with that. Kids YouTube for the unaware can be adorable. It can be boring. It can also just be flat out strange. But often it involves toys. And for toy makers who embrace the platform, it led to record success. And I think it was surprised on Quasher, the biggest phenomenon that has ever happened in a toy industry. This is the story of how YouTube changed kids toys. Play patterns, the way children play is timeless. But how we deliver on those play patterns through product and how we market that to children has changed quite a bit over the years. And I would say that the last five to ten years really ranks right up there with the 1950s when TV commercials directed to children was first launched by Mattel. This is Nancy's Wears. She led the Barbie brand during the 90s and spent four years as the chief marketing officer for Spin Master. It used to be that there would be a few play things that parents would bring into the home where that children would create themselves like a stick and a ball becomes a play thing. And the industry was at a certain level of volume at that point. Mattel was very innovative and actually put the first product on TV and advertised it to children. Let's play home. This created a huge explosion in the toy industry that unfolded across decades. The hit of the day when you're ready to play, everyone knows this thing. Here he comes, here he comes, radiate it for you everything. And his name is Mr. Machine. Here I go, here I go fighting man for it to go on the land of the TV air. When you go back to the 1980s, what do you think of in terms of head shows? You think",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,317,2022-10-06 22:50:57
12092," I'm ready to go on the land of the T. In the air. When you go back to the 1980s, what do you think of in terms of Hitchhows? You think of things like Mesters as a universe. You think of the original Transformers and Care Bears. The joke was they were 22-minute commercials. Just close your eyes and care. Let's make a TV show which is really promotion for our property or IP to help sell toys. There were a lot of those famous characters in which kids absolutely loved it. They were totally entertained but there were huge toy lines behind them. This is Jim Silver, a 37-year veteran of the toys industry. In 1999, he started a consumer toy review magazine called Toy Wishes. And now he's the CEO of an influencer talent management group, TTPM. Regulations changed through the years and also parents became aware that they were purely commercials and you saw a lot of the new channels, the Disney Channel and Nickelodeon. They realized that wouldn't work anymore. And to them, entertainment came before licensing. What happened over time was that toy started to become designed for a 32nd commercial. Closed at some mild matter toolbox, open at some micro-machine USA. Cruiser mini-micro-machine vehicles planes and post to the police station, the Marine of the mini-moderate cycle repair shop, the gas station, the construction office, worked the rear working rubber, highway, passenger rap and garage doors. So if you couldn't explain it in a 32nd commercial, cost-reduced it out of the product and just stick with what you could say. And features of toys, magical features using electronics, lights and sounds and mechanical movements that magic, like they don't know how it happens, that became more and more important. The sound of power is heard. Fire, movement, Batman! That man's turbo powered, that mobile flies into high gear. Since 2000, with cable channels dedicated to kids, Disney Channel, Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, there became the opportunity to reach kids and mass numbers every day of the week. And so the toy industries continued to grow. The toy industry, for the most part, was a pretty solid business. Just growing a couple of percent a year here and there. There'd be big, big years here and there when there was maybe a hit movie. Like a Star Wars movie come out, you know, drive a lot of toy sales. From 2014 to 2019, the global toy industry would grow by 15%. At about the same time, those major cable networks of Nickelodeon, Disney Channel and Cartoon Network would lose half their total audience. 2017 also saw the bankruptcy of Toys R Us. As both parents and kids discovered and bought more toys online. If you think about kids, they're usually the first adopters of a new medium. Kids weren't watching things like Nickelodeon as much as they used to. They were watching things on YouTube. YouTube started in early 2005 and this was like, you know, the very early web 2.0, this beginning of sort of like what was the time, was the moment you were generated content. Like web blogging was really big. My space was the biggest thing on the internet back then. There was an early video of a Brazilian soccer legend doing stunt tricks that just when it exploded on the site, one of the first viral videos. Lazy Sunday if you remember that SNL short. That's the chronic one, Kuzanania! Oh, Charlie! Oh, Charlie, bit me. You remember those earliest viral hits? YouTube in the early days was definitely comedy and music. It was a place of experimentation. I was the chief audience officer at Maker Studios. I oversaw essentially the creator partnerships and all over the world. Maker Studios was one of the largest multi-channel networks on YouTube and had partnered with some of the biggest YouTube channels of the time before being sold to Disney in 2014. Chris is now the CEO of PocketWatch, which represents some of the largest kids stars on YouTube, including Ryan's world and Love Diana, who can amass over a couple billion views every month. The truth is one of the very biggest and earliest videos on all of YouTube, is by a creator and star named I Justine, where she unboxed her first mobile phone bill.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,318,2022-10-06 22:55:36
12093," on all of YouTube, is by a creator and star named I Justine, where she unboxed her first mobile phone bill for her brand new iPhone and it came in a box. And this ultimately morphed into many different formats associated with unboxing and tech was actually really big. And those became fairly successful pretty early on on the platform and you know you saw them expand from tech products to beauty products and then around 2012 and 2013, which on this explosion in the toys. So here's the Furby inside right here. We used to call them handschannel. And a handschannel was literally a top-down view of someone's hands unboxing typically a toy and they'd unbox it, they'd show each component. We just got Uncle Scrooge. I would speak to many of those creators. We signed many of those creators at Maker Studios to be our partners and it was fascinating in that it was this whole new genre and this whole new format and that corresponded with a rise of kids and family viewership on YouTube that was stuck, that was hard to miss. And you would see it in the data and we had access to a lot of data in Maker Studios around YouTube. Let's see what's in size. First up we have the Storm Super Pig. You saw the launch of EvanTube who I consider the first child so to speak unboxing star and they would open toys and kids were just mesmerized by it. They loved watching it and next thing you know you had literally 50 unboxings. They were unboxing just about every toy you know it was and people were just really excited. You open the toy and you see a toy pop out and kids just got excited, see the piece by piece. He's in a bathroom wearing a he's eating a lobster. The early days of these unboxing videos the videos were from a doll's perspective just terrible. I mean they were 10 minutes long, they were boring, there was a shaky camera, there was absolutely no production value. If you think about these executives you know they're trying to figure out how to reach this new audience and they're brought these videos and say well look at this video it has 200,000 views on it and it's terrible. When I first heard of it I thought it was the weirdest thing it just seemed kind of bizarre who would want to watch someone opening a toy taking it out of the box. But then when I started thinking about this idea of exploration and discovery as a core play pattern the most fundamental play pattern there is it started to make sense and I think that I have to say that the company that that really jumped on that in the most concerted way was MGA with their launch of LOL. LOL surprise had three key elements, doll play which is you know basically the most popular play pattern there is collectible so within each LOL surprise you get a little sheet that showed you all the other dolls you collect and then the surprise factor you don't know which doll you were getting it was a blind pack as they call it and LOL was made by this company called MGA. Back then you know 2016 they were small player in the toy industry founded by this guy named Isaac Larian he's the CEO and founder. I have three adult kids and they were making fun of me that oh you're old you don't know anything about what's happening in today's sink and I said like what and they said for example there is do you know about this iPhone unboxing videos that get millions and millions of views so I thought they're pulling my leg children do to make fun of their parents and then I did go and look one night and I was frankly shocked and flabbergasted that why would you why would anybody buy an iPhone take it home and open the box and show it on the camera and everybody would go watch it so I typed toy unboxing and my god I saw",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,319,2022-10-06 22:59:46
12094," put the box and show it on the camera and everybody can go and watch it. So I typed toy on boxing. And my God, I saw so many different videos and people, kids and adults, buying toys like an apple and unboxing it and video and posting it. So that gave me an idea that why not come up with the ultimate? And that's the first LOR surprise. All right. Oh, yes, we've got a goal. LOL changed the way you open with toys and everybody saw that and the packaging became part of the play, which became part of the entertainment. So normally, if you get a package that you just open a package, you take the toy out. That's not exciting. You open up LOL. You peel it away. You open up inside. You have seven surprises. And it took off like wildfire and quickly became the top toy in the country. By December of 2018, eight of the top 10 toys sold were all LOL surprise brand. And according to MGA from 2016 to 2020, LOL would generate over $10 billion in retail sales worldwide. You know, LOL is bigger than Star Wars. It's bigger than Marble. It's bigger than Barbie. These brands with huge advertising budgets are known basically by everyone. You don't have to, you know, figure out when Marble or Star Wars is. And LOL eclipse them all. In the toy world, blind bag or blind box toys have been growing in popularity. The most famous example in recent years is Pokemon cards, where you open packs in hopes of getting a charizard, but more often wind up with something common like Bligar here. Two years before the launch of LOL in 2014, the Australian toy company Moose toys launched a blind bag collectible called Shopkins. And in 2016, Spin Master would launch a more expensive blind box toy it called Hatchimals. But the thing that sets LOL surprise apart is that it mainly focused on YouTube. And not putting ads on YouTube, but working with creators and influencers to get their products in the hands of these kids doing the unboxing videos. For MGA, actually, the move towards YouTube was kind of a bit lucky and almost out of necessity. In late 2015, Nickelodeon parent company Viacom would sue MGA for breach of contract after it failed to pay $3.5 million for the production of a TV series based on their Lala loop seat dolls. They tried to flex their muscle and they said, well, if you don't agree to our way of seeing things in the conflict that we had, they said that conflict. We are going to stop your advertisement of toys. At the time, Nickelodeon was the number one ranked children's network. And not to be able to advertise that Nickelodeon could have been a death now. But MGA, necessity is the mother of invention, that caused them to lean into digital advertising far more than any big brand had ever done before because they had to. They had to find a new way to reach kids. The court would ultimately rule in favor of Viacom, both in LA federal court and on appeal in the 9th Circuit. Larry and Blaine, the court, defeat on what he contends was judicial bias. Nickelodeon parent company Viacom didn't respond to a request for comment. So, that by itself forced us to go and say, okay, they had with Nickelodeon. Let's find another way to reach to children. And that's how we went and doubled up on YouTube, especially. And the rest, as they say, is here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,320,2022-10-06 23:04:14
12095," So early on, MGA partnered with YouTube creators with huge audiences like Cookie Swirl Singh. Good morning, Chocklady Chippy Cookies. We are going to be spending the morning with this LOL surprise baby fancy. They took it another step further. They actually helped kids learn how to do their own unboxing videos. They gave them support and learning and tools. And so all these kids got to be kind of a little mini influencer themselves as they were unboxing their LOL products. So just to give you a flavor of how popular these videos are, go onto YouTube and search LOL surprise. And you'll see videos with a million views, 10 million, 25 million, 50 million and even 100 million. There's a lot of them. And kids are watching these videos and they're probably watching them over and over again. The old way toy manufacturers would do things is they buy TV which was about 90% of their ad spend. And then traditional PR get on the big morning shows. It's an entirely different formula. It's much harder for toy companies right now because the formula is so complicated. You have to really take a deep dive into each platform. Am I promoting on Twitter? Am I promoting on Instagram? Am I promoting on TikTok? What am I doing on YouTube? You have to look at every possible social channel. By 2017 big toy brands like Mattel had shifted nearly 50 per toys. And if they were lucky, that could kick off a wave of creators making their own content around the product. In 2020 alone, tubular labs estimated that LOL related content had amassed 5.1 billion views. This idea of imitation. So when you see kids playing with product, it kind of excites the same neurons in your brain that happen when you do it yourself. The more we could show children, having this experience, the more kids felt what it would be like to have it and then wanted to experience it themselves. In one of the criticisms of this whole influencer movement among kids is that kids are young. They don't understand what's necessarily an advertisement versus real content. And that's a big criticism of this industry is that a lot of kids are getting on YouTube at young ages, not being supervised by their parents and just watching these videos. And they don't realize that maybe that influencer is getting paid by the brand to do that video or there's some other compensation. And that, you know, lures the lines for kids is sort of developing and figuring out how to consume media. And if you're a person who's not interested in advertising concerns aside, kids YouTube creators would take off. Channels like Ryan's World would grow to almost 30 million subscribers and a whole industry formed around them. When we first started working with influencers, they were very happy to work for free product. You give them the product and they do something for you. And gradually influencers got smarter and started, you know, charging for their services as they started building a following now because it is such a big business. The dollars can be significant investing in big influencers. When Spin Master launched one of its new TV series and associated product, we made a point to buy an advertising package with Ryan's World to ensure that we could get really quick, big reach right away. This is an advertisement for Spin Master. So from these unboxing videos, the content's gotten a lot more sophisticated. They're creating narratives around the toys, with voices and metta universes, if you will. And it's really engaging content, even more so than the original unboxing videos for these kids. And, you know, the content's coming out maybe once a week or even daily. So if you think about it, what they've done is they've created basically like a TV show around a toy. It's not unlike what we saw back in the 80s, which is criticized back then, by the way. We had toys like GI Joe, turn into an...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,321,2022-10-06 23:08:35
12096," Around a toy. It's not unlike what we saw back in the 80s, which was criticized back then, by the way. We had toys like GI Joe, turned into an animated series, or Masters of the Universe, or Transformers. So we've kind of seen this full circle now, right? So back to where we were, content and basically many television shows creating around toys on YouTube. Kids' content on YouTube is likely to face increased regulation in the coming years. In 2019, the company would agree on a $170 million settlement with the FTC for serving ads based on personal data to kids on YouTube. YouTube would put more emphasis behind its Made For Kids platform YouTube Kids, and each video uploaded to YouTube must be flagged as either Made For Kids or Not. In a statement outlining changes to the site, YouTube would say that Responsibility is our number one priority at YouTube, and this includes protecting kids and their privacy. Still, the site is far less regulated than traditional television. I do think parents have a better understanding of YouTube now, and the New John Risen formats there, that they didn't prior. And they now notice things like, their kid isn't watching a toy unboxing. That's a commercial for a toy. Their kid is watching other kids play with toys in an imaginative way, which inspires them to go play with things in the real world in an imaginative way. In just a few short years, YouTube had caused a transfer of power from toy and network executives to nine year olds and their families. The Koji family may have started out as toy reviewers, but now Ryan has launched his own line of toys, a cartoon series. He was even a blimp in the 2020 Macy's Thanksgiving parade. You and I might think about Spider-Man or Snoopy, but today's kids see that blimp of Ryan, and they relate to him. He's the character they want to grow up with. He's the character they want to engage with. And as we go forward, these influencers are becoming more and more like big, giant, global brands. And that has profound effects for entertainment going forward.abethe.bar Airbnb is huge today. On any given night you could have as many as two million people staying in an Airbnb all around the world. You know our mission is that everyone can belong anywhere. We're talking you know 300 million stays on any average year and there's tyranny and numbers. The vast majority of Airbnb stays don't result in a safety incident but sometimes things go wrong. And for Airbnb you know we're talking thousands of safety incidents that occur every year that the company has to handle and has to respond to. I'm talking situations like kidnappings, hostage cases, we're talking murder, we're talking rape, we're talking you know the worst violent crimes that occur in our society, happen inside Airbnb's. Airbnb never wants these kinds of cases to end up in the headlines. You know that's really bad for their brand, their reputation and their public image particularly because this is a business that's based on strangers trusting one another. So when crimes like this occur that kind of threatens their entire business model.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,322,2022-10-06 23:13:18
12097," This occur that kind of threatens their entire business model. I'm Olivia Carville. I'm a reporter on Bloomberg's technology team and I've been covering online travel companies like Airbnb for the last two years. Airbnb is a startup that's based in Silicon Valley. And like many of the sharing economy startups, it managed to grow so big, so fast by essentially skirting regulations. It was based on that premise of move fast and break things and it wanted to work against regulations in order to grow as big as possible and win the popular vote because it became so popular, so fast, that cities could no longer control it. And a peak night is past August. We had one million people from around the world coming from 180 countries in a single night staying in an Airbnb home. The vast majority of Airbnb stays. We're talking, you know, two million people staying in an Airbnb on any given night don't result in a safety incident. But sometimes things go wrong. And for the company, you know, it was dealing with these cases was a really challenging, difficult, complicated area. You had hosts and guests and sometimes they disagreed on what happened. You had regulatory issues in some of their biggest cities. Then you also had, you know, the growth of the platform and the fact that if you're going to try and prevent some of these incidents it could cut into revenue and cut into the number of listings that you have. So for Airbnb it was about trying to figure out the best way to handle these crises in a way that's going to not only protect the individual in crisis but also protect the company's public image, its brand, its reputation which is essentially what its business is based upon. As Airbnb grew, like way too big for them to be able to take all these calls alone, they developed a team of 100 highly specialized agents that handle the worst of the worst cases. Over the course of my reporting I've talked to almost 50 former employees at ADIABMB and you know, seven or eight of those work directly on this elite unit. These safety agents, many of them come from military backgrounds or trauma backgrounds. They're trained to handle traumatic situations and to try and, you know, help people who are going through what may be, you know, the worst day in their lives. For these safety agents, a lot of them understood that they had a dual role. First and foremost, they wanted to protect the user in crisis but they also knew they had a responsibility to protect the company's brand and public image. I mean everything about housing in New York is a total mess and it's always chaotic. It's not too surprising that Airbnb's biggest battle has broken out here. In 2015 was a really challenging year for Airbnb. Airbnb's listings between 2010 and 2014 were essentially illegal hotels. You know, the company was seven years old now. It had grown huge. It was now a household name. But by growing that big that fast, they also came up against, you know, a pushback in regulations. Now, Airbnb's under attack and a lot of media's are still sitting. Yeah, so what are they saying about this? They can't give up on New York because New York's too important for every kind of reason. They knew that they couldn't lose the battle in New York because it was one of their biggest markets and also it could result in a domino effect. If other cities around America saw New York City either backing down on regulations or enforcing stricter regulations, that could in turn be rolled out right across the country. I think it's going to be awkward when they have to, you know, putting their perspectives, their risk factors when they have to say, well, you know, one risk is that the whole thing might be somewhat illegal in our biggest market. And in December of that year, a young woman from Australia flew into New York and stayed in an Airbnb with a group of her friends. They picked up a key.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,323,2022-10-06 23:17:10
12098," a group of her friends. They picked up a key from the local corner bodega without even needing identification. The police report said this 29-year-old woman left her friends at a midtown bar and returned to the Airbnb on her own. She thought that she was alone, but she wasn't. There was a man inside the apartment, hiding in the shadows with a kitchen knife. He grabbed her, dragged her into a room, and raped her. He laid a fled. About an hour after this attack, he came back and police were in the apartment at the time. They opened his backpack and found three items of interest. The kitchen knife, one of the woman's earrings, and a set of keys to the Airbnb. This case was a really complicated one for Airbnb, partly because it occurred in New York City, where they were fighting this really tough battle with city officials over regulations, and partly because the alleged rapist had the keys and he was inside the apartment. That meant that Airbnb needed to do what it could to protect itself. They wanted to find out, you know, how did he get the keys? That was a really big question for them. They launched an investigation to find that out. But before they did anything like that, before they thought to kind of protect their own reputation here, they really focused on doing what they could to help this young woman. They paid for her to move to a hotel. They paid for her mother to fly in from Australia. They paid for both of them to fly home. They offered to cover any health or leave or canceling costs that she might need later. But inside the company internally, they also launched an investigation. They wanted to know how did the alleged rapist get the keys? How did he get inside that Airbnb? And when they found out that the keys had been left at the corner of Odaiga, that then created, you know, a problem of liability for Airbnb. They didn't have a policy around key exchange. They didn't tell their hosts how they did or didn't have to hand keys over to guests as they were arriving. So for Airbnb, they also, you know, they wanted to know what was going to be said in court. They wanted to know if any media were going to pick up on this story. And they wanted to know what their legal liability potentially could be. A week later, the alleged rapist was indicted in the Supreme Court in New York. An Airbnb sent a staff member to find out if the company was going to be mentioned in any of the court records. And it wasn't. It wasn't mentioned in the police report. It wasn't mentioned by prosecutors. There's no mention of Airbnb really in any public record. This case has never been reported until now. And, you know, for Airbnb, that was kind of lucky. This case never landed in the media. And, you know, 18 months later, when this woman's lawyer reached out to the company, they signed a settlement for $7 million. And part of that settlement, there's a clause that says she cannot assert or imply responsibility on the part of the company. We've spoken to legal experts who indicate that what this really did is gag the woman from saying, I blame Airbnb. Airbnb is one of the few companies in the world that has this like online offline kind of hybrid situation where you have users who meet online and then actually meet in the offline world and stay under the same roof. And that means that the company at the end of the day really has to take more responsibility than other social media platforms might do. With the Airbnb's terms of service, that really means that when you...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,324,2022-10-06 23:21:29
12099," At the end of the day, really has to take more responsibility than other social media platforms might do. With the Airbnb's terms of service, that really means that whenever there's a dispute between hosts and guests and the company, this is all handled behind closed doors in arbitration. Most of these cases don't even make it to the courtroom. And when they do, the company will settle them so it doesn't go on through the courts. And what that means is that there hasn't really been a legal precedent that's set to determine what your Airbnb's liability is here. You know, is it really responsible for when things go wrong inside its listings? What I learned over the course of my reporting is that this is anything but simple. This is a complicated, nuanced area. There are difficult trade-offs here. The company also has to have hard, you know, tough conversations about policy. Airbnb's business model is based on strangers trusting one another. We often hear from the founders and the chief executive himself saying trust is their number one priority. I've actually heard Brian Cheske, the chief executive of Airbnb, talking about how he didn't build a website or a platform that allows people to stay in each other's homes, what he built was a community that trusts one another. And when that premise is undercut, Airbnb's entire business model is under threat. Sounds far-effectured at the moment, doesn't it? But you know, we may be seeing ads like this in the not-too-distant future. Living away from Earth has always captured our imagination. As well as providing the basics for survival, these ideas are a symbol of humankind's unique creativity and ambition. This advanced beast or a species station would be hit quadrace for the final descent to the moon. Today, the idea of multiple outposts where we can live and work in space has never seen closer. We're going to fly. It's about making our lives the best we can make it. It's about as a species having a path for our future. And the mission to create these habitats is well underway as private companies get ready to take that next giant leap. The International Space Station, it's the only space habitat we have. One of the first places they take you in the ISS is the Kupala. So you can finally look at the Earth in all its beauty in it. I don't care who you are, it's always stunning, it's shocking, it's amazing because that's the view you've been waiting for your entire life. It passes over 90% of the world's population without most of us ever realizing. And at an estimated cost of $150 billion, it's the most expensive object we've ever built. You can think about the cysteine chapel, the pyramids, and the Burj Khalifa, or take your pick. I mean, it far outstrips those. It's the one and only nontrust real human outpost. We've had a constant human footprint in orbit for almost 20 years.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,325,2022-10-06 23:25:51
12100," Far outstrips those. It's the one and only non-terrestrial human outposts. We've had a constant human footprint in orbit for almost 20 years because of the International Space Station. The collaboration between 15 countries started construction in 1998 and was pieced together in space over the course of a decade. Since 2000 it's been a permanently crude research laboratory, a space habitat that's allowed human kind to live, manufacture and explore beyond Earth. The overarching achievement of the space station has been education. It has educated us about how to do research, it's educated us about how to live, it's educated us about the harshness of the environment that it is in. It's about learning I think. People say what was one of your favorite parts about being up there, hands down, floating everywhere I went. But your first impressions for ISS certainly is how big it is. The ISS is a size of an American football field. With most of that footprint taken up by eight solar arrays, these provide enough energy to power 40 homes. The station has an American side and a Russian side, as well as contributions from other nations like Canada, Japan and the European Union. Astronauts on board can pass freely between these sections. They're living and working areas are made up of modules, each 4.2 meters in diameter, and in total they have the same volume as a Boeing 747. The three main labs, destiny, hope and Columbus, are conducting up to 600 ongoing experiments at any one time. And while it's been a collaboration between governments to build and maintain the ISS, its next chapter will rely more on private enterprise. Today is a very remarkable day. NASA is opening the International Space Station to commercial opportunities and marketing these opportunities as we've never done before. Managing and maintaining the ISS costs $3.4 billion a year. That's over half NASA's Space Operations budget. Aging hardware and space debris will only add to these costs, which is why NASA is now hoping to pass some responsibility for the station over to commercial companies. We would like to see a robust commercial marketplace in lower orbit where space stations exist outside of NASA. The goal being that NASA could be a customer and we want to have numerous providers that are competing against each other on cost and innovation. With federal funding proposed to stop in 2025, opening the station to private enterprise would free up resources for the space agency's ambitions to return to the moon and journey to Mars. Transfrancumeral and commercial model is allowing industry to take over many of those areas that NASA has traditionally been responsible for, like the design and operations and maintenance of space systems. But the most exciting part I think is new opportunities. The iPhones would have never come from the government, for instance. The base technology came from the government, but the way it's used, the way it interacts with consumers, governments aren't really built for that. So I think that would be exciting to see how private industry uses the same technology or the same systems, but then use them in a different way. Every NASA achievement has been the collaborative achievement of NASA and industry. What's going on right now that's a little bit different is NASA is turning to companies not to direct them what to do, but it's turning to companies to build relationships with them because those companies are attracting investment from non-space sources and are bringing a different kind of innovation to the table. In the shadow of NASA's sprawling Johnson Space Center, the headquarters of startup Axiom Space might seem a little modest, but their goal is big to build the first commercial space station. Led by a former ISS program manager, the team has been involved in every mission to the station since its inception. We know it has to be much lower cost operate on orbit than ISS is today, so this is key to continuing the heritage of ISS. It's to start there so we can evolve everybody to the next platform. I like this too.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,326,2022-10-06 23:30:11
12101," So this is key to continuing the heritage of ISS. I liken this to the Internet. So the Internet was created and we got very excited. And any kid with a good idea and just the basic programming skills could go build a program to do something. We have huge companies that grew out of that and still today there's new ideas, new things being built. It's limitless. It's like the data we have access to on the Internet is limitless. And it is not immediately obvious to us all the benefits that that's going to entail. But over time it will become very, very obvious. By 2024, Axiom plans to send a central node to attach to the ISS. That will make up the core of their new station. This will be followed by crew quarters for 16 people in research and manufacturing modules. When the ISS is retired, this will break away. An additional modules with a lifespan of 30 years will be added and swapped out as they age using a robotic arm. And they're hoping to do all of this for 150th, the cost of the ISS. I mean when you talk about our vision, it sounds really simple. It really is about driving the thought process and the cost down so that anybody that wants to take advantage of our place. And a microgravity environment can do so. That's really it. The International Space Station is a fantastic vehicle. But one of the big things is they have quite a few major components outside. Which means you have to do an EVA, a spacewalk to go fix it. A spacewalk on a good day is 100 hours of crew time to get ready and actually go do the spacewalk. So we're able to take advantage of the reduced size of components. And so our design is going to have all of the components going to be in the personalized environment. So we know what the basics are, you know, water, food, clothing, life support. And we know how to handle those. But now the next step is how do we make it more intuitive? And we want to now take advantage of the technologies and the capabilities that have today to build more luxury into the experience. The objective is to make the environment the background for all the users. You're everyday doing whatever you want to do on orbit, research, manufacturing, looking out the window. Whatever you're there to do, we want you to be able to do that not even think about the environment. And it's because of our experience on ISS and what the team brings to the Axiom space, we're able to build that environment. You won't worry about that. Three, two, one. Release, release, release. Fire, fire. Like Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin, Axiom is hoping to attract space tourists with tickets starting at $55 million for a 10-day mission. But that's just one part of the commercial space station market that they think could be worth $37 billion over the next decade. Our first commercial customers are countries who have astronauts in space and want to expand their activity in space. And countries who do not yet have a human spaceflight program who want to send people up. And we've now got both research and manufacturing companies who want to do work with us while we're at the International Space Station and on our platform after it separates from ISS. Human spaceflight is particularly exciting because it's that slice of space that is really nested. It hasn't undergone the crowding that satellites have had. It hasn't already had that explosive growth. It's really ready for that now. The first thing I'm really looking forward to seeing happen is the face of our first astronauts on orbit looking back down on us and knowing that we had a hand in sending that person to space. And ultimately the separation of ISS when it's ready to be retired and de-orbited and then we continue in space independently. For me that is a stepping-off moment for humanity. It's almost like when Neil Armstrong put that first boot on the moon. This will be the first time that we've gone from a platform of learning how to live in space to building our permanent home in space. Other private companies also want to use the ISS as a starting point for their own ventures. Bigelow Aerospace already has one of its inflatable structures attached to the station and others including sea...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,327,2022-10-06 23:34:33
12102," for their own ventures. Bigelow Aerospace already has one of its inflatable structures attached to the station, and others, including Sierra Nevada and Nanorax, have put forward proposals. Space habitats are expensive. I think it's a false dichotomy to say, okay, we're done with the International Space Station. Let's move on to commercial platforms. What I think is much more likely and realistic in what NASA is certainly driving toward is an incremental transition where commercial platforms attach to the space station or work collaboratively with the space station. The next chapter cannot occur without the active engagement of companies. That said, that active engagement might not be as customers, might not be as drivers, it might be in service of government mission objectives. We will return American astronauts to the moon, not only to leave behind footprints and flags, but to build the foundation we need to send Americans to Mars and beyond. This proposed mission, along with SpaceX's own ambition to reach your red planet, has opened up a longer-term market, and some companies are already thinking beyond orbiting habitats like space stations to actually building on the surface of other planets. I was working in a firm designing skyscrapers, and you know, I saw Elon and he landed his rocket next rocket in the middle of the ocean, and that for me was a trigger. I thought, wow, this could actually happen, and it's always been my dream to put a building on the moon or Mars, and if he's going at the pace he's going, it could definitely happen within my lifetime, and I want to be the one to build it. In this warehouse, alongside startups from across the US, architecture firm A.I. Space Factory are refining the production of Marsha, a four-story structure they created for a NASA competition to design the next generation of space habitats on Mars. You know, when we started designing our Mars habitat, Marsha, I think we looked at everything that had been done already and kind of tossed that aside. But what we were given was a set of guidelines from NASA. They think the best way to build a habitat on Mars or the moon is to use what they call in-situ resource utilization, so use the materials that are there. If you've seen sci-fi movies, you might see like glass and steel domes on distant planets, but the reality is to ship that kind of material to the moon or Mars would be so exhortantly expensive you would never be able to build in the first place. So the idea is to send a 3D printing robot, which can then harvest the materials you find on a site, and build with that. The reusable print material is a mix of biopolymer, made from recycled plastic or plants like corn and sugar cane and basalt, a rock found on Mars and Earth. It's the rock that gives us its incredible strength. We've tested this material. It's three times as strong as concrete in compression and it actually has what we call it a tensile capacity and prevent itself from being pulled apart, which is something concrete is not very good at. You need to think at all times how do you optimize the amount of material that you use. And that's also why this thing is shaped like an egg. And if you think of an egg, it's a very structurally optimized form. It's very, very thin, but it provides the strength that the egg needs. And that's why this is shaped the way that it is. The egg shape, as well as the nested shell structure, also accommodates for extreme differences in pressure and temperature on the surface of Mars. But more research still needs to be done to find out how print materials could be gathered and how 3D printing would work in a unique environment of space. You're dealing with a completely different set of physics and environments, which is very harsh. The cold, you know, the low gravity, the vacuum of space, you know, and finding solutions for how to build our door or do anything in space just requires a high degree of innovation. There's no such thing as brute force when it comes to space. Like you need to think about the problem, find a very elegant, lightweight, cost-effective solution. The next challenge is really going to places on Earth, literally taking the dirt that we're finding on a site and beginning to print with the dirt. We have to perfect this technology on Earth, and then we go prove it out on the moon and then finally on to Mars. The first customer's could include...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,328,2022-10-06 23:38:55
12103," We have to perfect this technology on Earth and then we go prove it out on the moon and then finally on to Mars. The first customers could include NASA and companies like SpaceX who would lease out these structures for individual missions. But before that, AI space factory hoped their technology could be monetized as well as transformational here on Earth. The challenges of building on Mars forced us to kind of make this jump in construction technology which we can now apply on Earth to build more sustainably. So rather than building with steel and concrete which are these manufactured very energy intensive materials to go to a site, have a solar-powered array that would then allow our 3D printer to print in the most sustainable way possible. And we never would have found these ways that wasn't for the challenge of building in space. 3, 2, 1, ignition and lift off of the Falcon 9 to the Space Station on the first commercial launch from Kennedy Space Centers historic had 39A. Humans have now been consistently living and working in space for more than 15 years. And if we want to keep that up, what do habitats need to look like? And frankly, they can be larger, they can be small. But the future of space habitats really to me comes down to the ability to persistently maintain human presence. Whether that's a few people or many people, that seems to be the dividing line between where we were before and where we want to be in the future. We have to learn how to benefit from what we do on orbit and bring those natural benefits back home. So we help up ourselves out on the ground while we also learn to live somewhere else. And it really, at the very deepest level, is about survival or species. So I get pretty excited when I spend a few moments thinking about what we're off to go do, because this really is the first step to learning to live off the planet. That first step is just the start of our journey to create a lasting legacy in space. While commercial companies may be stepping in to imagine what these new space habitats look like, it's what's happening inside of them that may unlock the future of space industrialisation. On the next episode of Giant Leap, we'll visit the private companies who are looking to build their business around manufacturing in space. Using the unique properties of microgravity, they plan to create new materials with extraordinary qualities that can't be replicated on Earth. Including new manufacturing techniques that could change how we build large structures in space and even unlock the ability to 3D print full human organs. But before low Earth orbit can become a new industrial centre, we're going to need to take another giant leap. This is how it used to work. A real estate agent would lock in the client, stage the place, hold an open house every single weekend, and hope that the right buyer walks through that door. 10 years ago you could probably go look at a house and circle back 2-3 weeks later and still have an opportunity to make a bid. The first time I received a lead through Instagram, my mind was blown. If you're seeing something in a neighbourhood that is established, you have 2-3 days after the open house in this market to make an offer.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,329,2022-10-06 23:43:03
12104," Received a lead through Instagram, my mind was blown. If you're seeing something in a neighborhood that is established, you have two to three days after the open house in this market to make an offer. Our world has shifted so much. Folks are getting comfortable doing business either through social media or 100% virtual. Social media, like everything else it touches, has turned the real estate business upside down. You've heard this trope before. Millennials aren't buying and owning as much as their parents' generation. Be it a car, a diamond, or a home. But the lack of ownership is not always by choice. In 2018, a survey found that 89% of Millennial Americans want to buy a home. They just can't afford it. As of 2019, Millennials of all stripes owned only 5% of US housing, compared with 15% for gen-exers. Millennials haven't been able to make these big ticket purchases the same way as their predecessors did. Now this is down to the financial crisis. We have rising student loan debt and a higher cost of living. Now, Millennials are getting older. They're earning more money and saving more. So now is about the time where a lot of them are going out and making those purchases. And now, having been stuck at home for over a year, the same generation that embraced ubers and Airbnb's want something to call their own. I got married and I have a child, so looking for more space and thought about a conventional route of young and single and living the city and then move out to the suburbs, we have a kid and a wife. I've seen a whole bunch of my friends just move on down to the West Palm Beach, my AMI area, Austin, Texas. So they are certainly moving out of the city, but space was top of mind for them moving out. We lived in Williamsburg for about 16 plus years and week two in the pandemic, we just realized. We needed more. So we started looking for a house right away. We now live in Gosha, New York, which is about an hour and a half from New York City. Instagram accounts like circus houses and cheap old houses offer a glimpse into the perfect suburban life, often at a price point not too dissimilar to what adults pay for rent in major cities. By the end of 2020, New Yorkers who didn't flee paid an average of $2,700 a month for an apartment, even as rent prices plummeted during the pandemic. Millennials make a large percentage of spending right now and that makes them a valuable consumer for brands. That means they're being courted by everyone out there to spend with them. They grew up online. They're comfortable with pretty much anything that you can do there, and that's buying things, selling things, Craigslist, eBay, all that. Making a $100 purchase on Craigslist or a $1,000 purchase on eBay, it's not that much of a leap to go even further if you're buying a fancy piece of jewelry or a house for a million bucks. The uptick and home demand fueled by the pandemic combined with record low interest rates has made home buying extremely competitive over the last year. So much so that some millennials look to social media to shop and actually buy their first house site unseen. I saw sort of something on my Instagram feed and you know clicked and we ended up seeing this house. Houses weren't really being shown at that time because we were in full lockdown. We became really interested in one YouTube video, 20 Z-LO photos, and that is it. The Red Hot Housing Market spells opportunities for developers targeting this demographic, getting eyeballs strictly through social media. People are not looking in the back section of the times anymore for real estate listings. Our demographic is between late 20s to mid 40s and that demographic is spending a lot of time on social media and they're doing a lot of shopping via Instagram and other social media platforms. This is Joshua Gelb and Pele Hamburger. During the pandemic, the two New York City-based developers started Neville House, a new construction project two hours north of the city. Unlike most traditional real estate listings, the pair bypassed the use of a broker and advertised their homes directly on Instagram. No fees, no commissions.

12105," the use of a broker and advertise their homes directly on Instagram. No fees, no commissions. You used to have to hire a broker, work with them, they would do showings on site. Now you basically put your renderings on Instagram and within an hour you have 15, 20 replies saying can I come see it directly with you and let's see it tomorrow and it's just completely changed the game. Most people have that image in their head of the quid essential, upstate, modern cabin set in the woods. We've definitely tried to tap into that and create something that's attainable for these people. Say you can have that, you can be swiping through Instagram and that can be your home too. There's been quite a proliferation of these direct to consumer brands. There's just tons of them out there. It's not that hard to start up a website that sells things and get things manufactured for that e-commerce platform. So like all birds with shoes, casper with mattresses or warby parker with glasses. All of that means a lot more opportunity for brands in the online shopping space. So it's natural that real estate would want to get involved as well with these big ticket items. Ten years ago the broker would drive the search. Now I think that my clients text me listings, they have alerts, they find things quicker than we do sometimes because we're out and about. I'd say that the buyer is much more involved these days. Social selling is creating brand new ways to shop. So let's look at vintage clothing for example. There are sellers on Instagram finding successful ways to sell one of a kind items. It's that fleeting nature, the ephemeral nature of social media. You post the item online and whoever's first gets that one of a kind item. Now real estate has similar scarcity to it. There's one place to buy. It's one home, one apartment, one thing. It's one of a kind. But the rise in social media real estate isn't just about the instant gratification. Researcher Andre Perry, who studies economic inclusion at the Brookings Institute, says social media has evolved from the days of online hangout spaces and mood boards to a powerful change agent. Social media is a primary source to get news and information. But it's not just about social media. It's about the movement that we're in. The racial justice uprising really gave people a sense of worth and empowerment. And so people not only are getting information about what protects people in the long run from economic shocks, things like wealth. In his research, Andre found that not only are more millennials buying homes during the pandemic, the rate of home ownership among black millennials are at historic highs. The fastest way to accumulate wealth in this country traditionally has been through home ownership. Millenials in particular are saying, hey, I want protection. I want to live longer. I want my education to go further. Let me acquire wealth and the fastest way to do that is through home ownership. When the pandemic hit many of the amenities or the comforts that came along with those living conditions were gone. Folks couldn't go to bars and fancy shops. And so you saw instead of people going out and buying clothes, they saved their money and bought property and outside of the city generally. People are moving to the suburbs, to rural areas, places where home prices are a little bit cheaper. Many home buyers are looking for houses outside the major metropolitan areas. Additionally, many home buyers are looking for direct outdoor access and added space as the uncertainty about the virus persist. Millennials are also looking to influencers not just for the latest trends and TikTok dances, but to partake in important conversations, be it about politics or personal finance or anything in between. Relic state ownership. Let's start small. Let's don't be scared to start small. Instead, instead of renting a big house in the hills and California like most artists do buy you one that's on the flat. I meet folks like Brandon Rool and Charlemagne the God. You have residential real estate and you have commercial real estate. They're talking about buying homes.

12106," They're talking about buying homes. When I was coming up, really home buying was a mysterious shrouded process that only a few people could teach me. Now I can easily log on to Clubhouse or Instagram and find literally lessons on how to purchase a home, but done with savvy and finesse. Today we're going to make a greenhouse. I am DIY-ing the entire closet. Heather, having bought her fixer upper sight on scene, also looked to internet personalities to help figure out how to modernize and to make sure her home was also an investment. It gave us a lot of confidence. They make it look super easy. How we could do all of those things ourselves. My husband just installed a laundry shoe, which is something we never would have thought of if we didn't see an influencer do that and how easy it actually is. Really simple to do it yourself project. You can do that. If you have any questions, go ahead and message me. And in the case of Neville House, Josh and Paley hope that buyers see these homes as potential secondary income. These young families look at these products and look at our homes and say, here's a turnkey, this can serve our family, but this can also be the perfect rental. We've tried to strike a balance in the design of the home for working well as a family home. That's going to be lived in and also working as an investment. A lot of this is points to how millennials can utilize and leverage social media to their benefit. But it also speaks to again, this moment that folks want freedom. So millennials are really stepping up to this real estate game and taking ownership and building well. Of course, not everything is as it seems online. While social media can be a useful tool for learning, there's still a lot it can't tell you about the home buying experience or living in the suburbs for that matter. We knew going into it, budgeting for a lot of renovations. We kind of thought if we buy it at $450, we could put $300,000 into the house and really make it ours and our own. I can't wait to replace in this kitchen and update our built-in deep fryer, which was not in the listing photos. We kind of got into the house and we realized that budget was completely unrealistic. We have a lot of people who see our design on Instagram and they say, I love it. Can you come build this on my property? And then they'll send us the lot which they bought site unseen during COVID and because of site conditions or zoning, it's virtually unbuildable. I think we all know that what you see on Instagram and what you see in real life are two very different things. So while we can definitely as brokers create these fantastic narratives, the one recommendation that I would give is do your homework. Don't believe everything you say. That's not to say that there's dishonesty or anything where people are trying to manipulate you but not everything you see is accurate. This shift towards social media house hunting may also help to bring equilibrium to a market that has historically disadvantaged specific groups of buyers. Many of the traditional ways that people got mortgages or loans often precluded black people because they deemed us too risky for those loans. With technology, there's ways to get around that. As long as more black people get educated on racism and discrimination and lending, we're going to figure out ways to get around that racism. So the following issue is start at maybe deep PF",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,332,2022-10-06 23:56:23
