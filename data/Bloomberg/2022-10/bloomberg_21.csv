16362," and in boxing, the Muhammad Ali Act, which restricts the kinds of contract terms that can be imposed on boxers. The fighters who brought this lawsuit see it as the continuation of a tradition in sports, of athletes fighting to have agency and power in the terms of their work and who they do it for. Mixed Martial Arts used to be pretty culturally and legally French in the United States. It was banned by most states. John McCain had famously called it human cock fighting. There are some rules in the UFC, but to a large extent, all sorts of body parts and tactics and attacks are on the table. And people get seriously injured at times. My nose has been broken multiple times. I had my right pectoral torn off, had to get that reattached. I've had my jaw broken to two places, I've had my neck broken. I had my left ankle broken, had to get that repaired. I've had a torn right labor in my shoulder. He broke my eyeball, I mean the bone that holds up my eyeball. I've had my left eye, orbital fracture, twice where my eye caved in. I was walling my own blood, and I knew, don't blow your nose or both eyes of the bone. At the time that UFC was bought for just $2 million by the former boxing coach, Dana White, and a casino owner. He'd been friends with Lorenzo Fertita and his brother Frank Fertita. UFC was struggling, as were other mixed martial arts promoters. It was pretty much a fixer-upper. The money that they spent to actually purchase it for $2 million was much less than the money they quickly had to sink into it in order to revitalize it. They've hold off a multi-pronged strategy that was quite successful. First, they did what White has referred to as running towards regulation. They found ways to make compromises with state regulators so that the sport would not be illegal. And at the same time, they also popularized it. They made gambles like paying the production costs themselves for the first season of a reality TV show, The Ultimate Fighter on Spike TV. It is the All Over! It is the All Over! The All-Termen Fighter! UFC, Under Dana White, had a gift for weaving, compelling personal narratives and rivalries, people throwing shoes, a guy coming to the octagon with who let the dogs out playing while he was dragging another guy on a leash. My first contract with the UFC is kind of an interesting story because here I am on this reality show The Ultimate Fighter. And they started to realize how big of a stepping stone this was going to be for the UFC. It's at us all down individually. We realized that this is going to be huge and we really want to have you all a part of the UFC family moving forward. So we want to go ahead and get this out of the way, just sign this simple contract and we'll be able to move forward as one unit. But as I'm looking at this thick contract and wondering what I should do, Dana White looks at me and says, don't worry, this thing takes off, we'll take care of you. The fighters would say at the heart of UFC's power is the contracts that it signs with fighters. Before boxing had competition boxing used to be dominated by a few dominant promoters and the contracts were ported over from boxing. And the contracts are basically designed to control every aspect of a fighter's career. They're long-term. They last multiple fights. Fighters under these contracts are bound to fight only for UFC for a period of time. And UFC can extend that time if a fighter declines a match or if a fighter gets injured. They control who the fighter fights, they control when the fighter fights and then they have a number of different...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4708,2022-10-20 00:02:49
16363," Fighter fights, they control when the fighter fights, and then they have a number of different clauses that make it very difficult for a fighter to ever break free from UFC if that fighter ever did want to become a creation. Contracts are so one-sided, there really is no negotiation room for any of the things, especially as you're coming up and as their stranglehold on the sport of MMA got so much stronger. Part of what's at the heart of this lawsuit is the ways that UFC successfully took other competitors off the board. The UFC had such a stranglehold on mixed martial arts and as they were buying up so much of the competition shutting them all down, they really became the only option for anybody that wanted to do this professionally. If you follow Dana White's Twitter or watch him on YouTube, you could have seen Dana White calling himself the grim reaper and bragging about how he has defeated or derailed or acquired one after another company that tried to compete with the UFC. In 2011, UFC acquired Strike Force, which at the time was the most prominent rival still standing. The CEO of Strike Force Scott Koker has said in the past that he saw himself like Luke Skywalker up against the Death Star trying to compete with UFC. Eventually when Strike Force was bought out by UFC, my only option was go to UFC because they had the rest of my contract. Now I'm under a contract where it's only an 18 month contract with six fights, but five years later, I'm still stuck in the contract. The month before UFC's parent company Zufa completed its acquisition of Strike Force, a UFC executive sent an email and the subject line of that email was we own MMA. And the UFC has admitted in documents that have now become public that they've almost never lost a fighter that they wanted to keep. In internal UFC emails, we now know the company referred to what it was doing as choking off oxygen to the competition. The most important oxygen that UFC allegedly ran afoul of the law by cutting off two its competitors is the fighters themselves. And not only did they make it clear to us, they made it clear to the whole mixed martial arts world, there is no negotiating. These are our very strict never-ending contracts, and that's the case for this day. The UFC just says, oh you want to fight for us, you sign here, if you don't want to, we've got 20 other guys that'll take your spot. They have 70, 80, 90 percent of the top fighters under exclusive contract, meaning that those fighters are not available to any other MMA promoter. And fighters, even if they wiggled their way out of the very restrictive contracts that UFC imposed on them, didn't have another professional mixed martial arts option because there weren't robust rivals to go sell their work to. On Tuesday afternoon, a class action lawsuit was filed in US District Court in San Jose against a Zufa LLC with fighters, Kung Li, Nate Quarry, and John Fitch attached to the suit. Rampe Jassin came to me and says, hey, Kung, I know this lawyer, he will.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4709,2022-10-20 00:07:05
16364," against Zufa LLC with fighters Kung Lee, Nate Quarry, and John Fitch attached to the suit. Ram paid Jassin, came to me, says, hey, Kong, I know this lawyer, he will help get the fairness for the fighters in the market place. And I decided I wanted to step up for all the fighters that he affected. At the end of 2014, more than six years ago now, a group of now all former fighters filed anti-trust class action lawsuit against UFC. And in broad terms, the case is an antitrust case where we're claiming that the UFC is both a monopoly and a monopsony. Usually when we talk about monopoly, we're talking about the power that a company has when it becomes the only one selling something. Monopsony is about the power of being a monopoly purchaser of something. And particularly a monopoly purchaser of labor. A key argument in this lawsuit has been about as UFC succeeds and its revenue sores, how much should we expect that absent illegal conduct, the fighters pay would soar as well. In UFC year after year, the share of the company is revenue that goes to actually paying the workers doing the fighting has hovered around or below 20%. And what this analysis shows through complex statistical regression modeling is that if the UFC was competitive and did not allegedly violate the antitrust laws, it would pay its fighters 50% or more of the revenues is generated just like baseball, just like hockey, just like basketball, boxing. If instead of paying 20% of the revenues generated, it paid 50% or more of the revenues generated, the fighters would have made $1.6 billion more during the period that we measured 2010 to 2017. Sometimes when you write about allegations against companies and particularly about lawsuits against companies, those companies don't want to say a whole lot about them or are pretty dismissive of the significance of litigation against them. UFC in their comments to me has been pretty feisty about this, saying that they see this lawsuit actually as a threat to the ability of businesses to take risks and succeed, and that they don't want to roll over, that they want to fight it and they want to defeat it. The fighters I talked to describe having side jobs, being reliant on UFC in part because after taxes and expenses, they weren't making enough money to feel financially secure. The overview of my career from a financial perspective is something that had a challenge in admitting, I can tell you now that I lived in my mom's detach from the entire time I was fighting in a hand. The second job is about turning a bartender, the third job is a personal trainer, just to make ends meet. Nate Quarry told me that over his time in UFC, he fought fights while he was tens of thousands of dollars in debt coming into the fight. It gets so disheartening because I've seen fights that are called the fight of the year. This is just a brutal war and they battled for four and a half rounds until one guy's body just gave up and then you find out, oh, that guy made $60,000 for that fight. In one of the hearings in this lawsuit, UFC's attorney argued that if the fighters were really the product, if all that UFC were selling were the fighters, then the fighters wouldn't need UFC at all. That a fighter is not themselves the UFC product any more than an Apple engineer who makes a cool iPhone is the product that Apple is selling. We the fighters make this whole thing happen and it's been driven by Chuck LaDell. It's been driven by Rani Gatorz.

It's been driven by Brock Lesnar. It's been driven by all the greats that have walked before us and that walk this path right now. We are the product. If the fighters are not the product, then go ahead and release us from our contracts. You'll do fine without us, clearly. It's the identity and rank and popularity of those fighters that attract the eyeballs and make the sport what it is. And if you can lock all those up and keep them from other promotions, you can dominate the sport, which is what they've admitted they've done. William Isaacson, a lawyer for UFC, said in a statement that UFC has spent many years building a world-class organization enhancing the brand of our athletes and championing the sport of MMA. UFC pays its fighters more than any other MMA promoter with average fighter compensation rising by over 600% since 2005. Our efforts have raised the global popularity of the sport and the overall revenue potential of all MMA organizations and athletes. In December of 2020, the judge announced a crucial step in this lawsuit, which is that he is going to certify it as a class action. Class certification makes this lawsuit a much more significant threat to UFC and the judge made clear long before saying how he planned to rule that he expected whatever he did to be appealed into federal appeals court and on from there to the US Supreme Court. So we are likely in for many more months and years of wrangling over this. Kyle Kingsbury said that he doesn't think any settlement would be acceptable unless it includes a change to the restrictive contracts that UFC uses to keep fighters bound to the UFC. My son is about to turn six years old and it started when he was in the womb. You know, we are in this thing to the end to change the sport forever. We want the same freedoms that are offered in any other major sport. Every other major sport has gone through what we are going through right now. People tell fighters, you know, just shut up. Look at how lucky you are. Well, no, actually we are fighting for what we believe in. We are going to continue being fighters. That's how we are made. Every nation that's a coastal state has some region of the sea floor that falls in their territorial waters and many countries including the US, the area that's underwater exceeds the area that's above water. So huge amounts of nations, areas and regions are just really unexplored, uncharacterized. We don't really know what's there. We know less about our sea bed than we do about the surface of the moon or Mars. Only 20% of it has been mapped. A map of the sea floor could lead to all kinds of discoveries like numerous species and rare earth minerals like cobalt that we need for electric cars and mobile phones.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4711,2022-10-20 00:16:20
16366," Up of the seafloor could lead to all kinds of discoveries, like numerous species, and rare earth minerals like cobalt that we need for electric cars and mobile phones. The value of all the gold deposits are loan on the seafloor is estimated to be around $150 trillion. A map could also help us when tragedy strikes. Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared from radar screens. The mapping of the ocean floor is being carried out, the problem is that the southern Indian ocean is just so incredibly huge. To me, a map is a fundamental piece of understanding of who we are, where we are, where things are. Once you understand something, you start to value it more. When you start to value something, that's when you start to really think about making it healthy and preserving it and keeping it going. A map is the first step. It's the basic understanding that you need to figure out where you are. Oceans. They cover over 70% of the planet, but most of what lies underneath is a mystery. The seafloor is a really fascinating landscape. We don't have a lot of data to describe the shape of it in detail, but in places where we do, there are spectacular features, there's meandering channels with all kinds of interesting topography, there are canyons, there are sea mounts, mid ocean ridges, all kinds of things that we see on land that are just basically hidden from us by the water. As it stands, this is what a map of the seabed looks like. All that black? Those are the parts we haven't mapped yet. At present, most people think that the seafloor is actually mapped because you'll see a world ocean map and you can see some shape of the seafloor, but most of that is based on prediction. Roughly 80% of what you see for the world ocean floor is modeled based on measurements of the sea surface height and a computation based on gravity. In 2017, the Nippon Foundation and the General Barthometric Chart of the Oceans, or Jebco, launched seabed 2030. It's a collaborative project to collect and collate data oceanwide and create a complete map of the seafloor by the end of the decade. To do this would take one ship around 350 years at a cost of up to $3 billion. That's why data is harvested by all kinds of vessels from fishing boats to freighters. Because there is so little data, it's important that vessels that are capable and willing to acquire data when they're just moving around the ocean do so. So we have a lot of data that's collected during transit. There's a lot of academic requirements to make data publicly available. There's industry data that's starting to become more and more available. There's government data. So there's a lot of different ways that this data is coming in and it's a really messy and challenging puzzle to put together. But what's exciting is that it's a puzzle to put together. Since seabed 2030 launched, the area map has risen to 20%, and all the information collected is freely available. The more data we have, collectively, and other people can access, the faster the discoveries are made, which really pushes forward our understanding at a faster rate than if you held on to that data and it was only you with that data. Things like machine learning and artificial intelligence are also going to kick in in the next decade. Because with all this data, they'll be able to make connections that are a lot faster than perhaps we would have been able to, which then, again, feeds our human understanding and also gives us new ideas, new ways of thinking, of exploration. Until the early 20th century, mapping technology was simple. Usually a weight attached to a long rope known as a lead line. After the Titanic sank in 1912, explorers proposed using sound waves to find its hull in the North Atlantic. This led to sonar, the most common technique used for mapping today. Operated by the Schmidt Ocean Institute, the Falcourt is an 82-meter-long research vessel, equipped with two multi-beam sonar systems that have helped Deborah Smith and a team of other patients, including her two men.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4712,2022-10-20 00:20:29
16367," In the first year of the Foundation Institute, the Falcourt is an 82 meter long research vessel. Equipped with two multi-beam sonar systems that have helped Deborah Smith and a team of other marine technicians to map over a million square kilometers of the sea floor. You know, you go from somebody with a rope with some knots to sonar acoustics that is, I call it, math magic. But it is incredibly advanced mathematical technology to be able to measure the distance and time of travel of sound on a moving ship. Multi-beam mapping works by using sonars. So sonar is taking sound and measurement of time. So you have a multi-beam sonar and it sends out a ping of sound. That sound travels through the water column, hits the sea floor and comes back to the ship. And we measure that time and we're able to calculate the distance. Each individual ping of sound has many, many beams. So it looks like a giant fan across the sea floor. And that fan is moving along the sea floor. So you have many tiny little beams going across. And they're traveling along a track. You can look at that data and look at both the peaks and the valleys and the highs and the lows and sort of create a three-dimensional image of the sea floor. The accuracy of multi-beam sonar really depends on the water depth that you're in. Think of it like a flashlight beam. And if you're holding a flashlight and you're shining it on the floor, the closer you get to the floor with your flashlight, the smaller that beam is. If you have 400 of these beams all across, so think of 400 people holding a flashlight. The closer they hold that flashlight to the sea floor, the smaller your beam is, which also means the smaller that you can find information or data about. So it really depends on the depth of the sea floor in order to see how much you can define an object. This variation in depth means that mapping resolution will range from 100 by 100 meters in shallow waters to 800 by 800 meters in the deepest parts of the ocean, which go down as far as 11,000 meters. Remotely operative vehicles or ROVs can then be sent down to investigate sea bed features up close. We've just crossed the 1000 metre mark. It's 4.6 degrees C and now we're going to drive the ROV down at a high rate towards the sea floor. On a recent mapping expedition, scientists on the Falcon were discovered a 500 meter tall coral structure in Australia's Great Barrier Reef. The first to be discovered in over 120 years. A place that is incredibly popular, well visited, well travelled, you know, we're still finding new things. You don't know until you map it. And so until you get that sort of high resolution picture, you don't know the sand waves or the old river beds that used to be there, or the waterfalls off the side of a volcano that used to be above the surface and now is below the surface. It's a little bit of everything. Think of let's say Hawaii or someplace where you see a volcano above the water, picture that below the water. I'm really kind of obsessed with the whole concept of scale here. Although we can create 3D models and, you know, kind of come up with these visualizations, it's not the same as that feeling of looking out over this big landscape. But, I mean, I think we'll get there soon with VR and other kinds of technology, but it's really spectacular to think about, especially with the familiarity that some of us have with these features, like what it looks like. We look out at the ocean and it just looks flat, maybe with little bumps. We really don't think about all of this that's underneath and it's really an amazing landscape that's just hidden from us. With more than 90% of the ocean deeper than 200 meters, fleets of autonomous vehicles could make the data gathering process faster, cheaper and safer. And new discoveries might help with exploration of all kinds. I think the ocean can actually provide us with huge incidences, we go out into space as well and look for life and other kinds of life forms. I also think in this next few years we will have a different kind of access to the ocean because of virtual reality and augmented reality. And for that we'll allow us to sit in our living rooms and really experience what's under us.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4713,2022-10-20 00:24:40
16368," to the ocean because of virtual reality and augmented reality and for that will allow us to sit in our living rooms and really experience what's underwater in a different way and see it this different alien planet. Since the dawn of man, meat has been on the menu and even with growing trends of vegetarian diets and plant-based substitutes, around 89% of the world population consider themselves omnivores. We've come a long way from our hunter and gatherer roads. We have managed to establish a whole industry designed to feed almost 7.7 billion people. We've maximized production and we managed to reduce hunger over the past couple of decades. And although we've become exceedingly efficient at putting meat on the table, raising livestock animals by the billions comes with its own set of consequences. If animal agriculture continues to expand the way it has, there is a race that we won't be able to stop climate change. But with rapid advances in technology, we might soon see a food industry that leaves all those problems behind. I'm about to be one of the world's first commercial customers for lab-grown meat, cultured meat. To eat just as the company and I'm very, very excited. Here is the chicken. It's pretty crispy outside. It's really good. I mean, look, it's really tasty. Here at 1880 in Singapore, cultured chicken is being served under a regulatory approval granted by the Singaporean government. It's the very first time a cultured meat product, meat made from animal cells grown in a lab, has been approved for commercial sale. Eat just the company behind these chicken nugget-style dishes is based out of San Francisco and got their start in 2011 developing plant-based egg substitutes, like mung bean scrambled eggs and mayonnaise. But it wasn't until 2017 that they announced they were shifting focus to a cultured meat product. In order to feed the world that we live in, a lot of animal protein, we need to take a third today and it'll be more tomorrow of our world and make it dedicated to feeding chickens and counts. We go to areas that are filled with biodiversity rainforests, taking a bulldozer to them and planting soy and corn to feed the chickens that we climate change is accelerated by the kind of animal production that we engage in. When we bring animals in tiny little spaces, it accelerates the probability that more zoonotic diseases are going to impact our families. And from morality perspective, why do we need to cause any harm to any other living thing, to have dinner that tastes good? It does not have to be that way. And those things underlie the force of this idea. The meat alternatives that have made it to the market thus far have been plant-based. Imitation beef and pork made from ingredients like pea protein and coconut oil by companies like Beyond Meat and Impossible Food.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4714,2022-10-20 00:28:45
16369," Made it to the market thus far have been plant-based. Immutation beef and pork made from ingredients like pea protein and coconut oil by companies like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods. That's a very different proposition from cultured meat, which is made from actual animal cells. I'm a huge fan of any company of any person trying to make a product that's improving the food system, including all the plant-based proteins. Maybe in some future menu you'll have this kind of cultivated chicken, and you'll also have a plant-based version. That's fine. But I guess you have to ask yourself in our lifetime, is that diner likely to also remove the conventional option on the menu too? We do think we need a more permanent solution. We do think we need, if you will, an end game to this problem, and we just think this is more likely to be the path to achieve that. So animal cell technology has been around for several decades for applications such as development of vaccines and other biotherapeutics. The first known prototype of cultured meat was done by Mark Post earlier in 2011, and essentially he was developing beef patty. It was a very expensive prototype. If I'm not mistaken, above 250,000 euros at the time to produce just one beef patty, it was more of a group of concepts to really demonstrate that this technology is possible, and that it can be done. The way that we grow and produce culture chicken is essentially we isolate chicken cells from the chickens without having to kill them, so from a small biopsy, for instance, we immerse these cells in a liquid broth that contains the nutrients that the cells need to survive and be healthy and to grow. We really need these cells to multiply, to reach the numbers that are sufficient to make a meat product. We're looking into the cells that are really important for meat, so we think about muscle cells, fat cells, by the isolation we are able to form those muscle tissues in culture. The culture happens inside of a fermentation tank, what we call the bioreactor, which is essentially providing the same conditions as the animal body. From temperatures, some sort of mechanical stimulation, so that the cells that are exposed to very similar conditions that they have inside of the animal. After the cells proliferate and reach a certain density, the final step is essentially to separate those cells from the liquid broth that they are in. We just make sure that the product needs our quality and safety standards, and then those cells are ready for consumption. Milk, cheese, yogurt, a lot of those derived from fermentations. The only difference is that they are starting from a different cell type. In this case, we're just using the animal cells as the initial and beginning of the product. Eatjust has developed chicken nuggets so far, with far more textured chicken breast plan for the future. But another cell-based meat startup Memphis Meets has already started working on culturing other animal cells as well. We've done beef, we've done duck, we've done chicken, and these are things that are favorites in various parts of the world. For instance, people in America love beef and chicken. People in China love duck, so we wanted to show that we at Memphis Meets can produce meats that we as a global population love to eat. There's a lot of similarity on how we grow the meats from various animals or fish, but they're also different because of nutrients they need and how they actually come together to form the final product of meat. I think it's very similar to how we also grow various animals. There's similarities in the feed that we gave cows and pigs and chickens, but there's also differences how we cultivate and it's very similar for us as well. So we've been working with the FDA and the USDA for the last three years and really developing the guidelines on how this food should be regulated when we come to the market. As soon as we get regulatory approval in the United States, people will be able to go to their supermarket and buy it and enjoy it. They'll be able to go to a restaurant near them and order meat directly from animal cells. But it's not just getting the meat right. Once approved, the gates open to a very high potential demand and scaling becomes...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4715,2022-10-20 00:33:18
16370," and near them an auto-mead directly from animal cells. But it's not just getting the meat right. Once approved, the gates open to a very high potential demand and scaling becomes the next big hurdle. Before we can only make chicken for myself, my friends, my girlfriend, my family, my colleagues, now we actually have the ability to make chicken for millions of people. So that allows us to invest into allowing the economies to scale, to drop the price. The second is we need to reduce the cost of the nutrients that these cells are consuming. So think chicken feed raises or drops a price of chicken. The nutrients we feed ourselves does the same things. We need to drive that down. The cell density is another technical element. We need to continue to increase that and hammering on those things. So of the course of the next five, 10, 15 years, we'll put us in a place where we're significantly below the cost of this animal protein. And that will be one of the main inflection points that we'll lead to a new way of eating meat. So here is a close-up of a half-eaten crispy chicken bite. You know what? What I'm really thinking is, just I'm eating chicken. I like chicken. You know, the normal chickens eat, I don't know where they came from. And so I don't know why I should be very stressed where this came from either. The meat market is worth more than $1 trillion annually and there are over 60 startups in the cultured meat field. Cultured meat has attracted several prominent investors, including Sergi Brin, Richard Branson and Bill Gates. What is also interesting is that even meat giants such as Cargill and Tyson have invested in space. It's this disruptive potential of the market as well as the promise to greatly reduce the climate impact of meat production that has attracted investors. It remains to be seen who will get regulatory approval in which countries and whether consumers will like lab-grown meat enough to make the switch. And while there's no evidence that lab-grown meat is any less healthy than traditional meat, there's an ongoing debate over how healthy eating meat is in general. But if these products are a success, they could be the beginning of a more humane, less destructive meat industry. The food and ag industry is the most innovative industry in the world. It's always figured out how to feed a growing population and we've never failed doing so. And it's been very clear to us that we are part of that and we're going to figure out how to feed the next three billion people joining us and I just see an evolution. We can do this a bit differently. We can do this in a way that is consistent with the kind of people that we want to be, the kind of planet that we all want to live in. We can build a food system that reflects really the best characteristics of who we are. And that makes me really hopeful. 어느 more of the waste would have lost its Korea. In possible foods might be the world's most ambitious company. Just listen to founder and CEO Pat Brown. People wonder how big the plant-based meat industry is going to be. It will be the meat industry in 20 years. We're going to look back and basically say, well, remember back in the day when we used to use animals to make meat? Yes, impossible stated goal really is to replace the use of animals as a food production technology globally by 2035.

What's called artificial meat the realest fake-est burger in the world Not bad But before impossible foods can take over the world It's going to have to overcome strong competitors Penetrate tough new markets and generally transform its product from a conversation piece into a ubiquitous staple food With the coronavirus turning the world of food upside down This could be the moment when impossible's new fangled meat goes mainstream In Impossible foods was founded in 2011 when Pat Brown a long-time vegan was nearing the end of an accomplished career in biochemistry I've been astanagest my whole life and just came to this realization that by far the most important scientific question in the world is what makes me delicious Pat Brown someone call a zealot for his mission He really doesn't hold back when it comes to talking about wanting to completely replace animal agriculture producing Meat from animals is the most destructive technology on earth and if we're going to avert catastrophic climate change and we have to find a better way to produce meat You've probably heard about the dangers of cow flatchlance their digestive systems produce large quantities of the powerful greenhouse gas Meefane in fact, it's estimated that livestock farming is responsible for nearly 15% of all greenhouse gas emissions Impossible claims it takes 89% less GHGs 87% less water and 96% less land to produce its burger The key of course would be to get people to actually eat the thing which is where the company's secret ingredient comes in Heem a genetically engineered substance with a bloody iron rich taste like red meat So heem is a very controversial part of the impossible burger It's also what makes the impossible burger what it is There are a lot of consumer groups and anti-GMO groups that oppose the impossible burger because of the heem The studies on its safety are pretty short term but the FDA has approved it and the company says it's completely safe and There isn't any evidence that it isn't Critics have also challenged the company's claim to health advantages over traditional meat Pointing out that while the impossible burger has less fat sodium and calories than its beefy cousin It's also more highly processed But let's be real we're talking about mimicking hamburgers here not kale salads These burgers are definitely better for the environment so that's a plus But they are not necessarily better for your health After years in the lab Patan's colleagues were confident they had a product even runs Sponson could love and the impossible burger made its debut in 2016 Their burger began its life in the public when it was sold at David Chang's mom of Fuku and They went from sort of higher-end Find dining restaurants into higher-end burger restaurants like bear burger and mommy burger And then suddenly they started popping up everywhere. It tastes like a burger. It tastes like meat. This is all made from plants All made from plants. It tastes like beef. Doesn't that just look like real meat? So meat like they always say it's what they say like a burger. It tastes like yuckers The farmers of the world relax. Yeah, it doesn't taste like a burger. Opinions differed on the impossible burgers relative Metinus but the debate itself was fantastic free advertising Helping to propel impossible into major chains like white castle and then in the summer of 2019 into more than 7,000 burger kings across the US To date the company has raised over a billion dollars and a funding round in March valued the company at around four billion",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4717,2022-10-20 00:41:49
16372," To date, the company has raised over a billion dollars and a funding round in March valued the company at around four billion. But fake meat is a happening space these days and impossible faces some daunting competition. Time now for the stock of the hour and that is Beyond Meat shares of the faux meat or plant-based protein company are soaring today. Beyond Meat is also making a very meaty burger from plants. They're very non-GMO, they stress that all the time to differentiate themselves from impossible. It'll be much easier to genetically modify plant material to make it take on the texture and appearance and aroma of animal protein. But we won't do that. Beyond Meat had one of the biggest IPOs of the year in 2019. Although impossible which is still privately held has some catching up to do. But you won't hear Pat Brown knocking his biggest competitor. I wish I'm nothing but success, they have the same mission we have. The only rival we care about is the incumbent animal-based industry. Rivals or not, impossible and beyond certainly agree on one thing. The true prize isn't the American market, it's China. 27% of the world's meat is consumed in China compared to just 9% in the US. The Chinese population eats a ton of meat, they're a huge market. China is a really interesting case because they have long had vegetarian cuisine as part of their culinary culture and whether they are looking for meat replacements is still an open question. What we found in our reporting is that some consumers are excited about them. It's just we don't know if it's going to be enough. To improve its prospects, impossible is developing a plant-based replacement for pork. Globally pork is the most widely consumed meat. It's almost 40% of all the meat consumed globally. Number one in Europe, number one in China. So if we're going to achieve our mission, pork is right up there. No word yet on when impossible pork will be available. This morning, growing concerns about the nation's food supply. From butchers to national supermarkets, supplies now limited and prices rising. The impact of the coronavirus on the price and availability of meat has given a boost to companies like Impossible Foods. Over the four weeks ending April 19, sales of plant-based meat increased. But Impossible has acknowledged some negative effects from the pandemic as well. This being a product that has primarily been served in restaurants, they took a pretty big hit with all the food service shutdowns. Although the company doesn't want to say how much of a hit. They have, however, announced some new retail rollouts. Recently they announced that they're going to be rolling out with crogr supermarkets. And that's big, that's great for them. The question of whether this is like a long term sea change for these companies. Is that too easy? It's safe to say Impossible stands a slim chance of achieving its goal of replacing the entire meat industry. But it's early days for the science of plant-based meat, and it's not impossible that these products could one day contribute to a greener, more humane future. In the meantime, as the technology improves, we get to look forward to many more years of this. This is meat. No, this isn't possible. Yeah, that's what I thought. This is the meat burger. I like it better. It's not even close to a veggie burger or a tofu burger or anything. Without that, very, very much. Yeah.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4718,2022-10-20 00:46:16
16373," What are is a strategically important point on the map of Pakistan? It's very close to Iran actually, on the very southern coast. It's about a 10-hour drive west of Karachi, but it's only about an hour drive to Iran. The area is extremely poor. It's very arid. It doesn't have enough water. Electricity has been a very spotty. One of the most surprising things about visiting Guadar is the high degree of security that is absolutely everywhere. There are armed guards that are required to escort foreign visitors everywhere you go because it is a contested region because there have been militant attacks in the past. Despite all this, Guadar is a key part of the China-Pakistan economic corridor, also known as CPEC. The Crown Jewel of President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative. We will leave no stone unturned in ensuring that CPEC and all the projects under its umbrella are materialised in time and in full. So far, just one-third of all CPEC projects have been completed. In Guadar, none of them have been, and the promised improvements for local people like job creation and better infrastructure have not materialised. So what has China got to gain from developing this seemingly obscure city on the Pakistani coast? We have seen this movie before. An outside power comes into Pakistan. It spends heavily on big infrastructure projects. China is not the first to do it. Right after Pakistan became independent in the late 1940s, early 50s, the US was sending advisors into Pakistan to help plant economy. The US was doing infrastructure projects there too. Those early projects helped the US gain Pakistan as an ally against the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The US has provided about $80 billion in aid to Pakistan since its independence, but overall the result is disappointing. One of the recent attempts was in the late 2000s as part of the US effort to combat terrorism in Afghanistan. The number one item on that aid package was to build these high visibility infrastructure projects. So there are literally projects that the United States tried to do or Pakistan proposed to the United States in the 2000s during that period that have become Belt and Road projects. China is stepping into a gap which has been left by retreating ambition from the US. The Belt and Road Initiative is China's President Xi Jinping's signature foreign policy initiative. It launched in 2013. It comprises an overland belt stretching through China Central Asia into Europe and a maritime road stretching around Southeast Asia through the India Ocean and up past East Africa. So a benign way of characterizing China's Belt and Road Initiative would be infrastructure for influence. So when Xi Jinping announced the Belt and Road Initiative, shortly afterwards China designated Pakistan as its showcase flagship project. So the China Pakistan Economic Quarter was going to be the biggest and most important showcase for the success of the Belt and Road. Pakistan is in great need of infrastructure development. They wanted to create a railway, highway, roads, all kinds of economic development that is intended to help Pakistan. And it's meant to provide jobs 2.3 million jobs for Pakistanis. It's meant to provide a 2.5% boost to G.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4719,2022-10-20 00:50:32
16374," And it's meant to provide jobs, 2.3 million jobs for Pakistanis. It's meant to provide a 2.5% boost to GDP growth. And China would gain economically as well. CPEC was intended to reduce oil and gas routes from the Middle East by thousands of miles, a way to cut overland into Western China instead of going around Southeast Asia by ship. Projects in Pakistan also provide Chinese state owned companies with an additional market. Chinese workers have brought to Pakistan to build infrastructure and then take wages home. CPEC is also strategically significant for China and Pakistan. China wants to strengthen this relationship to counter their shared rival India. CPEC is both an instrument of Chinese power as well as a test of Chinese power. If it succeeds, China will be demonstrating that it's able to do what great powers have not been able to do in Pakistan, including the United States. Which is why Guadal is so important. It's in Pakistan's Bilochistan province, an area with serious electricity and water shortages. Bilochistan province is actually populated by people who are of Biloch origin. There are different ethnicity, they speak a different language from the majority in power in Islamabad. And they feel as the poorest province in Pakistan, they have not sufficiently benefited from some of the economic achievements that the rest of Pakistan has had. That area is quite contested by the Bilochistan Liberation Army. The people who feel that even Pakistani people have encroached into their territory. So quite a number of people are still staging attacks and they attacked the biggest international hotel in Guadar. Shot up the lobby and killed I think five people. But this unsettled city is where the China-Pakistan economic corridor is supposed to lead to. Authorities plan to develop Guadar into an international port city. Guadar port has an interesting history and an interesting location too. It's located in Bilochistan. It's about 120 kilometers from Iran. Pakistan purchased this territory from Oman, I think of the 1950s. And so for a long time, Pakistan has had on its agenda trying to develop this area. Since the 70s, it's wanted to build a port in Guadar, actually approached the United States in the 1970s and tried to convince the Nixon administration to pay for a port even offered naval access if the United States was willing to pay for that. The US rejected Pakistan's offer, concerned that the port would not be commercially viable and would cause geopolitical tension. But in the early 2000s, a Chinese company was awarded the contract to build the port and they completed phase one of construction in 2006. The port was then managed by a Singaporean government entity. In 2013, a Chinese port operator took over from the Singaporeans. In 2015, China announced that it will expand the port as part of the CPEC initiative, but five years later, little has happened. When you look out at the port, you can see it has only three births and all of them were empty. And the only ship that was in the port at the time was a Pakistan naval forget. And so it indicated to me that the port is not particularly operational for commercial purposes and a number of analysts have talked about the strategic importance in a military sense if eventually China were able to use the port of Guadar as a military base. No one would be surprised if China did use it in that way. I don't think in the short term, like it is set up in Djibouti where it has a permanent base. I think it is more likely to use it as almost like a sort of forward-based resupply option. Something that can use when it wants to. Other projects like building Pakistan's largest airport in Guadar and two special economic zones have been delayed. A 19 km highway linking the port with the Macarancostal Highway in Balochistan is under construction too. Most of the people who live there and work there already are fishermen. They rely on access to the sea. The way that the express highway from the port was originally...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4720,2022-10-20 00:54:54
16375," Most of the people who live there and work there already are fishermen. They rely on access to the sea. The way that the express highway from the port was originally proposed would have cut off their sea access. And so that was a real point of contention with the community. There have been some proposals to allow them at underpass. It's still a little bit unclear how that is finally going to be resolved. Even if those projects are eventually built, there are serious questions about who will work there. There is a problem with manpower of course in Guadar. It's a very small city. And so one proposal has been well, we'll just ship Chinese workers in from China and build lots of fancy housing for them. The first Chinese built community in Pakistan, a 500 million dollar development spanning over 10 million square feet with over 60% open spaces. That kind of proposal is what makes a lot of the Pakistani local people quite upset. A Guadal based journalist expressed concerns to Bloomberg over projects like this. The journalist spoke anonymously for fear of persecution from the Pakistan government. These projects are creating jobs but they're not really creating jobs for the local people of Guadal. They're not against economic prosperity but they're against the development that leads them behind. Pakistan doesn't have the money to build these projects. It's gone to the IMF for its 13th bailout since the 1980s. By engaging in CPEC projects, the government of Pakistan has incurred more debts from China. Not only posing challenges for Pakistan but possibly the international community if Pakistan eventually defaults on its debts. But CPEC is still set to go on. Even if most current projects haven't been completed, the two countries have recently signed new projects worth $11 billion. Pakistan's Prime Minister said the country's economic future is linked with China. It's hard to imagine how the China Pakistani economic corridor is going to be the game changer that the Pakistan government would like it to be. We're not seeing the economic growth of benefit from the projects that were set out. We're supposed to have seen by now. We're not seeing the job creation. Project delays, accumulating debts, commercial viability. These problems of CPEC are also typical of Belt and Road projects around the world. For China though, it's never the narrow accounting perspective that matters. It's the bigger strategic benefits. As China's dollars continue to flow, as China's concrete continues to pour, China's influence continues to increase. There was some degree of runaway expectations. I think there was also some degree that they weren't extremely forthcoming with the state of the game. The Cyberpunk 2077 story is very much a story of everything that can and will go rock in game development. What is this fun? Jack is AI flipped out. It wasn't there before. Where's my gun?

16376," Where's my gun? Trans, keep it steady. I can't shoot. The release of Cyberpunk 2077 in December of 2020 will go down as one of the most disastrous game launches in history, and it instantly rewrote the narrative of its celebrated developer, CD Projekt Red. Larger studios with bigger budgets weren't able to create the same quality of open world game. The inside story of the making of Cyberpunk depicts a process marred by unchecked ambition, unrealistic timelines, and a focus on marketing and the expensive development. When CD Projekt Stock was at its high, it was the largest stock in the Polish stock market. Cyberpunk was supposed to be the biggest game of 2020. This was a game that was starring Keanu Reeves. This is a game that was from the makers of the Witcher 3. This was supposed to be the big temple release of last year, and for it to become such a disaster for so many people, I think, will have pretty far reaching consequences. CD Projekt Origins are somewhat unique in the game's industry. In the West and Japan, the late 80s and 90s were dominated by games through the home console market, and characters like Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog were becoming household names. The same was not true in a post-Soviet and economically depressed Poland. Most games were done on PCs, and most games were copied and sold in small markets around the country. You could go to the market down the street in Warsaw and buy in<|pl|><|translate|> the CDs. These two guys, Marchiniewinsky and Michal Kaczynski decided they were going to start selling CDs, and they ended up striking a deal with the people who made a game called Baldur's Gate, which was kind of like the seminal role-playing game in the late 90s. CDs would move on from just reselling games to localizing Western and Japanese made games into the Polish language. But it wasn't until 2002 that the company would make its own game, The Witcher. The Witcher is a huge, huge series, huge fantasy series in Poland. And so it was a pretty big deal that these guys got the race to make the video games. The Witcher book series is a source of national pride in Poland. And as CD Projekt released The Witcher 2, the video game series would become an important economic symbol for Poland as well. CD Projekt Red had become this behemoth of an institution in Poland and they were really big in the Polish technology scene because they were getting more worldwide attention than most Polish companies do and making a lot of money. And in 2011 when Barack Obama came to visit Poland, the Prime Minister actually gave him a copy of The Witcher 2. I confess I'm not very good at video games but I've been told that it is a great example of Poland's place in the new global economy. But it would be The Witcher 3 in 2015 that would elevate CD Projekt Red from representing the best of Poland to representing the best of the game's industry. I mean really the thing people look for first and foremost I think is that the game is just good and Witcher 3 was just a phenomenal game. There's a level of just storytelling and emphasis on making every side quest count on top of the atmosphere, the dialogue, the character interactions, the different way stories can end. They nailed that. Other open world games felt empty and enforced and the developers of them gave excuses as to why there couldn't be more rich story or interactions. And The Witcher 3 blew them out of the water. CD Projekt Red was beloved. They were seen as a studio that was willing to make what the player wanted and to truly put in the love and effort required to make a high-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4722,2022-10-20 01:03:39
16377," Beloved. They were seen as a studio that was willing to make what the player wanted, and to truly put in the love and effort required to make a high-quality game that really connects with the people playing with it. And the winner for Game of the Year 2015 is... The Witcher 3. The Witcher 3 would go into an over 250 game of the year award, but along with being a critical success for CD Projekt, who is also a financial success. Estimates put the sales of Witcher 3 at around 28 million copies in 2019. A huge step up, considering by 2014, the Witcher and the Witcher 2, had only combined to sell 8 million copies. And with two large expansions for the Witcher 3, CD Projekt also helped separate themselves from other AAA publishers at the time. And the Game Award goes, oh man, I have to pay a micro-transaction to the unlock. That's so stupid that this has to hold on. I got this guys. Here we go. Other games, and the most notorious, you know, one to do this was EA's Star Wars Battlefront 2. They got really aggressive on micro-transactions in a game that already cost at least $60. You could have paid more if you bought the premium editions, but not only was it that they were being very aggressive and trying to get you to spend money, but you could actually get items that helped you win. Well, gamers kind of draw the line in the sand there, and they don't like them. CD Projekt had done this phenomenal job of marketing themselves as a gamer-friendly company. We've said this a million times, and I'll say it again, worth gamers, first of all, and we all like to be treated fairly. So it only makes sense that as developers, we apply the same principle to everything we do here at CD Projekt Red. So giving everyone a bunch of free DLC was an absolutely no-brainer. They said, we're not going to sell you DLC that's like horse armor packs and other nonsense. We're going to just give you a free stuff, and then we're going to sell big expansions as part of the Witcher 3. And not only were they really good, they were offered at a fair price. And this is a company that was seen as just like a company that really cared about quality and cared about its customers, and we're not doing anything to kind of screw fans over the way that fans see that EA and Activision and all the other big publishers feel. With a critically and financially successful game, as well as the goodwill from the gaming audience, all the focus would shift to CD Projekt's next release, Cyberpunk 2077. It's actually funny, they first announced it through like a press release. And then they showed off a trailer of the beginning of 2013 that was like the CGI trailer of like a woman and there was all sorts of cool cyberpunk stuff flying cars lots of stuff, but it wasn't really until after the Witcher 3 that Cyberpunk began really like building up this fever level of hype. CD Projekt Red though wouldn't put out another trailer for Cyberpunk until 2018 at the E3 trade show. And they showed off a, it was like a two minute trailer of Cyberpunk, look pretty rad. And then they showed behind the scenes for E3 attendees for press and anyone else who could get a score and appointment in there. They showed this 45 minute demo and it blew people away. Welcome to the gameplay demo walkthrough of CD Projekt Red's upcoming title, Cyberpunk 2077. The gameplay you're about to-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4723,2022-10-20 01:07:52
16378," Welcome to the gameplay demo walkthrough of CD Projekt Red's upcoming title, Cyberpunk 2077. The gameplay you're about to see is from a work in progress version of the game. Everything you see is potentially subject to change. Po-ly. This, if they can live up to what they showed me, it's game over. It all looked incredibly impressive. They had enough action, enough narrative beats with just the right amount of tension. They touted how each of these NPCs, their thousands of them, each one with their own daily routines and everything. We've greatly enhanced our crowd and community system to create the most believable city in any open world game to do. So yeah, so people were certainly blown away by the demo at 1-3 awards and just people left the feeder just in awe. What they didn't know of course is that the demo was completely fake. Fake demos are common at E3. Studios put together builds of games to show off what they tend the game to be like rather than the actual state of the game. What was unique about this demo was that it was impressively long. It kind of plays into this idea that CD Projekt is very much a market and driven company and so demos were really, really important to them. So it was really important that they make this demo blow people away, which it did, but that might have come at the cost of like some time they could have been spending on the game. A year later, at E3 2019, fans would get another big surprise. Whoa! No way! Oh what?! These clothes! You have being there of walking the streets of the future is really going to be breathtaking. You're a breathtaking. The Cyberpunk trailers showed gorgeous cities, beautiful lighting, really cutting edge technology when it comes to the rendering of the game itself. People were very excited to be immersed in this gorgeous Cyberpunk world. They saw over 8 million pre-orders, which is a ridiculously large amount for any title to sell, let alone pre-sell. And you saw the stock price start to go up and up and up and up and to the right. Pretty much in a straight line. If you just look at the polished stock market, like the Wig Index, when CD Projekt stock was at a tie, it was the largest stock in the index. And that was around the time that they announced that the game would be coming in April of 2020. Behind the Seaheens, people were pretty shocked that they were saying April. I don't think a single person who worked on that game actually thought they had a chance of coming out in April of 2020. So in April of 2019, I published an article for Kotaku about the making of a game called Anthem, which was a game from Byware that was disastrous in many ways and the article kind of ran through why that was. And afterwards, I started hearing from other developers who had stories to share that they said sounded a whole lot like Anthem. The deadline is unrealistic. The direction keeps changing. Things are floundering. We're going through a lot of problems. This sounds exactly like what you wrote about Anthem. Around that same time, perhaps coincidentally, I heard from VCEO of CD Projekt Red who wanted to reach out to me specifically to talk about Crunch. CD Projekt Red had a reputation for Crunch, especially during the development of Witcher 3. Their management wanted them to have a reputation for treating workers well and not forcing them to go through Crunch. So Marchinevinsky, who is a co-founder and co-CEO of CD Projekt Red, came to me and said, hey, I want to make a vow right now that we're not going to force anybody to crunch, that people will not have to work mandatory over time on this project. Over the course of reporting, Bloomberg has conducted interviews with more than 20 current and former CD Projekt staff. Most of them requested anonymity, so as not to risk their careers. CD Projekt declined a comment on the process or provide interviews with this story. 인",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4724,2022-10-20 01:12:50
16379," former CD Projekt staff, most of whom requested anonymity so as not to risk their careers. CD Projekt declined a comment on the process or provide interviews with the story. The company would end up delaying the game three different times, first pushing from an April 2020 release to September, then November and once again to December 2020. In order to meet the deadline, the studio would scale down the size of Cyberpunk's main city, as well as canceling some features, and while those measures helped, developers still said they were under significant crunch, including one former audio programmer who claimed to work up to 13 hours a day, five days a week, and stating he had seen friends who had lost their families over this. This was not a big secret in the office that the game was not going to be ready, but a similar sort of thing happened with Witcher 3, and a similar sort of thing happens with a lot of games where they don't seem ready until suddenly everything just clicks. Some of the best games ever made, like were created through this process. I don't know that it's the most efficient or the wisest way to make video games, but it's what a lot of people do. I think that management there has genuinely tried to change it or at least said they wanted to change it, but it has proven very difficult to change that when you make games in this one specific way. Game studios, some of them see Crunch as part of their core culture, that all of their games that they've made under Crunch have been successful, so it must be a core element to the magic recipe for creating good games. And that's really not the case. We've run studies and seen that at eight weeks of working 60 hours plus, the output of a professional is the same as if they were working 40 hours a week. So chronic overwork degrades how effective someone is to the point where then it becomes negative and overworking them is just getting new less and less productivity. And so these guys, the people at CD Projekt, having made the Witcher 3, we're kind of riding on that high, you could call it arrogance or confidence or whenever you want to call it, of having made the Witcher 3. And I think that like having a certain level confidence can certainly be a good thing, and in this case it could also be dangerous because it kind of blinded them to the reality, which is that this game wasn't going to call us. So many pictures entertainment is reeling from what may be the biggest and most devastating computer hacking in Hollywood's history. Packers attacked in waves, first crippling Sony's internal systems, then leaking five Sony movies online. Today the US government pointed the finger of blame directly at North Korea for the devastating cyber attack against Sony pictures. Sony pulling the plug on the interview saying it will not show the controversial comedy about an assassination attempt on North Korea's leader. The Sony pictures hacking was taken very seriously because it was not attacked on the free world. What we have been building in terms of our civilization and our freedom and our ability to exchange information freely have been disrupted by a country that we knew very little about. North Korea has reportedly made attempts to steal COVID-19 vaccine technology by hacking pharmaceutical giant Pfizer. The Justice Department has charged three North Korean hackers over a wide ranging scheme that included the attempt theft of billions of dollars for multiple companies. Despite so many attacks blamed on North Korea, there was not much known about the people behind the hacking attacks.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4725,2022-10-20 01:16:29
16380," dollars for multiple companies. Despite so many attacks blamed on North Korea, there was not much known about the people behind the hacking attacks. And my aim was to reveal who these people are and what they are like, what their operations are like, and on what their dreams and fears were. My name is Sam Kim. I'm a reporter for Blue MIRN News, and I wrote a story for Business Week about North Gun hackers. My story is about people who are sent from North Korea to countries like China, to hack for the regime, spy on enemies, and make money. North Korea's cyber abilities began about in the 1970s with a lot of students going to countries like Russia, China, and even East Germany to learn coding, it was aimed at improving the productivity of factories at home. But in some time in the 1980s and 1990s, the current leader Kim Jong-un's father Kim Jong-un thought that it would be a good idea to develop a team, an army of people who could hack for North Korea's military. So they began this team of hackers who would spy for the North Korean regime and also go out there and make hard currency for the regime. I think Kim Jong-un takes the hacking ability more seriously than his father. He also enjoys a bit of tech sadness as well. He's often shown traveling on his airplane where on the desk there's a Mac computer. He understands the importance of computers, he understands the importance of employing technology to improve productivity of his economy. North Korea is an isolated country with its economy pretty much dilapidated nowadays. It's been under increasing pressure and sanction from the US and the international community basically. It does not have the resources and money to build a kind of conventional weapons that other countries are able to build. So what happens is North Korea concentrates its resources on building nuclear arms and missiles which exports coal basically a symmetric weapons. It's the kind of weapons that gives North Korea an instant edge. Think of cyberhacking abilities in that context. It doesn't cost them much money but if you have the right people and if you have the right training you are able to cultivate an army of people who are able to penetrate into computer systems of other countries. And that's what North Korea is after. But if you consider the fact that there are only about a thousand IP addresses in North Korea available and many of them are basically loaned from Chinese communications companies you can kind of tell why North Korea is willing to send its hackers abroad rather than operate from within. What's the matter with operating from within? Well first of all it would mean that a lot of information would have to be coming in from the outside world which could risk exposing the government and the people to whatever truth there might be about them. So they're sending their trained hackers to China and other countries where access to information is better. But at the same time because these are allies and also because they have their diplomats stationed in countries like these like China they're able to regulate and control these hackers better. But formally North Korea denies engaging in hacking and described accusations to that",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4726,2022-10-20 01:20:47
16381," to regulate and control these hackers better. Performally, North Korea denies engaging in hacking and describes accusations to that affect as enemy propaganda. It took me at least half a year to track down these people. It felt like a wild goose chase in the beginning, because see a lot of the people like these are protected by the government in South Korea. But at the end, I was able to find a person who had pretty extensive ties to the North Korean defective community here. And then I was also able to gain access to the people who had actually done programming hacking from North Korea before coming to South Korea. And Jung is one of them. Jung actually is not a real name. I knew before meeting Jung that he was in his late 30s. But when I actually met him, he looked at least a decade older. He wouldn't open up. I mean, it took me at least an hour to make sure that he would trust me enough that he would share with me his life story. When he was first sent to China, he was a student studying computer science at a university near the border with North Korea. And he came back and realized that there was a lot more to do in China because he had more access to information. And he asked that he'd be sent back to China. And there was also recruitment going on for people who would actually do coding officially, but really hacking from North Korea. So he applied and he got the job. Once he got to the border, he crossed by foot and from there, he took a bus. And then when he arrived at the station that he would spend years in later, he learned that the three-story building in the heart of a city was actually provided for free, actually, by a Chinese man who had business ties in North Korea. There were actually two other people that I had met. They all said that they go to this freelance website for programmers and clients from around the world would come and give them orders, give them jobs to do. Some of the jobs given to Jung were cracking open, commercially successful and anti-virus programs. And when he was able to open that up, he replicated that program into another product, which his client would repackage as a whole different product to be sold to other people. He also created what we now call bots. They are very popular online games, including lineage. He would create a bot that would just roam around without any supervision from the user and basically trade items without the users on that game. He would grow that bot on lineage and sell it for almost $100. Another defector said the money from clients was wired primarily via PayPal to accounts controlled by minors because they were the only ones with access to legitimate bank accounts. Jung had to make at least $100,000 in a year and he doesn't get to keep most of it. Actually, most of the money goes to the minors to the North Korean regime. But if you don't meet the quota and the minors will make sure that they'll put enough pressure on you. And if that happens repeatedly, you will face the growing odds of being sent back home. Among the three people that I spoke to, there's a common thing that they all tell me, which is that on every Saturday they have to do this propaganda session, which is basically about gathering all the hackers together into a room and they have to recite whatever messages, whatever lines come from Pyongyang about the Kim family, about socialism. If you're especially someone with a free set of mind, that's stressful. And one person actually was really stressed out what he heard about North Korea.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4727,2022-10-20 01:25:16
16382," Especially someone with a free set of mind that stressful. One person actually was really stressed out what he heard about North Korea. Once he was in China during the propaganda sessions, he just couldn't take it. John was a senior member of the unit that he belonged to and he was good at Chinese as well. Whenever a senior North Korean official came from North Korea to check on the hacking units in China, John would accompany that official. He doesn't provide me details, but he calls it unsavory incident that happened between him and an official that he was traveling with. And that altercation prompted him to defect. But there was no one that he could turn to after defecting. He would, in disguise, roam around China. He called me that he actually enjoyed it. He actually enjoyed the freedom of not being known to anybody. Just roaming around a country that was huge. How did he make the money that he needed to carry on? He did the same thing he did at the North Korean unit. He would take orders, reverse engineer software to make money. But at one point, he said he was just sick and tired of it all of a sudden. He wanted to find a place where he could just settle down. And he contacted South Korean authorities. Now, he lives in Korea. He met a woman here. Last time I checked the head of baby, he worked for a software company, ironically, an antivirus company. What keeps coming up in my head, even long after I spoke to these people, is there was one common thing about them, which was the sense of disillusionment. One day had access to outside information. One day, we were able to freely roam in the Internet. There was a spark. And once they realized that there is a discrepancy between what they think is really happening and what North Korea is telling them every Saturday morning. That's when the spark gets bigger. The little fire is what eventually drives them to decide to leave, even if it takes a huge risk on their lives. That is.

16383," You Since they started popping up in the 1950s, malls have been the quintessential American shopping experience. The shopping temples dedicated to the wonders and excesses of retail, food service and entertainment, the rise of the mall coincided with the growth of the suburbs. The heyday of the malls really is the 1970s, sometimes referred to as the malling of America. They really thrived at providing some sort of public gathering space, some sort of social life, in addition to actually giving people places to shop. Over the past few decades before then, lots of developers were building malls and it kind of coincided with the growth of highways. So as more people started traveling and interstate started being built, developers really wanted to put something to attract people to stop. Take a look at an average American mall today, however, and you'll see a very different picture. Most stores and empty hallways became the norm in many malls even before COVID-19 delivered them another set of problems in 2020. So what happened? This is the story of the rise and fall of American malls. When malls work best, they survived and thrived thanks to their anchor stores. Those are the stores that are on the edges of the malls and that are outward facing to the parking lot. So if you're a shopper, you're going to walk through one of these big, usually a department store. So if you're thinking about maces or sears or jc penny, those are called the anchor stores. So once shoppers are done shopping there, maybe they wander to the middle part of the mall, shopping at the other apparel shops or even going to buy some food, but you really had to have a reason for people to shop in the first place. Because anchors bring in all those people, they tend to pay very little rent. Around 80% of income from mall owners come from the inline stores inside the mall. Over the past few decades, malls have been facing challenges from all sides. The first being, there's just too many of them. As early as in the 90s, the malls were beginning to compete with each other. We have a lot more retail square footage per capita than Canada. We have only seven times more retail square footage per capita than Europe. After the 2008 financial crisis lowered retail spending across the board, malls and especially their department stores also had to contend with a new challenge that was growing fast. malls started to suffer in the early 2000s with the rise of online shopping. Suddenly, they didn't have that captive audience who had to go to the mall to buy something. You didn't have to get up, get in your car, drive all the way to the mall and then see a bunch of other people. You can just do it from the comfort of your own. Department stores overall have become less relevant over the years. Many have fallen totally off and that's Sears, JC Penny, several bankruptcies in this space have really hurt the industry. But as department stores go, so does the mall oftentimes. So if department stores start closing locations, that means they're usually leaving malls. This is the Green Briar Mall in Southwest Atlanta, Georgia. It's in many ways emblematic of the problem.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4729,2022-10-20 01:33:53
16384," This is the Green Briar Mall in Southwest Atlanta, Georgia. It's in many ways emblematic of the problems facing malls today. It's been there since 1965, so for more than half of a century, it's been serving this area of Atlanta that's predominantly black and also its middle-class neighborhood. It started with anchor stores that were department stores. So you had JC Penny and then Riches, which was later bought by Macy's. So you had these two national chains. It had the first Chick-fil-A in a mall, like that type of format. So when you think about the history of malls, like Green Briar had like the perfect template, but now Macy's will be exiting the mall, meaning that the mall will be left without an anchor, which is vital to attracting other shoppers to come into the stores. Green Briar then because it's kind of an example or a test for all these other middling malls across America about what do you do when these large department stores as a business decision on their end are trying to just stay in the high quality malls. How does a middling mall survive? What's their next strategy? Green Briar is a textbook example of how closely the deterioration of the middle class in the US is tied to the health of its malls. The median income for the surrounding area has reduced by $6,905 over the past 15 years to a total of $20,756 per year. And yet, residents and store owners hope that Green Briar mall will see better days. Malls are made up of the people and communities that help fuel them. Green Briar is still a place that people go to and cherish, even if on paper it doesn't have the elements that make it a thriving mall. A lot of the existing constituents and residents there feel in any respect that they worked hard their whole lives to be able to experience the American dream, the single family suburban house in a leafy yard near a big mall that had a great nasi use and they're very reluctant to see that taken away from them. Now that Macy's is gone, Green Briar may try to take inspiration from what many malls were doing in the years following the financial crisis, focusing not on shopping but experiences. That was a trend we were seeing in 2016 up into the pandemic pretty much. And by experiences I mean everything as dramatic as a water park or hosting concerts to have people want to come other than just to buy stuff. Having Instagramable moments, making sure your store is pretty that people want to take a photo and post it on Instagram or Twitter. Historically the mall has always been a place for teenagers. I like to hang out, see your friends and also kind of be seen at the mall. And that hasn't completely changed like before the pandemic, about 95% of Gen Z. So today's teenagers had gone to a mall in a three month period. So teenagers are still going to the mall and they've always been key to having thriving malls because they're coming into their spending power. And once you win over teens, hopefully you're really winning over a loyal customer for life. But thanks to lockdowns across the country, most malls at one point or another were shuttered in 2020. That means no one...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4730,2022-10-20 01:38:08
16385," But thanks to lockdowns across the country, most malls at one point or another were shuttered in 2020. That means no one using the multi-billion dollar American Dream mall's indoor ski slope. No one going to the King of Prussia mall's indoor skydiving attraction. Basically, the pandemic gave malls what they didn't need, another problem. What would your net income or net operating income have been in 2022 without COVID and what is it now in a post-COVID world? So our views is roughly 10% hit to net income over that period. That's Vince Taboni from the analytics from Green Street Advisors, which rates American malls from A to D just like a report card. And if malls did have a report card, they wouldn't exactly make honor roll. During the US, out of the thousand malls in the country, there are roughly 250 malls, we grade A minus or better. The B and C quality malls, which is the vast majority of the malls by count, we think are on a negative trajectory. And it's going to depend on a lot of the local dynamics, ownership, decisions around how much money to invest in the property. We'll determine whether this mall can survive as retail or rapidly melting ice cube. While there have been a few bankruptcies among real estate investment trusts that own mostly B to D malls in the past few years, A malls really are doing just fine. Some of the most productive shopping centers in the country are super high-end. So I'm talking about bowel harbor shops down in Miami, Florida. There's Americana man has it in Long Island's Gold Coast, the Grove in Los Angeles. These are places that have all high end stores and have done quite well. A lot of that has to do with efficiency of their property, so their sales per square foot are really high. But also they've invested a lot in their actual mall because it has to look beautiful, it has to have all the services that a wealthy shopper expects. So what will the future hold for less sought after malls that can't revive their golden years? For many of these malls, it will mean closure and then hopefully conversion. If they can't get a new use to come in, it's expensive, but you can just demolish it. And there are still quite a lot of sites just sitting waiting. Amazon has been picking up more and more of those building their big fulfillment centers. Also, a lot of communities think this is an opportunity to redevelop, re-enhabit this dead mall. To help that community meet the challenges it was never originally designed for. The number one reuse of an existing mall is as workspace. It's actually pretty easy to just throw some carpeting down, cut a few more windows and turn it into office space. The sort of number two reuse of malls is either medical, healthcare or education. Lots of great examples of community colleges all the way down to elementary schools. Moving into malls, then the third strategy that I wish happened more is actually just demolishing the mall and re-greening. Either reconstructing the wetlands that used to be there and that frankly we never should have built on in the first place or providing community parks and gardens. While most analysts say post-pandemic retail shopping could breathe some life back into the American mall, many are not long for this world. Depending on where you live it might be time to make one last visit, grab some food, do some shopping and say farewell.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4731,2022-10-20 01:42:50
16386," Thirty Three President Trump traveled to Utah today where he dramatically cut back the size of two national monuments in that state. When former President Donald Trump announced plans to scale back two national monuments in Utah, there was outcry from a lot of people. One company in particular. Patagonia really is a resistance brand. They embraced the liberal resistance against President Donald Trump and really put themselves at the forefront of that movement. In 2017, it sued the Trump administration for sort of slashing the size of these two national monuments in Utah that were kind of mechas for climbers. It said at the time joining the legal fracas was both extraordinary and obvious. So the company's general counsel said it took exactly one email to the board to decide to actually do that. I send the case to still out. Well, I think the only thing this administration understands is lawsuits. We're losing this planet. And we have an evil government. And I'm not going to stand back and just let evil win. This year it got even more active, it changed its mission statement to quote, Patagonia isn't business to save our home planet. And then it manufactured these little tags on some of its clothes that if you flip them up, it says boat the assholes out. Very implicit running up to the election. And it launched a digital tool to help people find the polling place. And on that digital platform, it says boat the climate deniers out of office again and again on the loop. This isn't the first time that taking a stand has paid off the Patagonia. The business which is now worth over a billion dollars was built on it. I couldn't care less about making more money. But by doing the right thing, it always ends up making more money. So is this all a strategy, a sort of premeditated strategy? Who knows? I mean, Sean Arts has been very vocal from the start and makes no bones about. He calls himself a dirt bad climber and an accidental entrepreneur. So I don't think he's fudging this. But what's important is that it's sort of a textbook marriage of philanthropy and profit. If you want to understand the entrepreneur's study that you and I will delinquent, because you know, they're saying, you know, this sucks. And I'm going to do it my own way. Of course, like every other teenage kid, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. When I was 16 years old, I took off and drove across the country, went into the Wind River Range and discovered mountains.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4732,2022-10-20 01:46:53
16387," River Range and Discovered Mountain. Patagonia was born out of Rockclimate of Von Schoenard's first business, Schoenard Equipment, which made in soul climbing supplies. Ivan Schoenard was a blacksmith in the 50s, and he started selling climbing gear out of the back of his car. That was less harmful to rock faces. This is sort of the origin story of the company. It's called itself the activist company, a activist company. Six months out of the year, Ivan Schoenard is a blacksmith. He makes mountain climbing gear. The other half of the year he climbs. In 1968, Ivan Schoenard and four friends, including Doug Tomkins, the late founders of the North Face brand, embarked on the ultimate road trip. From California where they were based to Patagonia in Argentina. The mountains in a good mood, dazzling sun, calm air all day. If this weather holds, they could be on the summit within days. This trip became a documentary about these friends who were hippies in the 70s, climbing in New Samhiti where the sport became a lifestyle. And how these friends became pioneer of the outdoor industry. Schoenard moved from selling petons to polyester, and in the 70s Patagonia was born. In 1973, Schoenard and his wife Melinda opened the very first Patagonia store in Ventura, California, where the company's headquarters remained today. Melinda Schoenard was the driving force behind many of the employee benefits, like on-site childcare, that helped the company achieve an impressive 4% employee turnover rate. The retail and consumer product sector average is more than triple that at 13%. I do think that Patagonia was a leader, one of the first corporations, to take into account the human capital and make sure that their staff, all their employees were cared for in many ways, not just wages, but also they just cared about their people and knew that that's a good business model. Patagonia began donating 10% of its profits to grassroots organizations in 1985. This later became the 1% of sales that Schoenard labels and Earth Tax. I don't think it's from an experience. It's rent for us living on this planet. While Patagonia was creating the blueprint of how to be a socially conscious brand, it was also turning a profit. It even made Ink Magazine's list of the fastest growing privately held companies. So every time the company makes a decision to do something socially environmentally active, it is met with success, and that isn't lost on Schoenard and the other leaders of the company. The more money Patagonia made, the more it gave away under its philanthropic program. Between 1989 and 1991, the payroll grew by 40%. But trouble was on the horizon. I think for 1991, we are looking at a recession. The question is how deep that recession is going to be and how long will be in it. Sales fell flat and the bank called in the companies revolving loans. A company that prided itself on taking care of its own laid off 120 people, roughly 20% of its workforce. That was when we decided that we were going to start doing things different. We're going to start running the company as if it's going to be here 100 years. With a renewed sense of purpose, Patagonia was ready for what it called business unusual. It started with the costly move to recycle an organic materials before launching a clothing repair service to discourage fast fashion. And Patagonia's influence was growing. What was intended as Schoenard's philosophical handbook for employees became an international blueprint for sustainable business printed in term languages. What's interesting to me is that all this I hate this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4733,2022-10-20 01:51:16
16388," International blueprint for sustainable business printed in time languages. What's interesting to me is that all this, I hate the term on brand, but it's very on brand. It really works for the kind of company he's created. It works for the kind of employees he's been able to recruit and retain. It all is very seamless in terms of the identity of him and the company and what it means in the marketplace. Over time, the company's mission and its marketing have become the same thing. The inflection point came in 2011, actually Black Friday, Patagonia took out a huge ad in the New York Times that said don't buy this jacket and it's sort of got into the nitty-gritty on the carbon footprint and the water footprint that goes into a piece of a peril like a parke and at the time, Seanard said the best jacket for our planet is one that already exists. So the company at that time said it needed to address the issue of consumerism, which coming from a for-profit business hits pretty hypocritical. As the company encouraged its customers to buy less, its annual sales increased by almost 40%. The stance of this is hypocritical is loud and constant talking about consumerism in a critical light while very much being a part of it. Fast fashion is top on the list of environmental destruction and not just destroying the environment but impacting human health. They are in the fashion industry, they're clothing retailer and to come head-to-head with that is courageous. You're not only just trying to create a product that'll last but you're also educating an entire generation of people to understand that whole ideology that you don't need to change out our outfits. In 2014, Rose Macaria was appointed as CEO. During the next six years, she grew Patagonia into a billion dollar company while also scaling up its environmental goals and bringing a more political voice to its activism. Ivana had this model where he was basically saying you can have a great business, you can make quality product but you can also do the right thing by the environment, by your employees, by your community. That to me was like the most holistic vision of business that I'd ever seen. Right now, Patagonia has a team of about 20 people, solely focused on activism and grants. This all comes at a time in the past decade when consumers are paying much more attention to the social footprint of companies and where they buy their goods. So what's happened is all this is good business for Patagonia in the past 10 years, revenue and profit at the company of roughly quadruple. It's private but estimates are it does about a billion dollars in annual sales, which is sizable. And that's part of the reason why it's been such a fortuitous cycle as it's ramped up its activism and become more vocal on these things. It's resonated with the market. As the company branched out into other areas, including a venture capital fund for environmental causes and sustainable food, revenue reached a new peak of over one billion dollars in 2017. But this was still small change compared to fast fashion heavyweights like Nike, who made 37 billion dollars that same year. Patagonia's conscience hasn't always been reflected in its customer base either. Personalized vests have become the go-to corporate uniform. And the expensive price tag has helped the brand and the nickname Patagonci. It's expensive stuff, it's expensive apparel, and that is part of their calculus in terms of the activism, you know, a lot of the more sustainable parts of this pie chain art. There's a premium for organic cotton or sustainable down. The Patagonci label is a symptom of that. So Patagonia products are very popular, of course, with people who are active in the outdoors, but also with people who are not as active. For instance, you know, people...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4734,2022-10-20 01:55:37
16389," Patagonia products are very popular, of course with people who are active in the outdoors, but also with people who are not as active. For instance, you know, people in finance where the Patagonia vests go to the office. And that's because of the image that the brand projects. And so they have to deal with the fact, although they, you know, preach for the environment and want to stand for good, their victims of their own success. Patagonia set sales records in the first three years of the Trump administration. Now, in 2020, things have changed. Is COVID-19 brought the business world to a halt? And the American people voted in a new administration. Patagonia appointed Brian Gellert as CEO. As far as its CEO transition goes, this one's happening quite strangely. There's no real budget for next year yet because of everything that's going on and all the uncertainty around that. Patagonia's new focus is going to be on forging a relationship with the Biden administration. It should be a more close relationship. But Gellert still has his guard up. During the Obama administration, they didn't always agree, and he expects the same with Biden in the White House. They plan to bring litigation wherever needed against any government needed about the issues that they care about, and that's climate change in the environment.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4735,2022-10-20 01:59:59

I mean, it's so exciting. It's such a fun... It is. It is. But I would say the thing we're really excited about are these new buildings because we're building sustainability into everything we do. So really forward-looking. More? More? Good? Yes. Okay. From one of the newest workspaces at the Googleplex in Mountain View, California, this is Bloomberg Studio 1.0 with Alphabet CFO, Ruth Porat. We're not far from her childhood home. Her father was a physicist at Stanford, her mother, a psychologist. We're graduating from Stanford herself and then earning a couple more advanced degrees. Porat landed her first job on Wall Street in 1987, where she would spend almost three decades until Google's co-founders lured her to Silicon Valley. It's wonderful to be here with you. It's great to have you here at the Googleplex. Thank you for having us. So we are at Google headquarters in Mountain View and at this very same time you are making massive investments in New York office real estate, you're expanding headcount in Atlanta and Chicago and Washington, DC. What's the strategy behind all of this? Well, at the core we believe in hybrid work. So we do want to bring people back on campuses, but not full time. We're thinking it would probably be a three, two work week, but we think coming together is just such a core part of innovation, serendipity, culture, every element of it. And we're growing it a really rapid clip. So we are excited to be expanding our real estate footprint. And then we also wanted to make sure that we're meeting people where they want to be. And so enlarging the number of sites that we have available for people in particular sites where you have great diverse populations. Sundar just told me that Googlers will have this option of working in hybrid mode forever, like literally forever. Obviously, you're embracing this massive cultural shift, but what are the risks? What do you worry about? So the positive we've seen is there's a productivity uplift we believe in giving people the opportunity to be at home some of the time, not do the commute, be able to deal with everything else in their life.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4736,2022-10-20 02:04:31

So the risk is I think about my career and so much of the benefit in my career was the informal coaching being pot-pronented meetings, all of the touch points that you have. And so I think that one of the most important things for all of us as leaders is we need to evolve the way we lead. We need to make sure that we're thinking about this hybrid work life and why that's the way to be the best magnet for talent and make sure that we're continuing to reinforce all of those great practices while opening up new great practices. Speaking of your career before your CFO of AlphaBat, your CFO of Morgan Stanley and you started your career on Wall Street in 1987. Talk to us about the journey of going from big banks to big tech. Why did you make that leap and what impact did you want to have? Well I love seeing it work in Stanley and I became CFO the day James Gorman became CEO, yes, needed to join them in that in that journey and that was January 2010 and we were still recovering coming out of the financial crisis. There were still some pretty rocky days and a lot of decisions that needed to be made and then I got to a point where I felt like we were in a great spot at Morgan Stanley and obviously it's continued to do really well and I just wanted that next chapter. My view in my career I've always been focused on kind of continually learning and I feel like when you hit a plateau the right questions what's my highest and best use and it's been it's been an extraordinary time. You also survived Wall Street in the 80s and 90s which is you know notorious boys club and Silicon Valley has sort of come to be known as a boys club of its own. How would you compare those two cultures? Well when I was you know starting my career many decades ago it was much it was tough and much worse than it is now and it evolved no question about it not where it needs to be but certainly evolved and I saw it through my career. I would say the biggest difference out here is the level of impatience and I love it as the view is if you can do some of the extraordinary breakthroughs that we have out here if you can do natural language translation everything we do with AI with VR with self-driving cars why can't you fix this now and that level of impatience I think is fantastic. Legend has it that when you got to Google you were gonna rain in the spending tighten up on the moon shots your nickname I believe was Ruth Vader was that a tough job to take on so I think the the narrative was written before I got here and what I find most interesting about that is I firmly believe the single most important thing in capital allocation is investing for long-term growth I think if you don't you were sowing the seeds of your long-term decline and I learned that really early on in my career now if you're investing in an industry like this and trying to do truly transformative things by definition everything can't succeed and so by definition you should have the metrics and data and milestones to assess is it working or is it not because if everything's working or if you think everything's working I would say one of two things are wrong either you're not reaching high enough or you're not being honest enough with yourself about the pace of breakthrough whether you're gonna get there so to me a really natural part you know kind of a sister organization to investing for long-term growth is actually thinking about how are you doing with the risk that you're taking stack rack them and figure out what's at the bottom so you can redeploy those resources to the top they go together actually and so I find the narrative it's a false choice to think that it's either about growth or it's about pruning stack ranking they go together and you have to think of them as actually empowering one another you advised the Treasury Department during the great recession what lessons did you take away from that what struck me is a lot of the lessons from the financial crisis are relevant in good times and bad times so the most important is it's easier to prevent than to fix and and so you know there was that was really clear during the financial crisis the financial crisis was about liquidity and it dried up quickly",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4737,2022-10-20 02:08:39
16392," It's easier to prevent than to fix. And so, you know, that was really clear during the financial crisis. The financial crisis was about liquidity, and it dried up quickly. And it would have been really easy, six to 12 months prior, to build in durable liquidity. You couldn't do it in the moment. And so this notion about really building a solid foundation on which you operate, you need to do that ahead of time. It needs to be all of the work we do on trust and safety and content, moderation, security. What is the foundation on which you can build everything else? The hangpaws at one point said to me, you have to have the will and the means. And too often, by the time you have the will, you no longer have the means. His comment was, be decisive, act early, even in the absence of information. I think that's true in this whole notion of investing for long-term growth. Because if you're not actually assessing progress along the way, and you just assume, you know what, we can keep investing in everything. At some point down the road, you'll say, I wish I had made those tough calls to double down on the things that really mattered. What times are we in now? What's your read on the economy today, especially with rising inflation? Well, I think back to March of 2020, and where we were. And I think of all of the intervention and steps that have been taken since then. And you've certainly seen the recovery coming out the back end. And it's been really gratifying from those painful days to see the breakthroughs that we've had, not just on the medical front, but we've also seen the improvement across businesses. I think one of the biggest concerns, in particular, as you're seeing us, go through a digital transformation and the acceleration of it is ensuring that everyone has the skills, the digital training and skills to thrive in this new economy. Google now reaches more than half the people on the planet. Why shouldn't we view Google as a monopoly? We often say that people come to Google not because they have to, but because they want to. And we're opening the world for so many people, so that's the intent. Should we charge in resolutions that are not properly organised? I want to talk a little bit about regulation. You were drawn to M&A in your early days at Morgan Stanley. Microsoft is making some big acquisitions, deals that some think Google maybe would have wanted to win in a former life. Is antitrust scrutiny constraining any of your business plans and your ability to compete? So the main thing that we've done throughout the life of Google is really invest in innovation that's organic growth and we're continuing to do that at a really rapid clip. We have then layered onto it, tuck in acquisitions and larger acquisitions. We're continuing to be active, more on the smaller ones and the add-ons to be fair. But we think there's a lot of opportunity still ahead of us. So we're continuing to invest in partnerships and in some acquisitions and do...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4738,2022-10-20 02:13:01
16393," But we think there's a lot of opportunity still ahead of us. And so we're continuing to invest in partnerships, in some acquisitions, and do you think that there's still upside in a lot of different areas? So would you say this regulatory scrutiny isn't slowing you down? It's really important for those of us in certain leadership positions to be very focused on constructively engaging and working with regulators on what are the issues, what is it they're trying to solve, and how can we constructively engage with them? At the same time, our engineers should focus on innovation and continuing to kind of up the bar on everything we're doing, address what is most helpful for our users. Google is facing more serious legal threats at this time in the United States than the other big tech companies. How are those conversations with regulators going? Are they frustrating at this point? Well, there's certain elements that are frustrating because I listen to the outline of some of the proposed legislation, and I think it's inconsistent with some of the priorities for public policy. So as an example, there are a lot of focus on what is called self-preferencing. Are you putting too many of your own products together? But during the pandemic, one in three small businesses said they would have failed without digital skills. Why? Because what they were able to do is connect with their users in different ways. So if you go search for a small business, you can then go to a map and you can get directed to the small business. That's a good thing. We have 6,000 small businesses who wrote in and said, you know what, we need these digital tools and skills. Same with a number of things on racial equity. Real surge in searches about, where is a black owned business near me and the ability to direct people through search and maps. So I think that what's really important, and that's why I said it's about constructive engagement, let's make sure we understand what they're trying to solve. And work with them on what is it that we're trying to address through products so that the products are helpful in the ways that they want? Facebook has taken a serious reputational hit. Has that had ripple effects or created collateral damage for Google? Well, I think that whenever there's a backdrop that's challenging, it has ripple effects. But what we're really underscoring is all of the steps and investments that we are making to really protect the ecosystem the way we are commitment to our users. So we know how sacrosanct that trust is and it's all about privacy and what are the steps that we're taking to make privacy protected for our users. What is it that we're looking at to protect content and content moderations? Google now reaches more than half the people on the planet. Why shouldn't we view Google as a monopoly? So I go back to the earliest days when Google, I first learned about Google back in 1998. And in those earliest days, when I heard about this eight search engine, the question is why do you actually need it? And back at Morgan Stanley, it's working with our research analyst Mary Meekers, she actually had her team put up white pages all around the conference room and was doing this comparison, what provided the most responsive results most rapidly. And all of a sudden you could see, well, when did this Google thing actually, maybe we do need something new. And that's been the ethos at Google since inception. It's just continued to innovate to make this eight never better experience for users. And so if we can deliver on that, which is what drives people here, it's really opening the world for so many people. So that's the intent. Facebook and Twitter are exploring digital currency. What is your thought on the crypto market? And is there a play for Google? So we look at it. There's nothing to comment on now. I think we're much more interested in blockchain and the underlying technology and the implications for the business and also for the way we can support our cloud customers. So certainly a lot of effort there. There's considerable chatter in the crypto universe that Web 3 and the blockchain could circumvent the power of Facebook and Google and more. What do you think about the next frontier of the internet? At this point I think there are a lot of different things ahead of us that are actually studyingly exciting that enable us to actually continue to address different needs and in some way we have something to whole right now chat all about how we could go about learning more",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4739,2022-10-20 02:17:36
16394," When I think there are a lot of different things ahead of us that are actually studying exciting that enable us to actually continue to address different needs and requirements. Like I look at for example in something like health where I think blockchain will be very valuable when you think about health and health records. There also a whole host of other areas where the data analytics that we provide are absolutely critical. Should we make excuses to our employers? Should we tell our like if I have to head to a parent's teacher conference or take a kid to the doctor, do I tell my boss that I want to ask? You don't tell your boss. You've got to get over the guilt. What was your biggest fear at that time and how did you overcome it? Well the biggest fear was I wouldn't make it and I remember when someone at some interview while I was going through chemo said where do you want to be in five years and I froze because it was I want to be alive. And I learned a couple of really important things. One given breakthroughs in medical technology. I learned to love the word manageable. This journey does become manageable, not for all cancers but for many more cancers. And that gave me a lot of confidence talking with other survivors about it is manageable get the best care and just plow through it. I was just very grateful. I'm grateful for all of the investments people have made over the years but for anybody out there and I think everybody sadly will be touched by cancer either themselves or someone they know and love many of these cancers are manageable and just go at it with gusto. So that's what I did. You're a mom of three sons and I find that especially remarkable because I also have three sons. How have you managed that over the course of this incredible career? How do you find that right mix of focus and free time to spend time with your family and doing the things that you love? So my kids give me energy, they're remarkable. And I think one of the important things for me is this notion that you do have to have a mix. It's not about trying to find balance, the physics of which is really challenging. I think when people try for balance they always feel they're failing on something because something's out of whack. So this metaphor that life is like a kaleidoscope and you need to have different shaped pieces of glass and different color and sometimes one is larger than the other and what's beautiful about life is when it's constantly moving around. And so to me that metaphor has actually been sort of an anchoring principle. The other is you have to put the kids first.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4740,2022-10-20 02:21:36
16395," And I actually had a woman who emailed me afterwards and said, I know you said I'm not supposed to tell my boss. So I won't, but I can't not tell somebody. So I'm going to email you. And I'm like, OK, that's step one. I'm going to have five step journey. Do not tell your boss. You're telling your boss, you know what? I need to do certain things for myself. And I'm getting, I feel guilty doing it, but I get everything done. There's no question. You are so beyond having to check in with people. Well, thank you. To not. We're in the middle of this so-called great resignation. And people are reflecting and changing and making big decisions. What's your advice to people in this big evolution? You know, huge choices ahead. Well, I think you framed it really well. I don't think it's the great resignation. I think it's the great reshuffle. And people are reflecting on what do they want, and how do they want to work, and how do they want to live their lives. So I think for all of us thinking about what does that mean for our institutions? It is about evolving the way we work, the way we interact, the expectations that we have, to say, but I grew up in a cubicle on the 26th floor of a skyrise. It doesn't work anymore. And so what should we do as leaders? And I think that our, this generation, appropriately, and it's very exciting, expects more from all of us. And so it's not just in how we work, but it is in what we do. And I think all elements of what's the mission? And are you delivering on the mission? Is really important. OK, so if you rapid fire questions, someone you'd love to have dinner with. Well, I'd love to say my parents, because they passed away in over years ago. Favorite family ritual? We do this crazy thing that we've done for years, which is everybody gets to pick where we travel. We come up with the five different locations, and then we all vote, and then we get the grid. And that's where we go. What's your favorite getaway? Probably, I would say maybe Iceland was the vast. That's an amazing one. New York or California? Ooh, so unfair. Well, sitting here outdoors right now, and knowing I can do that for the rest of the years for you nice, for the energy from New York. So I'm not going to, it's like, I don't pick amongst children. So, in closing, Google is a massive company, multiple divisions, many bets. Where are you spending most of your time now? I'm spending most of my time on your very important question about capital allocation, because if it really goes to this core point, you've got to invest for long-term growth, and making sure that you're investing with the right intensity, I often say, I don't want to get to the two-yard line, but not score. So you need to make sure you're investing with the right intensity to support long-term growth. That's the most important area where I would say I spend the bulk of my time. And then, of course, you have to prioritize in order to recycle to support those efforts. What kind of discussions are you having with Larry and Sergey now about this next phase of Google? So when they made the announcement about the role of change, they were very serious about moving to this board role, and they've been, they're amazing board members. Sundar, of course, relies on them for counsel wherever, whenever, but most of the interaction is really around what are we doing at the board level? And send great. And you have your freedom to allocate capital as you like. I work closely with Sundar and Philip and Thomas. Yes, we work as a great team. So what's the vision for Google then 10 years from now? It's fascinating. I think I had the same reaction you did when I heard Sundar say search is the biggest moonshot. And I think that continuing to find ways to be helpful to users, to solve what they need, where so many people are coming online, and it is video going to be the way they understand. It's going to be about search is going to be a different type of experience. So much of it's going to be about voice, first, and language translation. So it's going to continue to evolve. And what about for you personally? Where will you, you know, it's been so amazing to hear about your journey, and I'm just curious about your personal growth, like what you feel you've accomplished in the last, since you've been here and what you hope to accomplish. And I find that the opportunity to try new things, and to invest in new things, and as we think about, what does that mean?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4741,2022-10-20 02:28:04
16396," I find that the opportunity to try new things and to invest in new things and as we think about, well what does that mean for each one of our areas? I think that intellectual curiosity keeps you young and I think that continuing to learn is like your brain is like silly putty getting pulled in a lot of directions. So to me it's continuous learning. Report thank you so much for joining us it's been wonderful. Thank you. Great to have you on campus. Come back anytime. Thank you so much for doing this. Thank you so much for doing this. Well thanks for doing it. So sorry I'm late and I'm coming late. Not at all. It gave us more chance to tweak the lights for the 50,000s times. You're doing well? Yes. How often are you coming into the office these days? About two to three days a week. Yeah. How about you I guess you come in. Yeah I'm in every day now so no more kids on the set. I have to ask is your son still mining Ethereum? He and I literally were talking about it last night. He's like that. You are the one who made me give up on it. I'm like no no I didn't. But yeah the thing that's good about this is I think it excites a whole new generation about technology which is which is good. I really appreciate you taking this. Well thank you for doing it and thank you for coming down to do it. I'm ready to go and you guys are. From Google headquarters in Mountain View California this is Bloomberg Studio 1.0 with Alphabet CEO Sundar Pachai. Born and raised in India Pachai had almost no access to a computer until college but just years later found himself rising through the ranks of the world's largest search engine. In 2015 it was Pachai that Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin chose to run Google and later Alphabet. Now valued at more than two trillion dollars it's one of the most powerful companies on the planet. Sundar it's great to be with you today. Thanks for doing this. Great to be here in person. Google just hit a two trillion dollar market cap Alphabet I should say. Where is the next trillion dollars going to come from? You know I've always felt you know your market cap valuation is an effect of the value you provide and I feel fortunate our mission is timeless. You know there is more need to organize information than ever before. I still feel searches our biggest moon shot as a company. You know people will want radically more conversational experiences. They will want what we call multimodal experiences. They may speak to search. They may look at something and ask what what the information is. Being able to adapt to all that and evolve search will continue to be the biggest opportunity. We are so excited about the YouTube cloud.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4742,2022-10-20 02:32:18
16397," Being able to adapt to all that and evolve search will continue to be the biggest opportunity. We are so excited about the YouTube, cloud, or hardware products, Google Play. So we're building a diverse set of businesses, but underlying all of it is the investments we are making in AI. We've invested 100 billion dollars in R&D in the past five years. And so applying AI in a deep way is probably where we will create the biggest opportunity ahead. Microsoft is making some big acquisitions. Apple's anti-adtracking technology is shaking up the industry. What do you make of these competitive moves? Your competitors say they're on the right side of history. Are they? I look at the fact that there are three billion people who have access to knowledge of their fingertips. I look at the opportunity we provide. I look at the skills people are learning through YouTube. You know, I feel it everywhere when I go talk to people and providing access to information and knowledge. I think we'll end up being on the right side of history as well. Your predecessor, Eric Schmidt, told me that he feels the latest Facebook revelations are disturbing. Google also has access to massive amounts of our data. Why should half the world's population, more than half the world's population, trust Google to do the right thing? We are trying to do more with less data. One of the biggest changes we made was making order delete the default setting for new users signing in. And now over two billion users have their data continuously being deleted. Look, we rely on trust for people, you know, every day when people come to Google. You know, they placed their trust in us and vulnerable moments. Maybe a health issue on which they are trying to understand. There's no more important responsibility we have than doing right by that trust. You know, when we provide Gmail to journalists and realize that their accounts may be under attack by an authoritarian government. I mean, that's what motivates us to make sure be privacy be security be trust. We are doing the right thing. Over time regulation will have an important role to play here. I think privacy regulation is important in areas like AI regulation will be important. And so I think, you know, those will be part of the answers as well. The Facebook follow out that Instagram can be toxic to teens, for example, has this raised more or new concerns for you about the impact of technology, tech addiction, algorithms, YouTube even on our children and their development and their mental health. I mean, you're a parent and you also have a lot of power over how this plays out. You know, I mean, like you, you know, bringing kids up in this modern digital world is something I think all parents are anxious about rightfully so. I think, you know, it's part of why a few years ago when in YouTube, you know, we were exposed to a set of concerns. You know, we invested it became the number one priority to work harder. The reason YouTube invested so much in developing YouTube kids as a safe destination for young children, so on. The technology is going to play a big role in helping give children the next wave of opportunity as well. So the answer is to develop it responsibly. We have changed our balance in these areas and saying, we think about content responsibility first. And then the pace of development for new features in areas like YouTube. And so that's how we approach it for a while. Facebook and Microsoft are all in on the metaverse. What do you think about the metaverse? What's Google's metaverse strategy? It's always been obvious to me that computing over time will adapt to people and people adapting to computers. You know, you won't always interact with computing in a black rectangle in front of you. And just like you speak to people, you see and interact. Computers will become more immersive. They'll be there when you need it to be so always been excited about the future of immersive computing ambient computing, AR. And we are in that count as the metaverse. Is that what that is? You know, metaverses. I think it means different things to different people. The way I think about it is evolving computing in an immersive way with augmented reality. As part of that, there'll be many experiences. Some of which will be immersive.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4743,2022-10-20 02:36:39
16398," during in an immersive way with augmented reality. As part of that, there'll be many experiences, some of which will be immersive interactive virtual worlds, which is the metaverse concept. And I think this doesn't belong to any company, right? I mean, this is the evolution of internet and the web, the internet, all of it will continue to evolve. Google was famous for its campuses, where you could go and never leave. You had everything you ever wanted. Now, you've said they can be flexible, they can work from home, they can work at the office, they can be hybrid, they can work remotely, permanently, perhaps. Are you committed to really letting them do this forever? And if so, how does that change the future of work and society? Look, we've really embraced the fact that the future is going to be flexible. At Google, we've always tried to give agency to our employees. But we do realize the importance of bringing people together the creativity, community, and collaboration that comes with it. So the balance we are striking is this notion of 3.2. And what we're giving, the strength of our companies, we have more locations than most of the companies. So we're giving people a choice to move anywhere in the world. Four weeks they can work from anywhere. We're going to accommodate 20% of our workforce to be remote over time. So we're going to embrace that flexibility. Forever. Forever, yeah. And we're committed to it. Through it to all it forces us to design better products. And since people use Google Workspace to run their companies, I think gives us a chance to innovate and bring all that out. I think there is so much value in giving people more flexibility between their personal and professional lives. And I think it will lead to people being happier. And I think companies can be successful in that model. And so we are trying to get the best of both worlds, but embrace the flexibility and see where we go. How confident are you that when you look back, you'll be able to say Google did enough to help save the world? We are putting so much energy and resources into it. You grew up in India. You lived through droughts. Water was scarce. How has that experienced shaped your feelings about the urgency of stopping climate change? You know, I grew up in Chennai, India. And a big part of my childhood was really pretty severe water scarcity. We would get water trucked in for the streets and stand in lines and carry a few buckets of water home. There was no running water for many years. And but fast forward a few years ago, Chennai had won 100 year flood.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4744,2022-10-20 02:41:10
16399," or a home that was no running water for many years. And, you know, but fast forward a few years ago, you know, Chennai had one in a hundred-year flood, you know, which was a very extreme event. Kind of drove home. That combined with a few years ago, waking up to the orange skies here in the Bay Area, seeing the look of concern on my children's faces and having to explain it, you know, all kind of drove home in a deeply personal way for me. So I think it's the most defining issue we all face and, you know, definitely something very motivated on working towards. I remember waking up to those orange skies too and having to have that same conversation with my kids. Do you think the commitments at COP26 went far enough? You know, encouraged by many things, you know, we have to tip our hat to the people who are working super hard. The issues and the trade-offs are genuinely difficult, you know, you have to keep the economies growing, you know, it really matters. And, but at the same time, it's a pretty severe urgent issue. Some encouraged by the progress, I think it builds on the Paris Agreement. So I can see the forward progress. There is the deep anxiety that it all may not be enough. But, you know, we have to be optimistic and keep pushing. Google has set some aggressive targets to run entirely on clean energy, to be the first tech giant to do so 24 hours a day. How confident are you that when you look back on this time, let's say a decade from now, you'll be able to say Google did enough to help save the world? We are putting so much energy and resource into it. It's always been kind of a founding value for us. We've been carbon neutral since 2007. We've been matching our energy consumption with renewable energy over the past few years. So this, you know, we are now pushing, it's a moonshot, to be 24, seven carbon free. That means every search you do, every email you send, that we can do it carbon free. We were at 61% in 2019. The number is now 67%. We have set our goals to be 100% by 2030. And to do it globally, that means we have to solve new things which we haven't done before. Wind and solar alone won't be enough. We just started geothermal in Nevada. We will be investing in newer technologies, including carbon capture, et cetera, over time. So that's what excites me. We are a technology company at heart. So part of, there are many answers to this problem. Some of it is that we are going to have to innovate our way out of it. And, you know, we want to push as hard as possible in doing that. Our Bloomberg New Economy Forum is happening this year in Singapore. And the Asia Pacific region is one of the fastest growing internet economies on the planet. Where do you see the most room, the most opportunity for Google to grow there? You know, it's such a 13 time frame. You know, glad you're focused on the region. It's the most vibrant region we see. It's our 20th year since we opened our office in Tokyo. It was the first office outside the Bay Area. You have two and a half billion people on the internet that are many areas in which they are leapfrogging trends which are here and embracing the future. Digital payments is a great example. So many of our products originated from APAC, Google Maps, Google Pay. A lot of our journey to bring computing to more people is playing out in Asia as well. I am excited about also the work we are doing through cloud because the companies that are rapidly transforming themselves digitally, so a chance to provide that is something very exciting for us. So super dynamic region. Glad I feel like we are learning as Google being in the region. And so I think it will transform. The first 10 years I would have said we took products here and brought it to APAC over the past few years. We are beginning to build things there. And some of our future global products will be APAC first and rest of the world later. You can't talk about APAC without talking about China and your facing stiff competition from Chinese tech giants there and beyond. What should US policymakers know about competing with China? There's a lot of conversations about US and China.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4745,2022-10-20 02:45:22
16400," And beyond, what should US policymakers know about competing with China? You know, there's a lot of conversations about US and China, the competition is fierce. Many of the Canadians like AI and quantum computing where we are investing a lot, you know, Chinese companies are neck to neck. What I think about, you know, was encouraged by the news coming out of Glasgow about the US-China agreement on climate. To me, while we talk about all the all areas where we are competing, some of the biggest areas which are common challenges for all of humanity. The pandemic was one, AI and AI safety over time will be a shared one, obviously sustainability is another area like that. So I think these are all areas in which the countries can come together. And so I think that's a way by which we think about as, you know, when we compete on the internet and there may be different versions of how the internet plays out. So I see opportunities both sides. What are the chances that Google Search will ever come back to China? Or that Google Cloud would ever come to China? You know, today we don't provide most of our signed-in services in China and I don't see that changing. But you know, there are ways, as I said, in areas like AI or sustainability, I think there'll be opportunities for us to work together. Through Cloud, we will support multinational companies which have presents everywhere. And so maybe there are opportunities to work that way as well. AI is advancing at an astonishing rate and it is hard to understand sometimes what this really means. In concrete terms, how will our lives look different? Let's say 10 years from now as a result of AI. You know, done correctly, you know, in many ways it's going to be helpful to you. You'll take it for granted. The same way today, for example, in India or one third of the queries on many phones come through voice. But it's something people take for granted. You can do it. So over time, you'll expect to speak and be able to understand any language in the world. And you know, those are all ways it's going to make it better. You may go to a doctor's office and go through a scan and the system may be prioritizing for the radiologist so that they don't miss some important things, maybe giving them a second opinion. You know, so these are all ways in which it will seamlessly start playing a role. And I think we'll you know, we'll see that. It's a fact. You mentioned if done correctly. And there are concerns. There are fears that AI will replicate the worst of society even under Google's own roof from your own researchers. What scares you most about AI? What keeps you up at night? It's the most profound thing we are working on as humanity. And anytime you're developing technology that is a dual site to it, I think the journey of humanity is harnessing the benefits while minimizing the downsides. The good thing with AI is it's both going to take time. I think I've seen more focus on the downsides early on than most of the technology we've developed. So in some ways, I'm encouraged by how much concern there is. And you're right, even within Google, you know, people think about it deeply. We publish a lot of research. There are, I think it's more important that there are outside academic institution, governments, nonprofits looking at this issue as well. So I think it's it'll be an issue which will have a lot of attention, which gives me a lot of comfort as well. You said you'd pick up some new hobbies in the pandemic. What did you start? The cooking pizza is learning cook, which I was never good at. I'm caught on a little bit better.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4746,2022-10-20 02:49:36
16401," Mr. You have presided over Google through massive social movements that reverberated in and outside the company. What have you learned as CEO since the walkout? For me, it was a moment. I think it changed the company for the better. We've always been committed. It gave us an insight on what more we could do. We undertook deep commitments. The biggest overall and diversity and inclusion, I think if you're committed and you actually put in the effort behind it, you can make a difference. Now we have stated clear goals. We are on track to meet those goals. But it forced us to think about new answers. For example, tech companies used to talk about the pipeline problem. But we are now going to places where the talent is. We are working much harder. So going to Atlanta, going to DC, going to Chicago, going to New York, that's improving our diversity and representation at all levels. The war for talent is even more competitive now in this new world. What are you offering? Elon Musk has said, big tech is a place where talent goes to die. How do you respond to that? I look at the fact that we are looking to hire 30,000 people next year. I look at the impact we have on many people coming and working in the latest cutting edge things. Many people come in, people leave Google. We are proud of people who have left Google. I think there are over 2,000 companies that have been started by whom we call as Zublers. I'm equally proud of that. I think we are one part of a big system. I think I'm proud of the role we play in bringing in people and the impact they have over time in the outside world. All right. That's most of the heavy stuff out of the way. We're going to do some rapid fire just to get to know you a little bit better. You said you'd pick up some new hobbies in the pandemic. What did you start? I started cooking pizza, cooking pizza, just learning to cook, which I was never good at. I've gotten a little bit better. Cricket or soccer slash football? Wow. Stuff. Both. Please don't make any clues. Okay. Squigging or Ted Lasso? I watched both. The Ted Lasso is much more calming. I'd rather take Ted Lasso over Scoot Games any day. I know you're a voracious reader. What's the last good book that you read? I know I've been on a podcast bench. So a lot more podcasts than books nowadays. Okay. Favorite videos you watch on YouTube with your kids? A lot of music videos. Music videos. This whole notion where creators are watching other things and commenting on it. It's a trend which my kids are really into and I've kind of gotten used to it now. So, you know, watching other games. It's a phenomenon. Screen time policy that's worked for you as a parent. You know, what's not worked? You know, I've kind of given agency to my kids. The only thing I tell them is that I can look at their digital well-being once in a while with them. And so. How do you do that? I asked them to show it to me and they show it on their phones. So, you know, so that's pretty much the-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4747,2022-10-20 02:54:06
16402," to me and they show it on their phones. So that's pretty much the only thing. So beyond that, it's agency and talking to them about it and making sure we are spending time doing other things. And making sure they develop good habits, basically. Metaverse or real world? Done correctly, you shouldn't feel the need to make a choice. You always want to be present in the real world. And when you feel the need to do something, you want to do that. But I do think presence and the realness of the real world will end up mapping for humans for a long time. Do you own any crypto? I wish I did. I've dabbled in it, but you know, in and out. In and out. OK. Larry and Sergey, I'm not going to make you choose. How many times a week do you talk to them? I talk to them regularly. It kind of ebbs and flows. And so there are times we get excited about something and we spend a lot of time talking it through, but it depends on what I need. A piece of advice you wish you had in your 20s. And a piece of advice you wish you had in your 40s. 20s would be, you know, being patient. You know, I think when you're young, you're very impatient, which is a great thing. But sometimes you do amazing things by slowing down and being really focused and doing it over a period of time. And so I would advise the younger version of me to be more patient. Maybe at 40, I would say, you know, when I look at climate, you know, I want all of us to be impatient. So, you know, I feel like when there's an urgency towards something, I think the world needs to be impatient. So that's the advice I would give to a older version of me. How much do you personally wrestle with the decisions that you have to make? And how much longer do you see yourself being the CEO of alphabet, not just alphabet, but also Google? Yeah. On the first one, there are moments we all have to make tough decisions and, you know, and some decisions weigh on me. And, but it's a privilege to do it. I have very good people helping me think things through. So I think the combination makes it all fine. On the second thing, I'm so energized by the things we need to do. You know, I didn't have much access to computing growing up. It changed my life a lot. The one laptop or child goal really motivated me to come into technology. And when I look at last week, us launching a affordable smartphone in India, the chance to bring the next billion users in Asia and in Africa online, that gives me a lot of energy. All right. Well, we'll be watching from afar. Sundar Pachai, thank you so much for joining us. It's wonderful. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. It's wonderful. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Less shocking was his choice for successor. Jay Jassy was not only one of his longest tenured lieutenants, but the architect of Amazon's multi-billion dollar cloud business, Amazon Web Services, a moonshot that helped transform Amazon into not just e-commerce, but enterprise juggernaut. Jassy then needed to find his own successor, tapping a former colleague who helped grow AWS in its earliest days, but had since left to run Seattle software giant Tableau. His job to continue the reinvention of AWS and in turn Amazon. Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, new AWS CEO.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4749,2022-10-20 03:03:06
16404," Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, new AWS CEO, Adam Salipski. You worked for AWS for 11 years and then went on to become CEO of Tableau Software in 2016. Then you get a call from Amazon to come back and run AWS as CEO. Tell me about that call. Well, I was having a one-on-one at my prior company and my Apple news alerts went off like everybody else did. It's at Jeff Bezos, who's taking on a new role and Andy Jassy's taking on the CEO role of Amazon. And of course Andy and I worked shoulder to shoulder about 20 feet apart for 11 years. Of course I reached out and congratulated him and we started talking. And the conversation turned to some of the possibilities and next thing I know a little while later. Here I am back at Amazon, absolutely delighted and honored to be the CEO of AWS and helping to shepherd this amazing business for our customers. In that process did you talk to Jeff as well? Yeah, I had some communication but it was principally with Andy who of course was a new AWS business best and of course was taking on the CEO role. But yeah, there was contact as you might expect with a small handful of other people. So what did Andy tell you he wanted in the next chapter for AWS? Andy reminded me nothing I needed reminding but that it has really still day one for AWS and for our customers. It is still so early in this business and we shouldn't think that just because the business has grown rapidly or just because we're currently the leader in the cloud. So I don't think that it is anything close to mature. And so he really reminded me that we have to stay hungry and innovate as quickly as we ever have done in the past. You're about half a year into the job. What changed while you were gone that surprised you? Well I think that so many more customers have really adopted the cloud and really decided that they're going all in. So I mean it was a pretty decent sized business when I left but it's really grown and the customer base is really expanded. And so now we have very deep relationships at the CEO level, the CIO level across every country, every industry, every use case. And we're regularly interacting with the most senior people at our client organizations. So you were working at real networks in the early 2000s and I understand you were offered a job at AWS without even really knowing what it was. I guess AWS was in stealth mode. It was very secret. So it was hard that the company didn't want to talk too much about it. But of course we had to talk a certain amount about it. So the call I got went something like we have this initiative to turn the guts of Amazon inside out and expose it to other people. And it sounded intriguing, although I confess I didn't fully understand what that was all about. So I came in and started talking to Andy and a few of the other senior leaders and eventually to Jeff. And I would have to say that even by the time I took the job I thought I mostly understand what they're talking about. And it sounds like a good idea and I'm in. But I also was like well, we'll just have to see how it goes and Amazon's a big place. And so I think we got a lot of intent to succeed here. And that's the thing that impressed me was Amazon really had the desire and the intent and the belief that this could be a really good business. AWS comes out of stealth mode and is the first to market with a cloud infrastructure service in 2006. How important was that first start and do you think AWS still has an advantage today because of that? I think the time to market advantage that we had, which was probably honestly five to seven years, head start before other companies really started to take this seriously. And it was, frankly, it was just one of the biggest things that happened to us in the early years. Because at the beginning, a lot of people didn't get it. I would get asked a lot in 2006. So what does this have to do with selling books? And I even had a slide with kind of a pile of books on it and a question mark next to it. And the answer was it has nothing to do with selling books. But the technology which enables us to sell books, being global, being at a massive scale, being secure.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4750,2022-10-20 03:07:09
16405," to sell books, being global, being at a massive scale, being secure, being low cost, being highly performant. All that technology has everything to do with offering these types of services externally. Now, AWS isn't a scrappy startup anymore, and you do have big rivals, even though AWS is still the leader, Microsoft and Google are big rivals. How do you make sure that being big doesn't slow you down? That's a great question, because we are currently the leader, and I mean, depending on which third party you look at, we're probably a little bit more than twice as big as number two. And it's really important to continue to act as if we're insurgents and to be insurgents and not to start to act like incumbents. And I like to talk about actually managing the business. We want our senior leaders to be managing product and managing customers. And I think as you get bigger and you put more and more layers into your company, it's all too frequent that you start managing math. You start managing ratios and percentages and growth. And I think it's a real disease if you stray away from really focusing on a deep way on the product you're building and a deep way on what your customers are telling you. And so we try and organize both with our org structure as well as just with our culture and what we choose to focus on, on really making sure that everybody is thinking about one or both of those two things, product and customers. And if you keep even the most senior leaders engaged at that level, then all of a sudden you maintain the urgency and you keep acting like an insurgent. We got to feel that urgency every day. So keep acting like an insurgent. That's the motto. Absolutely. And structure yourself and build a culture that allows you to. It's one thing to say it. But it's easy to say it. But it's much harder to put in place enabling mechanisms that enable you to do so. And we focus a lot of effort on those mechanisms. Now do you think the cloud keeps getting bigger? And that AWS and Microsoft and Google just get bigger pieces of an ever-expanding pie? Or at some point, does it become a zero-sum game? And that fight for market share becomes more brutal and more bloody? Well, I mean, this is a very large market segment. I mean, if you look at global IT spend, it's in the trillions of dollars I've seen estimates like three trillion dollars. It doesn't really matter how many trillions it is. It's very, very large. And we've always believed that this was too good a market segment opportunity for the really to only be one winner. And sure enough, you've seen robust competition emerge and we all compete vigorously. But it is, the segment is just growing so rapidly that I think really for us, we believe that the winning business strategy for a long time to come and I would maintain forever is to focus not on the competitors, but to focus maniacally on customers and wake up every day understanding exactly what it is that they need us to build next and then work backwards from there, back internally to how can we build those things. And if we do the best job at building the most quickly, the things that are most important for our customers, then I'm really not worried about what the competitors will do. You worked 10 feet away from Andy Jassy in the early days. Tell us something about the Amazon CEO that no one knows, but you. You're going to get me in trouble aren't you? I'm going to get you in trouble aren't you? I'm going to get you in trouble aren't you?

16406," [♪ OUTRO SOFT MUSIC BECこれは You worked 10 feet away from Andy Jassy in the early days. Tell us something about the Amazon CEO that no one knows but you. You're going to get me in trouble, aren't you? I grew up in Seattle and Andy coming from New York has this fascination I don't understand with New York sports teams. I've had to endure that for a lot of years. New Yorkers, yeah. So what are you going to do? I think come to adopt some of the Seattle teams, particularly the new hockey team, the Kraken here. As he should. Exactly. So how do you expect Andy will be different from Jeff or how has Andy already been different from Jeff? Well, I think we're all different as leaders. I think it's all important that we all bring our own stamp to it and operate within ourselves. I don't think I would be a very good Andy. I don't want to presume but I would assume that Andy wouldn't be a great Jeff because Jeff's Jeff, Andy's Andy and I'm me. So I think that Andy was certainly bringing a great depth of experience from AWS which is one important part of the business and will having operated that business for so long. I expect that will also give him an opportunity although he was involved in other parts of Amazon certainly for a number of years. We'll be able to bring a fresh perspective to the whole company just as I hope to bring to AWS. And I think that fresh perspective is often helpful. I think just the mere act of change is useful for for the business, for customers, for employees and just to shake things up a little bit. So I think just a fresh perspective. How will you be different from Andy? Well, I think that the world around us is changing so much that we're going to have to be different. It doesn't matter what we did yesterday and right after I joined we actually added two new leadership principles, which is very exciting. One's around striving to be Earth's best employer and the second around focusing on the fact that success and scale bring broad responsibility. And those are things about which I personally am very passionate and so I really personally look forward to digging in and helping the company to figure out what are those things that we have to figure out, where can we innovate to be Earth's best employer. And then also to figure out externally what can we do to really be great citizens of our local communities, to be great citizens of our national communities and to be great citizens of the global community. And I care a lot about those things as a lot of other people do here, but I plan to put a good amount of energy and time and focus and hopefully help Amazon innovate in all of those areas. How closely do you work with Andy day to day? Does he regularly weigh in on AWS decisions or not? Well, he's got a pretty broad scope of things to worry about now. So he's got a pretty intense day job, I believe. So he's really focused across the company as you would expect him to be. But that being said, obviously, AWS remains an important part of Amazon. And so we touch base regularly, be it in person or via email, just on the most important things going on in the business. Does Jeff ever weigh in on AWS decisions? Yes, I mean, really from the beginning, Jeff was involved at the very, very beginning at some of the most fundamental decisions. How do you price EC2? What do you name S3? What does the detail page look like? Obviously, over time, the business grew. But Jeff was always available when we needed him and I certainly anticipate that will be the same.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4752,2022-10-20 03:16:00
16407," We, the business grew, but Jeff was always available when we needed him, and I certainly anticipate that will be the same going forward. So is he still available now? And what do you understand that Jeff's priorities are? Sure. Well, I'll let Jeff speak to his own priorities, but certainly Jeff has been available when, for example, we've been doing our annual planning cycle as many companies have, and it's been great to have Jeff, you know, wane on really where we're heading for the next year and beyond, and to just make sure it's easy to get focused on the details of the business, and it's great to have multiple people who can help you pick your eyes up a little bit. Now, you joined AWS in the middle of a pandemic. You came back to AWS in the middle of a pandemic. That's hopefully moving into the rear view mirror. Moderna is one of AWS's biggest customers. If it weren't for the cloud, if it weren't for AWS, would we have had a vaccine? As quickly as we did. I've got to tell you, I'm Iuse, but it's been an absolute privilege for us to work with Moderna because what they're doing, obviously, is literally life-saving, and they've been so innovative and so creative. So Moderna took a drug development process to get to a vaccine candidate. That process would typically have taken them 20 months. And doing that on AWS in conjunction with all the innovation on their side, reduced that 20 months to 42 days, 42 days to get the vaccine candidate, the mRNA vaccine candidate for COVID-19. And those really running multiple parts of Moderna on AWS. So if you look at the drug design part, they had their drug design studio running on AWS all the way to manufacturing with the new digitized manufacturing that they call their digital manufacturing platform. So it's really end to end and the ability to use massive amounts of resources and to pick the exact type of service and capability for each part of the job and to really bring the full set of resources to bear. In addition to not having to focus on the IT and the infrastructure and the technology, and rather letting Moderna focus on the all-important job of drug discovery. So working in partnership, it was just magnificent to see what they accomplished. Since you joined AWS, a number of longtime AWS leaders have moved on to Microsoft, to Stripe, to Tableau, does that concern you? Well, actually retention has been very good. If you mentioned the senior leaders, if you look at the VP Plus ranks, VP and above ranks at Amazon, the average tenure is over a decade, over 10 years. So that's actually very, very strong retention. So of course, you're always going to have some level of people coming and people going. And at the end of the day, that's actually healthy for the business. You want new perspectives to come in. Of course, in the right proportion. Amazon has opened an investigation after 550 employees supported a petition, claiming a culture of discrimination, harassment, bullying, and bias. What's the status of this? Well, we are incredibly focused, and I personally believe it's incredibly important to really have a very diverse, inclusive and equitable environment. And we're going to make sure that whatever it takes that we've got that. So we believe that we're really doing a lot of things to deliver on that, and we've got a lot of innovative efforts around bringing in a diverse workforce, which we have to have both because we're going to serve our customers best, their diverse. We have to match that diversity. And also, I just believe it's our responsibility, and it's the right thing to do. Any time there is any possibility that something is not gone the way we wanted to, we're going to investigate it thoroughly. That's what we're doing in this case, and we'll make sure that we're operating in a way that's consistent with our values, and that's always the only goal. If you could rewind to the early 2000s, the earliest days of AWS, is there anything you would have done differently to build an inclusive culture, to start with a more inclusive culture, to make sure that it didn't become a boys' club? Well, I don't think that's what we have. I think that we do have a really...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4753,2022-10-20 03:20:10
16408," a comma, you know, a boys club. Well, I don't think that's what we have. I think that we do have a really fun, exciting, innovation led and inclusive culture. No, we're close to where we need to be. We're gonna be restless and dissatisfied with our progress on DE and I, just as we are with every other part of our business. Mark Zuckerberg is making a big bet on the metaverse. How big do you think it's gonna be? It's such an interesting sentence. The metaverse is real. I think it's gonna be a good one. I think it's gonna be a good one. I think it's gonna be a good one. AWS has the biggest trove of sensitive corporate data in the world. I'm curious how you think about the balance between data and privacy and, you know, freedom and civil liberties in the modern era. I mean, there are governments. There are nation states around the world that want that information. Hackers and criminals want that information. Well, we are very clear to start with that. Our first job is security. We often say security is job zero. It was on the first page of our operating plan pretty much every year. Every year that I can remember. But what about when governments request that information? So, subpoena that information. Sure. Well, we are very clear that our customers' data is their data. So, the data belongs to our customers. And not everybody operates that way. We are not going to look at customers' data. We are not going to compete against our customers using their data. Their data is their data. And furthermore, we have all sorts of architectural best practices that our customers should be and are using for any sensitive data. And so, a lot of that really relies around encryption. And so, we build a lot of different encryption capabilities. So, that any sensitive data, which could leak for any reason, be it to a government, be it to a hacker, be it to anyone else, any form of security breach, that it's encrypted and useless to anybody else. Given the broad array of encryption solutions that we provide, it's actually very doable and powerful for our customers to safe-grout their data that way. Mark Zuckerberg is making a big bet on the metaverse. Is AWS going to have a role in the metaverse? I think AWS already has a big role in the metaverse. So, I think the cloud enables the metaverse. So, if you think about all of the compute capacity, all of the storage, all of the machine learning, which is required to create, compelling and delightful end user experiences in the metaverse, a lot of that is already today running on AWS. So, if you take...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4754,2022-10-20 03:24:35
16409," A lot of that is already today running on AWS. So if you take Epic Games, for example, so Epic Runs Fortnite, you know, massively popular game, 350 million users worldwide, and Epic Runs, almost everything on AWS from the back end, servers to the analytics and everything in between. So I think that's a great example of the metaverse at work, and all that's happening today on AWS. And we anticipate that's only going to grow really rapidly in the future. How big do you think it's going to be? Such an interesting sentence. The metaverse is real, and yet it's virtual at the same time. I think that if we continue to do what we've always done, which is to provide a technology platform that allows organizations to transform, then these gaming and entertainment and social media and other companies will be able to do what they do best, which is to focus on innovating on behalf of their end users. And I think that the metaverse in many other areas will be rich with inventions. So this next conversation will happen in the spheres, in the metaverse. That's where we'll next meet. That can be, I'll meet you in the metaverse. All right, see you there. Now, I know that climate change, you know, and stopping climate change, and your data center footprint is a big passion of yours. How fast will Amazon's data centers get to carbon neutral? Amazon is already the largest purchaser of renewable energy in the world. And we intend to be 100% renewable energy by the year 2025. We originally said 2030. We actually accelerated that by five years to 2025. And that's part of our broad or climate pledge that Amazon created, and to which we've now gotten 200 other organizations to sign on to. And the climate pledge is to be a net zero carbon by 2040, and that's 10 years ahead of the Paris Accord target. So we know how to do some of that. Other part are going to require invention, but we really look forward to it. And I think it's one of the most important things we can do for our generation. Amazon counts some of the biggest oil and gas producers as its customers. Isn't that a contradiction? Should you be kicking them off your platforms? Those customers are trying to get to sustainable business models and on new energy sources. And so many of those customers are figuring out how do they get to wind, how do they get to solar, how do they get into batteries, all new business models relying on renewable energy. And I think rather than abandoning them and having them maybe dig in more on fossil fuels, if we can enable them to move faster, to be more innovative, and to be more agile in figuring out new business models, new technical solutions, experimenting, failing fast, and moving on to the next idea, then the whole world will get to the renewable energy solutions that we need. At this year's re-invent conference, it'll be the first time that Andy Chassi is not giving the keynote. You will be, give us a preview. What can we expect to hear? We're going to have a lot of really exciting announcements. So I think across our service portfolio, you'll see that. We have a lot of exciting partner announcements. The partner ecosystem still remains to this day so important to what AWS is doing, and we have some great announcements lined up for that. And then I think people are going to want to see that we're making it easier and easier for them to consume the cloud and to work with AWS. And so we're going to continue to, in addition to building more powerful basic capabilities, we're going to continue to make it easier and easier in a variety of ways to interact with AWS.

You've been at Google for 20 plus years going all the way back to Larry and Sergey. In the garage, you've been the CEO of YouTube for seven plus years. How has your job changed in that time? Since I joined being the CEO of YouTube, I would say one of the biggest things that has changed certainly has just been maybe the recognition of the importance of digital video. So when I first joined, actually a lot of people would say, oh, like, why did you join? I was running ads beforehand. And that was, that's been the main way Google generates revenue. And so a lot of people said, like, why did you leave that and go to YouTube? But I always believed in digital video. And I believe that",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4756,2022-10-20 03:33:02
16411," But I always believed in digital video, and I believe that now we see that the world also believes we've seen a lot of adoption of digital video and the benefits that that can have. You've championed this diversification strategy at YouTube since you started. What's working and what's not working? Well, our main value of generating revenue is from advertising. But we also have really grown our subscription revenue, and that has been really, really important from many different reasons. So that has enabled our users to have an experience where they can have music, YouTube music, and premium. We just announced the 50 million subscribers that we were really excited about. But we also see other ways that our creators generate revenue. So our creators, for example, generate revenue with channel subscriptions. They may sell merchandise. We also have things like digital goods, so like super chat, super thanks. And so we've basically diversified the number of ways that our ecosystem is generating revenue. The original tagline for YouTube was broadcast yourself, and that concept has exploded. You have ordinary people in the spotlight. When they grow up, they want to be an influencer. They want to be a YouTube star or a YouTube creator. What do you see as the future of the creator economy? I see a lot of possibility with the creator economy, and because I see that many people have a lot of interest and they have a lot to offer. And beforehand, they went up and able to have shared that with the world. And so there's so many people depending upon what they're telling or their interest is, whether it's a sport or cooking or gaming or hairstyles that people have come out and really been able to share that and create a lot of jobs. So we actually see, like our, we actually saw a 35% increase in the number of creators that are generating six-figure income out of YouTube and in the last year. And so that's just an example of how the creator economy is continuing to grow. Well, and for years, YouTube was the only company that actually paid creators. But now a lot of companies are paying creators. Facebook and Instagram, Snap, TikTok. How do you see that competition playing out? Who wins? Well, it is a competitive landscape. And in general, competition's good. It makes everyone work harder and that's good. I mean, we look at creators and we say, they're going to come to us if we do the best job. And creators come to us looking basically for fame and fortune. How can I have a skill or I have a talent? Something I want to share with the world. And YouTube can help that be known, can help them provide that fame. But also, we can generate revenue for them. And so as long as we're doing a good job of that, creators are going to come to us. If we start to fail, then they're going to leave us. And they're going to go to another platform. And so we just need to work really hard to make sure that we deliver that for our creators. A year ago during the Black Lives Matter protest, YouTube made big commitments to Black creators in particular. What's been the progress there? And how do you see YouTube, the potential for YouTube, to be used as a tool for social justice? Well, so we've made an announcement that we were going to do a $100 million Black Voices Fund. And so we're continuing to develop content there. But one of the other thing, and I think there's been a lot of great content that's come out and we'll certainly see more. But because YouTube doesn't have any gatekeepers, like you can just post and become a creator, we have seen a lot of people of different backgrounds and underrepresented backgrounds become creators and have audiences. We never really measured it beforehand because we didn't have a way. And so one of the things that we've done is we've enabled creators to now tell us what backgrounds they affiliate with so we can have a better understanding of how they're doing on our platform. Let's talk about YouTube shorts. It seems to be a top priority. We all know that TikTok is on the rise. Some important are YouTube shorts to the platform, to the company. So YouTube shorts, it's very important. We see that creators and users want to watch all types of content, long form, short form. It turns out that the first video that was actually ever uploaded to YouTube, me at the zoo, was an 18-second video. So it was a short form video. And we have lots of short form videos and we've had it way before TikTok did. But what we have really been leaning into more is just...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4757,2022-10-20 03:37:37
16412," So it was a short form video. And we have lots of short form videos. And we've had it way before TikTok did. But what we have really been leaning into more is just enabling those to be found. And then a lot of the creation tools. And so bringing a lot more mobile creation is really important for us going forward. Did you notice that viewing time was being lost to TikTok? Did you see that trend? And do you see TikTok as a sort of existential threat? I mean, we definitely see many competitors in this space. What we're just focused on are our own metrics. Do we see our users engaging? Where's our opportunity? We're always looking around and seeing what our competitors are doing. And if they're doing something that we think would be good for our users and our creators, we're also going to look at how we can improve our own economy, create our economy, and what's good for our users. I think a lot of people, you know, we talk about vaccine hesitancy and they blame social media. They say YouTube's not doing enough. One of the big things for us is to continue to work with public health experts to get their messages across. Today's your big day. Are you excited? Mama is tired. They speed up work. You have to feed your creativity. So this tree house, you guys ready for the movie? See what we can do. At this point, YouTube has become a hub for discovery, for information, for, you know, it satisfies our curiosities, right? That comes with a lot of inspiration, but also with misinformation. When it comes to vaccines, vaccine hesitancy, videos that cause a public health risk, where do you want to see YouTube do better? We've taken responsibility very seriously. It's been one of my top priorities. So first of all, we want to make sure that if there's information that violates our policies, we came up with 10 different policies around COVID. Then if that's a violation of policies, then that's something that will remove. We removed over a million videos associated with COVID. But we also want to make sure that we're raising up information that we think would be that come from trusted and authoritative sources. And we've really been able to do that. I think a lot of people, you know, we talk about vaccine hesitancy and they blame social media. They say YouTube's not doing enough, you know, how do you respond to that? Yeah, I mean, I think, first of all, we're always learning. I just, just to be fair, like, we're always thinking about how can we do that? We're looking at the feedback and working with public health experts across the board. And, you know, I think one of the big things for us is to continue to work with public health experts to understand, you know, what are the ways that we can partner with them to get their messages across. And I really believe that that is something that has really changed is the evolution of bringing, you know, creators, musicians, experts talk about it. We never would have seen that before in the pandemic. How much do you internalize the criticism of YouTube?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4758,2022-10-20 03:42:23
16413," How much do you internalize the criticism of YouTube's content? And how does that influence the decisions that you make as CEO? I care about the legacy that we leave. I care about how media is consumed by the next generation and I really have put a lot of time and effort to make sure that we are acting responsibly. And there's always a balance between the free speech and the... Right, but being responsible and taking down content that we think could lead to some kind of real-world harm. And so, I mean, sure, I think whenever you're in a position like that, there's going to be a lot of criticism. But our goal is just to continue to talk to experts and evolve. And how do you make decisions in those tough moments where it's a tough call? Like how much of it is making a decision or leading by consensus and how much does it come down to you? The goal is that when we have tough decisions, they're not... They are like improvising in some way. Like we've made a concrete set of decisions beforehand and then we're looking and saying, is this something that meets our standards? Is it a violation or not a violation? And if it seems like there's some set of issues with the content that we have on the platform, we're going to go back to experts and then reevaluate. It should be making changes to our policies. YouTube helped keep a generation of children connected, educated, entertained, distracted, through the pandemic. What have you learned from that experience and what do you see as the potential future of YouTube as a tool for learning? As a tool in schools. When I meet people and they find out I'm the CEO of YouTube, almost always they tell me about something they learned on YouTube or something they're a family member who learn. So I see that as being a very significant part of YouTube. And during the pandemic, we certainly saw that a lot more education went online and we had all the homeschooling, we had people who had to also just learn a lot of skills that they hadn't learned beforehand. But probably the biggest thing that we also learned was just and that I really saw was the need for us to continue to work with educational institutions. And the need for us to be able to integrate with some of the learning tools that the kids are all using because they are using YouTube. And there's a lot more that we can do to really help educators have YouTube be a key part of the curriculum. My kids are on YouTube a lot and sometimes more than I want them to be and sometimes it's super productive and they're learning something cool. And sometimes it's not productive at all. How are you innovating to make the time that kids spend on YouTube more valuable and of course safe? It's very important to me as a parent to make sure that we're giving parents options about how what they want their kids to see. And that's one of the reasons that pretty much as soon as I got to YouTube we started working on YouTube kids. Which is a separate app which is important for kids in terms of how we can control the quality and we can give parents a lot more control about what kind of content is appropriate for them and their family. And you know there are many other things like we actually just came out with a supervised experience for tweens because tweens was one of the age groups that was actually hardest. They usually don't want to be on the kids app but they're not 13 to be on the on the main app and so the supervised experience is something that we recently came out with. The Wall Street Journal has been doing some in-depth reporting on Facebook. The report is that Facebook knew that Instagram was toxic for teen girls and didn't do anything about it. Does YouTube look at the impact it has on teen users? The influence it might have on someone's body image or self-esteem? First of all I think it's a very important topic and we do have a panel of experts that we work with to be able to help us understand what are the different ways that our product could be used or what are how do we face some of these challenging issues to make sure that we're getting the best advice. And we certainly do see for a lot of really tough issues that YouTube can be a really valuable resource. So body positivity, mental health, we see a lot of creators actually talk about mental health and that for a lot of kids it's really...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4759,2022-10-20 03:46:19
16414," The creativity, mental health, we see a lot of creators actually talk about mental health and that for a lot of kids it's really like destigmatizes and enables people to talk about what's happening and what's going on with them. The potential long-term impacts of YouTube on teens and on children, whether it is toxic or whether it's addictive. Is that something that you wonder about? Is that something that you struggle with not just as a CEO but as a mom? We certainly want to make sure that we are doing what we can to be responsible with kids and in every way possible. And that's one of the reasons that we actually have worked hard to give parents as many options as possible for them to decide what is important for them and their family. Whether that's like limiting screen time, like limiting what is the content they actually have access to. I mean even letting parents just say these are like the 10 videos. My kid can only see these 10 videos. And so that is really important for us to give the tools back to parents for them to decide what is best for them and their family. Are you concerned about looming regulation? There may be regulation that is well intended but actually then has a really negative impact. And so that's really important for them to decide what is best for them and their family. And so that's really important for them to decide what is best for them and their family. I would like to begin by addressing the heinous attack on the United States Capitol. Like all Americans I am outraged by the violence, lawlessness and mayhem. How much did President Trump test YouTube and how much did it test you as a leader? Election integrity is something that we see incredibly, incredibly important and have leaned into in every way we possibly can. We treat all public figures and all public leaders the same as we treat any individual. And so meaning that everybody is held to the same standards. And so we definitely held President Trump as we would hold all other presidents and all other elected officials to the same standards that we hold our creators and anyone else on YouTube. But was that difficult for you as the CEO of the company? That's kind of a big responsibility. I mean, yeah, it is difficult, but it is very important and we also are global. So we're dealing with leaders from all over the world. And there were a number of leaders that and there continue to be a number of leaders that that poster that there's content that may be a violation of our policies. But we do hold a consistent standard across everything that we do. YouTube was the last platform to ban Trump and you have said his channel will be reinstated when an elevated risk of violence has subsided. How and when specifically will you make that decision? Well, we'll make that decision based on a number of different factors, whether that is like events in the news, signals we're seeing from them.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4760,2022-10-20 03:50:45
16415," We make that decision. Well, we'll make that decision based on a number of different factors, whether that is like events in the news, signals were seeing from the government. And we'll certainly continue to evaluate that based on a large number of signals that we see. And will he ultimately be reinstated? I mean, we've stated that we will reinstate him when we believe that there is no risk to public safety or no public danger. We'll just remove devoting app for Russian opposition leader Alexi Navalny. The Russian government seems to be stepping up requests to take down content. You've talked in the past about your family history, your grandparents living behind the iron curtain, being concerned about censorship back then. And Russia is a huge YouTube audience. How concerned are you about Russian government overreach? One of the things that is important to us at YouTube is the fact that we do enable so many voices and that we do enable people to express themselves and really celebrate the freedom of speech. And we certainly, that's a core value of ours. And but when we work with governments, there are many things that we have to take in consideration, like whether it's like local laws or what's happening on the ground. And so there's always gonna be multiple considerations that we're gonna have to take into consideration. Navalny said that YouTube deleted a video, one of his videos. Was that at the request of the Russian government? We certainly get requests from governments. And we look and consider what's, why are we getting the request? What's actually happening on the ground? And based on a whole bunch of different factors, we make a decision. So we don't always, those are not always requests that make sense for us to honor, but uncertain cases, we will honor them in that country. The Biden administration seems to be targeting big tech. We've seen Mark Zuckerberg, we've seen Jack Dorsey now testify before Congress multiple times. And I've heard it said that YouTube is getting a pass. Do you think you should be up there testifying? Well, I think we do get a lot of scrutiny. I feel like there's a lot of scrutiny. And because YouTube is part of Google, Sundar has testified a number of different times and answered many different questions on YouTube. So I do believe there's a certain amount of scrutiny. And if I were ever asked to testify, it certainly would go and testify as well. You're one of the most senior women at Google. If not the most senior woman at Google, Google has faced a lot of scrutiny for how it treats women in recent years. How much progress do you think Google has made in hiring and promoting women across the company? And how much progress do you think still needs to be made? I see a really big effort across technology as a whole to be able to be more inclusive. And I think that is really positive. I've been a big supporter of it since the very beginning. And I mean, I think at Google, there are many efforts and there's a lot of work that has been done. And I'm sure there's a lot more for us to continue to do. And if you just look at the stats, you can see they're not enough women. We need more women in technology. And I think we have made a lot of progress, but it's still hard. It's harder to be a woman in technology. It's harder to be a minority of any kind. And so I think there's still a lot of work for us to do. When we last spoke five years ago, I asked you about being a mom, you have five kids, and you said something that really stuck with me. You said being a mom makes me a better leader. I prioritize better. I see something growing fast and I run towards that. If something's growing closely, I'm like, I don't have time for that. How has that management strategy played out for you? I think it's played out really well. Thank you, Sven. I mean, prioritization is everything when you look at it because we have a lot of opportunity. There's a lot of moving pieces, very dynamic environment. So if you can prioritize and say, these are like the most important things to do, then you're gonna get there faster. Larian, Sarge, have no left. How long do you plan to keep running YouTube? How long do you plan to stay at Google? As long as I have a mission that I believe in and things that I'm excited about getting done. So I have a lot of ways that I see that YouTube can continue to grow. I have a lot of products and ideas and things that aren't yet released and things that aren't yet doing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4761,2022-10-20 03:55:04
16416," of a lot of ways that I see that YouTube can continue to grow. I have a lot of products and ideas and things that aren't yet released and things that aren't yet doing. And I'm excited about getting those done. So I think if there comes a time where I no longer have a list of projects where I feel like I don't have that much more to add, then it'll be probably time to do something else. Would you throw your hat into the ring to be Alphabet's next CEO or if the board asked you would you step up and do that? Well, I think Sundar's doing a great job. Very, very, please. I think he's doing, I mean, it's a very challenging job. There's a lot of different constituents and a lot of product, a lot of different issues. And I mean, I'll just say I'll always do whatever would be wherever I could be most helpful to the company. Do you still talk much to Larry and Sergey? I do still see them socially, though, not not workwise. Do you ever talk about work? I mean, sometimes we'd be casually, but our business is very complex right now. And there's a lot of things that are happening. And so it's hard for, I mean, people may have different opinions, but to really engage, it's a long conversation. What do you want your legacy to be? I am proud of the way that we've been able to enable people to have a channel, to have an audience. Like I just met with a number of three creators. And like YouTube really was able to let them shine and create audiences in a business and employ people that otherwise never would have happened. And so that's certainly one continuing to grow that. I'd say second, it's been really important to me to see a lot more women in technology. That has been just a personal goal of mine is to like be a role model and try to support women. And I feel very fortunate to be have gotten to where I have. And I know it was due to like many different factors. And I want to support the next generation of women and make see technology as like an open place where anyone can come and be successful. And then probably lastly continue to grow what we're doing with education. Susan, which is PCO YouTube. Thank you. Thank you so much for having me. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

16417," [""ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ This is the book they have written for at least our top stories this morning. This is a close-up. The president says he sees an end to the front loading of aggressive hikes by early next year and a shift to keeping policy restrictive with small adjustments as inflation cools. We're predicting, at least the dot plot is predicting that inflation will come down. It will be a disinflationary year in 2023. A night of political turmoil in the UK with list trusts as Premiership looking close to imploding and it firings, resignations and allegations of bullying in the House of Commons. The president shares slide after hours as the company reports sales short of Wall Street's estimate, citing delivery and production bottlenecks, putting on Musk promises an epic end of the year. And a national bank of Kuwait beats on third quarter in an income with a 45% year on year gain. We speak this hour to the deputy CEO. Just got any of our cross-demoers, I'm usually going to dinner. Dubai. And I'm going to screw right alongside you. Sex Pistols had anarchy in the UK. I didn't listen to that. I did. There's anarchy. There's political chaos. Chassis is the Irish word in the UK. The point is taking the brunt of what is literally anarchy in the Tory party. A new home secretary who lobbies actively against list trust the Prime Minister. The chief with resigned. No, she didn't. She's still that labor. So, members being physically manhandled in the House of Commons. What do you do with the pine? Do you think that it goes dine? Do you think the Bank of England rate hikes will save you? The hedges say great hill capital in New York. In the next one to three years, this currency will rally. But in the meantime, it is as chaotic as it was under George Sorrows tenure to break the pine. Now, what's going to happen in terms of who takes the strain of anarchy in the political landscape? Will it be the bond market, which is yet to open to this cacophony of catastrophe and misgiving in the palace of Westminster?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4763,2022-10-20 04:03:53
16418," political landscape. Will it be the bond market, which is yet to open to this cacophony of catastrophe and misgiving in the palace of Westminster, the bank of England, the long end of course, it doesn't intervene. They're not selling long dead of guilt. We're back below 4%. But here we are at the mid part of the curve. How will the bond market react to the political chaos and crisis? That is evident for everybody to see. The question is, does the bond market pay the price? I take it from the drama in the UK to the stocks that slump them at the spike and bond deals. Not even bright spots and earnings including Netflix was able to move the needle here. You have a note out from Morgan Stanley they're calling the rally earlier this week a rollercoaster to nowhere. A very impatient market. They want 2022 losses to be done with. But the reality is when you look at the third quarter earnings, there's still a lot of tailwind from the previous part of the year. So you don't get a true picture of some of the depths of the pain that should be out there. In the meantime, I want to get to the Tesla earnings in a bit more detail because third quarter revenue rose to 21.5 billion dollars compared with endless projections of 22.1 billion. So that is a slight miss. They cited delivery and production bottlenecks. They're seeing some easing of component shortages though. A key headline from his statement knock on wood. It looks like we'll have an epic end of year. I mean shares did fall dramatically. Pulse market down as much as 5%. They have declined 37% so far this year. I want to check in on the energy markets as well. Not a day goes by without some new update. This time again the US president Joe Biden scolding some of the US companies are saying don't pay out dividends. Don't buy back shares. This is a time where you need to rally with the rest of the country in terms of pushing back against Ukraine. And so he expects them to move into line. The US also has only 25 days of diesel supplies left. It's a real headache for this administration as we count down to the midterms. Let's check it out the first world headlines now in a bit actually first we go to Julia Salty for the markets updates in Asia. Jules. Hey, yes, if we're we are down again today. In fact, we've only had two sessions of gains in the past 10 in Asia. We're watching very closely as well. What's been happening in those tech players in Hong Kong in the last 10 minutes or so. Some breaking news that China is holding emergency talks with chip firms after those US curbs. So we'll watch the movement in the Hangsang Tech index, which was already down by about three and a half percent heading into the lunch break in the afternoon session to but more broadly, it is those tech players weighing on the overall Hangsang index to it is set for its lowest close since 2009. A drop there of two and a half percent to we've also seen more pressure coming through from the Aussie dollar. A bit of validation from the NBA's smaller rate hike, though given that we only saw about 900 jobs created in the economy versus a forecast of 25,000. And of course, we remain on intervention watch with the dollar strengthening against the yen there and getting very close to 150. Let's have a look as well at what we're seeing with Japanese yields because again, we saw the testing patients of that point to five percent target that the BOJ is comfortable with. And that triggered an unscheduled bond buying operation. The BOJ now planning to buy 1.7 billion dollars of bonds ranging from five year to longer data debt and has separately offered to purchase an unlimited quantity of 10 year notes and a yield of 0.25%. So on that, what yen intervention watch and of course, watching those yields ratchet high there to you, sir. Yeah, more momentum in some of these bond markets. Jules, thank you for highlighting that. That's Jules. They will check back in with you later on the show. Let's get to the St. Louis Fed president James Bullard because he says he sees an end to the front loading of aggressive hikes by early next year and a shift to keeping policy restrictive with small adjustments as inflation cools. We're data dependent and we're watching the data with I think we're predicting or at least the dot plot is predicting that inflation will come down. It will be a disinflationary year in 2023. The median dots do call for further moves in 2023. So if you take that as the committee sentiment, you know, there could be a decision to move that into 2022 at the December meetings. Let's get some more analysis with Blueberg's Michelle Jamrisco. So Michelle, how do Bullards comments fit in with recent debates about the Fed strategy?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4764,2022-10-20 04:08:10
16419," How do Bullards' comments fit in with recent debates about the Fed's strategy? Yeah, well, a disinflationary year. We haven't heard talk of that in a while, Yusuf. I think, first of all, it's important to keep in mind that James Bullard is among the most hawkish this year. I mean, he was the first one to publicly suggest his 75 basis point hike. Now that's become the norm. It's no longer considered jumbo. And now, here he is talking about not just the end of the inflation fight, but kind of addressing those risks on growth, the risks of the Fed overdoing it on hike. So yes, you heard there not an open-ended inflation fight. He did talk about the 125, 150 basis points more worth of hikes that he's suggesting might be priced in or might be looking toward a terminal Fed funds rate. So he did talk about ending that front loading early next year, as you mentioned. He said that it doesn't mean you go up forever. He talked about moving to that restrictive level of phrase that Fed officials have adopted quite frequently of late. And I think he was non-committal on the November and December meetings, but he did say November 75 basis points is priced in. He suggested he would be open to a similarly sized hike in December. So certainly, a lot of big hikes that he sees to come perhaps into the end of this year and before the start of the next year. One more line I jumped out to me at the restrictive level. He suggested further moves would be, quote, based more based on the data coming in as opposed to us trying to get off zero and up and up to some level that's reasonable. That's kind of an complicated statement. And I think underscores the difficulty of the policy and the messaging right now. Full of faith. Michelle, thank you very much. You're right. A bit of an interesting divergence between Bullard and of course, Kashkari, the arch-dov to Hawk. Michelle, thank you. No, it's been a busy night of political turmoil. As I said in the United Kingdom, let's trust his premiership looking closer imploding, quite literally. Leon Garen's join us now from London, HQ, Leon. I mean, we've had firings, resignations, allegations of bullying and the palace of Westminster by the whips. Talk us through this remarkable series of events. What did I miss in the past two hours? It almost felt unprecedented yesterday, didn't it, man? Everything is moving so quickly. And I'm going to bring you up to date. Nothing too dramatic in the last two hours. That's because it appears that everyone has been asleep. But many of the newspaper front pages today are really leading on Suwella Braveman. That was the home secretary's resignation yesterday for breaking the ministerial code. However, her resignation letter did have a sting in its tail and really accused the Prime Minister Liz Truss of not sticking to the mandate that they won in the 2019 election. But let's move on from that. What happened yesterday is Liz Truss, and you can see her right there on TV. She headed into PMQ's to try and calm the herd, to try and get her own MPs on side. And she appeared to be a little bit, you know, she did well in that in many respects. She stood her ground, but then everything just imploded as the evening went on. Suwella Braveman, she resigned five days after quasi-quarteng, the chancellor was sat. And then of course we saw Grant Shaps. He's been appointed the new home secretary in Manus, as you outlined at the top of the show. He's been a critic of Liz Truss and a staunch supporter of Rishi Sunak. And then if things couldn't get even more fraught, we had that fracking vote in the comments last night, a Labour motion that was put to the House. Anyway, the Conservatives won that motion, but then the MP Chris Bryant for Labour came out and said that he wanted an investigation into how the Whips handled that and accused many ministers of bullying Conservative MPs to vote in line with the government. And I wonder if Suwella Braveman's resignation is now the match that could like the bomb fire, because as Boris Johnson said, when the herd moves, it moves. Yeah, I mean, if there's somebody writing this script for the storyline hats off, it's just absolutely riveting by any stretch of the imagination. Leanne, thank you for that.

16420," It's absolutely riveting by any stretch of the imagination. Leanne, thank you for that. Leanne, Garence and London. It's all right to use the first word, hand lines, from around the world, without we get back out to June. Thanks, Josef Russian President of Vladimir Putin has extended martial law in four occupied zones of Ukraine and stepped up security in nearby regions. The new rules impose limits on civilian movement and give military officials more power. The actions come as Ukrainian forces continue to press their advance. President Biden says Putin's decision shows the Russian leader is in an incredibly difficult position. Well, President Biden says US oil producers should not be returning record profits to shareholders via higher stock buybacks and dividends. The US administration is stepping up criticism of the energy industry and its role in high gasoline prices, as the war wages on in Ukraine. Biden called for oil companies to use windfall profits to help boost production and bring down fuel prices for consumers. We need to responsibly increase American oil production without delaying or deferring our transition to clean energy. My message to American energy companies is this, you should not be using your profits to buyback stock or for dividends. Not now, not while a war is raging. You should be using these record breaking profits to increase production and refining. Bloomberg has learned that a group of US justice department prosecutors believe there is sufficient evidence to charge Donald Trump with obstruction of justice. But we're told a path to an actual indictment remains unclear over the former president's handling of classified records. Investigators have not yet made a formal recommendation to the Attorney General Merrick Garland, who would ultimately approve or reject such a move.

Let's get you a bit of a preview of what else is still to come on the show. We're going to discuss Saudi Arabia's bonfire with our com capables, Zina Risk, plus a conversation with NVK, Deputy CEO, Sheikh Bahan, about the banks or index. Next, Fed speakers reiterate the commitment to aggressive policy. We cover the market, fallout with government investment corporations, Rafael Abartone. And this is Bloomberg. Why is everybody want to be a consultant? And what are all these consultants doing? Well, David, I think that we actually defy the label consultant because sometimes consultants seem to imply that we only give advice. And when you look at what Accenture does, we're really different than the traditional version of a consultant. We're really about relevance and results. And that's what is driving our business. What about a consulting project? In my example, on the CEO, I have a problem. I call you up. I say, solve my problem or give me a solution. We don't operate as big companies permanently in crisis mode. And so when you think about, how long does it solve things, a lot of it starts with, you know, the company being willing to set aggressive goals. And so what we are trying to do now is work with our clients to work differently and to work faster. Everything you need to get set for the start of U.S. trading, Bloomberg, the open with Jonathan Terrell, filling down in the numbers and preparing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4766,2022-10-20 04:16:42
16421," Everything you need to get set for the start of US trading. Bloomberg, the open with Jonathan Terrell. Drilling down in the numbers and preparing you as only Bloomberg can. Weekdays on Bloomberg. I want to see us have confidence that that core inflation has peaked. And then I'll head back down in the right direction. You know, financial markets are suggesting that inflation should fall rapidly. Next year and year after, I certainly hope that they're right. But I have not yet seen evidence that that mechanism is in play. That was the Minneapolis Fed President Neil Kashkari sending a high bar for policy pivots. Markets are turning to the aggressive rhetoric from the Fed with both bond yields elevated and equity selling off. The more economics points out key words from Fed insiders that suggest even more rate hikes ahead. Markets are increasingly pricing in another jumbo hike in December. Let's bring in Rafael Bertone, he's the head of debt capital markets at the Gulf Investment Corporation. Who has flown in for a change from Kuwait. Oh, thanks for stopping by. Rafael, in terms of what we heard from Kashkari in terms of what that means for potential pivot because Dennis Garthman, the market strategist doesn't think it's going to happen for at least another 12 months. What is your thinking today? Our assessment is that the Fed has already done a lot starting from a very low level of rates. The economy, the word economy, is much more sensible to interest rates compared to the past. And total debt on GDP has reached 300%, which is way above even the big financial crisis. Every 25 basis point rating increase is equivalent to a much bigger rate increase in the past. What is important, and Bernanke recently stated that we needed to give time to all these rate hikes to produce a Fed on the economy. It was very interesting, your interview with Ballard yesterday, and they mentioned that the target of the Fed should be price stability, but should be financial stability. So we had a lot from the Fed. So it's time that they slow a bit and see the Fed on the real economy before going forward. But then you look at the other side of the coin, Kashkari says the markets are ahead of the Fed. We have a look at rates. We're looking at multi-year cyclical highs, high since 2007 on the very front end on twos, likewise in the belly of the curve. Markets are hopeful for a pivot. They're going to lean into Ballard. Do you think the front loading is done two more 75 clips and then pause? Not necessarily pause, maybe we can have another 25 basis point hike in the first quarter of next year, but then the Fed should really pause. Which means that the short end of the curve has become very interesting, so the downside now is very limited. And actually the shape of the curve should normalize, because what the market is pricing at the moment is also rate reduction in 2023, which is probably not realistic. So I want to go to a tweet from Jeffrey Goldler from Double Line Capital. He just did this about an hour ago and he writes, note how long, how the long end is flat. A sign of yield increase exhaustion. Treasury yields may well be peaking between now and year end. That kind of takes me to the market's life question of the day in terms of where the 10 year Treasury yields are going to peak. Again, the short end is probably very close to the peak. The long end should normalize a bit. Should stay at least in line with the short end. So in my point of view, 2023, we should see the 10 year moving above the 4% and very close to the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4767,2022-10-20 04:21:07
16422," In my point of view, 2023, we should see the 10-year moving above the 4% and very close to the 4.5%. So what does all that do to risk? Because I look at you of you, your strategy, you've reduced your defensive positioning. So tell us what portion you've reduced in terms of defensive positioning. You've added risk assets on a tactical basis and you say recent highs in rates. And I looked at Fconn, Fconn to the S&P 500, S&P 500 down 22%. Fconn has a little bit further to go if you get more good news in the earnings. You're oils up another 3%. The Fed could be moving higher. Do you think equities are now fully priced on the downside relative to the Fcon tightening we've had? That's a very good point, Mano. We know that the financial conditions are set from four different elements. One is equity, one is spread, the level of rates. In this particular environment, the underperformance of bonds versus equity has been massive. It's one of the biggest and since then, big rise in 1929. So bonds are much more attractive than equities. And we should see a stabilization of the credit market and underperformance of equities. So if financial conditions should tighten further, I would expect more because of the equity performance rather than further widening in spreads. Okay, Rafael, thank you so much. Rafael Bertoni, the head of that capital market. Some breaking lines, you see, on China, which have just come in across the terminal. So this is on inbound COVID quarantine. Step one of the step back, is it? I mean, so they're considering the quarantine to be cut to seven days from 10. The shift is still going to be presented to top leaders. But we are seeing a little bit of a move in the US equity futures here, pairing some of the losses. I mean, there's so much that hinges on this potential reopening up of China, doesn't it, Mano? Absolutely. We saw the momentum in Hong Kong. I'm sorry, in Japan when they moved to reduce the quarantine. Let's have a look at the yuan. It rises as much as a half of 1% on this news that they are mulling a shift in the quarantine period from 10 to 7 days. There you go, which is dollar dying and yuan, CNY and also CNH, also rallying as well. Okay, we'll track the story we get back to Jews because it's got a big impact if this is step one of a much bigger backtrack. This is Blaineback. China's military power has been growing at an incredible speed over the last 20 years. A strong country must have a strong military, as only then can it guarantee the security of the nation. In terms of sphere of influence, we absolutely know that China wants to be dominant in Asia. So there is a target to get to that point, to be a military that is appear to the greatest militaries in the world by 2035. The competition for influence is a global one. And through a multi-decade trajectory fueled by planning, money and pragmatism, China is building a military that allows it to shape the 21st century just as the US shaped the 20s.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4768,2022-10-20 04:25:17

So, it was her first time leaving to give me lessons and tried to get a new behaviors showing some for season TRL. The Dallas Rock City is highlighting in his Expedition Base and everything went well. Ar陳, ice glue vfinnish in the game anyone could beat it's heartburn Wrestleitt D O o institutes and- A C particular season announcement brought chocolate next to sport of boats, a lack of trains and a lack of carriers and logistics and fulfillment costs were elevated. The goal over a longer period of time is to smooth those deliveries out. Tester said that actually a third of deliveries in the third quarter came in just the final two weeks and as they smooth those deliveries out over a quarter they expect the cost per vehicle to improve. Long-term the risk is battery supply but they are doing work on the next generation of 4680 cell. The problem is that while they ramp up activity both in Berlin and in Austin, Texas that's weighing on profitability. Long-term a lot of fighting talk from Elon Musk. He said that it's going to be an epic end to the year, another record in the fourth quarter. CFOs at Kirk on the slightly more reserves saying that they will meet 50% annual production growth but that when it comes to delivery growth they'll fall just shy of that 50% target. Otherwise Elon Musk says that Tester is recession proof and long-term he sees a path to Tester having a market cap greater than Apple and twice that of Saudi Ramco. Ed Loughlo for Bloomberg News in New York City. And from the world of Tesla's I take you to Middle East equity markets just to give you a bit of a rundown of where we are especially given the volatility of global markets so sentiment quite clearly negative including on the side of the Dow down about a tenth of 1% even more so in terms of Katari stocks, IHC which is Abu Dhabi's most valuable listed company has called for a shareholder meeting on November 9th. They're trying to get approval on an entry of infinity wave holding so that was on the minds of investors there but again a lot of this is going to be driven by the direction now of the of crude prices and with the back and forth between the US and Saudi Arabia could mean a lot more still in the pipeline. Yeah keeping on to you back below it's IPO level here in Dubai so that's going to be one to watch. Let me just show you the immediate reaction you so we broke that line that China is mulling a reduction in its quarantine from seven days to from ten days to seven days that's perhaps step one of a much much bigger narrative about that moment of when China may reopen. It's bleeding through right the way across the rest of the equity market so it's the battle against the high yields tens of the highest since 2008 to your paper the highest since 2007 and that's what really challenged the equity market narrative yesterday. Absolutely we're looking here at S&P 500 mini but again as you said across the curve we seeing treasure yields hit multi-year peaks with the bearish sentiment taking full control. We had a week 20-year bond auction at push yields to session highs Jeffrey Guntluck so things that we might see a little bit of a peak in yields much more coverage ahead this is Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4769,2022-10-20 04:30:07
16424," MUSIC No one covers the world like Bloomberg. Because Trussonomics is being dismantled, MPs behind the scenes are asking what's the point of having her at the top?

This is Bloomberg Daybreak Middle East. How it helps stories this morning? Sir Lewis Fed President James Bullard says he sees an end to the front loading of aggressive rate hikes by early next year and a shift to keeping policy restrictive with small adjustments as inflation cools. We're predicting, at least the dot plot is predicting that inflation will come down. It will be a disinflationary year in 2023. And I had told political turmoil in the UK with this Trusson's premiership looking close to imploding amid firings, resignations, and allegations of bullying into House of Commons. He has a share of slide after ours. This is the company report sells short of the street estimates, citing delivery production bottlenecks, but Elon Musk promises an epic end to the year. And National Bank of Kuwait beats on third quarter of that income with a 45% year in your gain. We speak this hour through the WDCL. Breaking news coming across the Bloomberg terminal. This is on Nord. The third quarter net interest income 1.41 billion. That's ahead of the estimate of 1.37. And the guidance, the critical guidance about 2022. If you just think of the rates, the energy crisis in Europe, the rates narrative, the dislocation in markets, they are calling for an improvement in the outlook for 2022. All those headwinds and still an upbeat statement. Yeah, so the net fee and commission income was at 816 million euros. The estimate was for 824 million euros. They're still seeing the fiscal year return on equity above 11% going into this 22 by six holes and two cells in terms of the breakdown among analysts shares were done. What 14% of the past year? That's really been outperforming actually a broadly negative market mass. Let's see whether the loan losses can endure because in the third quarter, loan losses were 58 million euros with all those headwinds, a rind in terms of everybody calling about a global recession, European recession, and indeed an energy crisis. Will the loan losses appear if credit cracks? We can put those questions to the CEO, the president and the CEO, I should say. We'll join Danny Berger myself in just under 40 minutes time. Frank Vangensen to discuss his numbers and the outlook. Markets are moving. Juliet Sully is standing by. Jules, what are you racking? 10 days to 7 days quarantine going into China. Have you got the passport out? Well, there's still a lot of tests involved, but this is going to be very big if we are seeing these reports of reduced quarantine in China.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4770,2022-10-20 04:34:02
16425," Well, there's still a lot of tests involved, but this is going to be very big if we are seeing these reports, matters of reduced quarantine in China, as you say. We are hearing news that officials are debating cutting inbound COVID quarantine to seven days from 10 China markets, of course, on a lunch break, but you've seen it pick up in U.S. equity futures. We'll be watching very closely as well, the momentum in the tech players, because just before Hong Kong went on the lunch break, we also heard some news that China is holding emergency talks with chip firms after those U.S. curbs. It is a down day, though, at the moment, and certainly Hong Kong really bearing the brunt of the selling that index on track for its lowest close in 13 years. And we've been seeing momentum in our currency markets as well. Of course, we remain on intervention watch when it comes to the Japanese yen. You've got the offshore yuan at these record lows and a fall coming through in the Aussie dollar as well, Yusuf, after we had just about 900 jobs created in that economy versus a forecast of 25,000, so certainly validating the RBA's decision to go in with a smaller rate hike this month. Then zooming out a little bit in terms of the top calls, you got Nemura joining Morgan Stanley and calling for a bottom and Asia stocks. So what are the details behind the thesis? Yeah, absolutely. They are saying, look, they have looked at the past five chip cycles and 12 U.S. recessions and they've looked at all those indicators and say, look, perhaps we have here to bottom and you could start to see a rally here, including in those chip makers that have been heavily sold off. So they're suggesting that you could see some momentum in the first half of 2023, but of course, as always, there are caveats that really relies on China opening up, which hopefully it will, as we're hearing these stories of reduced quarantine. And also the fact that they say the U.S. recessions should only be shallow and only last around a year. Let's have a look though in terms of what we are seeing with Asian equities because of course still this underperformance when it comes to the MSCI Asia Pacific index. It has lost about 28% this year and it's poised for its seventh quarterly underperformance in eight against the MSCI World Index. The last time we saw such a trend like this was in 2014. Yusuf. Jules, yeah, a remarkable streak there. Thanks for running us through that. That's Julia Salih there. I want to get to this part of the world again. Cassidy Arabia this week made its first foray since November into international debt markets. It sold bonds and Islamic securities while offering to buy back some of its existing debt. The source says pricing for the $2.5 billion of Sukup bonds, maturing in six years was 105 basis points over U.S. treasuries. The dollar notes due in 10 years were 150 basis points over the same tenor of U.S.T.s. Let's get to Zena risk the executive director of fixed income asset management at our comp capital. Zena, this is a significant move from the kingdom. It's also part of a broader liquidity enhancement strategy. What came to mind when you looked at some of the initial pricing guidance? The pricing guidance was kind of generous compared especially to previous deals that Salih was making but which makes sense given the current market condition and the yields volatility. The deal was well received. It was significantly oversubscribed. Salih doesn't need the money so that's why the deal is not as big as it usually is in previous years. They don't need the money. It's interesting and the rising rates regime they come in and test the market. Are you worried at any juncture about U.S. Saudi politics interfering with rates pricing? I want to look at it from this perspective. They don't need the money. They just did it to keep engaged with international markets. They do have the money, they do have the excess reserves, all where it is significantly higher than their break even. I think Saudi is significantly comfortable fundamentally. In terms of the broader Gulf, you've done some analysis with your team and again it's a story of resilience. It's been a bit of a theme this week and I understand that but how enduring is that likely to be given an aggressive Fed and global bond market volatility? Absolutely. The Fed has had its negative effect on all the markets. The global indices are all down for this year at different levels. Relatively the GCC has been better off because of improved fundamentals and the pegged currency but the flip side of that is that valuation already discounts a lot of that. Add to that all where it is. Relative to other GCC is on the safer here. I mean when we look at that I perform it's in the GTV library. It's the white line on the bottom of the chart.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4771,2022-10-20 04:38:26
16426," So relative to other DCC is on the safer here, I said the safer haven. I mean when we look at that, I perform it, it's in the GTV library. It's the white line on the bottom of the chart, which is our market in the GCC, I perform in high yield, I perform in everything else. If the narrative continues that the Fed actually does need to go to a much higher level, beyond the 4.5%, maybe even the 5%, despite what Bullard says, Kashkari says there's no evidence for him whatsoever to oppose. At some say this differential must shift. If it goes higher than 4%, I think that the GCC would remain the place to be because of the negative strain it would have on other emerging markets. So you would want to be in a place with better fundamentals, but that is not our base case. Our base case is that the Fed has done already too much and it will not continue big goal. Saudi is in an uncomfortable position. You can say the same about Kuwait and Abu Dhabi. When we're looking for cracks, and this is the key question, isn't it? In terms of where are the vulnerabilities going to bubble to the surface? And should we be looking more at Dubai? Because I've been looking through the CDS, I've been checking with some of the bank's balance sheets, but at the moment there isn't anything. But where could something pop up? A significant drop in oil prices. Any geopolitical unrest that might impact the region. But so far we are in the best place and we have been both Dubai, UAE, and in the region in general we have been in the ideal place, if I may say. In the ideal place, which takes us then to inward investment into Egypt, we have this story Katar and talks about two and a half billion into Egypt. So this is both a political goodwill gesture and at the same time you said, set the stage for a different context of FDI in Egypt. Why would one of the shift an hour on FDI? It wouldn't be one of the early in my opinion. The IMF has been focusing on changing the structure to attract more FDIs. We expect more to come. And as you've mentioned, Manus, from both a political and a support for Egypt perspective. So we don't, a one-off wouldn't change the narrative, but that would be the first of many. So what did they need to do with the currency? Where does it weaken towards? Because that's also going to determine your entry point back into a potential resurgence of the carry trade. Absolutely. I mean, the IMF would like a complete float, free float of the currency. Not what the IMF wants, what Zina risk wants. Ideally, if free float would reduce the pressure on the reserves, but having a free float would have a big hit on the market, because we don't know where it would over-shoot and stop. Ideally, this is what we would want. Practically, I don't think that it's going to happen. But there will definitely be a repricing of the currency. Dina was in the seat. Yes, she said that the forward curve was being a little bit too aggressive and it wasn't going to drop that aggressively. You know, when you look at the Egyptian currency, who's driving that? Where's the flow that's driving that's driving that currency at the moment, that's driving our region as a whole at the moment? In Egypt, the air-high, like, indirect capital controls, the FX reserves were controlling it. Now it's the FX. Now you don't have FBI anymore in Egypt. So once the currency reprices to 11, that international investor, CS Fair Value, that would bring back FX and support the currency even further. Okay, Dina, thank you so much. Zina risk executive director for fixed income management and income capital. Tell you more ahead on daybreak Middle East. This is Bloomberg.

So for our business, our balance sheet across various locations are closely managed and you know has limited currency gaps, making the potential risk for our from currency movements relatively limited. But you know we believe that interest rate will continue hiking even in Kuwait. Post election what's the most optimistic thing that you're looking for that will drive FDI into Kuwait because a lot of things were on hold because of the political dislocation that's passed. What do you expect the alpha to be? Very good question. Anyway the political landscape in Kuwait is slightly considered as complicated but we are very very optimistic and you are aware that recent lack of political stability has posed some pressure on on business. But lately with the I mean ongoing changes in the government and parliament and after Tuesday's you know speech of the crown prince you know put everybody under pressure to push for the economic you know agenda and we believe government is being shaped as well and we believe that a lot of you know let's say political issues will be more stable and we will see a general commitment from all participants in the parliament and this will lead to you know approving let's say the debt law the mortgage law we are very optimistic this time. Let me jump in here just because I want to follow up on that in terms of the mortgage law how does that feed into your view on credit growth and where is that you know strength going to come from what if you put in as your base case. Yeah. Yeah well this will create you know great opportunity for banks and the mortgage law will have positive impact on loan and credit growth in the market so we are you know looking forward for this law to be approved this already I mean with the parliament and this time they have no other option but to approve the mortgage law so opportunities are huge and I believe this time that you know we are approved by the parliament. Okay politics and business a heavy mix Shaker thank you so much for being with us this morning Shaker Al-Baha NBK Deputy Group CEO a little bit of breaking news on ABB Pivot to Switzerland ABB the forecast or the outlook for them the guidance for them is a low double digit comparative revenue growth going into the fourth quarter so that's the guidance for them you're so but they've also given us the order and their margin outlook. Yeah so third quarter EPS comes in at 0.19 dollars the guidance is that they're going to meet the 2023 target of operational EBITDA early so on the face of it these are encouraging results for investors and that's going to be something I think we're going to have to look into.

Everything you need to get set for the start of U.S. trading, Bloomberg, the open with Jonathan Terrell, filling down on the numbers and preparing you as only Bloomberg can weekdays on Bloomberg. Two-year energy freeze, gold, tax-free shopping, gold, economic credibility, gold, and to suppose best friend, the formal Chancellor, he's gone as well. Opposition benches that clack literally mounds against the government benches and you know who's also gone, Lystruss' home secretary, Suella Braveman sat for the National Security breach during a day of high drama in UK politics, more on that in daybreak Europe. But let's return to our own region, Turkey's central bank. That could cut interest rates yet again today as the markets seek to know what happens next in monetary policy. A rate could fly in the face of the traditional monetary policy with inflation topping 83% year on year in September. Some folks, what can we get? Some on, good morning. Good morning, Mattis. Well, it's hard to know exactly how much the central bank could cut here, but that is the expectation. None of this follows what we think of traditionally as monetary policy, but we've seen two a hundred basis point cuts over the last two months. And so that's the median estimate today, even despite inflation at over 83%. And economists actually believe that inflation likely even higher than that, likely somewhere along the line of producer price index was up at 150%. But talking to a lot of economists and investors recently about what would change the game here? Is an interest rate cut something that is really going to affect the markets? For the most part, they say no. These interest rate cuts at this point, sort of meaningless in this overall scheme of things. What they're really looking for is a crash in the Turkish lira. We've seen a steady decline of the lira against the dollar all year, but they're looking for a sharp move, which might indicate a loss of domestic faith in Turkey's fiscal health. That could lead to a reversal of policy. It could also be the nail in the political coffin for President Erdogan, who's been calling for these lower and lower interest rates, single digit by the end of the year. He has to hold elections by next June, but as yet, economists and investors just simply not sure what that spark is for that ultimate move. They see as pretty much inevitable. It will be the focus of many studies on unorthodox monetary policies and dysfunctionality of that, if you're arguing that way, in terms of other companies that we're looking at, a Bloomberg scoop, they're pushing forward with plans to IPO, they're trading unit.

16430," Yeah, that's not actually a surprise Bloomberg first broke the news that RMCO trading was interested potentially in IPO back in May when it hired advisors. But what is surprising perhaps to hear is that the company is maybe pushing ahead with these plans. Usual caveats apply, of course, despite the IPO market across the Gulf, turning a little less rosy over the past couple of months. The transaction could value the unit we understand at some 30 billion dollars that would make it one of the largest IPOs this year. Gulf energy companies, national energy companies have been looking to beef up their trading units, Qatar energy saying it wanted to do the same as these look increasingly profitable amid the volatility we've seen in the energy markets. Certainly raising some cash in the market, either later this year come 2023. Those are the kind of dates we're hearing could help RMCO continue on that goal. And a day after the ownership shifts at the had aviation names, a new CEO, Tony Douglas remains as an advisor to ADQ. Who steps in and why do we think they chose this particular chop? Tony Douglas remaining an advisor for now, off to some unspecified opportunity elsewhere, the speculation he could go to Saudi Arabia to help them build an airline. But the new guy at the had a noir of the nevis. He was previously the CEO of tap Portugal, their flag carrier. And now that is state run. He stayed on until the company received an injection of capital. Then he was forced out during the midst of the pandemic. He has a particularly close relationship to jet blue airways founder David Neelman. Neelman and a crew had taken tap private back in 2017. And then that was when nevis came on. He also had run a zoole airlines, a low cost carrier in Brazil, which Neelman also began. Thank you for that. That's a Simone Fox, but the kind of financial center. And though let's zoom back into some of the market action in terms of equity futures where we're seeing stocks resuming a slump. This is off the back of a spike in bond yields. Are we on a roller coaster to noir where air? No where? Not Norway. Are we on a roller coaster to nowhere? Some more in Stanley's say. Yeah, I mean, we've got a nice little bit of a moment when we saw the potential for quarantine being cut from 10 days to seven days for China. What does that mean for the global re-opening narrative trade off China at treasuries is where the ground zero of risk is. You're at the highest levels since 2008 on 10 year bond. This is the boat. Yeah. It's a fantastic one. 700th anniversary of Dante allegaries death has triggered the work of many institutions and offered a very rich schedule of events. Today in Santa Crochet, we present one of these projects that suffered a difficult start because COVID-19 has stopped the project that was shared by the opera de Santa Crochet by the Franciscan community from Florence Municipality and the fun for religious building of the internal minister. Today Felice Limosani's project is finally enjoyable.

16431," In the posi chapel, the marvelous architecture by Felipe Bruno Leschi, the most important images from the divine comedy created by the French illustrator Guzdolf Dore, the weight of purgatory and the sublime joy of paradise. The digital humanities are a cultural occasion to exploit. In the end, it's about merging humanistic disciplines with new technologies. I find this to be an innovating and modern tool to update culture. Cultural heritage becomes something to hand over to the new generations and not to be put aside, so it's about using technology, pixels, and binary code with the human and humanizing content. This is a market that over the past few weeks has made it clear it wants to go higher. It got a little spooked by the idea that geocalitallic potentials arise. This is Bloomberg Daybreak, you're up. I'm Danny Berger in London with Managed Cranian, Dubai. And these are the stories that set your agenda. Danny Street, Klaus Liss, Trustless Government, hangs in the balance after her home secretary quits and the Tories fail to show unity in the House of Commons. Rally Paws, US Futures in the Red Treasury years hit cyclical highs, amid more hawkish central bank messaging. Asian stocks are lower, despite reports of Beijing's talks on a shorter COVID quarantine. Oil marches higher. Plus, Tessie Shares slide after ours. This is the company reports sales short of Wall Street's estimates, citing delivery and production bottlenecks, but Elon Musk promises a turnaround. As our factors ran, we're looking forward to a record-breaking Q4. So it really, you know, not on word, it looks like we'll have an epic end of year. Everything's epic for Elon. Breaking news, epic news coming from Nokia. I had a Nokia phone about 25 years ago. That was a long time ago. I know we've moved on. A third quarter sales, no two phones. A quarter sales 6.24. The estimate was for 6.03. I need to fact check that whether they still do the phones. 6.24 billion euros. The guidance was for 6.03. I don't know why I'm laughing. Fully in net adjustment sales, the guidance is 23.9 to 25.1. So beating on the estimates, very strong, dummy. In terms of the guidance. And this is what's going to define the next move in the equity markets. It's all about the guidance from the bank sanitara bust week. Here's Nokia on the Tech side. What have you got? Well, I've got Erickson for us, Mannes. By the way, I too had a Nokia flip phone and I bedazzled it. So that's where I was at. My life and that phone was out. Anyway, Erickson coming in as well, coming in as well. Manus, this one is not a beat. This one is a miss. Third quarter operating profit coming in at 7.2 billion. The estimate had been for eight and a half billion. Their gross margin that's slightly weaker as well. 41.4% the estimate had been for 42. So yes, while Nokia was a beat, again, we're looking at a miss for Ericsson Manus and we're also going to be speaking to the CEO. That's of course at home in the next hour. Okay, let's just get into these asset checks because there's a whole host of moving narratives from cyclical highs and yields. You've got tens at the highest since 2008 and you've got two-year paper still marching through up to our basis points yesterday, the highs of October 2007, Kashkari still on the march to the higher ground.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4777,2022-10-20 05:04:40
16432," as 2008 and you've got two year paper. Still marching through up to our basis point yesterday, the highs of October 2007, Kashkari still on the march to the higher ground in rates. Bullard, I think shows a narrative of a fissure in terms of maybe a little bit of a crack and pause in 2023. We can debate that two year yields 4.56, cable trades at 112, stoic in the face of literally anarchy in politics in the United Kingdom. At the hedge funds, want to be long and a one to three year basis. I don't know that I've got one to three years left in me with Sterling. Yuan marches higher. This is the dollar done by 31% on the back of quarantine, maybe moving from seven, sorry, from 10 to seven days and oil up 1.4% Titan constructed markets because the USA did not go for a balter of an additional SPR release, but they are often ready with the flow to go. Dany. Man, it's that combination of stronger oil on China molling some of those quarantine changes. Of higher yields of stronger dollar, it's the usual corporates for a risk off session. That's exactly what we are seeing in futures. S&P 500 futures, those are lower by three tenths of a percent. Tech is doing worse again. It's that duration that's really getting hit in the equity sector. If this all means of the Fed is going to have to raise rates more aggressively. CSI 100 on that China headline has erased a lot of its gains. It was down pretty significantly. Now it's just down a third of 1%. Manus, I just want to quickly show us what Tesla did after hours yesterday because it was a brutal earnings. Shares falling more than 6%. They had delivery logistics trouble. They had battery supply constraints and a strong US dollar. All of that resulted in weaker than expected earnings, Manus. Yeah, and we are hearing this dollar story begin to come through in terms of the knock that it can have, but it's not just the chips and the ships, but it's getting your product to market. Let's get to the team. They're ready. The standing by. Lizzie burden continues her watch on the prolonged political fallout in the UK. We're going to talk fed with Endocard and Julia Salia's ever. It's got the Asian market coverage on this big China news 10 days to 7. Danny. Well, it's been a day and an evening and I guess a month of political turmoil in the UK with Liz Truss' premiership looking close to imploding. Let's bring in Bloomberg's Lizzie burden in this and Lizzie, you've been staked outside of Westminster for the past week. Probably, probably longer if I'm not mistaken. Talk us through the past 24 hours. Well, it started with Prime Minister's questions and the opposition leader, Kirsta, I'm a did his best to humiliate Liz Truss over all the U turns on her economic strategy that there have been in the past week. But later in the later hours of the day, the government did its an even better job at humiliating itself. The Prime Minister lost the second holder of one of the great offices of state, the Home Secretary-Suella Bravaman, ostensibly over a data breach. But her resignation letter was scathing it called for the Prime Minister to quit herself. She was replaced by Grant Shaps, who frankly is one of Truss' political enemies. And then it got worse. The government said that anyone who didn't vote with it against Labour's ban on fracking was no longer a Tory MP. Then it said that this was no longer its position, it wasn't a confidence vote, then it reinstated that position. During the vote, two senior ministers were accused of manhandling a Tory MP through the voting lobby, though he and they denied it, despite multiple eyewitnesses, somehow in the cuffuffle the Prime Minister herself forgot to vote, because she was chasing the chief whip around begging her not to quit, though she did, asked it her deputy. Then in the earlier hours of this morning we find out that the whips have not quit, so Danny, in short, is absolute total chaos and the Prime Minister's lost all control. Well, that just sounds like something from a sex-pistols front cover, which is anarchy and politics in the UK, really, which leaves you... This is how the Tories... How do they pull themselves back from this? Because she has this one-year window. It's whether she decides to go or walk in Graham Brady and the back bench, 1922, Committee do, to invoke her departure. You're minus those conversations are being hard because this is desperate.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4778,2022-10-20 05:08:49
16433," The Backbench 1922 Committee do to invoke her departure. You know, as those conversations are being hard because this is desperate, it seems that she's doomed. Her backbenchers are absolutely livid. And frankly, her economic strategy has been decimated. She's now surrounded by Ramaynas and enemies in her cabinet. And the only connection she has to her base is that she's a hardline Brexit. If you remember that moment, Manus, when Boris Johnson woke up, wrote his resignation speech because he realised it was the end. I think many in Westminster today are wondering when Liz Truss is going to have that eureka moment. Yep, there you go. Well, let's see. I mean, it just, it's just quite surreal, isn't it? That the whole thing. Lizzie, let's see what today brings our by our Lizzie burden on the UK politics story to the Fed. OK, they stuck to the cautious tone in the beige book as it noted that the US economy grew modestly. And the risk of a recession is rising. And it looks our dimmy. But the St Louis Fed President James Bullard says he sees an end to the front loading of a grass of hikes by early next year and a shift to keeping policy restrictive with small adjustments as inflation cools. We're data dependent and we're watching the data. So I think we're predicting, at least the dot plot is predicting that inflation will come down. It will be a disinflationary year in 2023. The median dots do call for further moves in 2023. So if you take that as the committee sentiment, you know, there could be a decision to move that into 2022 at the December meetings. Let's get to our chief Asia economics correspondent, see whether he thinks there's a little twinkle of a pivot in Bullard. Come on, Andrew. Give me some hope. Maybe maybe a hint of one. Malas, what Mr. Bullard was saying is if they do the front loading now and they get their homework done, then next year you're going to see a point where obviously inflation is going to come off. That's expected in the markets and the base effect. And they he'll say they could get to a point where they at least slow the pace of rate hikes next year where they can watch and see what's happening with the data. And Neil Cush carry with similar remarks overnight by the way, make the point that that the will come up point when inflation comes off the ball and they can see where they are then. But however, that's not to hear and now the hearing message from Mr. Bullard and others is that they still have work to do. You know, you hear Mr. Bullard talking about still front loading those rate hikes into the end of this year. The markets already locked on for 75 for November. There's going to be a big discussion and a debate then about what did it do in December. So Mr. Bullard's fairly talking about a 2023 story. He did say some signs of pain in the economy is already being clearly seen in the housing market. For example, that's not a being suffering any variable lags. That's a real time impact from rising rates. It's the other parts of the economy, which are less clear in terms of how interest rates will hit them. Just on the beige book, I should also say those companies and real economy people telling the Fed that they are seeing signs of solving down their labor hiring intentions. Their customers don't want to take the higher prices anymore and there's more chatter about recession as well. And that beige book is usually an indicator of where it would be a few months from now. Well, tell you what, Enda, they also might have to deal with this swing factor of China. Oil keeps climbing like it is right now. Enda, thank you very much. Enda, current, our chief Asia economics correspondent in Hong Kong. Let's continue with that because Bloomberg is reporting, according to people familiar that Chinese officials are debating whether to reduce the amount of time people coming into the country must spend in mandatory quarantine. Let's get over to Juliette Sally who's got the market reaction in Singapore and Jules. Not only is the CSI 300 paired its losses, looks like it's in the green now. Yeah, absolutely. We had a terrible start to the days at trade, Danny, but in the last 10 minutes or so, China has come out of that lunch break and we are seeing some gains now. Four tenths of 1% on the CSI 300. 10 days to seven. We're hearing and five of those will be allowed to be in your home. Unclear what it means if you don't have a residence in China. But of course, this is the news that market participants have been waiting for asymmetry investors, though saying this is not enough for Chinese stocks to bottom. But certainly we're seeing a turnaround in Hong Kong as well, which is trading at that 13 year low. And also the Hang Seng Tech Index.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4779,2022-10-20 05:13:08
16434," As symmetry investors, though, saying this is not enough for Chinese stocks to bottom, but certainly we're seeing a turnaround in Hong Kong as well, which is trading at that 13-year low. And also the Hang Seng Tech Index, which had been down by close to 5% in the morning session, we also had a hot headline coming through that China is holding emergency meeting with chip firms to discuss the U.S. curves. And of course, as Manus mentioned, you're seeing a big pickup in the offshore yuan as well, which hit a record low against the greenback overnight, now up by 410% of 1% on this optimism of reduced quarantine. We are, of course, still, though, on Yan intervention watch and have a look what we saw in the 10-year yield as well, topping that 0.25% band that the Bank of Japan is comfortable with and prompting unscheduled bond buying. So Manus, I know you're a little upset that I didn't like your theme tune yesterday. I'm thinking maybe pink Panther, as we await this stealth intervention on the Japanese Yan. Oh, that's so good. I have to go back on the back catalog that Juz Ringgidding Panther, Ringgidding Panther. There you go. That's as much singing as you're going to get out of me, Juz Ringgidding Panther. Sally in Singapore, you do bring it out of me, Juz Ringgidding Panther. OK, coming up, Nourdea Bank CEO is waiting in the wings. Frank Van Jensen doesn't want to hear the pink Panther signed. He's a finished-based bank. He's going to talk us through the risks. And he's got an optimistic outlook. Let's talk to Frank Van Henson in just a moment. On Blaineback."" How much I've got pushed have you seen from the Kishita government in terms of green funding? The Kishita government has committed to doubling the amount of investments in green technologies. I think we need more than just pronouncements. We need real money backing, very innovative startups and innovative companies in this space. What do you make of Kishita's new capitalism? I think he is framework is reflective of the challenges that Japan society is facing, namely that growth has been present, but growth has not been, of course, evenly distributed. That frankly speaking, it's hard to register the income if you don't have much income to begin with. If the government and private sector can work together and collaborate to drive more innovative growth startups, that can really drive the income growth that the Kishita government needs to redistribute. No dear bank results are right there on the tape. The Helsinki based lender posting higher than expected net income for the third quarter and said lower costs would contribute to the improved outlook for the year joining his now is Frank Van Hatjensen. He is the CEO of No dear Frank well done on the numbers 1.41 billion. That's a comfortable beat on the estimates. Where did you beat was low cost cutting or where has the delivery been in this quarter? Good morning. Good morning. It was a strong quarter with a strong credit quality and that we land as you see at 1.3 billion euro in operating profit and income was increasing up to 7%. So we'll get back to Frank in just a moment. We seem to have just lost the telephone line there for now.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4780,2022-10-20 05:17:24
16435," So we'll get back to Frank in just a moment. We seem to have just lost the telephone line there for no. Danny, it's interesting that this is a CEO who's talking about a cost-to-income ratio at 48 to 49%. Again, it's going to be a tough, tough quarter in terms of how they are positioned going forward. We're going to try and redial as we speak, life-taping. We're going to have a lot of time to talk about the cost of the cost-to-income ratio. We're going to try and get Frank back. Just look through the rest of these numbers for a moment. Yeah. Well, so we are looking. So third quarter net fee and commission income. That was slightly lower. This is something that banks around the world are facing. Their numbers were 816 million euros. The estimate had been for 824 million euros. If this idea of more uncertainty, more volatility means that some of these deals corporate lending makes things a bit tougher. So if I can just read from their press release, what Frank Fenyensen said there so we can give a little teaser to what he will say when he comes back. It's about increased macro uncertainty with higher inflation in lower GDP forecast. Well, let's just take that to Frank. Frank, good to have you back with this. You talk about macro uncertainty. What's the biggest headwind in the back end of 2022 entering 2023? Frank, good morning. Good morning. So, yeah, of course, it's a very uncertain environment. And then the question is how it translates into PNL and balance sheet in Nodea. That's a different question. But what we experienced in the quarter was a very strong actually activity within the corporate sector. And the corporates are active within the Nordics within event driven. These reactions, for example, acquisitions, and acquisitions, because strategic decisions. I think the phone line has gone again, Manus. And I think we will give it one more. We're going to take a pause for thought, Danny. Of course, you can get to ask Frank just yet about the buyback plans. Let's take a quick pause and see if we can reestablish communication lines, Danny. What else have we got? Well, after we get back with Frank, hopefully, we're also going to talk about other earnings that happen overnight. It's must promising an epic end to the year, despite Tesla shares falling short of Wall Street estimates. We'll discuss that shortly. This is Bloomberg. Music Music Recently, cryptocurrencies have been very popular. If a client came to you and said, look, I'd like some crypto currencies in my portfolio. What would you say? We've actually been really deep into crypto, deep into learning about blockchain, and all of the new businesses. I would characterize this as crypto learners. We have made a series of toehold investments on behalf of our clients, both in some of the currency baskets, as well as with some venture firms that are investing primarily in the crypto area. I think it has the potential to be completely game changing, but it is still such the wild west, and so it's so uncertain. But it has the potential to completely upend everything. The market's come down in Europe from the financial centers of the world, Bloomberg markets European flows with Guy Johnson",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4781,2022-10-20 05:21:44
16436," Market's countdown in Europe from the financial centers of the world. Bloomberg markets European close with Guy Johnson in London and Alex Diel in New York. We'll talk numbers real time analysis week days. Managed the drinkers still out in full force breaking on Pernot record earnings. It is a beat. The first quarter organic sales coming in at 11% the estimate had been just under 10. First quarter sales 3.3 billion euros the estimate had been for 3.19 billion euros. Managed to me this points to another consumer facing company with strong earnings. The consumer is still strong despite attempts from central banks to cool this economy. And something which will say to you as you drink your pasties a little bit later on this evening is the buyback. They plan a buyback of 500 to 750 million euros. That's the big news. So it's a comes from a beat on the organic business and what you've got to ask yourself as this as the world travels again the emerging markets reopen. This is what the guidance was. That's what drove the first quarter which was the recovery in travel and in emerging markets and the likes of India etc. So you are just seeing this and if China moves incrementally forward from zero COVID it will have a positive impact on the market. It will have a pervasive effect not just on travel on oil on currency consumers. Everything is critically dependent supply chains inflation on incremental moves in China. Danny but the buyback is pretty important. It is extremely important especially for where and how these shares open today. They're also planning a cap-ax of about 7% of net sales this year. This is something that call us over a data track pointed out from these earnings. The decent corporate earnings means that we're not going to get reduced hiring or slowing spending. Again it means inflation is here to stick around and manage some dividend lines here as well. They're planning a dividend payout of around 50% of reoccurring that. Okay well let's shift on to shift the stick a little bit not the bare sticks and taslers anymore far too technologically developed for that. They're still good sales that fell short of the estimates on the street citing delivery production bottlenecks. And that prompted Elon Musk to assure investors that demand for the company's cars will that remain strong? As our factors ran we're looking forward to a record breaking Q-4. So it really you know not going to worry it looks looks like we'll have an epic end of the year. So he promises an epic year knock on wood it looks like we'll have an epic year and I think we have a pretty cool chart. 4.768 in the video library. Don't ever ever and he says we don't multitask on this show. They've they've what the record in terms of deliveries for the first three quarters of this year. They've done what they did in the whole of last year. So that just gives you a sense of the good news story and it doesn't it? Yeah, I was doing some quick math this morning if Musk on that call he said that Tesla would soon be worth more than Saudi Aramco and Apple markets cap combined. Man, is that means Tesla's market cap would have to increase by 520%. If that's not a bold, bold vision, I don't know what is. And also of course on the buyback. This was on the T-Live. Go and have a look on your Bloomberg. There's a retrospective T-Live blog on the earnings. He talked about a cash buyback. The potential on the balance sheet is 21.1 billion dollars. And he talked about the potential for a buyback of five to ten billion dollars. I think it was nice that he just slipped in a little bit of a one liner on Twitter. Obviously we're overpaying. But look, I think it is worth to go back to the idea that shares did fall post market. They're still having supply issues with justic issues and it's that strong dollar manness. Let's just have a look at those production numbers that we were mentioning. So as I said in the first three quarters of this year, they have delivered Danny pretty much what they did in the year of 2021. So that gives you something.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4782,2022-10-20 05:26:07
16437," at those production numbers that we were mentioning. So as I said in the first three quarters of this year, they have delivered Danny pretty much what they did in the year of 2021. So that gives you a sense of the ramp up in terms of overall production, even in the face of zero COVID and production delays. There is a red headline. We're going to have a big debate on daybreak, but we will come back to the debate on Volvo in just a moment. It's split the whole camp. Chile, it's Sally binds us together. She's in Singapore. She's got the first word. Cheers. Thanks, Manus Liz Trusses from ESC. He's looking increasingly fragile after a day of drama at Westminster. UK Home Secretary Suella Braverman, who was fired earlier in the day, criticized the Prime Minister and accused the government of breaking key pledges. Tensions came to a head later in a chaotic commons vote over Trusses' controversial plan to restart Shell gas fracking with reports of MPs manhandled into voting with the government. Well, President Zelensky has asked Ukrainians to consume electricity with quosh awareness tomorrow. This, after a grid operator warned of rolling blackouts because of damage to the country's power infrastructure from missile attacks by Moscow. Russia, meanwhile, has extended martial law in four occupied areas of Ukraine, limiting civilian movements. French President Emmanuel Macron has used a fast track to create a push through his budget, effectively bypassing the lower house of parliament. This, after the bill was debated in France as a national assembly for several days during which it became clear it wouldn't secure enough votes to pass. Macron's centrist grouping is nearly 40 seats short after losing its majority earlier this year. Global news 24 hours a day on air and Don Blumberg quick-tape powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. This is Blumberg, Danny. Jules, thanks so much, Juliette Sally in Singapore. Manus, the debate has been decided. We're going to cover Volvo, third quarter, adjusted operating profit coming in at 11.87 billion. That is in ever so slight, Ms. Fesment had been for 11.99. But Manus again, Macron uncertainty grabbing the headlines saying that there is increased uncertainty about macroeconomic development. Still, demand remains good. Order books are extended. Manus, of course, as always, this is Volvo trucks, not Volvo cars. Always worth emphasizing. Absolutely, North America are you looking at 300,000 units in North America, full year for Europe truck division. They still see full year Europe at 300,000 trucks. So again, trying to reassure us there on a net sales of 114.9, the market of pencil in 106.96. And I'm telling you, if this China reopening quarantine incremental move has anything to do with these markets, you're going to see a pervasive risk narrative. If China is shifting on COVID-0 in any way, you're going to have monster moves on some of these commodities, Danny, most especially on oil. Yeah. Yeah, WTI up one and a half percent this morning. It was little changed when we first came in, Manus. So we are seeing some significant moves here. Coming up, the Fed strikes a cautious tone in its beige book. There's growing pessimism on the outlook. We've got that story next. This is Bloomberg. Yeah. Why is everybody going to be a consultant? And what are all these consultants doing? Well, David, I think that we actually defy the label consultant, because sometimes consultants seem to imply.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4783,2022-10-20 05:30:22
16438," What are all these consultants doing? Well David, I think that we actually defy the label consultant because sometimes consultants seems to imply that we only give advice. And when you look at what Accenture does, we're really different than the traditional version of a consultant. We're really about relevance and results. And that's what is driving our business. What about a consulting project? In my example, I'm the CEO, I have a problem, I call you up, I say solve my problem or give me a solution. We don't operate as big companies permanently in crisis mode. And so when you think about how long does it solve things, a lot of it starts with the company being willing to set aggressive goals. And so what we are trying to do now is work with our clients to work differently and to work faster. This really a reminder isn't it just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see pressure on the U.N., we did see some pressure on the futures. That is now being reversed. This is Blinberg, David Cure by Manus Crenie. And bye with Danny Berger in London on the stories that set the agenda. Downing Street, K.R.S. Liz Truss' government hangs in the balance after Home Secretary Quit and the Tories failed to show unity in the House of Commons. U.S. futures, Chinese equities, and oil all head higher on reports of Beijing talks on shorter COVID quarantines. Plus, Tesla shares slide after hours as the company reports sales short of Wall Street estimates, citing delivery and production bottlenecks. But Elon Musk promises a turnaround. As our factory's ran, we're looking forward to a record-breaking Q-4. So it really, you know, not going to worry, it looks like we'll have an epic end of year. There you go. Knock on wood is all going to be fine. I say that every day when I come to school, Danny. I think the biggest defining line of risk is going to be about quarantining from China. Maybe it's incremental, maybe it's small, but it's certainly having an impact across the asset classes. Oil is bid up up nearly 2% this morning. You've got still the challenge, Danny, on the rates narrative. I mean, twos moved by 12 basis points. Yes, indeed, the highest is 2007. Bullard talks about ending of its front loading at the start of next year. Well, the risk market, obviously, not both of what Bullard's got to say. The more obsessed with Neil Cush Carrey. No, cables 1, 12, 22. When is it going to take the pain of anarchy in the Tory party? Not much on the currency front at the moment. How long will trust be in number 10, dining street is the moot of the market? And then, sorry, you want get stronger dollar, dying by a third of 1% on the news that quarantine may move from 10 days to 7 days. Juliet Sally's got. She's just enough that passport literally as we speak. Shanghai, here we come. Maybe we can all meet in Shanghai, Manus, or at least I can dream of such an event. That's what's moving equities so far this morning as well, Manus. CSI 300, that was red. That was down very significantly this morning. It's now erased those losses. It's off the highs, but it's still as significantly in the green. US futures also reducing racing. If I can get my words together, racing some of its losses. Now, the dreaded, hunched on the S&P 500 futures. Still looking at NASDAQ in the red that's underperforming. Again, the fear here is if oil prices are moving higher, it means that the Fed potentially has to clamp down even harder, raise rates even more aggressively. So your duration equities are going to do poorly. And Europe still in the red down one tenth of 1% Manus. OK, lovely roundup. Let's talk about the Fed. They stuck struck that cautious tone in the beige book as it noted that the US economy grew modestly with the risk of recession rising. And I looks at them. Minneapolis Fed president Neil Cushkari said that the center of bank could potentially pause its interest rate increases at some point next year. But only if that is a big if in the story. I want to see us.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4784,2022-10-20 05:34:44
16439," Greece is at some point next year, but only if that is a big if in the story. I want to see us have confidence that that core inflation has peaked, and then I'll head back down in the right direction. Financial markets are suggesting that inflation should fall rapidly next year and year after. I certainly hope that they're right, but I have not yet seen evidence that that mechanism is in play. The CEO of the Center for Economic and Business Research, Nina, if we are looking at a China that's slowly moving towards opening quarantine, if it's something that's punching oil prices higher, do we need to rethink how far, how fast the Fed is going to be hiking? The story out of China is a really, really important one, and it's perhaps not too shocking. We were actually saying just a couple of weeks ago that we were already talking about weeks ago that we are going to probably see China quietly and cautiously start to making some moves away from the Zero COVID policy after the Congress, which is right about now. And I think the clear sign of that was the fact that Hong Kong had been sort of in that part of the world, the leader from sort of slowly moving away from Zero COVID. And it's really the only lever that China can immediately pull to get its growth numbers up, given that the other non-COVID issue they're having at the moment is with a property market and that's going to be a longer and trickier one to address. So I wouldn't be surprised if this news is the first in a series of sort of small announcements of China moving more in line with the West in terms of its approach to COVID, although certainly they won't phrase it, phrase it that way. In terms of what it means for the Fed, for the US, I think even apart from the China story, the Fed was probably coming close to an end of its hiking cycle, which doesn't mean that there won't be any hikes, we're still expecting another 75 basis point ones and then another 50 basis point ones. But then we think the rates are going to stay around that four and a half, a level, basically throughout all of the next year, you know, we're trying to go down. That's a huge amount to unpack. Let's take the China portion of the story first of all. Is it appropriate or inappropriate to extrapolate from incremental changes in Zero COVID policy that we could begin to build a different narrative on supply chains and global inflation? Because those are the two most vexating points of Zero COVID. Is that now what we need to begin to reassess? It's hard to overestimate the role that China plays in both supply chains and sort of the global economy. So I think it's absolutely appropriate to put a lot of attention on what's happening in China and if they are showing signs of changing direction on its COVID policy, it's going to have very real implications on what's happening in the rest of the world. So I do think it's right to focus quite a bit on any signals coming from that part of the world in terms of what they're planning for the year ahead in light of COVID. So then I go back to my original question, Nina. At what point do you look at what's happening at China and revise what you see for the Fed? Revise your inflation forecast? What evidence do you need to see that that will change? I think at the moment, what we've seen is already supporting our current view, which I was just speaking of, which is that sort of inflation around much of the world is going to peak in the coming months, but then gradually start falling. And that is because we have already assumed that China is going to gradually start opening throughout 2023. What would make us change our forecasts is if sort of either it accelerated that process. So you know, instead of getting these gradual news or shortening of quarantine, if we suddenly got something very, very, you know, a lot more dramatic, or if it went in the other direction and we started seeing new signs of COVID crackdowns, but in terms of those two changes in direction, I would be a lot more.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4785,2022-10-20 05:39:14
16440," And we started seeing new signs of COVID crackdowns, but in terms of those two changes in direction, I would be a lot more surprised if China didn't proceed with cautiously dropping the zero COVID policy. You know, let's pivot to the UK in the space of a number of hours. The Chief Whip resigned, apparently remains. Grand Shaps is now the home secretary, and apparently there was actually MPs were manhandled in the corridors of the Palace of Westminster. To say there's anarchy in the Tory party and politics in the UK were being understatement, but let's listen to the leader of the opposition and the clack. Two-year energy freeze, God. Tax free shopping, God. Economic credibility, God. And her supposed best friend, the former chancellor, he's gone as well. Labour leader there, Kierstama, with the clack behind him, almost rehearsing the narrative. But on a slightly more serious note, I don't think I've ever seen political chaos like this in the history of the United Kingdom. Just trust me to go to reinstate any kind of confidence in the UK. What are the problems? I don't know at this stage what the Prime Minister could do to restore confidence. As you say, the story is coming out of the UK government at this point, most recently, the one about MPs possibly being bullied into voting with the government line are almost surreal, and it's very hard to believe in this context or even speaking about the UK. It's not my place to predict how long the current government will stay in power, but the science certainly aren't good if you look at every front page of every UK publication. They're all counting down some of them say days, not even weeks of Liz Truss being in her current post. And I think we're looking ahead to what will come out on the 31st of October in terms of OBR costings. But I think all of those measures have been completely overshadowed by what's happening on the political stage. And it's very hard to imagine the current situation persisting beyond a few weeks. Dario Perkins over at T.S. Lombard has been putting it really harshly. He's called the premium that yields are trading at. He calls it the moron risk premium that you need to pay extra money. The UK needs to pay extra money to borrow because of this political instability. Nina, I know the words are harsh, but is it fair to say that this uncertainty does demand an extra premium from the UK, even if trust leaves, even if we get more consistency in this government that the damage is done? The words that are harsh, but the evidence to support the theory is there. And, you know, so I've seen that it's or even possible now to cost the extra premium that the current leadership is costing the country in terms of borrowing cost, in terms of that premium. I think the problem is that if there is a change of prime minister, it's probably going to bring into question everything we've heard from Jeremy Hunt this week. And then there's going to be another cycle of, OK, what policies can we expect? How are markets going to respond to those? So it might be a little bit hopeful to think if we just have a change in prime minister order will be resolved. I suspect we still have a rather messy period ahead. And even if she is gone, I don't think that I order it be the exact wording, but that premium is gone with her. We're showing the pine. We're showing the front pages of the United Kingdom this morning. The Guardian, the telegraph all the way along the 90-minute shooting match with Liz. This is the former chief weapon, the Sun, broken. I mean, these are brutal. Ironic then, that the pine has bounced this morning. I think that's more a dollar story than it is a pine story. But when you look,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4786,2022-10-20 05:43:24
16441," Broken. I mean, these are brutal. Ironic then that the pint has bounced this morning. I think that's more a dollar story than it is a pined story. But when you look at investment in the UK, FDI and the UK believe in the currency and a re-resking of a currency, the hedge funds believe in one to three years the currency will bounce back and they're buying it up, suck up the short-term volatility. But it says chaotic as it was when Soros tried to break the bank of England. When you look at UK assets like the point, is there anything in the world could make people want to really be long? I mean, deeply discounted property assets. I get that. What about the currency? What about the outlook for FDI? I think there is now, I mean, that we have had two very sharp changes in the rhetoric about the medium and long-term direction of the UK. So we have the mini budget rhetoric that the UK was going to be a high growth low tax economy which markets did not like at all and clearly made them question not only immediate prospects for the UK, but also medium and long-term outlook and how if this was really achievable. So once the market's judgment on that was cast, we've now had a completely different rhetoric from the new chancellor that the UK was going to be a fiscally prudent economy and markets seem to have sort of bought into that narrative. And I think that's why we haven't seen sort of sharp downturns even in light of the very recent yesterday's news about the home secretary and about the vote for the fracking vote. Well, as one of our guests a little bit earlier this week, Nina said to Danyam myself, it's going to be Rishi Sunak economics on steroids in terms of this chancellor. Nina, thank you very much.

Welcome back to Bloomberg Daybreak, Europe with Danny Burger in London. News of the world. Airchter<|pa|><|translate|> ahead of the Commission, Ursula Von der Leyen, unveiled a sweeping plan to limit energy price rises. To debrief it all, we go to our European correspondent Maria today in Brussels. Maria, is there a plan of action? But the question, of course, is there political consensus for it? I guess, Danny. And look, the big difference to two weeks ago, remember, we were in Prague and this was still about the energy crisis. And the issue there is that there were too many ideas floating. Now the big difference going into the summit, as you said, there is now a plan of action. The European, well, the head of the European Commission has already talked about, well, the dynamic price cap, the joint purchases, demand destruction. There is now a number of ideas that have been consolidated into a number of proposals. So there is something the European leaders can now focus on and debate. The issue is, Danny, I'm being told, positions are still very far apart. There's a growing number of countries that want to see serious intervention. The Germans still worry very much about the cap and what it could do to supply. I asked a very good contact of mine yesterday, are we going to get anything that looks like a political deal to this intervention to actually happen and manifest in the markets? And he told me, look, this is going to be a very long night. I'm not sure where to end. So Danny, we'll talk tomorrow, Friday morning, with or without a deal, but definitely a long night for us and store here. I'm telling you what, from a market perspective, Maria, when you begin to look at some of these day ahead and one year ahead prices in Germany, day ahead prices, time by 17 percent yesterday, gas prices dropping by 19 percent, I know you can hurl tomatoes at the screen and go, oh, they're broken markets, they are indicative of hope versus delivery. But what else is being discussed by the leaders in terms of the fallout of the war? Surely, it's just an unwavering support for Ukraine or is anybody at that breaking point of, we've got winter coming and we've got perhaps something more to deal with here. Anybody wavering? Yes. And Matt, is going back to your point, by the way, this is also an excellent point because a lot of the diplomats that I talked to say, well, the market has responded well to the verbal intervention, now they want to see the real thing. But one of the key factors that has driven down prices is storage, which is almost 100 percent completed for this winter. But there's a question about next winter, but also the fact that European countries have stopped outbiting each other the way they were doing in August for gas. Now in terms of that unit, look, on paper manners, the head of the commission says, for us, it's clear, this is aocracy versus democracy. We're in it for Ukraine, the long haul, but two things that I want to point out to you. There is a message this morning from Victor Orban, the Hungarian Prime Minister who says, I honestly don't see a plan coming out of this meeting that is not expensive.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4788,2022-10-20 05:52:32
16443," There is a message this morning from Victor Orban, the Hungarian Prime Minister who says, I honestly don't see a plan coming out of this meeting that is not expensive and works for us. So that could be a sticking point, but also overnight, a scandal in Italy. There is now a leaked conversation by Silvio Battluscani in which he blamed Silensky for pushing Vladimir Putin into the war. This is not an anecdote because the Italian government is up in the year. It is in the making and there is a very severe warning now from George Amelani. Remember, she won the election saying, if you do not back Italy in the EU and NATO, you're not going to be in government and there may not be a government at all. So keep a very close eye on the B2P of course market and the Italian story too. Okay, toxic mix, politics and markets. They never far from one another. Maria, thank you very much Maria, back on Terra Europe. Coming up at we return to the turmoil, gripping the UK's Tory party, this trans-sister's government clings to power, this story on Blinberg. How much have you seen from the Keshira government in terms of green funding? The Keshira administration has committed to doubling the amount of investments in so-called green technologies. I think we need more than just pronouncements. We need real money backing, very innovative startups and innovative companies in this space. What do you make of Keshira's new capitalism? Well, I think he is framework is reflective of the challenges that Japan society is facing, namely that growth has been present but growth has not been of course evenly distributed. But frankly speaking, it's hard to register the income if you don't have a income to begin with that the government and private sector can work together and collaborate to drive more innovative growth startups that that can really drive the income growth that the Keshira government needs to redistribute. It's Dave Baker with me, Managed Cranny and Dubai. Danny Berger alongside me at London HQ, let's set the agenda for the rest of the trading day 12 noon. We're going to get the latest rate decision from Ukraine's central bank. Then Turkey kicks in as well at 12 noon with the decision on the rates 130pm. We're going to begin to get some of the hard data from the state's jobless claims. And by 3pm it's existing home sales figures. It's going to be an interesting one on the property market. Later today the EU leaders gather for the two-day summit in Brussels. Unity Danny, that's what we're going to look for. Yeah and we're also going to look for any twists in turns in the chaotic world of UK politics and it's been a day and any evening and weeks of political turmoil and Westminster with Liz Truss' premier ship looking close to imploding or at least on the edge. Let's bring in Bloomberg's Lizzy Burton. Lizzy does seem like things continued to reach new lows in this Tory party. Yeah, never mind the humiliation that Liz Truss suffered at Prime Minister's questions at the hands of the opposition Labour leader, Kier Starmer, over how much of a policy and her chancellor had gone.

Why do the biggest names in business choose Bloomberg? Great question. Good morning. Welcome to Bloomberg Market's Europe. My man Edwards live in London. Mark Cudmore, our market's live managing editor, joins us from Singapore to take us through all of the market action this hour. The cash trade just less than an hour away. Here are your top headlines. Downing streets on the brink, Liz Trussi's government looks close to imploding as her own MPs agitate for her to go. China debates cutting COVID quarantine for inbound travelers risk assets are given a boost. And Tesla shares four sales full short of estimates. CEO Elon Musk tries to assure investors that demand remain strong. Welcome to the program everybody. Welcome to Bloomberg Market's Europe live in London and in Singapore this hour. It's just on 7 o'clock here in London. Mark E's in Singapore for us. Mark, good morning. What are the markets saying to you? Good morning, Anna. Well, it's a really interesting session. It's one of those days where you really need to keep an eye on the price action. How we turn out today, not necessarily the data that we're expecting and not. And the reason I say that is we're expecting a little bit of relief rally into this earning season. But the mood this morning was gloomy. It then got much gloomier again when China and Hong Kong opened and just Hong Kong stocks followed for the lowest levels since 2009. It just seemed depression across markets. And then during the China lunch break we got the news that you just reported there. The Bloomberg scoop that they're considering easing quarantine standards and that has provided a little bit of relief. But it's not really sustaining. So I think it'll be interesting how Europe takes that news. I think how we trade today will be very important for the next week or so. Yes, absolutely Europe then weighing up that news out of China. We'll talk more about that. Get more detail on it shortly. But also political instability in the UK. Can that move the dial still? Let's have a look at where we are on corporate earnings. So Mark because we're getting some of those coming through as well this morning. Um as the luxury gives company based in France. Of course third quarter sales at constant effect up by 24.3%. And I mentioned this one. High up in the program just because it is much higher than the estimate. The estimate was for 15.3%. It comes on the back of a trend of strength from the luxury goods companies. And it comes on the back of a of a trending tourism that other luxury goods companies have mentioned. The CFO saying that US tourists have helped boost sales in Europe and that does seem to be something that has come to the rescue of a sector that was in trouble. Of course during COVID but has now found its legs again with the help of the strong dollar and US tourists on tour. Now let's get back to the broader macro picture an hour away from the start of cash equity trading. This is what European futures look like then. They look a little bit weak of this morning. Fancy futures down a tenth of a percent tax features down by four tenths of one percent yesterday was pretty mixed in Europe. The US actually dropped though in session. So perhaps we have a little catch up to do there. Looking ahead US futures. Then if we roll on to show you those perhaps being a helped a little by that news out of China. Mark that you've just mentioned that seem to help the futures picture at the margin. Whether that's sustained or see but E minis off earlier lows down still down two tenths of one percent. And as that futures perhaps responding to Tesla news down by six tenths of one percent down futures actually in the green mark. All that said what do you see then in the GMM? So the GMM is a picture of negativity but this would have been a much more negative picture two hours ago. A 1218 our time was when the Bloomberg scoop broke on those change in kind of China messaging around COVID. And we've had some relief since then which kind of shows how bad the day was that we still got quite a red board. We can still see that stocks are generally down and Chinese stocks have got back to.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4791,2022-10-20 06:05:08
16446," And we've had some relief since then, which kind of shows how bad the day was that we still got quite a red board. So you can still see that stocks are generally down and Chinese stocks have got back to positive targets to about Hong Kong stocks still deep down. It fell to the lowest level since 2009 today. There were about, hate shares were about down about 3.3% earlier back to down about 1.5% just like came onto the show. We've seen the dollar slightly stronger, but note the Chinese yuan is rallying and that's seen the dollar kind of pair. It's gained some earlier on in the session. People are really worried about dollar yuan going through 1.5% what that would mean. We are seeing yields a little bit higher in the region again, though. It's just to follow through from the treasury story from yesterday where we saw cyclical highs and yields right across the curve. And otherwise again, it's a slightly mixed story of commodities. But since that China news broke, it's not showing up there, but oil prices have bounced again a bit. Okay, Mark, thank you very much for thoughts so far on what's going on on the markets. We'll return to these markets thoughts shortly, but let's take a detour into UK politics. It has been a day and evening of political turmoil in the UK with Liz Trass' premiership looking close to imploding. At Prime Minister's questions, opposition Labour party leader Keir Starmer laid out a list of government U-turns. Two-year energy freeze, gone. Tax free shopping gone. Economic credibility gone. And to suppose best friend the former Chancellor, he's gone as well. Let's bring in Bloomberg's Lizzy Birdon. Lizzy, good morning to you. Where does this leave the Prime Minister? That was the middle of the day. After that, we had a whole series of seemingly chaotic developments surrounding the home secretaries, surrounding the whips, surrounding voting in the commons and allegations of other MPs being sort of manhandled. Intervoting lobbies. Where does this leave the Prime Minister? Well, she only added to Keir Starmer's list of what was gone from her premiership. She lost two of the holders of the great offices of state. She's lost her economic strategy and now her only connection to her core is Brexit. And yet, because of the replacement of Suella Bravenman with grant chaps as the home secretary, she's now surrounded in her cabinet by remainers, her political enemies, people who supported Rishi Sunak, the former Chancellor, to be the leader of the party in the summer leadership election. And the party seems to have lost its dignity. You had back benches absolutely livid when they were being interviewed in the commons late last night. So Liz Truss is looking desperate. It seems that she's doomed. And if she goes today, she would be the shortest serving Prime Minister in British history. I'm going to be keeping an eye out for that podium in Downing Street today. And in case we forget, this is just the chaos in Westminster outside in the real world, in the UK. People have got higher mortgages because of us. Tias Lombard put it the more on risk premium. Yeah, that said, guilt yields did continue to drop yesterday. So maybe we're watching markets trying to disconnect from all the chaos in Westminster. And just just wanted to mention one of the lines coming through in one of our most recent reports, Lizzie. In a statement sent at 130 this morning, the Prime Minister's press secretary said she would be taking disciplinary action against MPs who voted against the government. A sense just briefly, Lizzie, that the fight isn't quite over. I mean, you can't say more than, I mean, that was 130. Who knows how things have developed between then and now? And yet somehow the Prime Minister herself didn't manage to vote. Because she was chasing the chief whip around begging her not to resign. Absolutely chaos. Lizzie, thanks very much, Lizzie Borden, summing up the chaos that we see here in UK politics. Let's get back to a conversation about the markets. Let's talk about where we are in three minutes. And perhaps we have seen a bit of a disconnect in terms of where guilt can trade. I don't know how long a disconnect can last though, Mark, because if we're pushed into another bout of political turmoil in the UK, does that threaten to hijack guilt markets once again? We certainly saw the chaos that could be unleashed there. I'm actually not sure it does. I think the next week until the fiscal statement on the 31st and Bank of England on November 3rd is more of a political story in the UK. Sure, of course those headlines will see some, you know, short-term volatility in some of the asset markets. But I don't think we're going to get the real massive gyrations we got only a few weeks ago with those initial measures announced by Quartan and Trust. I think we're past that initial period of volatility. And overall......",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4792,2022-10-20 06:09:32
16447," get the real massive gyrations we got only a few weeks ago with those initial measures announced by Quartan and Trust. I think we're past that initial period of volatility. And overall, if we get a new government, if we get a new plan, we might get further stability, we might get a little bit of relief rally from a market that has a very negative story priced, a valid story, but it is priced. I do think, and I always talked about a lot this week, the longer term fundamental story from the UK remains very negative, but I think it might be a bigger theme for next year rather than trying to play it around the politics in the short term. Yeah, and that does seem to be a disconnect at the moment. I just wonder if the policy exchange is very quickly and very brutally. Do we get a fiscal savings on the 31st and can't take a administration hold things in check? Let's leave the UK there. No doubt we will return to it, Mark. But let's talk about what you were mentioning a little earlier. And that is China. The size and the scope of what is being considered in China, not necessarily huge, reducing quarantine down from 10 days to seven, from 10 days down to seven. But I suppose if it's the thin end of a wedge, if it points a point in an interesting direction on China, COVID policy, that maybe is what captured the market's attention. Yeah, absolutely, Anna. So this, as you say, the measures here are really minor, really incremental, changing from 10 days quarantine to seven days, changing the hotel bit. I think it is from seven days and three at home to five days and then two at home or something like that, but basically pretty incremental marginal. But I actually think this is really big news because the market had kind of bitten the idea that Congress was going to provide to the end of COVID-0. I always thought that was very mistaken. And you know, there's capitulation when it didn't kind of announce some great measures. And everyone was like, oh no, that's it. The China trade is over. Let's give up. The fact that this has come out now as timing is just after everyone's capitulated, just after everyone's given up hope on Chinese assets, Hong Kong assets, now this news has come through. And that's a very important messaging thing. And as you say, it's the thin end of the wedge. I think this could be quite a big turning point for Chinese Hong Kong assets, which would support global assets. Okay. We need to talk about what's going on with the Fed. And we will do that a little bit later in the program. I want to ask you about the Yen though, because we're at incredibly close to that one 50 mark, 149.95. What do we watch for next here, Mark? So there's a big debate in the market is 150, the big level, 151. I don't know too much. It's interesting. The option barrier seems to be protected at the moment. Look, I think expect them to come at some point again soon in the next percent if it goes much higher. I think this time they'll come in much more aggressively. They'll have to because they're measures are not worked as well. But not only will they come in more aggressively, but I think the environment is more favorable for dollar, Yen to fall. So I think we could see Yen bottom out on the crosses, maybe not against the dollar. Okay. Mark, thanks for thoughts so far. Remember, you can get up to date analysis and insight for Mark and the rest of the markets live team. MLIV goes the function to use on your Bloomberg terminal. Coming up on the program, we will speak to the Ericsson CEO. He would be joining us shortly. Boia Eakome. After the company said it will change pricing and cut costs after a profit miss. The focus on inflation there. Also the legal issues facing the business. Plus we hear from the Fed James Bullard on the US Central Bank's path ahead. If you have any of your own questions you want us to put to our guests, we'll also talk about guilt markets where we are on the UK narrative shortly. IB plus TV go. That's the function to use on your Bloomberg terminal. This is Bloomberg. IB. Recently, cryptocurrencies have been very popular.

16448," You know, I would characterize us as crypto learners. You know, we have made a series of toe-hold investments on behalf of our clients, both in some of the currency baskets, as well as with some venture firms that are investing primarily in the crypto area. I think it has the potential to be completely game-changing, but it is still such that the wild rest, and so it's so uncertain. But there's, it has the potential to completely upend everything. Welcome back to Bimbo Markets Europe. We are 45, just over 45 minutes away from the start of cash equities trading. And the future picture looks, well, mix actually this morning, DAX teachers and CAQ teachers diverging quite a little bit. The luxury story out of France could be important there to consider. Let us get to one of the corporate stories we're following today. Erickson says it will change its prices and cut costs after it reported third quarter profit that missed expectations. The company, one of the world's biggest providers of 5G networking equipment is also looking to use product substitutions to manage its margins. Erickson shares are down by more than a quarter this year. Let's speak to the CEO of Erickson Boyer, Erickcomb, who joins us now. Boyer, very nice to see you today. I want to start with what you've reported, the numbers, then looking a little below what some had anticipated. And one of your shareholders, the activist shareholders at Sevian, saying describing Erickson's quarterly profits as disappointing, what do you say in response to that? Well, first of all, we have to look at the business. And we see a good and solid growth. So we have gained sales in the quarter, about 3% organically. And this is on the back of the significant footprint gains we've had during the year. But also during the current quarter, the third quarter. So our business is robust. And then of course, what we see is that we have a couple of things going on in the quarter. And yes, one thing that's very important for us is the patent revenues or IPR revenues. They are down, which is because we are in renegotiations with license wars. And this is something that swings between the quarters. It's not really lost. It's more that it's delayed. Because typically a license agreement will include recuperating past royalties once it's signed. But then we also see a bit of cost pressures. We see cost increases due to investments in geopolitical resiliency. But we also see cost increases because we continue to invest for technology leadership. And here we're investing substantially in our cloud-drawn portfolio in Ericsson Silicon. And that's in order to meet the future demands of the Telecom networks. Okay, good morning. You mentioned there about patent revenues. And I think that kind of leads me into the idea that you've been involved in a sprawling dispute with Apple for almost a year with trials fast approaching. How confident are you that these cases will result in a vindication of both the strength of your patents? And also of your licensing practices. We have a very strong patent portfolio. We have more than 60,000 patents. We're very strong in the patent portfolio on 5G. So I feel that it's important for us to make sure that we optimize that value. And that's what we're going to do. And that may take some more longer time. But the most important is that we actually get the right value for our portfolio. Are you seeing any signs, boy, of course we track the inflation impulse, the threats to global growth daily here on Bloomberg TV. Do you see any signs that your customers that carry us are having to slow the rates of capital spending because of inflation, headwinds or their concerns about?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4794,2022-10-20 06:18:09
16449," With daily here on Bloomberg TV, do you see any signs that your customers that carry us are having to slow the rates of capital spending because of inflation, headwinds, all their concerns about growth in the future? What we see, we see the North American operators, they have guided for lower capEx in 2023. We know that already. We see a bit of, or at least it's prudent for us to believe that there could be some slowness in CapEx. At the same time, I must say the end traffic is still growing in the network and that will require capacity. That speaks in the other side and thirdly, it's actually our own footprint gains that are going to support growth in 2023 as well. And we're very confident about that. That's why the quality of our strategy to invest in technology leadership leveraged that to gain footprint has been critical and that's what's going to drive our success in the next year. Open Radio Access Network, is this becoming a bigger threat to your core business? You know, the ORAN or Open RAN, I think that it's an important part of the market. We're actually the leading contributor to, or one of the leading contributors to the Open RAN standards. So for us, we think that's one element of the future. This is why we invest in cloud run. But in reality, it's probably more of a 60 architecture than it is going to impact 5G. And if you look at the most recent wins, it's significant footprint gains in new markets where we're growing our presence on the current offerings. So this is all about what's going to happen in the future. And when ORAN happens, we will be there competing like we have done so far. Okay, can I move on to some of the legal issues facing the business, Boogie? And I'm thinking in particular about the SEC investigation into your operations in Iraq. Can you update us? What is the latest there? Yeah, this is an ongoing investigation. The US authorities bought both the Department of Justice and the SEC. So it's inappropriate for me to comment at this point in time when we have more developments. We will talk about it, but we continue to cooperate fully with the US authorities into this investigation. You've said that the company may be fined again. I mean, how bad could it get for Erickson? And maybe for you personally, are you concerned about you personally, possibly facing legal action? I would say, you know, it's today speculative. We can only focus on what we do, which is to make sure that we work with the US authorities. We shared the information we have and we cooperate fully. And that's what we do. Thanks for joining us. Very good to speak to you. Thank you for coming to talk to us. Well, yeah, Icom the Erickson CEO coming up on the program more from our exclusive interview with the fed James Bullard. What clues are we getting about where rates head in 2023? This is Bloomberg. Why is everybody want to be a consultant and what are all these consultants doing? Well, David, I think that we actually",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4795,2022-10-20 06:22:27
16450," Why is everybody want to be a consultant and what are all these consultants doing? Well David, I think that we actually defy the label consultant because sometimes consultant seems to imply that we only give advice and when you look at what Accenture does, we're really different than the traditional version of a consultant. We're really about relevance and results and that's what is driving our business. What about a consulting project? In my example on the CEO, I have a problem, I call you up, I say solve my problem or give me a solution. We don't operate as big companies permanently in crisis mode and so when you think about like how long does it solve things, a lot of it starts with you know the company being willing to set aggressive goals and so what we are trying to do now is work with our clients to work differently and to work faster. I do think they will have an impact and in some ways have had an impact, I would cite the housing market in particular where it appears that increase in rates has really changed the dynamics there so that's some place that I would say there are not long and variable lags. That market anticipated Fed moves that before they were even in train this spring and so that's a place where we've seen impact right away but you know it's a big ship and it takes a while to steer the ship and so the housing market is not the whole economy so. It certainly isn't and it's certainly not the main things driving inflation now of course prices have fallen but rents are important though. We think certainly aren't. They certainly aren't and in fact that's one reason why people are so worried about inflation staying high next year is that those rents are the way they are calculated. We're going to spread out over several months. Yeah but we're aware of the lags in the calculation and so we'll take that on board and take a look at that but yeah you're right the core measure of PC inflation is still on high fours and the Dallas Fed trim mean 4.75 or so. So pretty high inflation in the US even if you try to trim out some of the more volatile components so we're going to have to get that turned around moving in the right direction back toward 2%. So how are you going to do that? What does this mean for the restrictive terminal rate of the September steps medium target interest rate 4.4% this year 4.6% next year? What are your after the latest data? What are your projections now? Well if you look at the September summary of economic projections that so-called dot plot did seem like the committee was coalescing around further rate increases at upcoming meetings even by the end of the year. So that seems to be the base case right now most of that has been priced in the market so I would anticipate that that's having an impact right now so that's good news if you're trying to get inflation down but we'll have to follow through on that in the subsequent meetings this year and get the policy rate up to a level where we can put meaningful downward pressure on inflation. I think that's the main goal immediately ahead of us at the committee. Sir Lewis Fed President James Bullard speaking exclusively to our Bloomberg colleague Kathleen Hayes and Mark what's your latest thinking on the Fed because there was a story yesterday that maybe Fed insiders see inflation actually running hotter or the economy is running hotter than it is sort of being reported at the moment but then we heard from Bullard there talking about front loading of Hayes maybe ending in 2023 the early part and Evans hoping that what they've signaled already might be enough in terms of interest rate high so those I suppose they're slightly more dovish nuances not really convincing anybody in the market right now. No and I think you know it depends a spin the Bullard comments I think the idea of front loading rate hikes might be.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4796,2022-10-20 06:26:44
16451," New oncy is not really convincing anybody in the market right now. No, and I think, you know, it depends how you spin the Bullard comments. I think the idea of front loading rate hikes might end in 2023. But what does that mean? Does that mean we might get another five meetings of 75 basis points and IE eternal rate way above 5% by the first quarter? So you could see front loading of rate hikes end earlier in 2023. I'm not particularly fighting that, but definitely inflation is going to be very, very persistent. The idea of US inflation getting back to 2% next year is just bonkers. We're going to fall because of energy prices year and year, we're most like, and a slowing growth, we're most likely going to fall back towards 4% or so middle and next year. But it's going to be very hard for headline inflation to get multiple prints below that level. And the fact is that's going to be kind of the new floor, the new kind of equilibrium for US inflation, which is going to mean that US rates need to stay high. They need to be higher than they are now, and they just stay up there for a long period to come. And the worry is that if that's the kind of floor that we very quickly get another inflation spike again, if energy goes up. OK, and so with that said, yields could go a lot higher from here still, you think. I think US 2-year yields still have much higher to go over the next six months, next nine months. I think the terminal rate still needs to become unankored. I think the tenure is more difficult because I expect the curve to invert further. So I have less conviction there, but 2-year yields ultimately go much higher, but I don't share the theme for the next few weeks. OK, Mark, thank you very much for those thoughts on the Fed. Coming up, we'll get back to the micro. Tesla sales fall short of Wall Street estimates but Elon Musk tells investors the end of the year will be epic. We will have a deeper dive into the Tesla numbers that's coming up shortly. We'll also, of course, talk about what's going on in the UK, the politics and how that plays out or doesn't in gilt markets. This is Blinkberg. Apple has identified its next big business, bringing advertising to the App Store, Apple News, and the Stocks app. In the news and stocks apps, Apple shows display advertisements. That means that third-party companies like Cartel or Ships or mortgage lenders can showcase their advertisements just like they can on a website. On the App Store, the situation is different. There, Apple has search ads. This allows developers to, by their way, dishoeing a buyer on search results. For instance, an App Store developer can bid for the term car racing or basketball so their apps would surface above competing apps in the list of results. Apple's pushing to ads is a little ironic given that its ATT or app tracking transparency privacy feature limits the ability for Meta, Snap, and even smaller developers to generate as much revenue as possible from advertising. That's because the feature allows users to choose if they want their data collected and tracked across third-party apps and websites. Still, Apple's hoping to expand its own ads business and is planning to add search ads to its Maps app. Other areas where ads could eventually appear are in Apple Books and Apple podcasts, along, maybe one day, with an ad-supported tier of Apple TV Plus to compete with new offerings from Netflix and other streaming video providers.

16452," Everything you need to get set for the start of U.S. trading. Bloomberg, the open with Jonathan Farrell. Drilling down in the numbers and preparing you as only Bloomberg can. Weekdays on Bloomberg. Welcome back to Bloomberg Market's Europe. Half an hour to go until the start of cash equity trading here are your top stories. Downing street on the brink, Liz Truss' government looks close to imploding as her own MPs adhesate for her to go. China debates cutting COVID quarantine for inbound travellers. Risk assets are given a boost. Antesla shares fall as sales fall short of estimates. CEO Elon Musk tries to assure investors that demand remains strong. Welcome back to the program everybody. It's been a busy Thursday morning already and it is only 7.30 here in London. Let's have a look at the future's picture. Half an hour away from the start of the European equity trading session. First features looking more muted but DAX features moved down. CAQ features actually had spent a little more time in the green a moment ago. Perhaps the luxury numbers, the likes of earn theirs, that will add some boost to the Paris market. But broadly we are flat to negative across the European futures picture. Weighing up some of the higher rates of environment that we talked about in the last part of the program. And continue to do so. Mark, you've been thinking about some of the news flow we've got out of China and thinking about Hong Kong and how that particular market trades. What's your eye on that front this morning? Yeah, this is a little bit of a mere culper, confession moment, except I'm probably doing the wrong way of almost doubling down. So I think I've had a, you know, I'd make a lot of public views and this year has been pretty good for me. You have hot streaks, cold streaks. This year's largely been a hot streak but this year, one of the two worst calls I made and it's been terrible. It's earlier this year I said in even though I was very bearish that one of the best ways to play for a more bullish stance or play for a performance was to be long Hong Kong stocks. And that has just been appalling. They're down about 20% since then. That really was just an absolutely dreadful call. But I'm wondering when is enough enough in Hong Kong stocks? They have fallen today down to 2009 levels, right? We're rebounding from the crisis. And I kind of think that the news flow is turning a little bit more positive. I want to show in valuation. So here's one chart, which is a backward looking P ratio, which is many people looking at. And this is basically the lowest ever valuation in our history going back to 1993. So almost 30 years there we've got. This is the lowest ever valuation. 6.1. I mean, everyone's going to excited that the S&P 500 is cheap when it gets down to about 15. This is unbelievable. Now that's a backward looking P and we might be suspicious of them as earnings. So let's have a look at another chart, which is a forward blended, 12 months blended forward looking earnings. We're now near the lows ever. Now it is important to notice that this is not at the lows. It has been down towards that kind of below nine level towards eight several times in 2008. It even went below that eight level. We're at 9.1 today. So do you want to pick right here right now? I don't know. I've been wrong on this all year, but I have to say I still think this market looks incorrectly cheap. I remain very negative on global stocks. The US stocks have more downside over the next nine months, but I have to say a year from now, I hope I'm not wrong in this again. I hope you're not. I do like the way that you manage to laugh at your own calls, even whilst you're delivering to the international audience market, much appreciated. Right, let us turn to business news, corporate news this morning and get a Bloomberg business flash. Here's Alice Atkins. Good morning, Alice. Morning, Anna. Philip Morris has increased its offer for Smokeless Tobacco Company, Swedish match. The total value of the revised offer from the Swiss-based tobacco giant amounts to about $15.8 billion. A takeover would give Philip Morris a vast distribution network in the US, the world's largest market for smoking alternatives. It says it will not increase the price further. As LeCheres tumbled in late trade, after sales fell short of Wall Street estimates on delivery and production bottlenecks. The V-Car maker also warned it's unlikely to achieve full-year delivery growth of 50% this year as planned. But CEO Elon Musk flagged a potential share buyback worth up to $10 billion, subject to board approval. Bloomberg has learned Saudi Aramco is pushing ahead with plans for an IPO of its oil trading business and what would be one of the biggest listings this year.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4798,2022-10-20 06:35:32
16453," Board approval. Bloomberg has learned Saudi Aramco is pushing ahead with plans for an IPO of its oil trading business and what would be one of the biggest listings this year. Sources say the firm is working with advisors for a listing in Riyadh as early as this year, which could value the unit at more than $30 billion. That's your Bloomberg business flash Anna. Alice, thank you very much, shall we start here in London now? It has been a day and an evening of political turmoil again in the UK. With Linshtras' premiership looking close to imploding, conservatives were in revolt following a parliamentary vote that triggered allegations of government bullying. And cabinet ministers were reported to have held private conversations about whether the Prime Minister should quit joining us now to talk about the markets, though. Craig Inches, Royal London asset management head of rates and cash. Craig, I want to talk about the links or lack of them between politics and markets right now. Certainly, the link between guilt markets and politics was very clear to see when Quasi Quarting was the Chancellor. Things seem to have changed a little recently, a different tack of course as we well understand being taken by Jeremy Hunt. And we saw guilt yields despite we haven't seen all of the politics play out yesterday, but some of the chaos was clear. And guilt yields continued to retreat, continued to fall. Do you think guilt can keep their heads whilst the politicians seem to be messing things up? Craig Inches, I think it is interesting that, you know, it is almost the adult has stepped in. Whether it is a responsible adult or not as a different question at Andrew Bailey at the Bank of England, but he has effectively had to take control of markets. So obviously, Jeremy Hunt gave his speech, which put some stabilization behind the bond market. But if you look at the move that we saw yesterday in long dating bond yields, it was really that sort of implication of quantitative tightening being delayed for long dated guilt sales until the start of next year that really caused the big fall in long dated bond yields. We saw 30-year bond yields yesterday fall in the region of about 35 basis points. And you know, I was listening to your programme earlier talking about that. The more on indexes, as I was talking about, where guilt yields should trade perhaps above other bond markets, we like to call it the credibility spread rather than the more on indexes, probably a little bit more polite. But if you look at where UK bond yields were only a few weeks ago, they were trading 100 basis points above US 30-year treasuries. And now we actually trade below 30-year treasuries. So if you look at the state of political disarray that we have in the UK, personally, I don't think that is the right level. I think you should actually push higher. But with the bank effectively reducing that supply at the moment of long dated guilt, it could be quite difficult in the next few weeks. Correct. So you're talking about being difficult in the next few weeks. What is the big catalyst you're looking for? I know it could be anything in the UK at the moment. We've got the political turmoil. We've potentially got the fiscal statement on the 31st. We've got the bank giving in on the third. Which is the one that you think that really gets this story moving again? I think it's definitely that, first of all, to talk about. If you actually look at the last few days, we've talked about the original money budget. We've talked about the reverse money budget. And we've talked about QT, all of that really when you think about net supply for 2020 to 2020, 24 is probably a tiny proportion of the overall net supply. We are about to be hit with probably 270 to 300 billion of net guilt supply in 2023, 2024. Put that in context for the past 10 years, but when you put QE into the framework, we've only had about net supply of about 60 billion per annum for the past 10 years. So we're going to get 275 billion in an environment when inflation is very high, interest rates are rising, central bank and UK is behind the curve and we probably don't have a government. Whereas you was going to go in that environment, it's definitely shouldn't be lower. That's my opinion. Craig, if we did see a change of leader in the UK and if that date slipped, if that commitment to a fiscal statement on the 31st of October, if that moves, how would the market take that? Well, I think if the date slips, I'd imagine the bank are still in control. So they're going to basically be on that front to try and keep markets under control. Obviously, we've seen what the pressure point is and that pressure point is pension schemes. So we can't afford long day to use to go too much higher for the short term. I think if there is a change of leader, the question is going to be how long does it?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4799,2022-10-20 06:39:58
16454, point is and that pressure point is pension schemes so we can't afford long day to use to go too much higher for the short term. I think if there is a change of leader the question is going to be is how long does it take to get that new leader in place? Is it going to be you know and almost like a coronation by the Tory party to put Sunack in power because ultimately as you say probably most of the people who are surrounding the trust at the moment were potentially Sunack supporters. If that does happen that can happen quickly that might actually calm the markets because then we effectively get a move back towards austerity which could push go use Lord from here. Correct. The pension crisis took people by many people by surprise. I'm not going to say everyone but many people by surprise out there. Do you think that situation is now behind us and is there anything else you know but under the radar there that we might be watching for to be the next kind of crisis to hit in markets? Now I think I think that pension crisis is still you know bubbling beneath the surface. You know I think if we saw long dated you was pushed back up above 5% again you would get same sort of death spiral that we saw ultimately you need to get schemes coming and have to sell bonds again which we potentially sort of pushed those bond levels up. It's like you know a long time ago we used to have more existing facts they selling in the US and obviously the higher you go the more schemes need to sell and that's still the same situation with UK pension funds. I think the big problem big differences though is they have actually used this time wisely they have built up a lot more cash buffers they have lowered the sort of sensitivity of their portfolios to higher yields so you know the magnitude and the speed of the rise might be slower than what we had what we saw in the last few weeks. How sticky do you think UK inflation will be next year and in the years ahead Craig? Well this is the this is the million dollar question is the term where bond yields go where rates go how how inverted the yield curves get. I think if you look at UK you know we've got you know really since we've if you look at a few years since Brexit you know that's a cheap transferable labor has been reduced you know we've got a very tight labour market 3.5% you know in the UK probably the the sort of narrow rate is probably still up somewhere between 4.5% and 5%. So the banks still really need to generate a lot of unemployment to get inflation back under control and to bring it from 10 down to 6 maybe fairly easy to get it from 6 down to 2 is basically like putting toothpaste back into the tube that's going to be very hard for the bank to be able to achieve this and I think as long as that continues we're not going to see a fallen interest rates anytime soon. Craig thanks so much thank you very much for joining us Craig inches Royal London asset management head of rates and cash the perfect voice to talk to us about the links between politics and guilt markets right now coming up on the program EU leaders gather in Brussels so on the agenda energy Ukraine and the economy we will talk about that next this is Lindeke China's military power has been growing at an incredible speed over the last 20 years a strong country must have a strong military as only then can it guarantee the security of the nation in terms of sphere of influence we absolutely know that China wants to be dominant in Asia so there is a target to get to that point to be a military that is appear to the greatest militaries in the world by 2035 the competition for influence is a global one and through a multi-decade trajectory fueled by planning money and pragmatism China is building a military that allows it to shape the 21st century just as the US shaped the 20th,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4800,2022-10-20 06:44:01
16455," Two days ago, we remembered the commission, this is just a proposal. It really comes down to European leaders who decide whether or not this is going to fly or not. And Anna, I am being told in terms of the overall package that should be approved tomorrow, if it gets approved, we're still far away from consensus. The countries that have concerns about the cap and the implications of the supply still say they believe this is a risky move. They want to see some price intervention with a ceiling. The thing that's changed, however, from two weeks ago, is that there is now something on paper the European leaders can debate. Remember, two weeks ago in Prague, the issue was there were too many ideas floating around. It was hard to focus minds. I mean, in the meantime, I think there will be a meeting at 3pm, there will be now a point plan to debate. Good morning, Maria. And leaders are discussing the fallout of the war more broadly. How in wavering is support for Ukraine? That's in context. I've seen some relatively controversial messages from some senior European politicians than I see days. Yes, and look, that's a very good point because ultimately it comes down to the war in Ukraine. The energy crisis in many ways is the fallout from the Russian invasion of Ukraine on paper. The head of the commission has been very clear the way she sees it. This is aocracy versus democracy. The European Union is in it for the long haul, but I should point to two things. There is a tweet now already from Viktor Orban, the Hungarian Prime Minister, sometimes seen as the problem child of the EU, which he says I expect a very long debate. And I don't see a plan for the energy market that is not a going to be expensive or can be applied quickly. And then the other issue overnight in Italy, a private conversation by Sylvia Berlusconi, in which he blames the Ukrainians for pushing Vladimir Putin to invade. This may seem an anecdote. It's another joke by Berlusconi, but nothing about this is funny because the Italian government is in the making. And there was a very stark warning from John Tamilar, the winner of the election, seeing if you do not agree that Italy is the member of NATO and the European Union, you're not in government, and that means we may not even have a government. Maria, thank you very much. Blinberg's Maria today, over the latest on what to look ahead to at that EU leaders meeting, the energy and Ukrainian topics very much front and center. Let's get back to corporate earnings, though, because this also relevant to the trading day ahead. Tesla has reported sales that fell short of all street estimates, citing delivery and production bottlenecks. And prompting Elon Musk to assure investors that demand for his company's cars remains strong. As our factory is ran, we're looking forward to a record breaking queue for. So it's really, you know, not going to worry. It looks, looks like we'll have an epic end of year. He says, let's bring in Bloomberg, Stefan Nicola, who's been there tracking the story for us. Stefan, very good to have you on the program. So why did Tesla miss then these Wall Street expectations this time around? I think we are having some considerable problem with Stefan's audio. So I will just jump in and say apologies to the audience apologies to Stefan. The audio, not very good there. We will try and reestablish it. Take a short break and see what we can do. We will have a look at the stocks to watch as well. We're focusing on the luxury sector. Hermes with sales, beating estimates. This is going back. We're going to have a look at the stock market.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4801,2022-10-20 06:50:23
16456," seen from the Kishida government in terms of green funding. The Kishida administration has committed to doubling the amount of investments in so-called green technologies. I think we need more than just pronouncements. We need real money backing, very innovative startups and innovative companies in this space. What do you make of Kishida's new capitalism? Well, I think he is framework is reflective of the challenges that Japan society is facing, namely, that growth has been present, but growth has not been, of course, evenly distributed. But frankly speaking, it's hard to register the income if you don't have a income to begin with. If the government and private sector can work together and collaborate to drive more innovative growth startups, that can really drive the income growth that the Kishida government needs to redistribute. Welcome back to Boobab Monkeys, Europe. We still have 10 minutes until the start of cash equity trading. Let's get a focus on the stocks we're watching today, Danny Berger joins us on set. We're the breakdown of some of those. And let's start with the luxury sector in Paris, Danny. Yeah, another strong set of results. It was LVMH the week prior. Today, it is amazed. Really strong numbers here. The revenue coming in at a gain of 24 percent. The estimate was for 15 percent. They're citing the benefit of some of those COVID restrictions in China easing in the quarter, which meant returning shoppers to the luxury goods stores stores. Of course, the news today, at least the report out of Bloomberg that China might also be looking at lessening some of those COVID quarantines for travelers. That certainly is also going to help the luxury sector pop a bit today, Anna. Good morning, Danny. Nordea had results. I think it was good news, wasn't it? It was indeed good news and look, lots of it is tied to the fact that interest rates are rising. They booked a solid net interest income that was more than expected. And look, they're going to need that boost from lending, from net interest income, because they are seeing, or at least they missed when it came to things like fee income because of the volatility in capital markets. For what it's worth, Nordea also said that they're 2022, the rest of this year outlook has improved because they've been able to cut down on costs. Okay. And then let's go to the Swiss Swedish industrial business. It's a ABB. The industrial giant also reporting strong earnings and good news for the entirety of the supply chain. They attributed their brightening outlook to using supply chains. They said that they'll reach their 2023 profitability goal ahead of schedule, about a year ahead of schedule. Also still able to pass on those higher cost to consumers. The question, of course, is how long can they do that? We've also been waiting to see whether or not ABB would IPO their electric car charging business. They still plan to do so, but no longer will it be this year? Again, it's just the volatility of markets makes that less appealing. Okay. Danny, thanks very much. We're in both Sandy Berger with a breakdown of some of the stocks we're watching. Sorry, we haven't managed to get back to our colleague to talk about Tesla, but he was going to tell us about disappointment surrounding the deliveries. He was also going to talk to us about Elon Musk's take on China Mark that it's in recession of sorts due to property and that he is perhaps overpaying for Twitter. Anyway, that's the Tesla story. No doubt that'll be front and center as we move into the US session. As we move towards the European session, I note that European bond market selling off and yields going higher, a continuation of a recent theme, I guess. Yeah, very much so. There's going to follow on to what we're seeing in the US yesterday. I think there's that extra concern around the European bond market given the Italy story. What the UK has put back in the radar is that for the first time in whatever, 25 years, Economic Renewable a lawn in acak e чуд który in Sri Lanka is firmly strong,liche, participatory for revenue.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4802,2022-10-20 06:55:00
16457," I think there's that extra concern around the European bond market, given the Italy story. This, what the UK has put back in the radar is that for the first time in whatever, 25 years, bond vigilantes are live and well again. They've returned from the dead. And that's what the UK story has emphasized, and people are going, where will be next in target line for the bond vigilantes. Italy is the obvious candidate. For about the last 12 years, we've been worried about Italy's debt sustainability intermittently. It was during the Eurozone crisis again a few years ago, very Italian-centric story. It is back in focus for next week. So I think that's kind of going into next week. This kind of up-per-pressure yields as a global story, but I think there's particular concern around Italy. And our colleague, I like the way you say for Jelante, the slight Italian twang there, as well, Mark, very authentic, and perhaps leading the news. One of our colleague, our colleague, Valerie, pointing out that we had German PPI as well, and perhaps that's also part of what's pressuring the yield story. Closer to where you are though, Mark, we've had some interesting news developments around China. We started the programme talking about that. In the rush to cover the UK politics, perhaps we'll lose sight of that. But important to remember what we're seeing in China, then, even if it's just changes at the margin around Covid. Yes, I think this could be and use that phrase earlier on at the thin end of the wedge here, about a change in policy. And I think it's the context that comes in. It comes in complete capitulation in local markets. So maybe there's a chance for a change in narrative. All that said, Chinese stocks are about to close now, back negative, they're closing, five minutes' time. And they're negative. Hong Kong stocks have another hour of trading. But the HSI has down 1.7 percent. It's at the lowest levels in 2009. This is not a market that is particularly convinced yet that this is a change. Not convinced yet on the change. Just watching the dollar and what's going on in FX, of course, we're alert to any intervention by the Japanese, or 1495. And we move towards a focus on Japan next week. Yes, so, Bill J. Krupp next Friday, I think it's a really, really exciting one. I mean, the base cases that they won't change policy, but I think the risks of them changing policy are higher than many people think. So I'll be absolutely glued to that next week. It is interesting. People are watching Dolly and so careful at the moment. It's not moving. It's like watching paint dry. I think everyone thinks that when 50 goes, that might be the trigger for the MOF to come in. Remember, is the MOF who decides on intervention? Is the BOJ that executes? So you can refer to either one. OK, and it's very close to 150 right now. 149 at 93. So that explains why we're watching that particular pot of paint. As it dries, Mark, thank you very much for spending the past hour with us. The open is up next. Features have been pointing lower, perhaps a bit of our performance, relatively coming through in France. We'll brace for that. The weather in London looking as opaque as the politics right now. Complex and on the edge. This is Blaineberg. 5. 5. 6. 6. 5. 6. 5. 6. 6. 5. 6. 6. 6. 6. 6. 6. 7. 6. 6. 6. 8. 7. 7. 8. 6. 7. I'm going to be a little bit more patient.

We've actually been really deep into crypto, deep into learning about blockchain, and all of the new businesses. I would characterize this as crypto learners.

I think it has the potential to be completely game changing, but it is still such the wild west. And so it means they have a Bloomberg, a single Bloomberg, they have been an insane it. It means they have a Bloomberg. Welcome to the European market open every one a minute to go into the start of cash equity trading on froncing lack what in London with Tom McKin. And here are your top stories. Trust on the break. The Prime Minister fires her home secretary just days after ousting her Chancellor as members of her Conservative Party begin to revolt. This evaporates China debates a cut to quarantine rules, but stocks drop as inflation and growth risks continue to swell. Plus out of power Tesla slides post market as delivery and supply bottlenecks hit third quarter results, but it will mask promises an epic year end. Tom, let's look at the futures. I want to of course talk extensively not only about the economy's cover, that's definitely a forefront of our mind and the political turmoil here in the UK, but we need to talk about Jim Bullard and of course that interview that he gave to Kathleen Hayes, DAX futures, FTSE futures down between one tenth and four tenths of April. Yeah, it was a bit of a dovish flavor to that interview Jim Bullard suggesting that maybe there's going to be a pause in 2023. The markets, of course, expecting another jump by hike from the Federal Reserve in November, early November, the first to the second. 75 basis points is the expectation. But James Bullard telling our Kathleen Hayes that maybe 2023 is when they start to take a pause and recalibrate depending of course on how the economic data comes through. The markets here in Europe looking at potentially a second straight day of losses, then Spanish Ibex down a tenth of a percent, FTSE 100 down a tenth of a percent. You saw losses stateside of between around six tenths to around eight tenths of percent for the S&P versus the Nasdaq so closing in the red again. Some earnings coming through, solid Tesla, a disappointment there, but it is a concerns about the growth trajectory and just how far these central banks have to go that continues away on these markets. The Spanish Ibex is flat. Let's switch it over and see how things are shaping up as we look to the future stateside, but also, of course, the pound in focus given the political chaos that continues here in the UK. Future stateside pointing to further losses then of two tenths of eight percent. The pound is at one twelve. That's again, of a tenth of eight percent will break down that story for you around the political chaos and whether it's becoming endemic now within the body politic of the UK. So, I've bought 15 currently. That's a move of just two basis points higher for the ten year and ION or 89, 228, 2.28 percent lower. The context is on this longest route now, ION or since 2021, demand, of course, and the property sector out in China is playing into the softness that you're seeing in ION or that continues down at 2.3 percent this morning, friends. I have to say the politics in the UK, absolutely crazy. I mean, these are also in peace from their own party. It's actually, if you think about it with friends like that, who needs enemies. I'm looking at stocks overall and industry groups, energy banks, auto parts a little bit on the upside, energy the biggest gain or one and a half percent higher. And then you have real estate telecom financial services on the way down six tenths of eight percent lower. It's all about inflation. And again, what will the Fed do? What will all out of these central banks do? Let's get over to our Bloomberg, M life managing enter. He's Mark Cudmore and Mark today. You're actually looking at China. Yes, good morning, Francine. Hong Kong stocks. I'm going to focus on my worst call of 2020.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4804,2022-10-20 07:03:44
16459," On mark today, you're actually looking at China. Yes, good morning, Francine. It's actually Hong Kong stocks. I want to focus on my worst call of 2022, which is around this point here. I said that Hong Kong stocks were one way to play a bullish take. As you know, I've been pretty bearish all year on kind of global risk assets. I thought yields are going to go much higher, stronger dollar, but I thought the one market that might outperform was Hong Kong stocks, because at this point, could they fall much further? Well, yes, they can. They fell another 20%. That was really one of the worst calls ever. I'm revisiting it because this is a bit embarrassing, given how wrong I've been, but I'm again, I reiterate, can they much, fall much further from here? Let me show you another chart, which is valuations. They're at the lowest level, by the way, since 2009, but let me show you the valuation chart, which is the Hong Kong on a P basis. This is the lowest ever valuation going back to the full history back to 993 of our data there. 6.1 P. Now, we get really excited when the S&P 500 is around 15 P. This is incredibly discounted, but of course, it's been incredibly discounted for a couple of years, and it keeps on falling lower and lower. It's way down again today. Now, let me, this is a backward looking piece. Let me show you one other valuation chart, which is a blended forward 12 months P. This is now at a very discounted level, but it's not at multi-year lows. Now, that's an important disclaimer here. It's not even at the pandemic lows, so that's back in 2020. It was lower when that kind of flash crashed back in February. We were much lower in 2008. So this is kind of saying, hey, maybe it's not overly stretched yet, maybe I could go a little bit further, but certainly, this is a level where it's never sustained down here for long. So at the risk of repeating my worst error of 2022, I think this market has just fallen too far, too fast, and I think it can't be performed for the next year, and I'm going to look really, really sheepish when I'm having the same conversation in six months time and it's 20% lower again. I love it, Mark. I'm picking and unpacking your worst call. As you characterize it for 2022, we'll see how that plays out. The HSI currently in the session down 1.7% mark, cod mor, of course, are managing editor for Mlive. Let's check in on the guilt markets then, selling pressure across UK debt this morning as we weigh up further. It's hard to say, isn't it further? Further, it just gets worse. The political chaos here in the UK, but the selling pressure across Kills, you're seeing at the two year, 355, that's a move higher in terms of deals by four basis points. The 10 year yields up eight basis points, and the 30 year you're seeing a move higher by seven basis points currently at 4.06 for the longer dated UK debt. It has been then a day, an evening really of political turmoil in the UK with Liz Trass' Premiership looking close to imploding. A Prime Minister's question's opposition Labour Party leader, Keir Starmer, laid out a list of government new turns. Two year energy freeze, gone. Tax free shopping gone. Economic trekkability gone. And her supposed best friend, the former Chancellor, he's gone as well. OK, let's bring in Blueburg's Lizzy. Birdon, Lizzy guilt selling off. Where does all of this, the political chaos, where does it leave the Prime Minister? Well, Tom, there's huge pressure on Liz Trass to quit. Until yesterday, the consensus seemed to have been that they'd at least let her cling on until the Halloween budget. Apart from the weather, it very much feels like that morning when Boris Johnson woke up and realised he needed to write his resignation speech. The question is whether Liz Trass has the self-awareness to do the same, because throughout the day yesterday, she added to Keir Starmer's list of what has gone from her Premiership. Gone is yet another holder of one of the great offices of state-sweller-Bravaman. Gone is her economic strategy, leaving her only connection now to her core vote as Brexit. But in her cabinet, the replacement for a Brawman is someone who voted for Maine, who voted for Rishi Sunak to be the leader. And Gone as well is the party's dignity. Backbench and Tory MPs last night were livid, frankly, because of the chaos that ensued on the vote on fracking last night. There were allegations that an MP was manhandled by two senior ministers, although he and they denied it. So Liz Trass is desperate. It seems that she's doomed. And if she goes today, she would be Britain's shortest serving Prime Minister.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4805,2022-10-20 07:08:11
16460," So Liz Truss is desperate. It seems that she's doomed. And if she goes today, she would be Britain's shortest serving Prime Minister. Lizzie, thank you so much. Lizzie is burdened there with... Actually, I don't know where there are so many leaves out there. Tom, I've never seen Downing Street like that before. Maybe someone ready on strike. The rain is coming down. The clock is ticking arguably on the Prime Minister. I think the key question is, to what extent is this now endemic, this political rupture and disconnect we're seeing in the UK? Is it short-lived, can they address it? Or is this now structurally baked in to the body politic of the UK? I mean, I don't know how it can be short-lived. I mean, something at some point has to give. I guess we're comparing it more and more like it to these. So I think I'm like now the political authority and all things UK. Let's bring in Bloomberg, Christina Kino and global market strategy at JPMorgan asset management, Hugh Gimber. Thank you both for joining us. It does feel like, you know, amongst other political turmoil, which frankly is pretty, you know, crazy to watch, because we feel that the Prime Minister is safe and then something happens as big as it did yesterday. The market seemed to look through it and go back to the basics of how the BLE fights inflation. I do. I mean, the big story for the market yesterday was that inflation print yesterday morning. I think it offers a reminder of the context really before all of this political chaos started to take place. In that inflation is running off, there's massive pressure on the Bank of England. I think if anything, what's changed over the past 24 hours, is markets looking ahead to that 31st of October date where we are expecting a much more coherent budget plan from the current government. And so if you look at that, you say, we've only got 11 days until that point. The new chancellor was really buying time when he spoke earlier in the week. He was saying, look, we are walking back and I will be coming back to the market with much more information. I think now it looks difficult to see how you could shift a Prime Minister and still commit to that 31st of October date, which is why we're seeing a little bit more volatility in bond yields this morning. Ultimately, the Bank of England is left in a very, very challenging position here on the one hand trying to keep an eye on the bond market and ensure that guilt yields don't spike to aggressively while simultaneously trying to demonstrate that it is credible, tackling inflation. Yes, so uncertainty here around that key date for markets at the end of the month, of course, and spelling out that fiscal plan. And of course, the OBR's role, Christine, I want to bring you in this one. And I want to go back to that question as to whether or not markets need to now start to price in structural political risk here in the UK. Well, so I think we're starting to see signs of that already. One incredible metric that we've seen so far in these crazy markets is the fact that guilt traders are leaving the market in droves. One measure of activity trading in the UK 10 year bonds, for instance, is now at the lowest level since 2020. And so we are seeing that sort of endemic impact here in the markets. And I do note that it has been relatively calm. We haven't seen the gyrations akin to what we saw in the aftermath of the mini budget. Yes, but systemically, we are starting to see the markets kind of shift. And you can understand investors who really don't want to deal with a political chaos. I can't do Italy, as you say, friend. Just holding up your hands and saying, you know what? I think it's time for me to just call it good here. I'm done with the UK guilt market and I'm out. You agree with that? This is what something endemic in UK politics that will last for years to come, or is it just a blip because the government and maybe the Tories have been powered for so long, it's difficult to come up with new ideas. I think the challenge for the market at the moment is that if you're trying to look forward to the potential for an election, you still don't have very much sight as to what the policy of a changing government might imply. And so I think guilt trade is a struggling really to assess the fiscal sustainability of the UK over the next three to five years, regardless of who's in charge. I think visibility on that is still pretty light at the moment. What I would add is I think there is already now a significant amount of risk premium built into UK guilt markets. So yes, we've seen yields decline since the U-turns earlier in the week, but we're still well above where we stood at the start of September. And so for me, you know, I think we can answer that question by saying, look, that is being built in now. And I think that is here to stay. It's going to take a long time for the UK government to regain its credibility with the Obama.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4806,2022-10-20 07:12:29
16461," That question by say, look, that has been built in now. And I think that is here to stay. It's going to take a long time for the UK government to regain its credibility with the bomb market. So that risk premium will stay baked in for some time, Hugh. I just nodded to this in your first answer when you talked about the B.O.E. Is there, what are the risks of a policy mistake from the Bank of England given just how much uncertainty there is on the political front, but again, the dynamics around inflation as well? I think it's high. I think when you look at the challenge to the Bank of England faces, it's really twofold. One is that their inflation problem is getting bigger and bigger. And therefore, they're going to have to step up the start of November and height rates aggressively. I think 75 basis points of that meeting is really now the bare minimum that the market will accept. I think there's a clear risk that they feel actually a hundred basis point move is more appropriate at that point. And then as you move through the subsequent meeting, still, the bar is pretty high now for the Bank of England to send this message that they are serious in getting inflation, not even back to target, but at least heading in the right direction. At the same time, they then have this financial stability concern. We've seen issues with UK pension funds over recent weeks. And so the Bank of England may be saying, yeah, we plan to start guilt sales in early November. I actually think it's going to be very difficult for them to keep going with that. Why does the Bank of England really need to shrink its balance sheet that aggressively? It's really only a story of trying to build up its credibility for the next time it turns to QE. And so I suspect that what we're seeing in the UK is really a model for what we'll see in other countries around the world over the coming months, where rate hikes are the primary tool for fighting inflation. But actually, plans to shrink the balance sheet. Our shrunk back themselves. I think guilt sales are going to be very, very difficult in this environment. OK, very interesting. You don't see QT starting anytime soon. Hugh Gimba stays with us, global market strategist, at JP Morgan, asset management, get views on the Fed, and the rest of these markets as well. And that's a few minutes. And Christina Kino, of course, thank you for walking us through some of the key themes. And of course, how we start to assess this political risk here in the UK. Just briefly checking in on the stocks that are on the move, this one, we have a flurry of earnings, of course. The likes of Ericsson coming through with a miss. You see the stock there down more than 12% on those disappointing earnings. No key, of course, the non-emaker of Telecom equipment down, 4%. Just in the first few minutes, the open Volvo. The truck maker that is down around 4%. I'll just get the top line for you in terms of Volvo's earnings. Operating profit actually rose, lifted by a backlog of what they say truck orders they see demand holding up, nonetheless, investors selling off, potentially, on the back of what's happening in terms of inflation. And that weaker economic outlet, down 4% for Volvo, friends. Now coming up, St. Louis, Fed President, to Jim Bullard season end, to aggressive rate hikes early next year. Our exclusive interview is coming up next and this is Blubert. Why is everybody want to be a consultant? And what are all these consultants doing? Well, David, I think that we actually defy the label consultant because sometimes consultants seem to imply that we only give advice. And when you look at what Accenture does, we're really different than the traditional version of a consultant. We're really about relevance and results. And that's what is driving our business. What about a consulting project? In my example, I'm the CEO, I have a problem, I call you up, I say solve my problem or give me a solution.

And so when you think about how long does it solve things, a lot of it starts with, you know, the company being willing to set aggressive goals.

We'll mark it that over the past few weeks has made it clear it wants to go higher. It got a little spooked by the idea that zero potential rises. We're data dependent and we're watching the data with I think we're predicting, at least the dot plot is predicting that inflation will come down. It will be a disinflationary year in 2023. The meaning does do call for further moves in 2023. So if you take that as the committee sentiment, there could be a decision to move that into 2022 at the December meetings. Now to go say hello to Fed President James Bullard there, he sees an end to the front loading of aggressive hikes by early next year. The Fed has struck a cautious tone in its page book as it noted that the U.S. economy grew modestly with the risk of recession rising. Hugh Gimba, global market strategist, a JP Morgan asset management still with us. Hugh, I'm interested by these Bullard comments as a question and how you look at possibly an entry point for those on the sidelines at this stage. If one of the previous hawks within the FOMC is looking at maybe a pause in 2023, is that an opportunity for those on the sidelines? I think the big change here is that the Fed needs to start to bring growth considerations back into their mandate. At the moment, the message has been very clear throughout 2022, which is frankly, we will do whatever it takes to bring inflation down. And if that means that we weaken the economy, then so be it. If anything, they want a week in the economy in order to try and get inflation under control. So at this stage, you look at the Fed and think what data really matters to them? Well, it's headline inflation. That is the print they want to get inflation down. And aside from that, they don't worry about weakening the labor market. They don't worry about slowing down activity. As we move into Q1 next year, I think that should start to change. Provided that the Fed is seeing enough encouragement that inflation is trending lower, still no end near target, but at least going from sort of 9 to 8 to 7 rather than the 7 to 8 to 9 world that we've been in over the past few months, that I think should give the Fed enough confidence to pausing Q1. And that's where markets can start to look at the terminal rate and say, right, I now feel more comfortable about where the Fed is going to stop until you know that. It's very difficult to price for his asset. So I think that kind of growth consideration is what we need back on the table to get the terminal rate right and then start to think about risk assets looking more attractive. So Hugh, first of all, would this be a hawkish policy error by the Fed because it's unwarranted or actually is inflation the worst thing in the world if it's out of control on so central banks, it's better that they're hawkish now and then deal with consequences later. And what does it mean for your exposure to stocks? Yes, so the politics of inflation this year has clearly been really difficult for the Fed. We've been in a world where the message has been people are living paycheck to paycheck, therefore we have to bring inflation down. I think the politics of inflation will change next year because if we do start to see not only...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4808,2022-10-20 07:21:01
16463," to be in people are living paycheck to paycheck, therefore we have to bring inflation down. I think the politics of inflation will change next year, because if we do start to see not only average outly, earning slowing, but rather the unemployment rate going up, then you start to talk not about living paycheck to paycheck, but rather, actually, those paycheck starting to disappear for some people. And therefore, I think the Fed's view on inflation next year will look quite different to the one this year, where they've said, we've added over three and a half million jobs to the economy. Therefore, we can keep hiking without really seeing any consequences of what we've done so far. In terms of the stock market, I think the market now is looking at 2023 and baking some form of mild downturn into the price. You look at how markets have moved well in anticipation of earnings down grades already. The key is that inflation number coming down, because if inflation is coming down, 5% for the Fed looks to be roughly about the right figure, and then you can start to say, right, I have a clear picture. If inflation doesn't moderate, the Fed's going to have to go through 5%. And you're looking at a much sharper downturn, both the economy, but then also for earnings as well. Here, thank you so much. Hugh Gimber, there are huge calls from him, global market strategist, JP Morgan, asset management. Now, coming up, Musk promises an epic end to the year, despite Tesla sales falling short of Wall Street estimates, but we'll have plenty more on that story next. This is Bloomberg. Thinks the public space for all, like $30,000 or something new, China's military power has been growing at an incredible speed over the last 20 years. A strong country must have a strong military, as only then can it guarantee the security of the nation. In terms of sphere of influence, we absolutely know that China wants to be dominant in Asia, so there is a target to get to that point, to be a military that is appear to the greatest militaries in the world by 2035. The competition for influence is a global one, and through a multi-decade trajectory fueled by planning, money, and pragmatism, China is building a military that allows it to shape the 21st century just as the US shaped the 20th.

Let's get back to the end.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4809,2022-10-20 07:25:20
16464," And the global bond market sell-off is back guilt as well, selling off quite strongly an eight basis point move higher in the two year and a seven basis point move higher on the 30 year. Let's get back to the earning story, though, Tesla, reporting sales that fell short of Wall Street estimates citing delivery and production bottlenecks and Prompt and Elon Musk to assure investors that demand for his company's cars remains strong. As I've actually ran, we're looking forward to a record breaking Q4. So it really, you know, not on word. It looks, looks like we'll have an epic end of year. We're joining a sales Bloomberg's global auto-z editor Craig Trudeau. Craig, I mean, Elon Musk is never dull. No matter what you say, it's just like always entertaining. So you must have a lot of fun in your job, even if you probably don't see very much. I mean, what do we learn about the sales miss and what he's going to do about it? Well, you heard that that was for the beginning of the call that he, you know, floated this idea of an epic end to the year and that's very characteristic of him where, you know, these calls often start with how great things are and emphasis on that. I think what you heard as the call went on and also, you know, when you looked at the numbers was, you know, revenue a little bit short of expectations. There were some hope that even if they missed on deliveries, which we know they did it as of a few weeks ago, that perhaps with pricing being strong, that revenue, you know, would actually be, you know, perhaps coming better than estimates. And instead, we saw it come in a bit low. And I think you also heard, you know, some caveats after that initial optimism on the call about, you know, we, yes, we do expect to see deliveries grow a continue to grow by 50% a year, but there are some things outside of our control. We'll be a little bit shorter that this year. So there was enough there for the bears to maybe sort of, you know, kind of do a little bit of a victory lap despite the fact that this is a company that is still growing quite a bit. Yeah, he also talked about the recessionary like environment in China as well. The stock down about 40% year to date, an attractive opening may be for some buybacks. Is that something that they could look to? That's one of the interesting things on the call was Elon, you know, we just talked about how you sort of never know what the guy is going to say. He, you know, alluded to the fact that yes, the board has not really decided this. We're kicking around, but maybe we'll buy back five to 10 billion share worth of shares. So it is definitely something that he's entertained more recently. I think he floated it during the annual meeting that maybe it was a possibility. And you've, you've started to hear some of the shareholders who've been a little bit frustrated by the performance of the stock recently. Maybe call for that as a perhaps a way to, you know, bring it back up. Okay, Craig, so you're always excellent on these Tesla results after hours at the stock down about six percent, disappointing set of numbers from Tesla. Coming up, many UK conservative lawmakers are reported to now want Prime Minister Liz Truss to resign immediately, leaving her leadership hanging by a thread. We bring you the latest. This is Brindal. So as you look back on your career, what would you say is the best investment advice you've ever received? Probably the best investment advice that I never received. I've lived my whole life around.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4810,2022-10-20 07:29:52
16465," Is the best investment advice you've ever received? Probably the best investment advice that I never received, but that I've lived my whole life around, is surround yourself with really good people. I thought about it just today, like I do many times, you know, what makes a great investor? A great investment firm is comprised of people who are optimists and pessimists and realists. Because in the intersection of the debates that go across that wide range of personalities is where you find truth. It's part of the reason I'm so focused on freedom of expression. I see it my own four walls, the robust and fulsome debates around how we commit our capital, what defines a good idea, what businesses to build or pursue. That's what drives the success at Citadel. And I've been very fortunate in life to have always had a group of friends who really push me, who make me better. And here, I get to work with three and a half thousand colleagues who, in their ways, make me better each and every day and collectively, as a team, we've had the opportunity to have an incredible impact on the financial landscape around the world. This is really a reminder, isn't it, just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see some pressure on the U.A. and we did see some pressure on the futures. That is now being reversed. Welcome back to the Open. Everyone 30 minutes into the European trading day. And here are your top stories. Trusts on the break, the Prime Minister fires her home secretary just days after asking her chancellor as members of her Conservative party begin to revolt. Risk evaporates. China debates at cops to quarantine rules, but stocks drop as inflation and growth risks continue to swirl. Plus, profit miss, the Eric Sen shares drop the most in smudge after the Swedish companies adjusted operating profit misses estimates. So, Tom, if you look at the markets, stocks are sleeping yields elevated. Yeah, indeed, James Bullard, of course, selling Bloomberg that he sees potentially a pause to these jumbo hikes in the early part of 2023. You have to assess the data. So, ugly bit of a dovish tilt there from someone who's known to be a hawk on the FOMC, but nonetheless, you are seeing these losses across European markets shaking up, at least at this stage for a second day of red on the screen when it comes to the equity markets. And bonds also selling off in a pretty pronounced way as well, across the US, but also the Eurozone and here in the UK. The benchmark is currently down 3.10% over in Germany. The DAX is off by 87 points. That's a loss of 7.10% of a percent. The FTSE 100 down just 10th of a percent per basic resources. And we'll have a look at this in more detail. One of the biggest hits in terms of the sector's IONOR is part of that mix. Let's switch it over. That demand question around China, the property market slump. Elon Musk, not TASC, interestingly saying, that there were recessionary-like conditions now in China. And IONOR is in its biggest slump since 2021. The last time I checked that down below $90 a ton for IONOR. Energy is currently at the top of the list, gaining 1.2% real estate also, just a bat in positive territory, banks, a range ban. Every other sector, though, in the red, led by telecoms. And as I say, basic resources down 8.10% of a percent. A couple of individual corporates to bring to your attention earnings season, of course, and a mixed picture here. So misses for the likes of Ericsson and Nokia. What a drop there for Ericsson, a telecom equipment maker currently down 13% on the back of the miss on those third quarter earnings. Volvo trucks came in with profits above the previous quarter. But in terms of the estimates, it was a miss. They still see strong demand for their trucks despite the economic conditions, of course, deteriorating. Down 3.7% for that company. Pernor Rika, talking about a share, buy back. It was a beat for this company, post-pandemic upside, range bound for that company. The drinks made it, of course. And Nokia alongside Ericsson, it was a miss there. Down 5% for that telecom equipment maker, as well, Francine. Tom, let's return.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4811,2022-10-20 07:34:05
16466," company the drinks maker of course and okay alongside Erickson it was a miss there down 5% for that telecom equipment maker as well Francine. Tom let's return to the chaotic world of UK politics. It's been a day and an evening of political turmoil in Westminster with Liz Truss' premiership looking close to imploding while it's now bringing Dean Turner, his chief eurozone and UK economist at UBS. Dean do the markets? Does the economy change depending on whose prime minister at this point or it's anyways the chancellor that calls the shots? I think what the market's the most focused on is the outlook for fiscal policy for the time being so stability at in number 10 whilst it would be welcome. I think you know the key thing to watch at the moment is the policy decisions coming from the treasury. We're all waiting now for this next fiscal event due to take place on the 31st of October we'll see if that that actually happens or not given these times of uncertainty but for me you know that's going to be the key thing to watch from here. Dean how are you thinking about the inflationary dynamics here in the UK? CPI of course coming back to a four-decade high yesterday but then of course weighing that up against the announcement that the energy support is going to be reduced potentially after April. Where does that leave your forecast around the UK inflation? Next month or two October I mean on paper October should be the peak but obviously we are seeing other dynamics and the inflation basket it's notable that food prices are on an upward march again yesterday so there could be some little variances around that. I would still be expecting that inflation starts to head down as we as we moving to the early months of next year but you're absolutely right when it comes to the April and beyond the revisions to the energy price cap probably do put a little bit of upside pressure on inflation. I don't think it takes away from the general narrative that we should be seeing inflation heading down next year but perhaps if we were to see that bills do rise because gas prices are elevated at that point then it probably makes inflation a little bit stickier next year which again poses another problem for the Bank of England. Dean what happens with the Bank of England next? Do they how aggressive do they need to be for the next three actually central bank you know NPCs to get inflation under control or they just lost the spiral now? I think it's taken it too far to say that they've lost the spiral here. I would expect that the bank do a hike that's you know large in the last hike as has been indicated it's the conditions warrant a larger than normal hike. I'm still looking for a 75 basis point hike in November and probably another 75 basis points in December then I would expect the pace comes down a little bit we can probably move to slow slow moves perhaps 25 basis points but you know I'd still think that the peak rate for the bank bank rate is closer to four and a half percent which is still some way below what the market's surprising and I think the reason for that is because by the time we get into the early months of next year it will be quite apparent the the slowdown that's currently taking place in the UK economy is well underway and that's you know that's going to pose another dynamic for the bank. Okay so you think markets a little ahead of their skis or over their skis in terms of market pricing around the terminal rate here at the B.O.E. where does that leave the pounds then Dean currently at 1.12 further pressure on sterling then? I think in the short term it's going to be more about the dollar I mean obviously look none of us can predict what's going to happen within the next 12 hours 48 hours you know next week or so in UK politics so you know trying to predict sterling it's the short term losing sterling I think is going to be very challenging but kind of taking a step back from the noise I think you know the narrative as we're going through the closing months of this year especially because we are going to be seeing that both the UK and Eurozone economic growth is slowing quite sharply is still going to be supportive for the dollar so yeah on paper we have four classes that we can see sterling trading around you know the one 10 level against the US dollar through the through the first quarter of next year we should see some recovery thereafter but you know really that's going to be a story about the dollar around you",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4812,2022-10-20 07:38:21
16467," the one's hand level against the US dollar through the first quarter of next year. We should see some recovery thereafter, but really that's going to be a story about the dollar rather than the pound. Dean, there are so many parallels between the UK and Italy, so I need to ask about Italy as well. So we have a Prime Minister in waiting, George Aminoni, who had to rebuke Sivirbet Rusko, and he's saying that it's actually Zelensky's fault that Russia invaded. What does that mean for BTPs? What does it mean for this coalition? Well, look, I think we've found the market perspective. I think all of us have been somewhat surprised at how stable spreads have been on BTPs. Look, a lot of that is with regards to the TPI instrument. I think the ECB seems to have brought a lot of credibility with that. As in terms of what it means for forming the next government, look, it's been our expectation that forming this government wouldn't be as easy as many expected. Our once-election result was announced. It's likely that we're in for a few more weeks of volatility there. But I think the key thing is that investors are focusing on is much more looking at the budget, and the fiscal position. And whatever happens domestically with a political backdrop, our sense is that you're not going to see much of a deviation from the budget plan that's been agreed or held laid out by the previous Prime Minister, Mr. Draghi. So, I think markets can take some reassurance from that. And as long as we don't see any deviation from that, then I wouldn't expect to see that we see many big moves in the BTP. Well, I mean, that's a lot of as long as. Thank you so much, Dean Turner, Chief Juror's Zone and UK economist at UBS joining us this morning. Now, coming up, you leaders gather in Brussels on the agenda, sanctions on Iran, protections against energy sabotage. We'll get the latest life in Brussels. Next, this is Bloomberg. Thank you. How much of a push have he seen from the Qashira government in terms of green funding? The Qashira administration has committed to doubling the amount of investments in so-called green technologies. I think we need more than just pronouncements. We need real money backing, very innovative startups and innovative companies in this space. What do you make of Qashira's new capitalism? Well, I think he is framework is reflective of the challenges that Japan's society is facing, namely, that growth has been present, but growth has not been, of course, evenly distributed. But frankly speaking, it's hard to register the income if you don't have a income to begin with. If the government and private sector can work together and collaborate to drive more innovative growth startups, that can really drive the income growth that the Qashira government needs to redistribute. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. Because Trussonomics is being dismantled, MPs behind the scenes are asking what's the point of having her at the top? In the strong dollar, amplified world's risks of instability. She didn't think that complete reunification must be realized. With unmatched reach in resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. The world's largest market has come down in Europe from the financial centers of the world. Bloomberg markets European flows with Guy Johnson and London and Alex Diel in New York. Real-time numbers, real-time analysis.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4813,2022-10-20 07:42:36
16468," Setters of the world, Bloomberg markets European foes with Guy Johnson in London and Alex Diel in New York, real time numbers, real time analysis, weekdays. We'll talk about energy crisis in Europe in a second, but we have some breaking news, yet weakening through $150 per dollar for the first time since 1990. Remember, $150 is a very big psychological support level. We did hear more and more hedge funds market participants at traders saying that there is going to be some kind of intervention. Now that speculation is certainly not helping with the BOJ ones to do, and you've seen it follow through in the markets within weakening through $150 per dollar for the first time since 1990. Again, that is the line, of course, where many expect some kind of intervention. It's currently $149.92. So back flirting with those $150 levels. And of course, this, and you can draw the linkages to what's happening in terms of the bond market, it's the sell-off and yields up across the treasury curve as well. In terms of your benchmark, 10 year 417, that's a move higher by 8 basis points. Here in the UK as well, more pronounced in terms of the sell-off 11 basis point move at the front. But it's the linkages, of course, between the Fed and the BOJ and that divergence that continue to put pressure on policymakers in Japan. Are seeing our inflation, though how entrenched it becomes, of course, is going to be a question going forward. Still, a big gap to an inflation dynamics in Japan and many other parts of the rest of the world. Talking inflation, European leaders gather in Brussels this morning for a highly anticipated summit dominated by energy and the war in Ukraine. The meeting comes after the head of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, unveiled a sweeping plan to bring down energy prices. To do a brief on all of this, we, of course, bring in our Europe correspondent, Maria Tudau. Maria, there's been a plan of action, of course. Are you getting the sense from your sources that there's actually the political will, the consensus to lock it in and implement it? What a question, Tom. But yes, that is fundamentally the issue today. There has been now a roadmap laid out very clearly by the head of the Commission. Remember the criticism two weeks ago is that there were too many ideas floating around. Now we know that on paper, they will talk about this dynamic price cap, the joint purchase, the circuit breaker. And of course, all of this coming together with the gold to bring down energy bills, but the Commission, they just lay out the executive action. Decisions come down to European leaders. And these are 27 countries that have to agree on a message. Now I am being told today that we are far from consensus. The sticking points remain. Remember when you talk about a price cap, this is something that really concerns and scares the Germans because they worry about the implications that it would have on supply and the flip side. You have now 17 countries that say, we need a cap, whatever way it is. We need something out of this meeting. So I'm being told this is going to get thorny at times. It will be a long summit. I was told by the way, we will bring a lot of coffee because you will need it tonight. But come tomorrow, the markets will want to see something. So the pressure is definitely on today. Yeah, talking about coffee, it's 22 percent more expensive than it was last year. But leaders, never mind. Yeah, leaders discussing the fallout of the war more broadly. So how unwavering is the support for Ukraine? It was pretty shocking or unusual for Soviet-Berlisco to go into defensive Russia. Yes, Francine, you nailed this because this is the other big topic happening today in Brussels. Now there is a recording, of course, that was leaked by Berlusconi. This was a private conversation in which he says, essentially, that it was Ukraine, a president of Zelensky, that in some ways pushed Vladimir Putin into the special operation. That is the kind of language that Vladimir Putin uses himself. The issue here, of course, is that European leaders want to stick with this narrative that this is almost a battle between autocracy and democracy. That's the way the head of the commission, Vonder Lining herself, has framed this. He says the European Union is in it for the long haul here. But precisely because of that, you have to keep public opinion on your site. And that's the reason why you have to get the energy response. But then, of course, you have the political story here. And this is, well, important, the Italian government, the third biggest economy in the euro area. This is a government that is in the meagre.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4814,2022-10-20 07:47:04
16469," government. The third biggest economy in the U.S. area, this is a government that is in the making. This complicates things for George Amelani, who by the way yesterday had a very clear warning to Berlusconi seeing if you don't agree that Italy belongs in the EU and NATO, you're not going to be part of my government. Is that simple? And that takes me to another question, Francine. Is it time we stop comparing the UK and Italy I wonder, though, this morning? Because to me, one should be more shaky than the other. I mean, that's also fair. I think they're looking at the median average of lost ten years, but there are a lot of people. I wish we had the economist, Frank Gouverneur, because it basically talks about Britishie and you see it more, you know, the UK becoming more and more chaotic, like Italian politics, has been over lost ten years. Tom. Yeah, I love that. I mean, how do I weigh in here? You're the expert on Italy. But yeah, look, this is, I think this is a question, is this becoming structural now in the UK, to break down in politics? Because the Tory party is not just one party. It's a division to run two, three different factions, right? And then the Labour party, they've papered over some of their divisions, but for how long. And so the question remains as to just how structural this is, and arguably a lot of this links back to Brexit. I mean, I just wanted the chance to talk about how I am pizza. But, Samaria, today, thank you so much, Maria, today in Brussels for us. Now, the former Italian Prime Minister Sylvia Berlusconi has blamed the Ukrainian president Vladimir Zelensky for pushing Russia into an endless war. That's according to audio obtained by an Italian newswire. Now, it comes as Italy is presumed next Premier. George Ameloni attempted to distance herself from Berlusconi, pledging to maintain support for Italy, for Ukraine. Now, for more, let's turn to Bloomberg's. Roombiore chief, Alessandro Spicciallis, Alessandro, first of all, we still have a Prime Minister in waiting in Italy with George Ameloni. Will she actually become Prime Minister? Yes, yes, I think, I mean, the outcome of the elections were clear. But what is at stake now is whether this process will be delayed. I mean, it could be delayed very simply because President Matarella, who hence the cards when he comes to forming the new government, will ask for Meronia and Erolyce to sort of clarify their own positions and sort of make up their mind over Italy wants to stand internationally. And of course, you won't be easy. You won't tolerate any departure from Italy's international commitments to the EU and NATO. But what is even more complicated for Meronia potentially is that it's time candidates, for example, Antonio Tayanita, former European Parliament president, who was counted in the Italian media to become foreign minister, is from Fort Saitalia, is from Berlusconi's party. Can it be foreign minister after the thing that is both said, but if they have to reopen that, well, it's the whole kind of warms and it's back to the drawing table for Melonis Coalition and for Melonis Cabinet. Could that be? Yeah, that's really fascinating, isn't it? And it seems to be that this is the long term play by Putin is betting on divisions within Europe. You're seeing it in Hungary. Of course, the foreign national over in France, they are by no means a dead political force. And then of course, Melonis controversy over Berlusconi, this plays into Putin's hands. How do you expect it to play out, though, within the politics of Italy? Well, Melonis made it clear that she doesn't want Italy to become, again, Europe's soft underbelly. We know Italy's long-standing ties to Russia. It had the biggest communist party in Western Europe. It had Berlusconi, Tessalini, with and about Putin admirer. But the question is now, will she be able to deliver it with her own cabinet? It's not so clear right now. President Matrila starts talking to parties. Melonis could be tasked to form a new government as early as tomorrow afternoon, but we'll see what kind of government it will be. It's still very, very fluid here in Rome. Okay, Bloomberg's Rome bureau chief, Alessandro Speciali, on the attempts there to form a government so far, not successful. And of course, the controversy around Berlusconi's comments on Zelensky and Russia. Thank you. Coming up, Chinese officials, well, they are debating whether to relax some of the country's strict COVID-19 measures. We're going to get the details what it may mean for the world's second largest economy after the break. Stay with us. This is Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4815,2022-10-20 07:51:25

Soaring energy prices and a short supply of key chemicals that produce synthetic fertilizers are sending peak, cow and horsemen your prices soaring. Even human waste is in demand as farmers hunt for alternatives. Fertilizer helps increase crop yields. You can see how much moisture is held into this. It's a lot of organic material into the compost that breaks down the manure and the straw breaks down into a friable mix that can be mixed into your soil in the ground and for growing a whole range of different vegetables. The nutrients in, the water in, really increases the kind of bio-dynamic profile of the soil. The recent price spike could mean more farmers going organic for the long term. Everything you need to get set for the start of U.S. trading. Bloomberg, the open with Jonathan Terrell. Filling down in the numbers and preparing you as only Bloomberg can. Weekdays on Bloomberg. Welcome back to the open everyone. We are 15 minutes in the European trading day. We're seeing a bit of pressure when it comes to equities but currently on the move also yend, weakening through $150 for the first time since 1990. Again, this is a psychological level. We've been watching for a, we slowly saw it weakening. Does it mean that we're going to see interventions? Certainly a lot of speculation around it. For the moment, officials have been holding the line. Uncheduled bond buying from the BOJ early in the day after that year curve control was challenged. You saw rates taking up of course the markets are betting. They're going to have to walk away from this so far. They are in lockstep. This is the BOJ and the government on holding the line. But of course the question is for how long? 149.82 on the end. Let's get over to what's happening in China now. Bloomberg has learned that China is considering whether to reduce the amount of time in bound travelers must spend in mandatory quarantine this as the country's COVID-0 policy leaves it increasingly isolated from the rest of the world. Join us now is greater China executive editor John Leal. John, this is a Bloomberg scoop from you and the team over in Beijing. What are the details? What do we know about how the officials and Beijing are thinking about potentially relaxing some of these measures? So right now the isolation rules for travelers coming in from overseas is 10 days, 7 days in hotel quarantine, 3 days at home if you have a residence here in China. The sort of bureaucrats and the government are debating whether they should cut that back to 7. Two days in a hotel, 5 days at home doing health monitoring as they call it. That though is probably more important symbolically than it is practically. Those 5 days of monitoring if you do not have a residence here in China, you would have to do all 5 in a hotel.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4816,2022-10-20 07:55:52
16471," Symbolically, then it is practically those five days of monitoring. If you do not have a residence here in China, you would have to do all five in a hotel. So four in travelers coming in from the UK or the US, you would have to do seven days and 14 still. So John, how would you feel game change? Drone, good morning. Is this actually for the economy at the same time? We're also hearing about potential shifts on the border with airlines, right? Planting more international flights from later this month. I think the Chinese government, if anything, is known for gradualism. So step-by-step changes, they are not known for doing big bang openings. And we don't expect that to happen. But if this is going to start step-by-step, the quarantines are going to get rolled back. More flights will be connected to cities around the world. Then I think you will see a trajectory of the country and the economy slowly starting to open. And if that does happen, I think you will see a bounce in the markets just because of sentiment, expectations for an improvement in the outlook of the economy. Yeah, that incremental cautious approach, John. Another story that you and the team broke for us was this huddle of a senior or at least leading chip makers with officials in Beijing, is everyone tries to get up to speed on the ramifications of these restrictions from the U.S. What do we know about what officials were concerned about? So what we know is that the Ministry of Information Technology, called in some of China's biggest, most prominent chip makers to discuss how they're going to be affected by the Biden administration's latest restrictions on what technologies Chinese companies can buy. And what we understand is that many of those chip makers are saying those actions are going to have a significant impact on what chips they can produce and what they can look to develop into the future. Obviously, the regulator here is looking at what it can do to support the local industry, but so far have more questions and answers. One thing the regulators are saying, though, is that because China is such a big market for chips, the world's biggest indeed, that that is something they can fall back on. John, thank you so much our greater China executive editor, John Lu. In the meantime, European stocks, U.S. equity futures contract, also following rising bond yields, investors now concerned that strong inflation and hawkish monetary policy will really slow the global economy.

Now first thing is first let's check it on the markets and actually there's quite a lot going on in terms of BTPs but also yields not only in the US but in the UK. Now overall there does seem to be a focus on the market of inflation. The fact that central banks once again will have to fight really hard and that will tip the global economy into if not a recession, a significant slowdown. So we're seeing a lot of pressure across the board. European stocks down half a percent energy is one of the only industries that's really gaining in today's trading session. This is on the back for example Brent 1.3 percent higher. Now US Treasury yields holding your recent highs. And policy sensitive to your Treasury yield near the highs since 2007. That's quite significant and then the yen also weakening to 150. That's the first time we saw it since 1990. The European map, if we take a look at the difference between some of these countries, the UK pretty much flat as is the CAC 40 on the FTSE maybe just a bit more pressure on the DAX than 7.10 of 8 percent. So it's been a day and an evening of political turmoil in the UK with Liz Truss' premiership looking close to imploding. And Prime Minister's questions opposition Labour Party leader Kierstarmer laid out a list of government euterns. Two year energy freeze, gold, tax free shopping, gold, economic credibility, gold, and her supposed best friend the former Chancellor, he's gone as well. Well let's bring in Bloomberg's Lizzy Burden. When you look at frankly the last 48 hours, does Prime Minister Stereo go? Well the journalist lining up in Downing Street waiting for the podium to arrive outside number 10. The pressure is on for Liz Truss to resign. The winds really have changed since yesterday when it seemed that most Tory MPs thought they'd let her cling on until at least the Halloween.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4818,2022-10-20 08:04:23

16474," There's no sign that they're coming back just yet. Coming up, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard sees them end to aggressive rate hikes early next year or exclusive interview next. This is Bloomberg. Why is everybody want to be a consultant and what are all these consultants doing? Well David, I think that we actually defy the label consultant because sometimes consultant seems to imply that we only give advice and when you look at what Accenture does, we're really different than the traditional version of a consultant. We're really about relevance and results and that's what is driving our business. We're about a consulting project. In my example on the CEO, I have a problem, I call you up, I say solve my problem or give me a solution. We don't operate as big companies permanently in crisis mode. And so when you think about how long does it solve things, a lot of it starts with, you know, the company being willing to set aggressive goals. And so what we are trying to do now is work with our clients to work differently and to work faster. I do think they will have an impact and in some ways have had an impact. I would cite the housing market in particular where it appears that increase in rates has really changed the dynamics there. So that's some place that I would say there are not long and variable lags. That market anticipated Fed moves before they were even in train this spring. And so that's a place where we've seen impact right away. But it's a big ship and it takes a while to steer the ship. And so the housing market is not the whole economy. It certainly isn't. And it's certainly not the main things driving inflation now, of course, prices have fallen. But rents are important though. We think certainly aren't. We certainly aren't. And in fact, that's one reason why people are so worried about inflation staying high next year is that those rents are the way they are calculated. They're going to spread out over several months. Yeah, but we're aware of the lags in the calculation. And so we'll take that on on board and take a look at that. But yeah, you're right. The core measure of PC inflation is still on high fours and the Dallas Fed trim mean 4.75 or so. So pretty high inflation in the US even if you try to trim out some of the more volatile components. So we're going to have to get that turned around moving in the right direction back toward 2%. So how are you going to do that? What does this mean for the restrictive terminal rate of those",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4820,2022-10-20 08:13:04
16475," So we're going to have to get that turned around moving in the right direction back toward 2%. So how are you going to do that? What does this mean for the restrictive terminal rate of the September steps, medium target interest rate, 4.4% this year, 4.6% next year? What are your, after the latest data, what are your projections now? Well, if you look at the September summary of economic projections that's so-called dot plot, it did seem like the committee was coalescing around further rate increases at upcoming meetings, even by the end of the year. So that seems to be the base case right now. Most of that has been priced in the market, so I would anticipate that that's having an impact right now. So that's good news if you're trying to get inflation down. But we'll have to follow through on that in the subsequent meetings this year and get the policy rate up to a level where we can put meaningful downward pressure on inflation. I think that's the main goal immediately ahead of us at the committee. That was St. Louis, Fed President James Bullard there. He's an end-to-the-front loading of aggressive hikes by early next year. And I were joined by Kevin Torsay. He is a portfolio advisor and member of the Investment Committee at the Caminac. Kevin, thank you for joining us. So Mr. Bullard sees a 2023 shift with end-of-front loading hikes. Is this wishful thinking? Well, it's a question of political courage really because we know that given the level of unemployment, which is still the key variable which will impact interest rates in the end, you have this unemployment rate moving into non-inflationary levels, this would mean a potential severe recession in the US in the area of 3% for inflation to get back on track to the 2% target. So far, politicians are quite keen on stating that they will do whatever they can and whatever it takes to bring inflation back to 2%. But we know that when times are getting more and more difficult, it will be more and more difficult for them to be courageous enough to move back to this target. So Kevin, what does that mean? First of all, where do you expect treasuries by Yand? Well, you know, on treasuried markets, again, there's lots being integrated, lots being factored in, terminal rates in the area of 5%. You know, that's already a decent level of tightening being priced in. I'd say the main question is, you know, when will the Fed pivot, when they, if they eventually pivot, and this would be at some point in our opinion that Karmia crowned mid 2023? And this puts, again, some pressure on longer term interest rates, because it would mean that, you know, the Fed will be shifting a bit late and hence it will be weighing on growth and then weighing on long term rates. So, Kevin, when you look at all of the concerning bad news across the world in terms of valuations, in terms of inflation, a possible recession, where are you putting your money right now? Well, you know, again, on equity markets, where we prefer to allocate assets is in those parts, I'd say most recession resilient part of the of the equity markets. Pelska is one, we're having luxury companies publishing today in France, no to be that's another area where we like to allocate assets, those luxury names, which tend to be quite resilient, provided that the recession is not that severe, or the impending recession is not that severe. On fixed income markets, I'd say credit markets are integrating a fair bit of pessimism. We get very decent yields on those credit markets between eight and 10% on the, I'd say most in depth part of the market, whether it's the Neuro or in the US. And this integrates, I'd say, or embeds a very high level of default rates, which is, I'd say, unlikely to happen going forward. So, that's, I'd say, the two areas where we would be allocate most of our assets these days. Kevin, when you look further afield, I don't know whether you need to get the dollar, call the right, it feels like the riskiest position if you feel that it goes down and actually goes ever higher. What's your take on dollar?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4821,2022-10-20 08:17:26
16476," You need to get the dollar call right. It feels like the risk is positioned if you feel that it goes down and actually it goes ever higher. What's your take on dollar? And therefore does it mean for, for example, emerging market credit? Yeah, well, so on the US dollar, there's been several factors helping and that's clearly what you was doing. It's the best performing assets this year. There's probably more to go on that front, why that is. Because again, the energy crisis is far from being sold in Europe. There's still this huge, tamakly sort of potential gas stoppage in Europe. Another one is interest rates differential, growth differential. And on that front, I mean, if we do expect recession to be hitting the US over the next 12 months, they will likely be coming much sooner into Europe. That's more likely to happen over the next coming six months. So this would mean that the dollar has further room to appreciate versus the euro going forward. Kevin, very quickly, when you look at Europe, is now the right time to get in or out of bonds? Well, again, on credit market, I would say, it's a very right time to enter on those markets. Again, we are living through volatile times to say the least. But you have carry with you when you're investing in those credit markets. And again, on the short term part of the yield curves, whether it's the US or the US, there's already a lot being quite still. I'd say on long term euro rates, I'd be a bit more cautious because there's still lots of supply coming. There's a this natural price and sensitive buyer, which is the ECB, which is going to pull out of the market. And this is likely not going to help, I'd say, longer term euro rates. Okay, Kevin, thank you so much. Kevin Toze, there, a portfolio advisor, a member of the Investment Committee at Giaminiac. Now let's get straight to the Bloomberg. First, we're news, here is Leigh Ann Gehrens. Hi, Leigh Ann. Hi, FanCene. Liz Trusser's premiership is looking increasingly fragile after a day of drama at Westminster UK Home Secretary Suela Bravaman. He was fired earlier in the day, criticised the Prime Minister and accused the government of breaking key pledges. Tentons came to a head later in a chaotic commons vote over Trusser's controversial plan to restart shale gas fracking with reports of MPs manhandled into voting with the government. Now President Vladimir Zelensky has asked Ukrainians to consume electricity with quote, awareness tomorrow. This after a grid operator warned of rolling blackouts because of damage to the country's power infrastructure from missile attacks. By Moscow, Russia meanwhile has extended martial law and four occupied areas of Ukraine, limiting civilian movements. Bloomberg has learned that China is considering reducing the amount of time inbound travelers must spend in mandatory quarantine. This as the country's COVID-0 policy leaves it increasingly isolated from the west of the world. Bureau crats are looking at cutting quarantine to two days in a hotel and then five days at home down from a total of 10 days of isolation at present. And French President Emmanuel Macron has used a fast track decree to push through his budget effectively bypassing the lower house of parliament. This after the bill was debated in France as national assembly for several days during which it became clear it wouldn't secure enough votes to actually pass. Macron sent his group is nearing 40 seats short after losing its majority and that was earlier this year. Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg quick take powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. I'm Diane Garenz. This is Bloomberg, a fancy. Leanne, thanks so much. Coming up Tesla sales for short of Wall Street estimates but Elon Musk tells investors in the end of the year will be at a equal take a look at the numbers and this is Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4822,2022-10-20 08:21:40
16477," China's military power has been growing at an incredible speed over the last 20 years. A strong country must have a strong military, as only then can it guarantee the security of the nation. In terms of sphere of influence, we absolutely know that China wants to be dominant in Asia. So there is a target to get to that point, to be a military that is a peer to the greatest militaries in the world by 2035. The competition for influence is a global one. And through a multi-decade trajectory fueled by planning, money, and pragmatism, China is building a military that allows it to shape the 21st century just as the US shaped the 20s. You've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. What does it mean? What does it mean? It means they have a Bloomberg. Economics, finance, politics, this is Bloomberg surveillance, early edition, or from Singapore here in London. Now, Tesla has reported sales that fell short of Wall Street estimates, citing delivery and production bottlenecks and prompting Elon Musk to assure investors that demand for his company's cars remain strong. As our factors ran, we're looking forward to a record breaking queue for. So it really, you know, not going to work. It looks like we'll have an epic end of the year. Well, joining us now is Bloomberg's global auto-s editor. He's Craig Trudeau. So Craig, good morning. Thanks so much for joining us again. So how serious are you know, demand issues for Tesla? So we entered this earnings report with that being the real big question, right? There was kind of a troubling deliveries report just a few weeks ago, much shorter of pretty much everybody's estimates, you know, concerning that production exceeded deliveries by about 22,000 vehicles, which is sort of unprecedented for Tesla. They usually sort of clean out by the end of each quarter. And, you know, you heard the knock on wood there that sort of allowed for, you know, hey, maybe some things could still go go a stray in the fourth quarter. You also heard later on the call, the CFOs.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4823,2022-10-20 08:26:10
16478," We'll go astray in the fourth quarter. You also heard later on the call, the CFO sort of allow for the idea that we should expect that again in the fourth quarter, more production than deliveries, more cars and transit at the end of the quarter. You also heard Elon Musk talk a little bit about, he did allow for the idea that demand is a little harder to come by because of economic headwinds. So this wasn't necessarily the effusive abulance that you would have hoped if you were sort of rooting for Musk putting the demand concerns, putting them to rest. Yeah, so Craig, very quickly, is the share buy-by possible? Interestingly, Musk said that this is something that has not been decided by the board, but that didn't stop him from sort of floating the idea that something like on the order of $5 to $10 billion share buy-back could be possible. So that may be some way to sort of put some concerns to ease about what the stock's been doing lately. Craig, thanks so much. Craig Trudeau, there with the very latest on Elon Musk now, we're joined to coming up. We're joined by David Hunt, he's the chief executive of PGM, which has more than $1 trillion in assets under management. We'll get his thoughts on the market outlooks. That's coming up next, and this is Drew Bray. Yeah, Rebecca Runen, let's hope you found it helpful. push have he seen from the Kishida government in terms of green funding. Kishida administration has committed to doubling the amount of investments in so-called green technologies. I think we need more than just pronouncements. We need real money backing, very innovative startups and innovative companies in this space. What do you make of Kishida's new capitalism? Well, I think he is framework is reflective of the challenges that Japan society is facing, namely that growth has been present, but growth has not been of course evenly distributed. But frankly speaking, it's hard to register big income if you don't have a huge income to begin with. If the government and private sector can work together and collaborate to drive more innovative growth startups, that can really drive the income growth that the Kishida government needs to redistribute.

Risk evaporates, China debates a cut to quarantine rules but stocks drop as inflation and brink risks continue to swirl. Plus out of power Tesla slides post-market as delivery and supply bottlenecks hit third quarter results but Elon Musk promises an epic year end. Well good morning everyone and welcome to Bloomberg's events early edition. I'm Franci Lacquay here in London. Now the news cycle relentless, especially relentless at this moment from the Mayhem in Downing Street to earning season next week. But my next guest likes to look at the long term picture for the markets. David Hunt is president and chief executive of PGM which has $1.3 trillion in assets under management. He joins me here in the London studio. So David, welcome to London. Nice to be with you Franci. And welcome to our studio when you look at inflation. David, this is the biggest concern for asset managers, for private equity, really for any kind of investor and the people also that are trying to make ends meet. How will this end? Well I think that the first thing to recognize is that actually it's very different around the world. It's easy to kind of extrapolate maybe from your home country. But in China, for example, inflation is not a big deal and the economy is shrinking. In Japan, inflation is not a big deal and there's almost no growth anywhere. In the U.S., we have high inflation which is pretty broad based. And in Europe, we have high inflation but which is more targeted toward energy and food and a few other sorts. It's a very different story and I think it does lead you to different conclusions about how things begin to come undone at the end of this. Personally, I think we're headed into a kind of post-COVID regime which is very different. It will be higher inflation. It will be still fairly low rates by historical standards and unfortunately we'll go back to somewhat of a low growth phenomena in the developed world. So what does it mean your offerings for your clients? How will they change? Because it's going to be much more difficult to, well, it's going to be much more difficult to make money but it's easier maybe to lose money in this kind of environment. Well, yes and no and this is where it's a wonderful thing to be a long-term investor. While it's undoubtedly true that if you were a big holder of bonds at the moment and rates went up on you like that, you're feeling a little bit poor. But in truth, over the next 18 months, the money that we put out, we think is going to be some of the best money actually that we invest. This is what happened after the GFC. I mean, we now have an entry point and we can talk about when that is but there is an entry point now, I think to put money to work at far more attractive terms than we've seen over the last five years. So I think there's real room for optimism for long-term investors but you've got to be able to ride this out a little bit. Right. So first of all, how do you not catch a falling knife? And so what is the right entry point? Well, I think that is the million dollar question for sure. And for us anyway, what we're really watching is the rates of inflation and trying to figure out when those are indeed coming down. And you can see some early signs. I mean, the base effects will naturally bring these down for sure. But I do think inflation is likely to stay higher than the market anyway believes that they will. And the reason for that is actually how much money has been put into the economy by fiscal stimulus, whether that's here in the UK or in the US. We've had more than 10% of GDP pumped into consumers and businesses while it's, and they're spending that. There's a lot of momentum behind it. Do you worry about zombie companies? And to your point of actually putting capital to work, can you demand higher fees in this volatile environment? So there's no question that a lot of the money that has gone into the economy for COVID has meant that the natural process of creative destruction probably has been delayed a little bit. And I would say we're going to see that more in Europe than the US where much of the support actually went to unemployment insurance, whereas much of the support in Europe actually went into companies. But nevertheless, I do think gradually you will see a kind of creative destruction. You will begin to see as we head into recessions that there will be a rise in the economy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4825,2022-10-20 08:34:47
16480," Do you think gradually you will see a kind of creative destruction? You will begin to see as we head into recessions that there will be a rise in credit losses and defaults. And that's a natural part of beginning to get demand under control. And central banks want that. But nothing like an 0708 crisis. Actually very different. I think the analogies are not that helpful. The GFC was fundamentally a liquidity issue that was driven by banks that were under capitalized. We actually have the opposite problem now. The banks are in very good shape. The GFC was not really a credit issue. This I think if we have kind of a mild to moderate recession, at least in much of the developed world, which will be driven by higher rates, you're going to have actually more of a credit issue than we did before. But I don't think you're going to have the same kind of liquidity issue. I mean, if you look at some of the credit issue. I mean, there was a bit of liquidity concern for some of the pension funds, longer-day pension funds here, which I'm sure you follow very closely. A couple of concerns, of course, with shadow banking. How do you stress tests, leverage companies at the moment that are OK at 1% interest rates, not so much at 5%. So I'm really glad you raised the leverage question. Because whenever the question of where should we worry, what's going to break? The answer that is almost always follow the leverage. Because that, oftentimes driven by the use of derivatives, is in fact where you see things that people thought were relatively tame, all of a sudden with fast moves and prices can't make margin calls. And that's what you saw in the guild's market here. And that's what we saw actually, a couple of years ago in the U.S. government's market. So we're watching those markets that have built in leverage very carefully. To what? Get out? Or go in? And monitor what the leverage situation is to make sure, one, we have enough liquidity in our portfolio so that clients can move in and out when they want. And secondly, of course, that we do have dry powder that if prices moved dramatically lower, that we could actually move in force for sure. David, are you here to do business? I wonder what you make of all the political turmoil. And we mentioned the pensions. But also yesterday was a pretty extraordinary day for the U.K. No, it really has been absolutely an amazing week to be here for sure. And I'm sure you don't need yet another kind of commentator on the U.K. political situation. But I can say that markets are very clear about what they expect. And that at these heightened levels of interest rates, having big, unfunded liabilities by the government is really not going to be acceptable. And I think that was sternly delivered here by markets. But that should be watched in the U.S. and in other markets, Italy comes to mind, where for sure the same kinds of problems exist. So I think this has been a very, very important week for the world to watch. What are you most optimistic about? And we do, there's a lot of things that could go wrong and we talk about this day and day out. But for the chief executives, such a respect and large company, PGM, are two, three years before we be better in a better place than we are now or there are opportunities for you. So I remain extremely optimistic as an active investor. I mean, I really do think that at these levels of prices, that as we go through the recession, we hit the bottom, of course, the markets will come back faster than the real economy. We will actually see really terrific buying opportunities. By any measure, right now, rates are too high, spreads are too wide. And the real question for many of us is when to make that move, not weather, because I think the next 24 months will actually be very attractive, but people should be optimistic as long as they have a long-term view. Are your clients optimistic or have they been, yes, right? They haven't been trying to... No, and we see one of the biggest differences, I think, that I can remember between institutional investors who have not changed their SAA. There's been no panic whatsoever. In fact, many of them have been selectively rebalancing into this. And retail, where you have seen a lot of big outflows and people just kind of running for anything that's said fixed income. But the two are very different. And so I think most long-term investors are riding this out and feel as if they have an opportunity now in front of them. How difficult is it to go from what we've lived through in the last 12 years to the next 10 years?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4826,2022-10-20 08:39:09
16481," and feel as if they have, you know, an opportunity now in front of them. How difficult is it to, you know, to go from what we've lived through in the last 12 years to the next 10 years with, you know, QT with central banks just taking on a completely different point? It really is. I mean, so I mentioned this kind of new regime and so what we're working the most with clients on is so if inflation is higher, what does that mean for your portfolio? If rates are going to be a bit higher, what does that mean? If emerging markets no longer really operate as a block, you know, how do you break all of that up? So it's a very interesting time to be an investor. Yes, really not dull day. Thank you so much for joining us. Today, come back soon to London and here on air, David Hunt there, President and Chief Executive Officer of PGM. Now in the meantime, let's also check on Brown. We probably need to also check on guilds. The focus is on the politics. Now we did here, Mr. Broadbent of the Bank of England. It's not clear for its most rise as much as market see. Remember, it is November 3rd that we have the Bank of England decision. It's on October 31st that we're expecting more details from the chancellor in terms of fiscal spending. But then of course, a million dollar question is does the Prime Minister stay what comes if she goes and how does that change to the fiscal equation? Now let's get straight to your Bloomberg business slash. Here's Lee and Garence. Hi, Leigh Ann. Hi, Frank Seen.

The results provide more evidence that producers of luxury goods remain mostly immune to the wider squeeze on spending. Now, Philip Morris has increased its offer for a smokeless tobacco company, Swedish match. The total value of the revised offer from the Swiss-based tobacco giant amounts to about 15.8 billion dollars. A takeover would give Philip Morris a vast distribution network over in the US. The world's largest market for smoking alternatives. It says it will not increase the price further. And Bloomberg has earned Saudi Aramco is pushing ahead with plans for an IPO of its oil trading business in what would be one of the largest listings this year. So, also say the firm is working with advisors for listing in ReAD as early as this year, which could value the unit at more than 30 billion dollars. And that's your Bloomberg business, Frank Seen. Thanks so much, Leigh Ann. Now, coming up, you leaders gather in Brussels on the agenda sanctions on Iran protections against energy sabotage. So, that's up next, and this is Bloomberg. I'm going to ask you a question. I'm going to ask you a question. We've actually been really deep into crypto, deep into learning about blockchain, and all of the new businesses. I would characterize this as crypto learners. We have made a series of toe-hold investments on behalf of our clients, both in some of the currency baskets as well as with some venture firms that are investing primarily in the crypto area. I think it has the potential to be completely game-changing, but it is still such the wild west, and so it's so absurd. But there's, it has the potential.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4827,2022-10-20 08:43:28
16482," It's still such the wild west, and so it's so uncertain. But there's, it has the potential to completely up end everything. The difference between political gossip and policy intelligence, Bloomberg government provides our clients with expert reporting, analysis and public affairs tools that give you the edge in reaching policy makers on the hill. When you're in the business of influence in Washington, information and connections are the currencies on which you rely. For knowledge you can act upon, the difference is Bloomberg government. Economic finance politics, this is Bloomberg surveillance early edition of comes in quite here in London. Now European leaders gathered Brussels this morning for a highly anticipated summit dominated by energy and the war in Ukraine. The meeting comes after the head of the commission, Ursav Andrelyan unveiled a sweeping plan to bring down energy prices. Now to debrief us all, we go to our Europe course plan, Maria Tudoe, who's covering the summit. Maria, great to speak to you again. There's a plan of action, but is there the political consensus to get it done? Yeah, Francine, and frankly that is the key question. Today, and there is no simple answer for it. We've now seen the plan put forward by the head of the commission. We've talked about this dynamic, very dynamic price cap. The idea of a circuit breaker and the derivative markets too, we've talked about the joint purchases, but ultimately these are ideas that will only fly if European leaders agreed to them and give it the green light. Now I am being told today, the sticking points essentially remain. The Germans continue to be very worried about the implications of any cap whatsoever. They worry that could limit supplies and their priorities to get a hold of supplies. And then of course, you have this growing coalition of countries that want to see a price limitation being put forward. So Francine, overall, I'm being told consensus at this stage, a lot can change in 24 hours in Brussels, but right now it looks in many ways that this is going to be a long but also very thorny discussion tonight. Yeah, and to be fair, usually a lot just change in 24 hours in Brussels. Maria, thank you so much. Maria Tudoe there with the very latest front Brussels. Now the energy crisis forcing governments to rethink how they generate power. One alternative being considered Turkish power ships. Now these giants floating power plants are run by Turkey's car power ship. They burn fossil fuels and are usually spotted on the coastlines of Africa and emerging markets. But the company says it's now in talks with four European Union nations. Well, we're now joined by Zainab Harazi, managing director at car power ship. Zainab, thank you so much for joining us. It does seem, you know, the idea is not as green as many governments would like it in Europe. The idea may be important just to make sure that we don't have blackouts. Germany, as far as I understand, is now backing off this options. Who are you talking with in terms of governments in Europe? Thank you very much. As car power ships, we have built conventional land-based power plants that are combined cycle that are dual fuels inside ships. And we've done this, particularly before any contract, so that these power plants can be mobilized in less than 30 days. So these technologies have been in use in Europe for the many decades before and there are no news to the European Union. The only difference is that they're built inside ships rather than on land. We have been speaking with the leading four economies in Europe to provide electricity and we have been in very mature discussions and hope to have a couple of the ships operating before the winter peak so that we can lower the electricity bills and make sure no industries and no households get like that. Zainab, so who would like to buy this? If you look at some of the economy ministers or energy ministers, is France looking into this? Are they ready to accept and actually use some of the car power ships? How much do you think you'll be president in Europe in six months from now?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4828,2022-10-20 08:47:47
16483," Is France looking into this? Are they ready to accept and actually use some of the car power ships? How much do you think you'll be president in Europe in six months from now? We hope that if we can go through the regulatory processes, which are made for conventional project development, for the standard regulatory processes take approximately one year, if we can expedite that process to implement a past-track solution, we should be able to commission and make readily operational two gigawatts of electricity in Europe in less than 60 days from today. Zainab, when you look at some of, you know, the countries, you haven't talked with Paris, is it something that they'd be interested in? We understand. The Germany may not be looking at this option, but that France could be. We are speaking with the whole core of the leading economies in Europe. They have been reflecting also keep their main reasons. So with your permission, we will respect our potential clients' requests, but I would be very happy to share that information first week of December, but hopefully all the power ships will be operational. Yeah, and for the moment, I understand there are 33 power ships on operation across African-other emerging markets. How long are these contracts? So the shortest contract we have is one year and the longest is 25 years. These ships have a lifetime of more than 30 years, but it is very natural to use the ship for three to five years with a medium-term contract, and then one understanding the merits of it and how low cost electricity generated from it and how reliable it is, then provide for a contract extension. That flexibility is not possible with a land-based power plant since the structure is thick and it cannot be moved, but we can provide that flexibility with floating power plants. Zainab, thank you so much. Zainab, how is either a managing director at Car Power Ship joining us this morning. Now let's get straight to the Bloomberg. First word news, here is Leanne Garence, highly un. Hi, FranCeme. Let's trust this premiership is looking increasingly fragile after a day of drama at Westminster, UK Home Secretary Suella Bravenman, who was fired earlier in the day, criticised the Prime Minister and accused the government of breaking key pledges. Tensions came to a head later in a chaotic commons vote to the Trust's controversial plan to restart shale gas fracking with reports of MPs manhandled into voting with the government. Now President Vladimir Zelensky has asked Ukrainians to consume electricity with quote, awareness tomorrow. This after a grid operator warned of rolling blackouts because of damage to the country's power infrastructure from missile attacks by Moscow. Russia meanwhile has extended martial law in four occupied areas of Ukraine, limiting civilian movements. Bloomberg has learned that China is considering reducing the amount of time in bound travelers must spend in mandatory quarantine. This after the country's COVID-19 policy leaves it increasingly isolated from the rest of the world. Bureau crats are looking at cutting quarantine to two days in a hotel and then five days at home, down from a total of ten days of isolation at present. French President Emmanuel Macron has used a false track decree to push through his budget effectively bypassing the lower house of parliament. First after the bill was debated in France's national assembly for several days during which it became clear it wouldn't secure enough votes to pass. Macron's centrist grouping is nearly 40 seats short after losing its majority that happened earlier this year. Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg quick take powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. Amniand Gerenes, this is Bloomberg, a Francine.

16484," The British Cabinet has become something of a revolving door and the Prime Minister is under immense pressure to be the next person to leave. We have the latest from the Mayhem and Downing Street. This is Bloomberg. The British Cabinet has become something of a revolving door and the Prime Minister is under immense pressure to be the next person to leave. The British Cabinet has become something of a revolving door and the Prime Minister is under immense pressure to be the next person to leave. Why is everybody wanting to be a consultant and what are all these consultants doing? Well David, I think that we actually defy the label consultant because sometimes consultant seems to imply that we only give advice and when you look at what Accenture does, we're really different than the traditional version of a consultant. We're really about relevance and results and that's what is driving our business. What about a consulting project? In my example, I'm the CEO, I have a problem, I call you up, I say solve my problem or give me a solution. We don't operate as big companies permanently in crisis mode and so when you think about how long does it solve things, a lot of it starts with the company being willing to set aggressive goals. And so what we are trying to do now is work with our clients to work differently and to work faster. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. Because Trussonomics is being dismantled, MPs behind the scenes are asking what's the point of having her at the top? In the strong dollar, amplified the world's risks of instability. The President thinks that complete reunification must be realized. With unmatched reach in resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Remember, your global business authority. Economics, finance, politics, this is Bloomberg's surveillance early edition of Fountain Act or Prime Minister they described yesterday as not just ideological rigidity, not just political misjudgment, but amateurishness for all the world to see. It was the resignation of Homestec Referee Sulebravenman and then her scathing resignation letter. We're going to hear from her with her resignation speech. We expect in the commons later. Then the vote on fracking and all the chaos surrounding the allegations of manhandling to get a Tory MP through the right side of the lobby to vote. The MP involved and the ministers, I should say.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4830,2022-10-20 08:56:30
16485," We are surrounding the allegations of manhandling to get a Tory MP through the right side of the lobby to vote. The MP involved and the ministers, I should say, have denied that, although there were multiple eye witnesses. And there was of course confusion as well, whether the fracking vote was a confidence vote in the government or not. And that has flipped flopped multiple times. And the chief whip and the deputy whip quit and then unquit. So in some front scene, it has been absolutely chaos. The pressure is for this trust to quit and we're just waiting for the lectern outside number 10. I have to say, so many commentators commenting that it's now like Italy and so many times being offended by that. In the meantime, the Bank of England, the government broad bent to also saying that it's not clear that UK interest rates need to rise as much as markets are betting at the moment. And that's why we are using the word outside number 10. Bluebird surveillance early edition continues. Music. Music. Music. Music. Music. Music. Music. Music. Music. Music. Music. Music. Music.

16486," We're in a desellerating environment right now, and the market leadership to us just doesn't make a ton of sense. Effex is a relative game. The dollar remains, you know, first amongst equals in this. We will not see weakness in the dollar until the other economies start to do either as well or better than the US. I haven't seen enough evidence that there's been any sort of break in the way things function. Yes, we're going through a painful period in the markets. It's a very difficult environment, right? We're at market breaking levels and in almost every asset class. This is Bloomberg surveillance, early addition with Anna Edwards, Matt Miller and Kaley Lines. It's 10 a.m. in London, 5 a.m. in New York and 5 p.m. in Hong Kong. Our top stories today. On the brink, Liz Truss is hold on the premiership is hanging by a thread as many members of her UK conservative party agitate for her to go. Tesla slides, delivery and supply bottlenecks hit the EV makers third quarter results. CEO Elon Musk tries to assure investors promising an epic year end. The sweetened offer, Philip Morris says it's new bit for Swedish match is its best and final as it targets the world's largest market for smoking alternatives. Welcome to Bloomberg's surveillance, early addition, I'm Anna Edwards in London with Matt Miller and Kaley Lines in New York and Kaley hard not to be distracted by the politics here in the UK, but away from that, the rising yield environment is still very much in focus. Yeah, and that is weighing on risk appetite really around the world. Anna, definitely true in Asia overnight where stocks were down pretty much across the board, though what's interesting is the MSCI Asia Pacific index as a whole cut its losses about in half only right now down about three quarters of one percent after earlier losses of more than one and a half percent. And the reason for the rise off of session lows was some Bloomberg reporting that China may be looking to cut its COVID quarantine measures shorter, potentially just two days in a hotel than five days at home. So that would be a reduction in an easing of some of the really strict COVID zero protocols there. So that helped things out, but still a down day for equities. Also a down day mostly for bonds and that yields are moving higher around the world, really seeing follow through upward pressure on yields like we saw in treasuries yesterday in the overnight session, including in Australia, where the two year yield rose 12 basis points to 351. That's the highest going back to 2012. And of course, the Japanese bond market has not been immune to these forces. We have seen the 10 year JGB yield once again above that 25 basis point cap that the Bank of Japan would like to keep there, which is why they announced an unscheduled bond buying program to try to keep that yield curve control. And of course, that is contributing to a weaker Japanese yen. We are on intervention watch because we are very, very close to $150 per dollar mat. Right now dollar yen trading at $149.92. So that's a pair to watch very, very closely. Yeah, we won't know until we do. And then markets will react very sincerely if that happens. Take a look what's going on in futures. We are down about half a percent on S&P futures. Now, of course, Tesla is an S&P stock, but we're watching that and it's dragged very closely. Tesla on the NASDAQ futures down 9, 9 tenths of 1%. So you could see tech stocks take a big drop, but just keep in mind how many tech stocks these days are in the broader index. The 10 year yield continues to rise and really yields across the curve are rising to cycle highs. We're looking at 460 basically on the 2 year right now, 416 on the 10 year. And then 9X crude up 1.36, 1.5% a little bit more than that to 86.91. So we do see a little bit of gain there. That may be a little bit of optimism across the oil market as we hear news that China is considering cutting the COVID quarantine time in bound travelers. What do you see in terms of the European stock market? We did see that news around China, the pop oil higher. It didn't keep its impact on equity markets, but some of that pop higher in oil did last a month. As you point out, I see a really divergent picture across the European equity markets depending on the sector waiting of these different geographies. So the London market down a 10th of a.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4832,2022-10-20 09:05:15
16487," that pop higher in oil did last. As you point out, I see a really divergent picture across European equity markets depending on the sector waiting of these different geographies. So the London market down a tenth of a percent also, the DAX in Germany really underperforming because it doesn't have the waiting towards oil names. It also doesn't have the luxury assistance that France has today more on that in a moment. It is the energy sector that is the only one that is going higher across Europe today. I picked that out as one of the sectors to follow today, energy markets, then energy stocks rather up by 1.4 percent, but that is the only sector moving higher, everything else moving negative today. This is the two-year yield. I picked this out for this for the guilt market, of course, 3.54 percent. And we do see yields going higher. And to math point, this is a global phenomenon. This is something we're watching in other geographies in Germany and in Italy. For a little time this morning, it looked a little bit nervous as if the guilt market was going to price in higher yield gains than other markets, but that doesn't seem to have been the case. Now it's sort of on par with the rest of what's going on in Europe. Not all that is similar to what's going on in the German market this morning. And Erickson is down by 14.7 percent. The telecom equipment maker, the profits disappointing. They're under pressure from an activist investor. They're also guiding that it's prudent to expect that some of their customers might cut back on spending given all of the headwinds that they're facing. And Ernest, this is a luxury goods company. It was up much more strongly than this, only up by 3.10 percent. Not doing as bad as had been anticipated in China is one part of the story. And stop me if you've heard this before. American tourists in Europe with strong dollars spending on luxury items seems to be coming to the coming to the aid of the luxury sector. Let us talk about something that's happening here in London. It's been a day and an evening of political turmoil in the UK with Lidtruss' premiership looking close to imploding. Our Prime Minister's questions yesterday, the opposition Labour Party leader, Keir Starmer, laid out a list, a listening of government euterns. Two-year energy freeze, gold, tax free shopping, gold, economic credibility, gold. And her supposed best friend, the former Chancellor, he's gone as well. For more, let's bring in Blue Votes at Lizzie Bird and the Downing Street. I mean, that was yesterday lunchtime, Lizzie, since then she obviously had that appearance in Parliament. And then we had a really troubled vote in Parliament, really messy chaotic scenes in the House in Westminster. Where does all of this leave Liz Truss? Well, Anna, Liz Truss only added to the list of things that are gone from her premiership in the hours that followed Prime Minister's questions. Gone is another holder of one of the great offices of state, the Home Secretary. Gone, of course, is much of her economic strategy. And really, her only connection to her core vote now is Brexit. And yet her cabinet is now filled with remainers. The new Home Secretary Grant Shaps voted remain and he also supported Rishi Sunak in the summer leadership election. But crucially, Gone is the party's dignity, according to Tory back benches themselves. They were livid last night because of what happened around the fracking vote. There were allegations of man-handling of an MP by two senior ministers to go in the right lobby and vote the government's way. That's been denied by the MP involved and the ministers involved. But still, there are calls from both MPs in the Tory party and the Labour party for an investigation. So the wind has changed in Westminster today. It had seemed that Liz Truss was going to be allowed to cling on until at least the Halloween budget. But now the pressure is mounting for her to resign today. We're just waiting for a lectern to arrive. And if that lectern does arrive and she does indeed resign, Lizzie, what happens next to would replace her? Well, interestingly, the polling shows a difference. The party membership would like Boris Johnson to come back, but the population would like Rishi Sunak who of course lost out to Liz Truss over the summer. He's the former chancellor. You may see the 1922 Committee of Tory back benches opting to appoint a noint, I should say, a successor to skip this very divisive leadership election process that we saw over the summer by pass the party membership because we see where their decisions lead. But the trouble is, whoever they pick would have a seriously diluted mandate. That would raise this pressure for...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4833,2022-10-20 09:09:30
16488," The party membership because we see where their decisions lead. But the trouble is, whoever they pick would have a seriously diluted mandate. That would raise this pressure for a general election and no Tory wants that. Given it already looked like the Tories were going to get annihilated at an election, yesterday's only added to the chaos. All right, Lizzie, thanks very much. Lizzie, burden. They are reporting from Downing Street. We are waiting for any changes there and we'll bring them to you the minute they happen. Now let's get back to the market's Tesla shares down after the EV maker reported. Sales fell well short of Wall Street estimates, citing delivery and production bottlenecks. The Miss prompted Elon Musk to assure investors that demand for his company's cars remain strong. As our factors ran, we're looking forward to a record breaking queue fall. So it's really, you know, not going to worry. It looks, looks like we'll have an epic end of year. Joining us now is Craig Trudeau, Bloomberg's global auto's editor. So what do we know? I mean, Craig, it looks like Tesla's sales fell about $600 million short of the street's estimates. If you factor in even $100,000 a car, average telling price, that's 6,000 vehicles. Right. I think, you know, there was also some mention of dollar strength playing a part there. I think you also, I think just have to step back a little bit and do sort of acknowledge that this company is growing quite a bit, right? Revenue did increase by 56%. Having said that, they've really sort of set a high bar for themselves by, you know, the talk along the lines of what we just heard from Musk of, you know, an epic outlook and lots of talk about record breaking results. You know, this is a case where this is a company that's gone from, you know, two car plans to four in the course of roughly a year. And so you would definitely expect that they would have record deliveries and so forth. I think that the big concern going into this was that, you know, deliveries fell quite short of production last quarter. They sort of allowed for the fact that they expect that to continue in the fourth quarter. So that, you know, sort of allows that demand concern to fester a little bit. They also expect to come up a little short of their 50% annual growth outlook for this year. And so, you know, they didn't necessarily put totally to bed this concern about demand. And maybe what we'll see in the coming weeks is perhaps some price cuts from the company after many, many price increases because of all of the material costs and so forth that have prompted those increases. Well, that would be interesting. That would be a pivot in itself. We worry about, we think about a pivot from a macro perspective, a focus on inflation, turning to growth. If we saw that from Tesla, that might tell us something interesting. He, Elon Musk, we're talking and acknowledging some of the weak spots in Europe and crucially in China. Yeah, absolutely. I think he talked about, you know, the idea that demand is, and I quote him, a little harder to come by. So, you know, I think he's alluded to the idea that the property market in China is a drag here in Europe. It's the energy crisis. He alluded to the idea that the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates and sort of clings to his belief that they'll actually have to bring them back down a little bit, which is definitely a sort of contrarian view, I think. But, you know, I think he did sort of allow for the idea that, you know, demand while it is strong, it's going to be a difficult environment for them and that certainly is making it harder than it's been for them in the past. All right, Craig. Great to get an update from you. Thanks so much. We'll continue to follow Tesla this morning, obviously, as the shares look set to fall and could be a big drag on the broader market. Let's get to some big deal news. Philip Morris has increased its offer for smokeless tobacco rival Swedish match. The total value of the revised offer from the Swiss-based tobacco giant amounts to about 15.8 billion dollars. Now, takeover would give Philip Morris a vast distribution network in the US again, which is the world's largest market for smoking alternatives. Bluebrook's Andy Hoffman joins us now. And Andy, this is really interesting because of course, Philip Morris, you know, that's an American company. An American name, the breakup with Altria just 15 or 16 years ago, is this going to be enough now to get it back in the US, are the hedge fund shareholders of Swedish match going to get on board the deal?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4834,2022-10-20 09:13:48
16489," years ago, is this going to be enough now to get it back in the US? Are the hedge fund shareholders of Swedish match going to get on board the deal? Good morning, Matt. Yeah, this is the big question. I mean, what we're hearing initially and early on is that this increased to about 116 Corona from 106 Corona initially should be enough for some to tender. However, the big question is L.A. investment management. That's the hedge fund that owns, we believe more than 7, 7 and a half percent of Philip Morris International and what they decide to do and whether or not this is enough for them is the big question. We haven't heard from them so far and so we don't know where they are. Indeed, as you were saying, this is all about getting back in the US market for Philip Morris International as they move to what they call smoking alternative products and the US is the largest market for smoking alternative products, things like vaping nicotine pouches, which is what Swedish match makes and that's why Philip Morris, which right now is not in the US market wants to get there. Well, and on that note, how does this deal with Altria to sell ICOs in the US fit into this equation? Right. Well, this is also a key move. This is a sort of a interesting strategic move by Philip Morris at this point. What it does is it gives them, they're spending about $2.7 billion in this deal with Altria. It gives them access to the US market to sell the ICOs product, which is a heated tobacco product. It's not tobacco that you light on fire and the hell is that you heat and vaporizes and Philip Morris is that is a smoking alternative and that is better. At this point, Philip Morris was not able to sell that product. That was Altria's product to sell in the US, but this deal will give them that right once they begin manufacturing the ICOs product in the United States. That should be in about 18 months and it gives them leverage here in the fight with the Swedish match shareholders because they say, well, this is our entrance into the US market and perhaps we don't need Swedish match if you're not willing to accept this offer, which Philip Morris says their best and final offer. All right. Bloomberg, thank you so much. Andy Hoffman. Polities. Thanks, Andy. Thank you very much for joining us. Now, let's quickly take a look at some other company stories we have our eye on this morning with some stocks moving in pre-market trading here in the US. All of them related to earnings that were reported after the bell yesterday. First up, IBM, topping expectations on revenue, plus boosting its full-year forecast, really signals still strong demand, which is helping them contend with dollar strength that a lot of companies are facing right now. IBM, other three percent before the bell. It's also a positive story for Las Vegas Sands, the casino operator. It's adjusted property EBITDA, topping expectations, strength for Marina Bay Sands and Singapore helping offset a still-week Macau. It is up a little more than 1 percent, but sinking to the downside is Alcoa, the big aluminum maker posting. A surprise loss. They're dealing with higher costs, but slumping prices as well for aluminum itself. So all of that taking down the company's performance and the stock with it. It's down about 9 percent in early hours and now it's your turn. Now it is my turn and that was definitely worth a mention. So I've got we got there. Coming up on the program then, Kaylee, Adika Goepza joins us, Whiston Tree, director of research, so much to talk about from UK Guild Markets, to the weakness in the yen and the possibility of intervention. What breaks if we see further intervention? And talking of the markets and the macro picture we have been hearing from the St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard, he says it's important the Fed's follow-through on expected rate hikes passivari exclusive interview ahead. November meeting has been more or less priced in the markets at the 75 basis point number. Again, I think you do want to wait till you actually get to the meeting, see what the situation is there. The December meeting is a little farther away. We will have more data at that point.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4835,2022-10-20 09:18:10
16490," We'll have more data at that point. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today won't electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building to cross America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels. We want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Markets are preparing to close, but the day is not over yet. We've talked it is now up about 45%. A lot of volatility right now. You need the power of the Bloomberg terminal to get you market moving data before anyone else. There's numbers much higher than expected. Operated data overweight. You need top analysts to bring you exclusive global insight into cross asset markets. The Neenibond market. The China is a really big focus. Bitcoin ain't playing along today. It's going to be a short term. Bloomberg markets the close weekdays on Bloomberg. Welcome back to Bloomberg surveillance. I'm Matt Miller here in New York, a Kaley Lines, Anna Edwards with us out of London. And we are looking at yields that are at cycle highs really across the curve. I was interested to see two year yields up to almost 260 when I logged into my terminal this morning. Five year yields at 237. Ten year yields at 415. This is, I think, just another example that there are reasonable alternatives to stock. Real competition coming from rates. Let's get over right now to Phil Sarapino. Bloomberg senior markets editor to talk about this. Phil, there was an idea that maybe we hit a bottom. Mike America said there's a series of screens capitulation. Nonetheless, it seems that there's other stuff to buy. You don't need to get the dip in equities just yet. Yeah, it's been pretty hard to make the case that the worst is over. It's time to come rushing back into stocks as that chart shows. You know, if you're getting 4% plus on on treasuries, that's not too bad at a time when the outlook is not great. Some's been waiting for that capitulation. Even Bank of America says they might, they think we might get the people throwing in the towel early 2023. So that means several more months of sort of the market grinding lower. And that's just not an environment that's going to encourage people to come back into the market, especially given the economic news. And you played that clip from Bullard from the Fed, basically saying 75 basis points is baked in rates could be going higher still. Yeah, and just to lay with the capitulation points a little more, Phil, because it is something that so many people are watching for and waiting for. I spoke to one guest this morning who said, no, we're not close to it. Maybe it doesn't come till sometime in 2023 because we haven't seen yields go as high as they are going to go yet. And that I suppose is the missing data point. Absolutely. And you know.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4836,2022-10-20 09:22:33
16491," haven't seen yields go as high as they are going to go yet. And that I suppose is the missing data point. Absolutely. And you know, there's just no urgency on the part of investors to come in. You get these little mini rallies like we saw at the start of this week where, you know, the selling kind of Peters out a little bit. People start to creep back in, but there's just no follow through, no momentum. And, you know, the economic data is probably going to continue to be very difficult for a while. You know, we haven't really seen a huge uptick in an unemployment and you almost want you want to sense that things have gotten really bad in the economy before people start to look for that bottom.

African governments themselves said we are tired of aid and charity. We want to do trade, we want to be treated like partners. The Chinese came along and said, great, we don't do aid in charity, we want to do business with you. Global gateway will mobilize 300 billion euros till 2027.

16492," Now keeping you up to date with news from around the world, here's the first word. Officials in China are said to be debating whether to reduce the amount of time people entering the country must spend in quarantine. They're considering setting the period to two days in a hotel and then five days at home, versus the current seven days in a hotel and three at home. The country's COVID-19 policy is leaving it increasingly isolated from the rest of the world. And Ukrainians are being warned of rolling blackouts because of damage to the country's power and infrastructure from Russian missile attacks, with President Volotomir Zelensky urging people to use as little electricity as possible. Zelensky has said about 30 percent of Ukrainian power stations have been destroyed since October 10. Coming up, we'll turn back to the markets, Ziels, Ryze and Stocks head lower, Anika Gupdo, Wisdom Tree director of research will join us with his per take on where we go next, monetary policy and earnings. From New York and London, this is Bloomberg. The standard way venture firms work is you commit capital, let's say, over a five year investment period, something like that. Yeah, exactly. And then the fund, typically, has maybe 10 years or so. 15, or these days longer. So often 15, often the tale extends out to 20 years. And some of the investment in venture funds today should be trying to get rates of return of 20 percent, would you say, or more? Top-in venture is sort of three X-net of fees. You ideally are hoping for more than that, you're hoping for five X or more. You're illiquid the entire time, right? So you hope to get paid for the illiquidity. And today, maybe 20 to 40 percent if things go well is sort of baseline. Let's take another subject. The sets up post somebody says, I don't want to invest in Andrews and Horowitz. I want to be Mark Andreessen. How does somebody become a venture capitalist? What are the skill sets for good venture capitalists? It is high degree of intelligence, hard work, lot of luck, dress the right part, don't wear a tie. What are the things that make one a good venture capitalist? So the super, the highly successful VCs historically are very idiosyncratic. You know, people from very different backgrounds, Mike Morris is a former newspaper reporter, John Doris of former chip salesman. He's got people with very different management, and Bryer has more of this kind of blue chip investment background. You have people with very different backgrounds and experiences. And so I think it's some set of skills and some set of knowledge. And then there seems to be a taste component to it that's really hard to measure and really hard to produce.

Tesla slides, delivery and supply bottlenecks hit the EV maker's third quarter results. CEO Elon Musk tries to assure investors promising an epic year end. And a sweetened offer, Philip Morris says, is new bid for Swedish match. Is it best and final as it targets the world's largest market for smoking alternatives? I'm Anna Edwards in London with Matt Miller and Kayley Lines in New York. And Matt, it seems European equity markets struggling to find any momentum. Yes, we've got the political chaos not really jumping on the latest newslines out of China and wary of volatility in government debt markets. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, we're seeing rising yields here, which is, I think, one of the reasons that you see lacklustrid demand for stock or actually the opposite of that, right? S&P 500 futures are down four tenths of 1%, NASDAQ futures are down three quarters of 1%. The concern here, some earnings stories, Tesla having to defend demand for its products, seeing some weakness this morning. And that could drag on these two indexes. Here you see the 10 year yield right now rising even less than one basis point, but still at 414 and we showed you earlier the two year yield at 459 right now. So across the curve, we're seeing those yields continue to rise and the question of whether or not we've hit a bottom in stocks is also being asked of yields, right? Have we hit a high in yields? Have we hit a low in terms of price of bonds? Now I'm xcrued up about one of the third percent. We did have a pop this morning in crude and some other commodities on that news that China may reduce the quarantine time for inbound travelers. It wasn't enough to sustain a rally in stocks, but it certainly has sustained a rally in crude as we see Brent rising as well. Kaley, what do you see in terms of pre-market movers? Well, there's a lot of earnings related movers to keep an eye on. One of them being Tesla, which is Anna mentioned, disappointed in its report after the bell yesterday. The issue really is on delivery, supply chain bottlenecks, making it difficult for Tesla actually to get cars to people. And as a result, the top line missed expectations. And yes, Elon Musk is trying to say it's not a demand problem, but still shares being weighed down in pre-market trading to the tune of about 5.6%. It's an even bigger drop, though, for Alcoa, the big aluminum maker. It's facing higher costs, but prices of aluminum are going down. All of that adding up to a surprise loss for the company in the quarter they reported. So it's down about 9%. One more positive story out there, though, is IBM. It actually topped expectations and raised its forecast signaling strong demand. And yes, being able to withstand a stronger dollar in those FX headwinds as well. So IBM up about 3% before the belly enough. Yeah, quite a lot of divergence, it seems, across the corporate reporting schedule so far, Kayleigh, in this reporting season, the European markets are taking all of that on board, and showing some moves lower, the stock 600 in Europe down by 6 cents of 1%. And not many sectors, no sectors going in positive territory, apart from energy, that seems to be one area where we are managing to e-couts and positive ground. The UK two-year yields at 3.49%. Actually, a bit of a turnaround here. We had seen that we're now seeing buying of UK debt. We had seen some selling. We had seen those yields going higher. Now we see them coming a little bit lower. But the point remains that we are seeing the UK market move kind of in step with the rest of the European markets today. And that is something really given the political turmoil that we've seen in recent weeks, and it continued overnight. Ericsson, down by 16% just shy of this is a telecom equipment company, of course. They missed in terms of their profit that they reported to the markets. They're under pressure from an activist investor, and they are also being cautious about what happens from here, saying it would be prudent to assume that some of their customers reduce their spending on, for example, 5G. LMS is the luxury goods company out of Paris, and of course we've seen a number of luxury goods companies having quite a good quarter reporting better than expected in China, but also saying that American tourists in Europe are spending those strong dollars, Matt, and that is adding up to some better results for the sector. All right, we'll continue to watch obviously all those luxury goods companies. It really is a threat, I think, in today's markets. Let's get to Enika Gupta right now, Wisdom Tree Director of Research, and take a bigger view, first, the 35,000-foot view Enika.

16494," Director of research and take a bigger view, first, the 35,000-foot view, Anika. The question of whether we hit a bottom in markets has been asked. Bank America came out with a survey yesterday saying that the results, screen capitulation, nonetheless, it looks like we're going to be down again today as rates continue to rise. What's your view? I couldn't agree more with them, a very good morning, Matt. We kind of share this same view because we have seen equity market volatility remain high as monetary policy has increased at an excessively sharp rate across central banks and developed markets. Now, as we enter the Q3 earnings season, the key focus is really going to be on current macroeconomic challenges that are being priced into stocks. That's going to be alongside forward guidance. Investors are going to be looking very, very closely into what that forward guidance really is. The reality is the brief rally that we've seen so far has been owing to some pretty good earnings coming in. But inflation and the strong dollar, I believe, are obscuring the real earnings pictures. I think higher discount rates will continue to deflate earnings multiples and it's still too early to save. OK, then those higher discount rates, of course, links into a conversation about how high yields go, then, Annika. I wonder if you could weigh in on that in the UK from a UK perspective. We've just heard from broad bents of the Bank of England saying that UK rates may not rise as much as market C, which does sound a little more dovish than some of the commentary of late. That's from Ben Broadbent, Deputy Governor at the BOE. How aligned do you think on market expectations of Hikes and the bank's intentions? Very good morning, Annika. Yes, there is a slight disconnect and that's because we've been over the past few weeks we've been through a stream and a raft of changes coming in from the government and the Bank of England. So, we've, you know, we started off with this launch of the original Minil Budget. We've then taken a, you know, a complete reverse course on the Minil Budget and a reverse on fiscal policy. And now the key focus really is on, you know, quantitative tightening being delayed until next year. Now, given the fact that we've taken such a sharp turn on fiscal policy, there's a very strong likelihood of that really impacting the market on the downside as well. So while originally our expectations for the Bank of England was to come in with an aggressive 100 basis point rate hike, we now think there is a possibility of them, you know, lowering that to around 75 basis points because if you think about it, this reverse stake on fiscal policy is also likely to impact, you know, demand going forward. We're seeing a very high inventory levels. We're seeing a drag on consumer demand and the key focus for the Bank of England is they need to loosen this ever-so-tight labor market, you know, that is, that has been tightening even more since Brexit. So, you know, to get from a 10% down to a 6% was relatively easy. But now to loosen that from 6% all the way down to 4%, it's going to be a lot more harder. Anika, on the subject of fiscal policy, how are you thinking about that in the U.S. and the implications of the midterm elections for that as a potential market risk event that's now less than three weeks away? Morning, Kaylee. Yes, that's a very interesting question, you know, and what happened in the bank, in the U.K. and, you know, with the Bank of England having to step in, it is a big stark reminder for the rest of the world to not make the same mistake that the U.K. has made. So I think for now, the U.S. will tread very carefully on its, on its, you know, on its take for fiscal policy. We, you know, we do have fiscal deficits at a very high level. And I think, given the fact that now we're entering the midterm election period, you know, focus is going to remain on managing that fine balance between not having very loose fiscal policy alongside the fact that, you know, you've got the Federal Reserve on an extremely sharp, you know, tighter monetary policy path. Okay, Anika, thank you so much for joining us. I will be next, GeoGurr.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4840,2022-10-20 09:39:47
16495," extremely sharp, tighter monetary policy path. Okay, Annika, thank you so much for joining us. Where will the next geography for volatility be? Annika Gupta joining us there from wisdom tree with the latest on the markets. And coming up, St Louis Fed President Jim Bullard expects a shift in Fed policy early next year. Can't have our exclusive interview next. This is Linda. Is it possible the industries in an arms race that will be Ben Zappi, yeah. I think it's happening. And COVID has accelerated that. The industry cost $500 billion last year, the semiconductor industry overall, and estimates are $1 trillion of doubling by the end of the decade at that point. I believe those estimates, it's not that there's not gonna be some blips and turns on the way, and the majority of that is driven by leadership process technology, of which only three companies can satisfy that need. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. Because Trussonomics is being dismantled, MPs behind the scenes are asking, what's the point of having her at the top?

With unmatched reach in resources, from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. This is Bloomberg's surveillance early edition on Katelyn's with Matt Miller in New York and Anna Edwards in London. While St. Louis Fed president Jim Bullard says he expects the central bank to end its front loading of aggressive interest rate hikes by early next year. He spoke exclusively with Bloomberg's Kathleen Hayes. I do think they will have an impact and in some ways have had an impact. I would cite the housing market in particular where it appears that increase in rates has really changed the dynamics there. So that's someplace that I would say there are not long and variable lags. There, that market anticipated Fed moves that before they were even in train this spring. And so that's a place where we've seen impact right away. But it's a big ship and it takes a while to steer the ship and so the housing market is not the whole economy. So it certainly isn't. And it's certainly not the main, one of the main things driving inflation now, of course prices have fallen. But rents are important though. Well, they certainly are. They certainly are. And in fact, that's one reason why people are so worried about inflation staying high next year is that those rents are the way they are calculated. They're gonna spread out over several months. Yeah, but we're aware of the lags in the calculation and so we'll take that on board and take a look at that. But yeah, you're right. The core measure of PC inflation is still in high fours and the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4841,2022-10-20 09:44:05
16496," and take a look at that. But yeah, you're right. The core measure of PC inflation is still on high fours and the Dallas Fed trim mean 4.75 or so. So pretty high inflation in the US, even if you try to trim out some of the more volatile components. So we're going to have to get that turned around moving in the right direction back toward 2%. So how are you going to do that? What does this mean for the restrictive terminal rate of the September steps medium target interest rate 4.4% this year, 4.6% next year? What are your after the latest data? What are your projections now? Well, if you look at the September summary of economic projections that's so called.plot, it did seem like the committee was coalescing around further rate increases at upcoming meetings even by the end of the year. So that seems to be the base case right now. Most of that has been priced in the market. So I would anticipate that that's having an impact right now. So that's good news if you're trying to get inflation down. But we'll have to follow through on that in the subsequent meetings this year and get the policy rate up to a level where we can put meaningful downward pressure on inflation. I think that's the main goal immediately ahead of us at the committee. So off the cuff right now, what would you say that level looks like it's going to be? Is it going to be higher for example than you thought it might be? Is that the risk here? Not that you're going to be okay or you're going to move it lower, but there's actually going to need to have more rates to get to a more restrictive level. Yeah, I've done this calculation of a minimal level that you would have to get to to put downward pressure on inflation. I did it at a conference in Stanford in May and you can look it up on my webpage. But at that time, it came out that number came out to three and a half percent. But since then, the inflation news unfortunately has surprised, continued to surprise to the upside. So if you do that again now, you know, you're going to get something closer to what's in the dot plot, four and a half, four, seventy five, something like that. And I think also, you know, we're data dependent and we're watching the data with, I think we're predicting, or at least the dot plot is predicting that inflation will come down. It will be a disinflationary year in 2023. St. Louis Fed President Jim Bollard in an exclusive interview there joining us now to further discuss is Bloomberg Markets Editor Valerie Tytel. Valerie, did we get anything new from him there? He's reiterating what we've heard from other Fed officials that core, core inflation is the real enemy here. But I want to pick apart one thing he said and it was at the end of his speech. He said, market-based inflation expectations are looking good. I want to pick that apart. Break even since October, this entire month have shifted higher across the curve. And then if you look at survey-based inflation metrics, the U-Mish data, for example, those ticked higher as well. And we know that the U-Mish survey explicitly follows gas prices. And we've seen things like the China reopening news, right? That is boosted oil prices this morning, nearly 2 percent after closing 3 percent higher yesterday. I think there's a real risk that inflation expectations tick higher from here. And that will cause a ratcheting higher of the terminal rate. All right. And well, US yields hitting highs, cycle highs right now as you showed an excellent chart earlier Valerie, the BOJ, again stepping into defend their yield target. It's the same all over again. But what do we actually worry about or why and when do we actually worry about a BOJ shift? Look, we all know that this BOJ policy could break soon. We just don't know when. But I would put it in the bucket of things that could ruin your Thanksgiving mat. The market is very, very worried. And I want to show you something here on this chart. I've mapped out here the 10-year Yen swap rate versus the bond yield. And we can see here with this red line. That's the 25 basis point yield curve control that the BOJ defends. The swap rate is trading at 61 basis points. That means those hedgers in the market were getting so worried that a yield curve control break situation might come. They're willing to",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4842,2022-10-20 09:48:28
16497," Swap rate is trading at 61 basis points. That means those hedgers in the market were getting so worried that a yield curve control break situation might come. They're willing to pay nearly 35 basis points above the V.O.J.'s target to put it on. And look, yes, dollar yen is showing some fireworks, but the real fireworks comes from when the bank of Japan shifts on their yield curve control. And then the last true buyer of fixed income steps back in the world is really flooded with higher term premium and yield surge everywhere. OK, and I know that this could have really crossed outside Japan, of course, Valerie. We heard from Jim O'Neill, formerly of Goldman Sachs, of course, who said, pretty recently, if this is poorly handled, it could have a much bigger global consequence than the recent UK mess. So we will watch very carefully. Thank you very much, Bluebeaks, Valerie Titell for the update there on both the Fed and also the B.O.J. And if you want to see Valerie's charts up close, then you can go to GTV Go. That is the function's use on the Bluebeak. It's terminal.

16498," Our founding father Charles Rolls said in 1900 that he foresee a great future for electric cars. Once charging is fixed and is available and I think now we are here fulfilling his prophecy. We are fighting for the number one spot in terms of pure EV cells in Europe. It's the very first time that you can acquire a superluxury segment, an electric car. The cost of EV is concerned as we scale this technology eventually cost will start to come down. From my perspective I think electric is only a transition but hydrogen can really be the solution. We need to protect the affordability for the middle classes to access clean safe automobiles. This is fundamental and of course the energy inflation is not helping. Europe in particular will be challenged in the next two maybe three years and we are working on fixing that especially Germany that has been dependent on gas coming from Russia. The governments they haven't understood that they cannot bet on only one solution. And especially now where we see for instance you know with the energy crisis for instance in Europe we would like to have hydrogen. If we go look a little bit longer mid to long term I think this may even be a catalyst to go quicker into renewables. Some European auto executives they are global auto executives speaking this week on Bloomberg television about their ambitions and plans to compete with the likes of Tesla and how they intend to deal with the energy crisis that we see on the continent and in the UK. Let's get a look at what's ahead today. The Turkish Central Bank will likely deliver another cut further cementing its outlier status among global central banks. And then US data coming out today includes US existing home sales initial jobless claims conference board leading index so you'll get those signals on the economy to the markets and to the Fed. Blackstone, Philip Morris and Snap will be among the companies posting results today and interesting after Philip Morris brings its bid the Swedish match up to almost $16 billion and finally European Union leaders gather in Brussels for a summit that is dominated by energy and the war in Ukraine. The meeting comes after the head of the Commission Ursula Fondre Lyon unveiled a sweeping plan to bring down energy prices across the continent. Anna? Now let's get to our European correspondent Maria today who is covering that summit that you were just mentioning. Maria, there is a plan for action around energy and energy and war are the very linked topics of conversation at this summit. Is there any political consensus around the plan though? Well Anna, today finally we get to find out whether or not there's consensus. It is decision time. Remember the criticism just a few weeks ago is that there were so many ideas floating in the European space that it was very difficult to get to an actual informed debate that could produce results because there just were too many options out there. We know now that the Commission has put out a point plan to talk about the dynamic very dynamic price cap. It's unclear exactly how that would work in the real market. They also talk about a circuit breaker that could potentially put an end to price spikes in the market. The joint purchases of gas, all of this coming together for leaders to debate. The reality is however in this meeting which I'm being told so far we're very far from consensus. That is from a source that I talked to who says this is still a conversation between a growing number of countries that want to see a price cap and Germany. Germany continues to say they do not support this idea because they worry the implications of the signal that it would send to the market could compromise supply for the Germans right now. This is a story about securing supply even if it is expensive. This is going to get tense today. I am being told as I said there was no consensus on this but you know very well in Brussels. The night is young and 24 hours. Well a lot of things can change in the city. Maria just quickly as we talk about contention on some of these issues are they at least still unified in their support for Ukraine or are we starting to see some wavering in that support? Look I think what we'll have to keep a close eye on Victor Orban the Hungarian Prime Minister always very outspoken the problem child for some in the European Union but also Italy overnight there was a private conversation from Sylvia Berlus.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4844,2022-10-20 09:57:05
16499," Mr. Always very outspoken, the problem child for some in the European Union, but also Italy overnight. There was a private conversation from Sylvia Berlusconi, which has created a national scandal in the country. He flat out blames Ukraine essentially for pushing Vladimir Putin into this invasion. He says some of the content has been taken out of context, but this is now a very contentious debate in Italy. The problem, of course, is Mario Dragues on his way out. This meeting could be his last. And then this is a government that is still on the meeting. OK, Mario. Thanks very much, the Italian perspective there on what's going on in Ukraine. Maria, today, in Brussels, she'll keep us up to date with all of the conclusions on energy and the war in Ukraine. That is it for early edition. We will keep the coverage coming, though. Hey. What do you say to the cynics that say, look, it's all nice and fine, but a lot of it is greenwashing and you're not a good company, you're just a less toxic company than some of the other oil majors. Now the first thing to say is that, you know, I'm a big believer and we need to put ourselves in other persons' shoes in life in general. And so I understand that point of view and I get that people have that perspective. I don't agree with that obviously, but I understand where they're coming from. We have an enormous challenge as society which is to provide the world with reliable, affordable and clean energy. That's what society wants, that's what society needs. And I believe in my heart that a company like BP is actually one of the few companies in the world who can actually make that happen. We can talk about the things that we're going to grow over the coming years and I find it huge, the exciting and energizing for our organization. But that's what the world needs and you simply can't go against the grain of society. You can't defy gravity and that's why we're making the change that we're making. This is a market that over the past few weeks has made it clear it wants to go higher and got a little spooked by the idea that zeal for little potential rises. I think the Fed is going to be able to do that. I think the Fed is going to be able to do that. I think the Fed is going to be able to do that. I think the Fed is going to be able to get inflationary pressures to some side, but at what cost? They're not at levels where one can say we can declare a Katrina. Over the next three to six months we still have a lot of monetary policy tightening ahead of us. It may be some time before we get back to low rates. I don't see 2% rates coming back anytime soon. This is Bloomberg surveillance with Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow and Lisa Abranoids. Good morning everyone. Jonathan Farrow, Lisa Bramford and Tom Keane, Mr. Farrow off on that paper, the FTSE and the Dow really acclaimed.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4845,2022-10-20 10:01:35
16500," Good morning, everyone. Jonathan Farrow, Lisa Bramson, Tom Keane, Mr. Farrow off on that paper, the FTSE and the Dow really acclaimed it's behind J-Store folks. Some of you asked for it. It's behind a passcode on J-Store. Anyways, Farrow is off and we are here. And you know, Lisa and I, we put our heads together and guess what? We're considering it pivot Thursday. There is so much going on this morning. We will go to London Air, Lizzie Birdon, briefed here on the huge, movable feast of the collapse of the British government. We're not there yet, but you know, there's reports coming and I saw something from Sky Moments ago. But Lisa, we have got to go over to the bond market, which two days in a row pivots to higher yields. This is front loading Thursday, right? This is basically this question of Jim Bullard coming out yesterday with Kathleen Hayes and saying that they really need to front load. This has been the theme that we've heard, although some say that they're going to also continue after that. Nonetheless, that two-year yield has really been parabolic. We are almost a 4.6%. We are pricing in 5% Fed funds rates next year. This is a game changer for how far the Fed can go and how much this market will withstand. Farrow doesn't like to do math in the 6 o'clock hour. Lisa and I are going to do math now. Stay with us on radio, please. From a huge negative 10-year real yield up to where we were today, a new high in the 10-year real yield, 1.69%. We've made it 88% of the way back to where I was before the great financial crisis. We're getting back to what I knew was normal. And this is key. It's the real yield. It is not just nominal yield. It is being driven by this feeling that the Fed is going to have to have a higher base rate than it's had and higher relative to inflation at a time when again, people gaming out. What did we hear yesterday from one bank from BNP, 5 and a quarter percent Fed funds rate? These are the kinds of projections to hearing out on Wall Street rate. One other idea here in Pivot Thursday, maybe Corota will pivot, maybe the Bank of Japan, and critically the Ministry of Finance. Well, Pivot, I woke up to a 150-year yen. That's historic back a zillion years, the 1990. And people are calling about intervention. You also saw the 10-year Japanese bond trade above the range. By the way, we're opening ourselves up to all sorts of criticism with Pivot. People are going to send us gifs of people dancing and pivoting. And the Fed's going to pivot. It's been dragged under the mud or raked under the colds, whatever kind of acronym that you want, based on the idea that the Fed is not going to retrace. And that's sort of what it's been associated with. And I think that the market's pivoting away from that. Lisa, for the American audience here on the chaos in London, all I can say is I woke up to its more immediate for Prime Minister Trust than it was 24 hours ago. Yeah, her Tory peers are basically saying get out. I mean, really, they're really saying, we hope she doesn't last the night. That was one of the MPs. That was what they said. We hope that she doesn't last the night. For those of you framing caution, Max Kettner is going to join us quickly here. We're going to get through the brief. Let me do the data real quickly here. Read on the screen. Ever so slight futures negative 12. The VIX really goes nowhere for six weeks 31 level on the VIX and the yield structure. Simple 4.58 percent was 4.60 percent two year yield, 10 year yield 4.14 percent oil, not part of the story today. And dollar really interesting with real Pacific Rim weakness. And I do want to note Chinese stocks really not doing all that well. I don't know about you, but let's pivot to a brief. Let's pivot to 830. And that's a nice initial jobless claims. Really curious to see whether they start to take up. I mean, if you look at the actual line of initial jobless claims since the pandemic, it looks like it's flat lining. It looks like someone died. This is the question. When does it come back up and start to really give a sense that there is this loosening in a labor market that really has been quite tight today. The talk show that is Fed speak includes Philadelphia Fed president Patrick Harker, Fed governor Philip Jefferson, Fed governor Lisa Cook, and Fed governor Michelle Bowman. I know you love this time. Jim Bullard though yesterday said a tone that we're going to hear more of that it is important to front load, but it is also important to wait because of the lag effect. I'm going to listen to Harker. I think he's got a great, great concept there with his business background of the manufacturing of the Philadelphia region. And with earnings coming out today off of Procter and Gamble yesterday. It's a rich ad also know I believe American airlines out. Yeah, so let's talk about some of the earnings.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4846,2022-10-20 10:05:55
16501," and Gamble yesterday. It's a rich add also know I believe American Airlines out. Yeah, so let's talk about some of the earnings We do get American Airlines. We also get Blackstone at freeport Mac Moran. I'm curious about that. That shell space snap and whirlpool just the big industrial companies. I'm very curious about the tool business for snap I mean it's gonna be amazing to see what they do Step on what do you think it is? Is it snap or snap on that we're gonna see it's snap It's social media thing. It isn't necessarily a tool belt. I'm just curious. Providing clarity Bramble incredible. Bramble's favorite guest joins us right now. He's hugely popular with the Bloomberg surveillance audience worldwide HSBC's chief multi-asset strategist Max Katner Max when does the gloom lift? Yeah, good morning Tom. I think it's gonna take some time still I just cannot see risk assets. I cannot see equities really forming a bottom before we see the correlation between Risk assets and rates turn negative. Why is that well very simple because that would tell us that the market is switching into proper recession Concerns all that we've talked about I've listened to you guys just now all that we're talking about still is inflation So all what we're still talking about is well is there gonna be further upside-to-prize And surprises and inflation in the UK in kind of you know, we've seen the UK broadly in line yesterday That all that is still enough to inflict broad-based pain across the asset classes and that is our positioning still Julian manual over every quarter does a daily note now folks in earnings season he talks about forming the dry Kindling of what could be a bull market Max you know the market gets out front of the Econobabble Is the market doing that right now? No, it's not really doing it unfortunately because I think what we have is we have an almost abnormal obsession with all Things in inflation right whether that is you know the the claims data today whether that is you know Tier two data like inflation expectations from the University of Michigan Survey for example that the problem that we're facing now if you want to jump on any kind of relief trait Any kind of Goldilocks trait the big big issue that you've got doing that is That none of those data can get in your way So none of the CPIs or PC's or PPI's or NFPs or claims or indeed any of the global inflation data can get in your way So the risk reward on jumping on such sort of a relief rally or year-end relief rally is Extremely poor it's an extremely poor risk rewards where the data just can simply get in your way and Really smack your trade this seems like almost a consensus the bearishness around Wall Street at least the expectation for some sort of downturn Where there's a much bigger controversy is around the long end of the Treasury curve 10 year treasuries with some people saying They're headed higher because we are going to lead to a more inflationary environment and then HSBC Which is saying actually probably not are you actually incredibly bullish right now on the longer end of US yield curves? I'm not quite yet, right? I don't think we're quite at the point yet So we need to see a couple of things happening And so for example one of them is if we see certain parts of the yield curve move further towards inversion We know that two's tenses inverted But we also know that the two's tens part of the curve is usually the one that's pretty much the worst of the common yield curves Insignalling in its signaling effect in terms of a recession. It is much better if you look at three months tense Or if you look indeed at what Powell was saying a couple quarters ago the front end forward spread those are still not flat Those are still Actually in positive territory. So we need to see them actually first at least flat until we can really go And play that sort of end of cycle Recession trade and then on the other hand the reality is that hard activity data are still pretty strong, right? So we all feel miserable Everything that we're talking about is pretty much flat-outs doom and gloom and misery and that is you know consumer confidence That's based on PMIs and all the surveys and the soft data But the heart data are still actually holding up pretty well and that keeps yields still a bit on the on the upside So that again, we need to see that change a bit that the heart data surprises start to converge towards",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4847,2022-10-20 10:10:12
16502," And that keeps yields still a bit on the upside. So again, we need to see that change a bit that the heart data surprises start to converge towards the soft data surprises. Then it's time to switch into sovereigns. So Max, given that you have to recommend an allocation, is it just 100% cash? No, absolutely not. I think in actual fact, we've just moved into maximum overweight commodities this morning because we are quite concerned about not only the demand side of things, right? It's possible, for example, gas to oil switching, particularly in Europe, so not only on the demand side of things, but particularly also on the supply side of things, really, a few really underappreciated supply concerns that keep us quite bullish actually now for the next couple of months on energy at the moment. We do like value of a growth in equities. We do like things like insurance, things like food and beverage. So we need the fences, not only just cash. We got to go, Max, give me a Brent crude price. I mean, forge a commodity optimism into what Brent crude does. Do we go back over 100? I think we're going to go back over 100. We've got a hundred sort of average for Q4. So that's probably means, you know, it's going to take a bit of time back to the range where we've been up until two months ago. Max, Kenner, thank you so much for the HSTC. And within the pivots of today, we're going to go to Britain here in a moment on all that's going on with Lizzie Burden, I believe scheduled to be with us so if we can link up with her, I believe 10 Downing Street. I just, a research report is really fluid right now in the earnings season, about 20% coming in. Lisa, Oliver Chan channeling what we talked about yesterday. What was the stock that went down to 45% yesterday? Oh, yeah. The olaplex. The olaplexer at Watter. He comes out with a deep 35 page research note on Sephora. And everybody watching, you know, has young girls knows what Sephora is. And Chan is robust on Sephora and robust on Alta, and ought to be based on what I see coming in. Well, and there was a story in Business Week that I was reading this morning about how the wealthy consumers keep spending at really accelerating. Yeah, Dana Chelsea mentioning. And this is really the divergence between the desiles as you talk about where the upper desile keeps spending. And actually, a lot of these companies like LVMH can increase prices at a much more rapid level. Yeah, from quarter-frivolv, exactly. Way way above on March. How does that factor into overall inflation when you have a significant portion of the population flat on its back? I agree. And you may be of two markets here. Where you've got the caution of Max Kettner, but you've also got some optimism as Julian Manuel speaks of futures at negative 14. Coming up from London, Lizzie Burton joins us. This is Bloomberg. MUSIC Keeping you up today with Newsom around the world with the first word. I'm Lisa Mateo. Liz Truss' premier ship is looking increasingly fragile after a day of drama at Westminster. The British leader fired one minister over a security breach. And two others were heard resigning amid the fallout from a chaotic commons vote before agreeing to stay in their posts. Many conservative lawmakers now want Truss to resign immediately. Ukrainians are being warned about rolling blackouts because of damage to the country's power infrastructure from Russian missile attacks with President Vladimir Zelensky urging people to use as little electricity as possible. Zelensky has said about 3% of Ukrainian power stations have been destroyed since October 10th. And Italy's Silvio Berlusconi has told lawmakers that President Zelensky forced Russian President Vladimir Putin into an endless war. That's according to an audio obtained by an Italian newswire that recording reveals the existing pressure on the right-wing coalition at one elections last month to soften Italy's stance toward Russia. And Netflix top executives continue to battle it out over releasing more of its original movies and theaters. The Wall Street Journal reports some argue Netflix is leaving hundreds of millions in box office receipts on the table by showing select movies in a few theaters for a few weeks. While others feel theater showings create buzz for the streaming service.

Apple's the link, its next major iPad software update, iPadOS 16 by about a month from September to October. Apple made the decision for a number of reasons, including a still buggy, stage manager multitasking interface, and an order to link the launch closer to the more similar Mac OS Ventura. Still, it's an unusual move. Since shifting the launches to the fall in 2011, Apple has released its new iPhone and iPad software updates simultaneously each year around September. By staggering the releases, users may find some issues around compatibility with cross-device features like retracting and editing messages in iMessage, the new shared iCloud Photo Library, and the new feature for transferring FaceTime calls between iPhones and iPads. It will also make it a bit harder for developers to launch apps that run on both the iPad and iPhone that require new APIs and features found across iPadOS 16 and iOS 16. Regardless, it was still of course the right move. Stage manager on iPadOS 16 is still quite buggy, I don't find it particularly intuitive, and it's not compatible with most iPads and many third-party apps on the app store. The feature clearly needs some more polish, and complaints from consumers about stage manager will now no longer probably overshadow the earlier launch of the iPhone 14. What does it mean?

16504," Watch Wednesday's on Bloomberg Television. Bloomberg, Savannah, Celeza, Brown, Suntime, King, John Ferrell, on assignment this morning, futures in negative 13. The VIX-31 yield higher, yen prints 150 week yen, but all eyes in international relations and in politics turned towards London. David Blanchflower will join us in a moment with his work for the Bank of England and now at Dartmouth, but first, in front of 10 Downing Street, I guess his history is made at Lizzie Burton. Lizzie, there is so much speculation and of course the British press is abiced under its own. Let me go to the discussion of this committee that makes the rules for this beleaguered conservative party. Tell us what the 1922 committee is thinking on a Thursday. Well, the wind seems to have changed in Westminster Tom because yesterday it seemed as if the Tory party was going to give Liz Truss a chance to cling on until at least the Halloween budget, but since all of the chaos yesterday over the fracking vote, the resignation of Swela Braven in the home secretary now there is massive pressure for Truss to resign. So the discussions behind the scenes are who is going to replace Truss and it seems to be, well, they are talking about Richie Soonach, they are talking about Penny Morden, Summer calling for Boris Johnson saying that he has got the biggest mandate of anyone because he actually faced a general election. I don't know if you can hear the protesters, I don't want to overfleet and fleet their influence. I'm not sure if you can hear the other day, but he is calling for Tory's out. But that is the fear. If they replace Liz Truss, the fear is there to be a general election. Lizzy, 20 seconds here in between protests from the gentleman and truning, what is the likelihood that the Prime Minister will resign today for the American audience waking up? Is this immediate or is this something where she gets to the weekend? I can only tell you that the international press is gathering here, discussing, making sure that they are on shift to cover it if the lectern comes out. And peas behind the scenes say they are hours to go. The photographers keep shouting, Range Rover because you have got Ministers coming and going, you see the cheeswit, you see the chairman of the Conservative Party, it seems that the discussions are ongoing for who should succeed Liz Truss. So it could be hours. Saving petrol in their range, Rover. Thank you so much, Lizzy Bird. In front of 10 Downing Street will continue to follow the story with Bloomberg News's government to him in London. Right now the perfect guest for this moment for his beleaguered London, nothing like this ever happened in his wells from Cardiff David Blanchflower joins us. He is Dartmouth professor of economics. We are a former Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee member. David, I guess I want to avoid the politics. And just within the chaos of London, what the commonwealth outcome is for the people of the United Kingdom. Whether Labor, whether Tory, New Tory government, will England be poorer in 12 months? Well, I think so, I think it's clear that there's a risk premium that's happened since that terrible, mini budget that's come. The financial chaos, actually I think Tom, is what's driven the politics. So what you saw is a budget that was not, they didn't work out what the funding was, they fired the peronisecord at the Treasury. They said more tax cuts are coming and the markets didn't like it. So we saw the pension funds collapsing. We saw mortgage markets not being able to price products. So that kind of chaos has caused the politics. And I think it's caused the economics and it's caused people to be poor. I mean, Ben Broadbent, the governor of the bank, one of the deputy governors came out today saying, this is not looking good on the downside. And maybe the bank won't be able to raise rates as much as the markets are thinking. But this is sort of apoplectic. I mean, I've never seen anything happen so quickly. And remember the economy, it was the economy says, they didn't think that Trump...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4850,2022-10-20 10:23:15
16505," thinking, but this is sort of apoplectic. I mean, this is, I've never seen anything happen so quickly. And remember that the economy, I think it was the economist says they didn't think that trust had the shelf life of a lettuce. And it turns out that the lettuce is probably going to win. But the British people actually, in fact, are going to lose. Well, it depends what kind of lettuce I suppose, Danny. I am curious. Well, they posted it. You can see it a lot. Exactly. They have a believe a lot, yes. So 160 people from Pesco's. What's your question? What's your sense, though? You would say initially when this all transpired, you thought that the Bank of England should raise rates by 100 basis points and an emergency meeting in order to get some credibility in markets. They didn't. And they won in terms of markets moving toward them. What do they have to do next month when they come back together and try to understand how to approach an economy that's going to weaken one way or another and plans that look much more like austerity than anything else on a fiscal level? Right. I mean, I mean, in a sense, Lisa, it's asking me what's going to happen in the next 24 hours. We don't exactly know. I mean, obviously the problem is that there are arguments on the one hand to say you need to stabilize the currency to worry about inflation. But actually the data from yesterday suggests that the UK's hit peak inflation. And then the evidence is actually that the economy is going to slow. I mean, especially, well, we don't know what's coming. We heard that lots of spending cuts were coming. But that was yesterday. So I think the Bank's going to be in a position where there's very strong arguments on one hand to raise rates and on the other hand to cut. Right. I mean, what they got to do is calm nerves. That's really what they've got to do, Lisa. For Professor Boyle-Clawert, what changes if labor takes over? What, you know, within the mess of this, what happens if it's Prime Minister Starmer? Well, I mean, I think you're going to see things at the edges. But I think essentially what he keeps. And if I was advising him, I would say, what you're going to have to do is take, you can't really do anything much to start with. And Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said this, you've got to get in, try and calm nerves, work out what the right strategy is. They'll probably, I think the thing they would probably do on the first day would be to impose a winful tax on the all companies. And the CEO of Shell has even said that's probably a sensible thing to do. They may well go and impose a winful tax on the banks. But I don't think they're going to move very far because the chaos that's going on is really, I would never see anything quite like it. So the political chaos now is feeding back to the economic chaos. And they're going to have to calm nerves and say, we're not going to do anything stupid. We're going to pull back that mini budget. We're going to talk to our opponent, Secretary. We're going to talk to the OBR. And we're going to think where we go. But I think they've made that clear that they're going to have to sit and take stock. Because you don't, you know, you want to be in a situation where you're trying to catch a falling knife. And if you ask me these questions in an hour, the answer might be different because it looks. Well, what was that? Come back in an hour. David Blanchard, thank you so much. With Dartmouth College, greatly appreciate it. A moveable, at least. I just looked at a technical study, Lisa Bramo, it's of sterling. And when the moving average is converged to a point like this, whatever your setup is, that's where we are right now. We're at a point here at 111.97. And you just wonder, and do the markets again tell the politicians whether Tory or Labor what to do with, you know, you pick your level on sterling where it goes weaker, drives weaker. It gets more complicated from here. Because on one hand, you do have yields coming down on the long end, which is positive, at least for the Bank of England. But you do see a weakening, a pervasive weakening, and perhaps not to the recent lows, but still nonetheless, the pound has lost a lot of its international cloud. When you do have everyone calling for austerity, you do have this expected lower growth picture, no matter what happens. And so what is the market calling for? Right? What's the break point going to be? What are they going to really lobby the Tories or anyone else to do? But it is a political battle in folks, I wish Farrah, where are they? Where's Farrah? What's he doing? You keep telling him, you keep mocking his dislike, his disdain of the Dow playing fusing. I don't know, is a glass door out in Burrow giving a paper for you? He's on a well-deserved day off. Have a great time. Futures at negative 10, sterling. Keep telling him, thank you. 111.98.

While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today won't be electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building to crowds America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels, we want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Access to financial world on demand.

16507," It picking up the one earnings last night after the bell, we saw alkoa earnings. And this is one of the biggest of the oil of the, excuse me, the metal giants. And they came out really disappointing. And you can see those shares absolutely plummeting. This is a bellweather. How many more bellweathers do we have to have? These are not, you're not seeing the same kind of demand for electronic goods that use metals, for cars that use metals from China. How much do we start to see that kind of theme as we get earnings trickling out? Yeah, what's so interesting here is alkoa was the first to report out of Pittsburgh. They used to take huge pride in reporting early. Now everybody's caught up with alkoa where they're in the first wave of earnings that are coming out. Yeah, but the interesting thing is is that it's not a good signal. So how many of these do you need to see? There are those that can pass well, look at proctoring animals headwinds yesterday. Exactly. The FX headwinds and you're seeing that also from IBM still managing to beat, but for how long? And again, these are kind of a themes that I'm looking at to try to understand exactly what we're going. Alkoa, 10 years old, it returns 6.4% per year. Wow, is the aluminium business been a challenge? It's been a challenge and how much has there been a lack of investment at a time when there was a shortage of real world stuff? There's also a shortage of houses, which is the reason why the prices have been bit up and we keep getting housing data that shows plummeting sentiment, yet prices hanging in there. What point do we move on? Sandra Philippine has been covering this all over at ABN Amro and the meaning behind some sort of significant correction in the housing market. She's chief economist there, Sandra. How concerned are you as we start to see yields rise and we start to see some of the evaluations of housing across the world plummet? How concerned are you at this being a note of instability going forward? I'm very concerned, but also I'm not that certain yet of this being the start of a major house price correction. I think what you should realize what we're seeing here is a steep correction after a very steep rise of house prices. That could also be the air out of the market where depending on which region you're looking at, because this is all very institutionally determined. In a lot of housing markets, what you're basically seeing is that there's a huge shortage. Price rises have been massive. That has been basically eroding affordability before the war. And the interest rate rises translated into mortgage rate rises and that could be a trigger event. However, the shortages are still there. So if there is a fast price correction of some percentages, that could also mean that affordability comes back and that would mean that transactions would come back and that would be the support for the housing market. That's what I'm saying. But there could be a big concern. There could be something significant that happens and this is sort of the imbalance that people are looking at on a broader sense, looking out when you see yields rise to this degree. Do you feel that it is sustainable on a global basis or do you feel like we're seeing the beginnings of certain triggers that really cause some sort of violent end? Yes, well, there are numerous risks currently out there that could lead to a violent end. So if you saw the mortgage demand in the US declined with 86 percent, that is quite shocking. And actually, so I just mentioned our base case, which is still for kind of a moderate correction, but you could indeed imagine something much more severe. And the way to think of that is if you just take the mortgage rate rises in most countries between kind of new mortgages now and let's say six months ago is about a 4 percent difference. If you would assume that people cannot afford higher monthly payments, especially not in these inflationary times, that would mean that their lending capacity is decreasing 20 to even 35 percent. And if that were the house price correcting that we would be looking at a disaster.

You talk about an America landing softly in a rapid deterioration within Europe. How does Lagarde and ECB adjust to that reality? Well, I think, I mean, Lagarde and ECB are mainly focused, of course, on what's happening in Europe and the nature of the problem are really quite more severe in Europe. But still, I think that Lagarde is mainly worried about inflation expectations at this point in time. And, yeah, and, of course, how all these shortages, even though gas prices are declining significantly, the real worry is now really kind of people are getting more and more aware that the real worry is not only about this winter shortages, but also next winter shortages, and non-run adaptation potential. Sandra, I'm fairly you, but I'm going to rip up the script right now. We've got to do that. Sandra Philbin of ABN Amaro here, a telegraph reporting on a speech that's a secure car, a starmer is giving in Brighton, where he says, we need a general election now. Sandra, how would a general election now in the United Kingdom change the financial markets in the city? Well, I think that could be, well, in the first moments, give more uncertainty, but in the middle to long run, it would definitely provide more certainty, because I do think that the situation now is basically not reassuring. And, I mean, of course, now it's not reassuring at all, but the problem I think that markets are really digesting this still, is that what we've seen in the last few weeks with trust is basically a situation where politics and financial markets and the Bank of England are really not moving in the same direction, also eroding each other's credibility. And this confidence crisis is basically not solvable, and I think markets are starting to price in the idea that whatever you turn is going to happen. Right. Nobody is guaranteed that there will be a new turn around the corner a week from now. Sandra, thank you so much. Sandra Philip and with us with ABN Amaro, and we do see a weakening of sterling, I would suggest off this idea of a general election, and he's like, where's Farrell? I mean, you know, you and I don't know what we're talking about. Let's just be, you know, it's like, what? And that's where we are, but the answer is, it's telegraph reporting that this is a farmer in a public speech saying, let's go, let's get a general election out there. I agree with Ms. Philip in that that would clear uncertainty. Well, certainly there needs to be some sort of changing of a guard, and that's what we hear. And it's not good for any party or any political regime to have so much dissent publicly with people calling for someone to step down. Looking at this backdrop, though, there is a larger takeaway over the past few weeks, which is that governments are constrained by what the market lets them do. That is what the electorate is about. And the electorate. And this is a new paradigm. This idea that markets are in charge, the popular support is in charge, and they cannot make violent moves away from what they will be allowed in markets. And this is a new regime that's really foisted upon them, but the fact that money costs something. And that has been the lesson from the United Kingdom, and they are not alone in that. That's very much a lesson for Europe, and it's very much a lesson for the US. Let us stop here moving into the end of October, and Max Kettner, HSPC, was talking about his year ahead piece, which people are starting to talk about. And you know, Lisa, where you say, what's different now is money costs something. And that's a massive generational change for X percent of the people watching surveillance. We heard that from Senator Warren. On earlier this week with David Weston, and he was saying it's really important to reduce the deficit. It's important to be cognizant of how much we're spending. It's a renewed fiscal discipline that, again, has been caused by where the market is. The fact you cannot spend. People are talking about reducing the deficits. So at what point does that really push policy in another direction and hold them accountable? I would argue that the UK is a prime example of that. Yeah, I'm watching Sterling.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4854,2022-10-20 10:40:36

Yeah, I'm watching Sterling here folks really off the Bloomberg. We do this on a wonderful day as we saw Yang goes through 150 earlier this morning for those keeping score at home through 1170. When you go out for digits on a currency, that's a PIP. So you say that's a Gladys Knight in the PIPs, which you probably don't get. I get that. I do get that. And I would also argue that you rounded up yesterday. So I don't even know. Yeah, but it's how they quote for disdessimal points in Atlanta down in Georgia. But the answer is Sterling here through 117, he is a weaker Sterling this morning. Meanwhile, we're getting earnings continue to roll out in the US AT&T the latest. And what I find interesting is people turning to utilities is a real bastion of safety at a time when people still pay their wireless bills and AT&T did beat expectations on that exact fact. People are going to pay their wireless bills arguably before they pay their rent. I mean, people want their phones. And that's something that we live every single day. Let's talk about this in terms of pricing powers we heard from Procter and Gamble yesterday. I know all of you are living it on radio and TV 10 year total return. What's left of the telephone of my youth flat per year? Okay. 10 years. Fair. That's not acceptable. Okay. But that right now, you're getting a little bit of a pop and at least they're maintaining what they've had. The point is they're not necessarily losing to the same degree as some of the other. They're losing less than one of the years. Exactly. And they're losing less on a relative basis. And the fact that people are talking about them is a bastion. And you know what else? Am I just to buy an equity of the gross yield of 7.1 percent? I think there are a lot of people who are saying it's pretty attractive when you have, you know, the risk in other stocks. Other people are saying it's important to look at multi-nationals outside of the U.S. that can have the reverse effect of the dollar headwind. If the dollar's fine, those are the ones right. Well, we're going to, I mean, that's something people are going to think about. And a handful of day of earnings, Julian Emanuel mentioning 20 percent of market cap is already reported. We'll give you coverage of this on surveillance through the coming weeks, including that tech overload. Is it next week we get massive tech overload? We'll have to see on that.

Keeping you up to date with Newsom around the world with the first word, I'm Liz Mateo. Officials in China are said to be debating whether to reduce the amount of time people entering the country must spend in quarantine. They're considering setting the period to two days in a hotel and then five days at home versus the current seven days in a hotel and three at home. The country's COVID-zero policy is leaving it increasingly isolated from the rest of the world. Hong Kong is reportedly looking to allow VIP bankers who test positive for COVID-19 during a gathering next month. Leave the city via private jet. About 200 people from global firms, including banks, securities companies and asset managers are said to attend the two-day HKMA summit. Infected guests without their own planes may be allowed to isolate in their hotel rooms. Australian employment unexpectedly stalled in September while the jobless raid held steady a result that reinforces the reserve bank's decision to slow the pace of policy tightening. Employment advanced by just 900 people from August well shy of the 25,000 gained forecast by economists. Unemployment held at 3.5%. Our May sales have surged as luxury shoppers in China return to stores after pandemic restrictions eased, snapping a berk in and kelly and bags. Third quarter revenue rose 24%. Excluding currency swings, topping analyst estimates, the results are more evidence that producers of luxury goods remain largely immune to the wider squeeze of spending.

We want to do trade, we want to be treated like partners. The Chinese came along and said, great, we don't do aid and charity, we want to do business with you. Global gateway will mobilize 300 billion euros till 2027. Now the US and Europe are answering back with their own infrastructure initiatives to counter China. But African experts are skeptical. China has been that guy around the corner with a bouquet of flowers to Africa, the US and Europe and the UK have time and time again say be careful of the flowers you see out of the window, they have funds on them. Lots happening on Wall Street. I think Che Powell said things that were indefensible. Need to catch up. This is Bloomberg Wall Street week. I'm David Weston. We've got the information and insights. We think that's the next sector. From businesses most influential and instrumental. It's mocking it at the bullfrog. It's a challenging dynamic. This is a level of uncertainty that we've had to deal with. Bloomberg Wall Street week live Friday with replays all weekend on Bloomberg Television Radio. Is it possible the industries in an arms race that will lead to spending itself into an oversupply? I mean that has happened before. We've looked at this very carefully and the digitization of everything. Tell me what aspect of your life Emily isn't becoming more digital. I'm trying to prevent that but yeah, it's happening. And COVID has accelerated that. The industry cost $500 billion last year. The semiconductor industry overall. And estimates are $1 trillion a doubling by the end of the decade at that point. I believe those estimates. It's not that there's not going to be some blips and turns on the way. And the majority of that is driven by leadership process technology of which only three companies can satisfy that need. My message to the American Energy companies is this.

And thank you for watching the micro-Nesia. Guilts, British Guilts extend their game. This is price up, yield down, and Lisa from a 5%-ish level down to 3.87% on the 30-year British guilt. I'm sorry. I'm busy watching the live stream of a head of lettuce and seeing whether it's lettuce. I'm just to our American audience, because most Greek to me too. Tabloids in the UK have a live stream of a head of lettuce from Tesco. And they want to see if that will outlast Liz Trust's Prime Minister ship. And there's an even an entire betting system around this with people betting on the lettuce. Well, it's a movable story. Let us go to some of the breaking news. They're Lizzy Bird and outside 10 Downing Street. As well. Lisa, why don't you bring in Kevin Book? But Lisa, you and I saw something yesterday, both of us have never seen, which is a White House is Wall Street oil strategist. OK, one of the most stunning things that I saw yesterday was the White House putting a floor under crude prices. It's $67 to $71, $72 a barrel as an attempt to shore up confidence by oil companies so that they would invest. What does this say to the rest of the market in terms of how closely they will be intervening at a time where it's unclear what they can do on the key products of refined goods? Kevin Book is joining us head of research at Clearview Energy Partners. What did you make yesterday, Kevin, of all of the rhetoric out of the White House? Good morning, Lisa and Tom. Look, let me back up just a little bit and ask a question about where we are in market democracy. Markets essentially allocate by pricing scarcity. Democracy's allocate power through popularity and scarcity isn't popular. So something's got to give. You can ask, are we looking at markets as they were in the answer? I think you were referred to this just a few minutes ago. Is no, absolutely not. Governments are stepping in. We call it an age of intervention. But on the supply side, there's not a lot that governments, especially the government of the United States, can do because it doesn't have an oil company. So it's trying to send a signal to the companies that are out there that there is some demand that the government is willing to provide and therefore a floor on prices. Not obviously going to convince when the prices skewed $20 to the upside of that floor, but it could have some potential to persuade if that free hedge stays on the books long enough for companies to use it. Kevin, none of this really makes sense unless you view it through a political lens because gasoline prices have come down dramatically and the real problem remains in diesel. And you're seeing those prices remain high and stockpiles fall to the lowest levels in decades. And there is very real concern that we will not have enough heading into the winter. What's your view on why now and what could actually be done and how perilous the situation in the diesel stockpiles really is? Well, perilous because in February, the European Union is supposed to block imports of Russian products, which means that if those products don't find other markets, more diesel scarcity coming when we're already short. One thing we didn't see yesterday, Lisa, was a product export limit. It had been talked about, it's been talked about since March. June, a lot, September, continuously, nothing yesterday, but I don't know that we're done, Tom. Well, this is important. Lisa Grille, Brian D. Shus today, on the sunny export question, explained to our audience the ambiguities of a US exporting hydrocarbons versus a US saying, no, we're done with that. Yeah, we've been essentially exporting products on a net basis for more than a decade and really going gangbusters with diesel price signals out there in the world calling for our inventories as an essential moderating part of balancing the market. And so, inventories are extremely low in the Northeast, 60% more than 60% below the five-year average for distillate fuel. That's a real concern for policymakers going into the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4857,2022-10-20 10:53:35
16512," And so, infinitories are extremely low in the Northeast. 60 percent, more than 60 percent below the five-year average for distal at fuel. That's a real concern for policymakers going into the risks of shortage. I look Kevin at the price of oil and one thing we can say, and I'm beginning to see little tealies of China capitulating on quarantine of travel. In your Clevver model, is there the idea demand comes back in Asia? And what does that do to Bren at 93? Well, if we've been looking at the Chinese effect on demand, depressing crude prices, relative to where they might go, again, let's just back up. Russian fossil fuel exports, 5.5 percent of global consumption for decades. We're now missing 1.3 percentage points with more to fall away. If you come on the demand side strong from China, and you're going to tighten markets a lot, and you might argue, inventories are still below the five-year average for global petroleum and moe CD stocks. That means that there's still room, but of course, OPEC just cut. Well, Kevin, go ahead. Just real quick. No, I want to link this into what we're seeing over in Europe because you were talking about the potential export control. Where could we see the price of diesel? How much could we see it increase? How could we see the price of natural gas increase? If there is some sort of export ban or even not, but just based on where inventories are right now? Well, we don't think that we're likely to see a natural gas export limit. Lisa here in the United States, the White House, I think, has been pretty clear about trying to support allies by providing supply. But in terms of permitting new plants, in terms of getting through the regulatory process, high prices here at home may be already starting to put the brakes on now. In terms of diesel exports, you know, about 10 percent of distillate in the US is exported to Europe. So significant but not dominant from our export portfolio. We export zero gasoline, right? The gasoline price is really the political meter that so many people watch. But more than half of our gasoline goes to Mexico. So if there's export limits on hydrocarbons writ large, particularly on liquid fuels, then there's other parts of the world that could be short a lot sooner. Kevin Trivick-Bree, thank you so much. Kevin Book, Clearview Energy here. And with oil up a stick, 86.98, make it $87 American oil, $94 Brent Crude. And I mean, that's not that far from 100. We have, as we mentioned, many pivots today. And one of them is the continuing news flow out of the United Kingdom. Grant Brady is with this, for me, not strange. That's the wrong word, but foreign, 1922 committee. He runs it. These are the committee that makes the rules. Lisa, if a prime minister comes or goes, how many votes are needed, how do you get to one candidate, two candidates, five candidates, et cetera? And he's walked through the door of 10 Downing Street. The clock is ticking. And I will just say that you're seeing the metaphor of that head of lettuce on Twitter, pretty much lighting up the screen, as people say. It looks like it's going to win. How much are we looking at the last hours, as Lizzie Burden said, of Liz Truss' Prime Minister ship? But what comes next, right? Because it's coming at a time when the economy is facing a really difficult moment, where right now the Tories are flat on their backs. But there isn't a clear leader. Do we actually see Boris Johnson come back? I don't sure that much. It's not our territory, but I will make clear, folks. The idea of prime minister Johnson returning is not in the zeitgeist this morning. It's about the former chancellor, Mr. Sunak. I even don't hear Michael Gov, what you talked about, is well. But again, it's a movable feast. I would say at seven o'clock here, Wall Street time, the dialogue has changed for Lizzie Burden just in the last 60 minutes, as well, at 10 Downing Street. We're following that story. We're following higher yields. Futures go green now. Futures up 11. It's too much optimism. We've got to speak with Chris Arvey.

16513," Shortly. Today, what is the biggest challenges for General Dynamics and what are the biggest opportunities? So I think in any business, the challenges are solving complex problems that come to you. The problems that come to me and my senior leadership team for resolving tend to be highly complex and nettlesome. So your ability to solve those complex problems is an important element, I think of the value that we add to the company. And then I think opportunities, you always want to make sure that you've got a creative enough mind and open enough mind to be able to see around square corners. What am I missing? You know, the why questions are really powerful, why are we not doing this, so why are we doing this? I ask those questions a lot and in the answers, you can sometimes tease out some real opportunities, some hidden things. But thinking creatively about opportunities and problems is really important. What about the industry generally? I think they have big challenges now as the defense budget probably comes down a bit. So I think that we are all responsible and we have an obligation to find the latest and best technologies that we can for our customers and deliver them the most cost effective manner we can. And I think that that's a challenge and an opportunity for all of the big defense companies. Today's CFOs are reshaping the C suite positioning companies to meet the next generation of challenges breaking out of traditional roles.

They're not at levels where one can say we can declare victory now. Over the next three to six months, we still have a lot of monetary policy tightening ahead of us. It may be some time before we get back to the low rates. I don't see. I don't see two percent rates coming back anytime soon.

So let's just talk about what we're looking at today quickly at 30 a.m. we get a US initial jobless claims do we see that tick up that so many fed members are looking for in this perverse reality where a softening economy is actually exactly what they're looking for we get a host of fed speak Philadelphia fed president Patrick Harker Tom will be watching that closely fed governor Philip Jefferson fed governor Lisa cook fed governor Michelle Bowman among the many voices and then earnings do continue we did just get blackstone which was a beat will go into that later free port mac moron coming out as well American airlines snap and world pool all after the bell snap and world pool in particular how much do we get a feeling is 20% of the s and p has reported that that we are in a good phase because right now if you take a look at alkoa those shares down almost 11% on the heels of a disappointment a bell weather potentially the metal industry am I right that it's each each company is a different story i don't see a holistic thing here right now the pressures are holistic fx pressures front and for first and foremost among them but how they cope with them and their pricing power is different depending on who their customer are and depending on how essential their goods are to what people do their lives let's do what you need which is re-calibration the equity markets here at 37 19 on the standard of force 500 Christopher Harvey joins us how to equity strategy at Wells Fargo Chris let's get to your breaking news some Wells Fargo and that's simply you go a little bit tepid on the banks what did mr. diamond get wrong he didn't get anything wrong we've been thinking about down creating the banks from overweight for some time it just doesn't fit with our sector of things we really want to reduce our exposure to sick locality we really want to barbell more defensive assets with garpy type assets and banks just infid in there the it's more of a macro issue than anything else and and if you look at how banks reporting look at the numbers they popped they're performing in line with the market we thought this was a good time just to step off this trade nothing that that we really don't like about the banks but we do think it's just more of a market perform as we think about things to sentiment or the macro sentiment's going to be an overhang and we just don't want to fight that we think there are better opportunities out there for us.

16515," stop because they're following what the front end is doing. But the valuation is really more about the tenure at this point. Time in the tenure is really caught up with what's happening over in Europe and the gravity European rates have on the tenure. Chris, I want to talk about a factor. Nobody ever talks about it. And I give a nod to the megged and decide who owns this at the London School of Economics. And that is a factor called profitability. About 18 months, out 12 months, will there be a partition between evidently profitable companies and those non-profitable? So Tom, when you think about profitability, actually when we think about quality, we think about balance sheets, we think about ROE, ROIC, we think about profitability and we think about net profit margins. And so it's very important for our quality factors and the way we characterize quality stocks. And so is it going to be important? Absolutely, it's going to be important. We think we're going into a higher quality environment. And so those companies that are higher profitable should be better, more rewarded by the marketplace. And we've seen that year to date. There's also a bit of a duration component to some of these things, but absolutely we look at profitability and we do think it's going to be very influential on stock pricing. It's something that's replacing a lot of focus on. Your SPX target here, out 12 months, you're doing a year in target, 1231-2023, help me. We have it. What we're saying about 2023 is we think the first half is going to be really sloppy. That's when we think numbers come down. That's when we think we're going to be dealing with recession. And what we want clients to do is on these rallies, we want them to reposition. We want them to get longer, quote unquote, momentum because that actually is a more defensive strategy. We want them to barbell momentum or low ball with some of the GARP type names. We've seen some good reports from some of these GARP names or some of the rated stocks. But we haven't put a 12-23 number out just yet. Chris, sorry. Thank you so much. Well, Fargo, security. Is any number of stories you're watching again in London? The travails of Prime Minister Tuss Pestan over at ITV says trust called for the meeting. I don't know what that means. But what we're really looking at is the follow-on to our conversation yesterday with Scott Kirby of United Airlines. And you know, you look at American Airlines and I really don't know the nuances. I mean, I don't know who's serving the best beverage of my choice. But what I see here is American Airlines telling me they're really back to 2019 business. Again, this is yet another major US airline coming out and beating expectations of shares popping after they came out. But really, this highlights how much people are willing to pay for tickets. People are wanting to travel regardless of how much you've seen the inflation really increase the cost of that. Also notable that American Airlines is on track to reduce debt levels by $15 billion by 2025. And this really feeds into a theme of a Bank of America fund manager survey where the highest proportion of investor surveys that it would like companies to use their cash to reduce debt than investing cat-backs or buy back their shares. The fiscal discipline is something that we're seeing not only for governments, but also for corporations. And now folks, we go to what matters. And you can ask a Raskooay reporting off our London desk in Paris on a small stock called Hermes. And they have Lisa the Birken 25 bag in Togo leather costing $7,242 in Hermes reporting. You can nudge that puppy up over $8,000 here with pricing. My favorite thing is that you look at me with a handbag. And it's you who's more interested in Hermes handbag than me. And I will just say this that with respect to all of these pricing, it goes back to luxury goods. You mentioned LVMH. Being able to continue to up their prices and sell just as much because you are seeing a real divergence, an even bigger divergence between the upper and the lower end households. You can see that with Hermes. Hermes opening on Madison Avenue in New York. And they announced today they will open a new store in Shanghai. Interesting. Interesting. I look forward to Asia opening up. So there's just too much optimism. Come back. This is Bloomberg. 8,000 for a handbag. What are we coming to?

Ukrainians are being warned of rolling blackouts because of damage to the country's power infrastructure from Russian missile attacks with President Vladimir Zelensky urging people to use as little electricity as possible. Zelensky has said about 30 percent of Ukrainian power stations have been destroyed since October 10th. And Italy's Sylvia Burskoni has told lawmakers that President Zelensky forced Russian President Vladimir Putin into an endless war. That's according to audio obtained by an Italian newswire. That recording reveals the existing pressure on the right-wing coalition that won elections last month to soften Italy's stance toward Russia. List Trust's premiership is looking increasingly fragile. After a day of drama at Westminster, the British leader fired one minister over a security breach and two others were heard resigning amid the fallout from a chaotic commons vote before agreeing to stay in their posts. Many conservative lawmakers now want trust to resign immediately. Australian employment unexpectedly stalled in September, while the jobless rate held steady, a result that reinforces the reserve bank's decision to slow pace of policy tightening. Employment advanced by just 900 people from August, well shy of the 25,000 gain forecast by economists. And employment held at 3.5%. Cargo volumes at the port of Los Angeles fell for a second month at September. The number of containers handled in a historically peak season were down 22 percent from a year ago, the lowest amount for September in seven years. The head of the nation's busiest container port says the outlook remains soft for the rest of 2022. Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quick Take. I'm Lisa Mateo. Yes, it's Bloomberg. The standard way venture firms work is you commit capital, let's say over a five year investment period, something like that. Yeah, exactly. And then the fund just typically has maybe 10 years or so. 15, well these days longer, so often 15, often the tail extends out to 20 years. These companies take a long time to develop. And somebody that invests in a venture fund today should be trying to get rates of return of 20 percent, what do you say, or more? Top and venture are sort of three X-net of fees. Ideally you're hoping for more than that, you're hoping for five X or more. You're illiquid the entire time, right? So you hope to get paid for the liquidity. And today, maybe 20 to 40 percent if things go well is sort of baseline. Let's take another subject. Because that's supposed somebody says, I don't want to invest in andries and Horowitz. I want to be Mark Andries. And how does somebody become a venture capitalist? One of the skill sets for good venture capitalists that is high degree of intelligence, hard work, lot of luck, dress the right part, don't wear a tie. What are the things that make one a good venture capitalist? So the super, the highly successful VCs historically are very idiosyncratic. You know, people from very different backgrounds, Mike Morris is a former newspaper reporter, John Doris of former chip salesman. You've got people with very different midge and brighter has more of this kind of blue chip investment background. You have people with very different backgrounds and experiences. So I think it's some set of skills and some set of knowledge. And then there seems to be a taste component to it that's really hard to measure and really hard to predict.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4862,2022-10-20 11:17:23

The difference between endless research and a winning strategy. To improve your firm's productivity and profitability, Bloomberg Law combines the latest and AI-powered tools and in-depth analysis to accelerate the research process. To grow your practice and make better use of your valuable time. The differences, Bloomberg Law. You've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. Lots of Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. What does it mean? It means they have a Bloomberg. It's pricing for another big, unexcited market. With exclusive expert analysis. Which aspects of the market are not sufficiently priced? Is this a macro-cute headwind? There is some bright light at the end of this panel. When can I stop on it? The fastest numbers and analysis you trust. We did not have a full briefing of the package the night before. To be fair, we had some briefing from them, ex ante, on the fiscal event, on the things they thought. It would be in, but we did not get the normal briefing that we would get for a budget. The Bank of England, deputy governor, John Confloss, a really interesting guy teaching at the University of Western Ontario years ago, hugely prestigious school in the Western atmosphere and, of course, doing duties for a bank of England. We've got all sorts of different news flow this morning. Futures now go green up 16. Now futures up 184. The VIX has been static for six weeks, 30.79. We're going to be 29 or 28. We'll get to the yield story here in a moment. For those of you waking up in America, it is different in the United Kingdom than it was yesterday. And certainly within the chaos of 10 days ago. Our guy Johnson is a student of this and joins us some London this morning. Guy, in your briefing to me this morning, you made clear something has changed in the economics and the politics of the chaos. So I think what's happening here, Tom, and we're waiting to see exactly what is happening with Liz Truss. Looks like we might be entering the end game there. What you're getting here is a divorce between the party pantomime that is taking place in Westminster right now. And what is happening with the politics of whether or not Liz Truss survives and who will replace her and who will be the chancellor. And what is happening in the city of London, the two feel like they're on very different pages now, Tom. You've got relative stability in the markets today. Little pop in the pound over the last half hour or so. But I don't think it's it is substantial enough to really merit a raising of an eyebrow. So you've now got basically stability macro stability, which allows maybe the end game of the politics to unfold. And what we saw last night, the chaos in Parliament, I think is now having the aftershock of that is now being felt. And Brady is now in.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4863,2022-10-20 11:21:40
16518," And what we saw last night, the chaos in Parliament, I think is now having the aftershock of that is now being felt. So, Grey and Brady is now inside 10 Downing Street. He is the guy that basically determines the kind of the rulebook as to how leadership challenges are mounted or not mounted. And I think we're watching potentially the end game unfold here, Lisa. How messy could this be? And what does that mean for markets? Because right now there's relative comm yields are lower across the board. You're seeing a little bit of stability in the pound. Yet if we start to get a general election or if we start to get some sort of sense of Boris Johnson coming back, what does that do to that stability? I think it's very hard to tell. I think the best case scenario here is that you either get Rissi Schoonak taking over as Prime Minister or you get hunt taking over as Prime Minister. If Rissi takes over, hunt remains as Chancellor. That is the kind of stability. Certainly I think the Conservative Party is craving after we saw what happened last night. Are they prepared to go back to Boris Johnson? Clearly there are those within the party. I note the Doris Tweet this morning who would like to see that happen. But I think it may be the moment for the Grey men. We saw that a few days ago being talked about and I think you're slowly seeing that becoming a reality here. They want stability, they crave stability. I'm not sure Boris Johnson would bring that back right now. We still potentially turn a half years away from a general election, Lisa. How much does this actually change the whole landscape? If you're looking for a technocrat after a very emotionally driven debate over Brexit, after a emotionally driven debate around helping households, what does it look like in terms of the depth of a potential downturn in the face of energy prices, in the face of double-digit inflation, in the face of rates that are going to be higher and a pound that's going to be lower? You're going to have a recession in this country. It is going to be probably a fairly deep one. It's going to be unpleasant. In some ways, maybe it is required as well that the UK now goes through this. I was joking with Marcus Ashworth upstairs a few minutes ago. We were talking about the moron tax that effectively the UK now is having to pay. You need to get through that. You need to calm the situation down. As you say, maybe a technocratic government is ultimately the way to achieve that. It's interesting that comparisons are being made with Italy right now. Well, comparisons are made with Italy and Maria today, I'll send you note this morning on the interesting Italian politics again of Burlesconi. What is Burlesconi being visible and coming back? What is Burlesconi doing right now? I mean, you know, Guy, my knowledge on this is the crown in Anthony Eden, and I'm not that very good at it. What is Johnson part of the dialogue of Tories in the 1922 committee? I think, Thomas, I say there are some that would maybe like to see him back. There would maybe some that would like to see his sort of cakism return, that sort of boosterism, that positivity. But in some ways, it comes with instability. And that's the challenge at the moment. The Tory party has experienced much volatility, continues to experience much volatility. I suspect that they would want that volatility to speak. Right. I'm not sure that they would get that with Boris Johnson. I don't know where Boris Johnson is. I've seen tweets of him on a Caribbean beach. I can no longer guarantee that that's where he is. Itting less. I don't know, Tom. I don't know where he is. I'm sure he's watching with bright interest. Guy help. But he has a bank balance to fill. Guy help our American audience here at 723 AM New York time. What happens today? What's your best guess? To be honest, Tom, I think it is very unclear. I think the fact that Sir Graham Brady is inside 10 Downing Street speaks volumes. I don't think it was the resignation of Braveman last night that has been a catalyst for this. I think it was the chaotic scenes in the House of Commons. Liz Truss clearly has no authority. You need somebody to run this government. In theory, it should not be the chance to live the ex-Jekker, but at the moment it looks like it is. So she completely lacks authority. You've had ministers quitting last night. I think more importantly, you had the chief whip and the deputy chief whip, a peer to resign and then unresign. It was just chaos, Tom. Enough is enough, I think, for many people within the deputy party.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4864,2022-10-20 11:26:08
16519," Chief whip and the deputy chief whip appear to resign and then unresign. It was just chaos, Tom. And enough is enough, I think, for many people within the executive party this morning. They want change now. They hope that they can get to the end of the month. Doesn't look like that maybe it's going to happen. It's a terrific and knowledgeable brief. Guy Johnson there from our studios at Queen Victoria Street this morning. We're going to try to get back to economics, finance and investment with Brammo. We can do this on yield. Am I right? Lisa that over the last couple of days we've seen a shift in yields up, not so much dynamics in yields. Exactly. Across the entire curve. So not only are you seeing it on the tier, but also the 10 year yield. Basically, people are seeing the likelihood of inflation remaining high for a longer period of time. I keep going back to this right now. Markets are pricing in a 5% Fed funds rate for the first half. You can say that 5.0 zero. Yes. For the first half of next year. We are now pricing that in as a base case. How much has that really been adapted into the broader market, especially considering that after that, there still are cuts priced in. That the Fed's going to have to back away even though they're saying we're going to hold it there for a while. And the Bloomberg 7.20%. 30 year bank rate mortgage. Please stay with us. This is Bloomberg. Steve's ability on the course may not be etched into any record books, but following him around, it's clear that it's not for lack of trying. Geez. We were constantly hustling behind him as he caught up with executives in the portfolio companies, and reminisced with former and current players. He's a day trader himself. He's on the bus after a game in New England, and he's day trading on the bus and Bill checks season and cuts him on the spot. In many ways it's convention. Right. The people that I don't see maybe once a year. And so it's kind of all come together. My firm, our charity, fundraising efforts, and then the friends that are around. My dad and my brother, it's all happens right there as a confluence of all these parts of my life that have found its common center.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4865,2022-10-20 11:30:35
16520," here. Markets are preparing to close, but the day is not over yet. It's talked that it is now up about 45% of the volatility. You need the power of the Bloomberg terminal to get you market moving data before anyone else. There's numbers much higher than expected. I'm created today to overweight. You need top analysts to bring you exclusive global insight into cross asset markets. The mini bond market is a really big focus. Bitcoin ain't playing along today. It's going to be a short term. Bloomberg markets the close weekdays on Bloomberg. Today's CFOs are reshaping the C-suite, positioning companies to meet the next generation of challenges, breaking out of traditional roles. One of the most important things is looking around the corner. Look for Chief Future Officer on Bloomberg. Thursday, Bloomberg surveillance at one hour claims which seems so secondary to all that's going on at today. Red and green in the screen futures up nine and futures have been all over the place. I'm not going to give you a vector on the equity markets this morning. The yields more exciting early on, they've come back a little bit, two year yield. I'm still not used to this 4.57 percent. Oil gives me a $1.00 lift, $94.00 on Brent. That crude pay attention to that, particularly with what we hear from the White House. And in the currency space, a churn now after the drama of weekend this morning, 150. In the equity markets, it's about earnings. Lisa, what do we have? Well, yeah, about 20 percent of the S&P has reported and what's catching my eye, first of all, Alcoa. And I mentioned this earlier, but this is the aluminum producer that signaled an actual loss in this quarter. They actually posted a loss and they highlighted that higher costs are facing, are really crimping their margins and falling prices. This is the problem with the time of inflation, but also quickly deteriorating demand. You're seeing that in China, you're seeing that around the world for particular computer devices. So, what point does this act as a bellweather at a time when we see strength in other areas? But yet, American Airlines, completely different story. Well, this is the travel story, right? People aren't buying goods as much, they're still traveling, those shares up ahead of the market, nearly 3 percent after reporting, better than expected earnings, increasing their full year forecast. They can charge more and people keep coming. We saw this from United, we saw this from Delta. So even as Alcoa is flat on its back with 11 percent decline, you still see that gain in American Airlines and Tesla shares are lower by more than 5 percent. After shipments were lower than expected. Well, Elon Musk talking about a recession in, or some sort of downturn, economic downturn in China, talked about a lack of demand there. He talked about different supply chain kinks that were difficult for him. He also talked about Twitter and how he knew he was overpaying for it, but he was going to do his talk by-backs. He was all over the place. Right now the takeaway is they missed and they're being punished. A mixed sell side, I read it to him, a colleague's noted, city group very, very carefully on Tesla talking about a little bit of margin erosion there, but I just, I honestly don't know what to make of it. Other than when I watch the baseball playoffs, everybody selling elect EVs. I mean, that's what they're doing. Well, and the competition, that's exactly the point. And so some of the subsidies are affecting their competition and supporting them. But honestly, all of these earnings, you really nailed it, Tom. They are not the same story. So what is the cohesive narrative emerging at a time of incredible flux? We'll turn to Wall Street for that analysis. And of course Bloomberg intelligence and Gina Martin, Adams, and her team through the coming weeks. Again, red and green in the screen. And right now we're going to digress here. We're still watching the United Kingdom, Guy Johnson, Lindsey Burton, helping us out this morning. But for Global Wall Street, it's about good ample liquidity. Remember Cunningham has been with us often. She's global liquidity's market. Chief investment officer at Federated her, as we're thrilled that she could join this morning. Deborah, instead of me asking some question, I sort of kind of like know about when you go into a meeting at 1030 this morning, what is your first statement to your team on the liquidity of the market? Well, the liquidity of the market remains good. You know, it's one of those things that...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4866,2022-10-20 11:34:52
16521," to your team on the liquidity of the market. Well, the liquidity of the market remains good. You know, it's one of those things that it's not being tried or tested right now. There is a lot of cash on the front end. Despite the fact that U.S. savings are down, you know, from their high points, they're up a little bit month over month and people continue to have a pretty high cash coffer. In addition to retail, you've also got industrial firms with a lot of cash in the front end of the market. And then from an investment perspective, certainly a lot of people have moved out of the long end of the bond market, a lot of people have moved out of the equity market and they moved into liquidity products. So because there is a lot of cash in this market, Tom, you've got ample liquidity. There's no real issue there. Deborah, where is it coming from? The flow is into the United States. Are they all domestic? How much is coming from overseas, taking advantage of both the dollar and rates? Well, you know, we are being impacted to some degree from some of the slower markets in, you know, the global economy, but a lot of our strength, if you will, and the liquidity in the marketplace is coming right here at some grown. You know, some of the, we were talking, I heard you talking about the UK issues and some of the things that are happening in Europe from a heating perspective. And although those are huge issues and problems causing a lot of volatility in the global markets, in the US that doesn't, it hasn't come through as much. Earnings, despite the fact that Alcoa is down, you've got a lot of other companies, two thirds of the earnings that have come in for the third quarter have come in beating estimates, not beating by very much, but beating estimates. So there's cash on a homegrown basis to be used and to keep the market very highly liquid at this point. We still ask every day, when is it time to extend? The yield curve is higher, it's steeper, and it's expected to remain that way for longer, but we still have to ask every single day, when is the time to extend? When is that, you know, trend that we've been in going to stop? Do you see any sign of it anytime soon? Not really, not really. I mean, it's obviously being driven by inflation and, you know, with very sticky types of inflation, like wage inflation, like goods inflation, like supply chain disruption and parts inflation, we don't see that changing in a very short fashion. The Fed is, you know, on a path that's going to continue into 2023 and then probably doesn't start the downward turn until 2024. Should our listeners and viewers, Deborah, consider the path of the two-year yield to be smooth, quiet, linear, or does it get lumpy and ugly and non-linear is you migrate to 5%. You know, I think lumpy and choppy is a good way to describe it. Right now, you have basically one year, two year, and three year, all right on top of each other. And that's kind of an anomaly. I don't know that that stays that way for a long period of time as we move towards higher rates, four and a half, five percent. You're going to see some choppiness and some lumpiness in your terms in that two-year sector of the curve. On single-point duration, what are you doing? Is federated, Hermes, are you coming in underration? Are you extending out to pick up that yield? We're actually not extending yet, but we are not, we are way off of our lows from a duration standpoint. So, you know, we're basically median at this point. Real quick here, Deborah. I'm curious from your perspective, we heard about the Treasury potentially or the Federal Reserve. Buying back Treasury Department, excuse me, buying back certain treasuries at discounted prices to help with some of the functioning of the liquidity in this market. Do you think that this would help with this actually serve as some sort of ballast for yields, at least creating a bit of a ceiling in the near term? I think the long and longer end of the market beyond two years has been saturated to some degree with supply, while the short end of the Treasury marketplace, you know, two years in under, and particularly one year in under where money market funds can buy, has, you know, had extra low supply with a huge amount of demand.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4867,2022-10-20 11:39:05
16522," under and particularly one year and under where money market funds can buy has, you know, had extra low supply with a huge amount of demand. So to me, it would not necessarily being changing the amount of security, treasury securities that are in the market and depleting it, but rather having more supply on the front end where a lot of the cash continues to reside. Deborah, thank you so much. I'm coming in with us to federated him is this morning here on liquidity and on the yields as well, the two year yield we mentioned 4.5 7% okay, it's distant from 5% but I'm sorry folks, it's still a shock to say that to you the short term, the short, short term used to be live or OIS and now there's all this other stuff that Irish Jersey explains to me and it goes in this year and I can tell. It comes out this year with your nap that happens with the auction right now. I am looking also at oil prices and we talked a lot about this yesterday. How many people have come on this show and said they're very concerned heading into this winter with where we're going with stockpiles with where the SPR has been drawn down to the lowest levels going back to the early 1980s. There isn't the same kind of lever that can be pulled. What does that mean in terms of the inflationary push heading into your end the perverseness and I'm not predicting this folks in any way and I don't mean to be political in any way, but with what we heard from Brian DC yesterday in Amos Hockstein about gaming whatever the strategic political reserve is that on election day, Brent crude is at 100. Well, I mean, this is, but I don't know to they actually have over it and it's not just the crude. It's also the distillate market and I keep talking about diesel because if you look at diesel prices, they've got pretty significantly. And this is what people need for all of the trucking of all of the goods and heating homes because a lot of them are fueled by by degenerated engine. So how much do you really end up in a sort of tenuous situation, which we heard about from Kevin book. You were breeding your beating Brian D's to a pulp yesterday and all I could think about is they need to cup a coffee with Steve Schorke of the short report. I'll explain to the president. I'm sorry sir, there's three major airports and 20 million people and they eat with heating oil and focus on new. They know this. The problem is that they don't really have the tools to really deal with it. And so how do you expect that they would have the tools deal with it? So why is that the political expectation and yet here we are the litmus test of inflation very much heading up on the gasoline stations to see around the country. How great. Let's look at predicted news here on pivot Thursday where there's any number of stories that are dynamic in moving. We have yet to speak of claims it's weekly data. It's been a little elevated, but not that elevated. Is that the right analysis here? We haven't really seen true weakness and it's unexpected to come out. I was looking at one higher numbers. Yeah, it's well, yeah, higher number is better for the Fed worse for the economy. But it's not a sensitive way in terms of people perhaps losing their jobs. I saw a report yesterday. There are a significant number of people in the United States that are working several jobs in order to pay for inflation. How does this data capture that? How do you capture a very bifurcated workforce that has changed and changed significantly? This is one of the things that I keep reading about. What are we actually seeing? Is there actually more weakness in the market than we're actually observing? The housing coming out later, Lisa, let's, you know, I get it. We talk about New York too much. Cleveland, Ohio. Thank you Cleveland.com. Up 8.5% in Ohio from a year prior. You mean in terms of home prices? Yeah, they're not going down, but this is what we heard earlier. That's a big number on your eye. Then, yeah, even though the mortgage rates are the highest since 1990. Housing data 10 a.m. We'll have that for you as well. Stay with us. This is Bloomberg. Keeping you up to date with Newsom around the world with the first word. I'm Lisa Mateo.

16523," The country's COVID-0 policy is leaving it increasingly isolated from the rest of the world. Hong Kong is reportedly looking to allow VIP bankers who test positive for COVID-19 during a gathering next month, leave the city via private jet. About 200 people from global firms, including banks, security companies, and asset managers, are set to attend the two-day HKMA summit. Infected guests without their own planes may be allowed to isolate in their hotel rooms.

While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29 percent of total US greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71 percent building to crowds America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100 percent clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels, we want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30 percent of US greenhouse gas emissions. Access the financial world on demand.

16524," On the David Rubens line show, here to peer conversations, I uncover the untold stories of the world's most successful leaders. Watch Wednesday's on Bloomberg Television. In the past two decades, China has built large infrastructure projects in almost every country in Africa. African governments themselves said we are tired of aid and charity. We want to do trade, we want to be treated like partners. The Chinese came along and said, great, we don't do aid and charity, we want to do business with you. Global gateway will mobilize 300 billion euros till 2027. Now the US and Europe are answering back with their own infrastructure initiatives to counter China. But African experts are skeptical. China has been that guy around the corner with a bouquet of flowers to Africa, the US and Europe and the UK have time and time again say be careful of the flowers you see out of the window, they have fun on them. I think we're predicting, at least the dot plot is predicting that inflation will come down, it will be a disinflationary year in 2023. The median dots do call for further moves in 2023. So if you take that as the committee sentiment, there could be a decision to move that into 2022 at the December meetings. I will not mince words. The doctorate from Indiana University has led an informative debate on a new Federal Reserve over his career. It's a St. Louis Fed. The Bullard has talked about front loading, he's talked about regime change and the rest and you look where rates have gone and Lisa you've got to look back and say what did Bullard get wrong and the answer is not much. Yeah, he has been on top of this which is really some why the front loading really is gaining some traction. I'm watching a clock right now, 18 days, 16 hours, 11 minutes and 27 seconds, it's counting down, election day in the US. And we haven't talked enough about that. We have really, we don't want to London. Yeah, you were the three weeks left at a time when the polls are moving so quickly against the Democrats face of some of the inflation, there was a quick pop and then it seems to be evaporating and Greg Valleier has been tracking all of this chief US policy strategist at AGF investments. He joins us now, Greg. Thank you for making me take a look at this clock 18 days, 16 hours, 10 minutes, 56 seconds. How quickly are these polls moving against the Democrats? It's really quite a story, Lisa. In the last couple of weeks, there's been a shift of Hispanic voters to Republicans. There's been a shift in the polls showing crime is a much bigger issue and a surprising shift showing that abortion is in the middle of the pack. It's not a big issue. These are dramatic changes and you have to conclude that a right slide is likely in the House. Greg, I have been dying to talk to you. I am suggesting that the General Lady from Hawaii, Gabbard, exiting the Democratic Party is a huge deal. Forget about the libertarian angle. Our moderate Democrats can exit the progressive Democratic Party here post election. They have a huge identity crisis. You've got Bernie Sanders, who's 81, who's itching to run again. We'll see about Elizabeth Warren. He has to win her Senate seat in Massachusetts. There's a place for moderates in the party, but there's going to be a brutal post-mortem. Why did we lose? What didn't we emphasize enough? The biggest question of all time is what about Joe Biden? Does he announce? Okay. Greg, give the Republicans some credit here. What did they get right in the last four or five, six weeks? Well, inflation. I mean, I don't know if they got it that right, but they certainly emphasized it. And in the final analysis, that will be the big issue. The fact that Joe Biden is perceived by the public, I'm doing much. Greg, I'm going to step on you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4870,2022-10-20 11:52:05
16525," emphasized it. And in the final analysis, that will be the big issue. The fact that Joe Biden is perceived by the public by doing much. Greg, I'm going to, I'm going to step on you here. I think this is really important. Tossing goards comments were stunning. I mean, is woke dead for the Democrats? It should be. And I'll tell you who else hinted at that. And that was Barack Obama. A few days ago, he said we've, we've gotten too infatuated with all of these, you know, niceties and what we can say and what we can't say. So it's not just her. There are a lot of Democrats who feel the party is veered off a cliff. Well, and this actually speaks to the shift that we've heard in tone in terms of exports to the European Union in terms of support for Ukraine. There has been a subtle shift heading into the winter during a perilous time for the European Union, where the US is saying we want to protect ourselves. How much is that going to really feature not only in the election, but in the political zeitgeist after? This is a story to watch, especially for Western Europe. Could it be that the resolve in the US could fade a bit? I don't see us being there yet, but many Trump Republicans running for the Senate are now openly saying we don't want to give any more aid to Ukraine. It's not a majority, but if this starts to catch on, that that could send a signal to Vladimir Putin that if he just waits long enough, he might get what he wants. But it's not just the Republicans. Even the Democrats yesterday, we heard from the White House that they may be considering restricting exports of diesel to Europe, restricting exports of natural gas because of what the US is facing itself to lower prices for consumers. How much is it becoming an increasing bipartisan pressure in the face of inflation? You also see protests in Paris and elsewhere. So is the Western resolve starting to falter? I would quote Margaret Thatcher, a wonderful quote when she said, this is no time to go wobbly. The Ukrainian army is still advancing, but this issue is going to be a big one in Washington after the first of the year. Greg, I think our global audience would ask the tradition here of a beleaguered president is to turn to the Vice President. I basically hear within year-world radio silence on the Vice President. Give us an update. I have to say in both parties, there's a consensus that Kamala Harris has been a disappointment. So if Joe Biden does announce he's not seeking another term, there's a vacuum who feels it, uh, gap reducing. He's got his problems in LA and San Francisco. There's going to be a real vacuum. I fear for the Democrats. Greg, save me some time. I'm watching too much baseball and not enough politics. Which Senate race is Greg Vellier focused on? Well Ohio's fun to watch. Pennsylvania's fun to watch, but I'll give you a sleeper. That's Nevada, where a Democratic senator is in real trouble. And if she loses, that makes it really tough for the Democrats to have any chance of taking the Senate. They might lose the site by a sneak. Greg, don't move. Lisa, you still got the clock up here on the election. Give me the clock here on the election. A lot of second answer. 18 days. 18 days, whatever. We got to talk to Greg Vellier three times within the countdown clock. We're going to the Vellier countdown. Exactly. It's amazing. With the AGF investors, Toronto, with a brilliant morning note, get that through AGF investments. I read it every morning. Greg Vellier, thank you so much. Folks, we're looking here at the Bloomberg screen. We've got three or four major stories this morning to get you through the Bloomberg morning. And Lisa, I'm going to go to where I've always gone, which is to see the 10 year real yield 1.70%. Wow, really? It was there for cup of coffee. Vellier was talking about, Nevada, there it is. It's 1.70%. And the 10 year real yield, it's not up through new highs, but still that dominates everything. And frankly, for Liz Truss as well. Hold on a second. That is the highs. If it stays since 2009. So we keep creeping to new post 2009 highs. At a time when people just a couple of months ago, we're saying 1.5% on the real yield was enough to torpedo stocks. We have seen a somewhat of a rally, although it's really cut a tepid. How much does that become a game changer over the long term? When do you start to reset? What do you call it? Zombie roll ups. Zombie roll ups. Zombie roll ups. Zombie roll ups. My phrase for next year. My whole way. You know, I think you're going to see with a risk-free rate coming back and that folds into the 10 year real yield. Bram, it's-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4871,2022-10-20 11:56:26
16526," Zambi Rollins is my phrase for next year. How are we? You know, I think you're going to see with a risk-free rate coming back and that folds into the 10-year-old yield. A Bramow is correcting me on air. You're right on a daily basis of 1.7012 as a new high for that real yield. But with this new math, which is the old math of my youth, that's where the zombies disappear. Well, and this is something that we have seen in certain pockets of the equity market. You haven't seen it in credit. You haven't seen it in the high-yield space. Tell me about high yield right now. Right now, you are not seeing the same kind of spread widening that you're seeing in other places. Credit deterioration. Credit deterioration. There isn't the expectation for some sort of massive default cycle. Does that start to change? You're starting to see investment-grade yields actually completely underperform because of the rate component. I don't know. My number I'm looking at, it's an amateur take, folks. Just an opinion, 2.05% on the 10-year-old yield. We're not near it, but we're moving there quickly. The futures up 8, the VIX still above 30, 30.73. We are watching London with Guy Johnson and Lizzie Verd and this is Bloomberg. All of us are doing this, now. Oh, Bunny has less potential for buying that beautiful What do you say to the cynic, Seth? Look, it's all nice and fine, but a lot of it is greenwashing, and you're not a good company. You're just a less toxic company than some of the other oil majors. Well, the first thing to say is that, you know, I'm a big believer in, we need to put ourselves in other persons' shoes in life in general. And so I understand that point of view, and I get that people have that perspective. I don't agree with that, obviously, but I understand where they're coming from. We have an enormous challenge as society, which is to provide the world with reliable, affordable, and clean energy. That's what society wants, that's what society needs. And I believe in my heart that a company like BP is actually one of the few companies in the world who can actually make that happen. We can talk about the things that we're going to grow and over the coming years. And I find it hugely exciting and energizing for our organization. But that's what the world needs, and you simply can't go against the grain of society. You can't defy gravity, and that's why we're making the change that we're making. Lots happening on Wall Street.

In the strong dollar, amplified the world's risks of instability. She didn't think that complete reunification must be realized. With unmatched reach in resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. The US economy still looks somewhat overheated. For the moment, I haven't seen enough evidence that there's been any sort of break in the way things function. I think there's going to be the big drag on the economy. The consumer, as we all know, is the workhorse of the US economy. And I think we've got to watch the deterioration there. The US will join this recessionary crowd in the early part of 2023. I think it's just a matter of time that we start to see consumer spending come down. This is Bloomberg's surveillance with Tom Kean, Jonathan Farrow, and Lisa Abramowitz. Welcome back, watching Rising Global Yeals watching earnings, watching a head of lettuce in London. This is Bloomberg's surveillance. Tom Kean, Jonathan Farrow, and Lisa Abramowitz. John is out on a well-deserved day off. He is not writing about playing putsy with the Dow. Tom, political turmoil in the face of market regime really is the mood of the morning. Sterling, 112, 53 rebounds here off of what we've heard from Guy Johnson and Lizzie Burton. I think it's a distraction to the markets, but as Guy said, it is again within my exhaustion of watching the soap opera, new political theater for the United Kingdom. It's new political theater on the heels of market regime change. And it comes with the yield story that we've been talking about for months that seems to only be accelerating with yields going up. CPI, ex-surprising to the upside in the US, in the UK, in Canada, and there is a response in markets. And the other thing is to look forward. I believe you said 18 days to the election and Greg Valleye saying we're going to see the same turmoil in America. He's seeing a massive shift towards the Democrats. And you're hearing, I shift toward the Republicans away from the Democrats and also really concerned about inflation, talking about fiscal discipline. And then we're hearing about that again and again. At what point do we see some sort of peak hawkishness, peak yields? We already have talked about that and then blown through it. 5% now baked into market expectations for Fed funds rates in the first half of the year. And the housing statistics, which we really haven't talked about much this morning, a housing data here at the 10 o'clock hour. And with a mortgage rate, seven-ish, let's call it, who's counting? It is a changed world. I'm going to go back to the boring data point. Lisa, the 10-year yield 1.70%, the real yield rather is extraordinary. 1.7% you highlighted this before, which is the highest level going back to 2009. And this is the reset. This is the great reset that people have been talking about. Dollar strength, although a little bit moving away today, given some of the developments, the stabilizing developments in the UK, as well as what's going on in Europe, the year 98.14. Dean, Dean Kern had published him moments ago. Yields are breaking out. He's continues to see the same trend that Jim Bianco would tell us about here in moments. Yeah, exactly, which is really the reason why people are completely resetting their expectations. I wonder how crude folds into this. We were talking a lot about oil yesterday. Yes. We did see a decline in gasoline prices. This pulled back some of the expectations for inflation, then a stabilization, then an increase, an attempted administration response, but crude right now higher, right? $87.33, $87.33, WTI. You're not impressed. However, we're far cry from the $67 to $71 or $72 where the trader that is the US government's going to step in. Well, the Biden administration, I'm not going to pin that on the Department of Energy, is well, I'm looking at this charts too fancy for TV. Everybody will turn a channel and a radio. They'll drive off the road. I can't give you a technical path to 100 on Brent. Yeah. The problem is nobody's looking at that. They're all looking the other way. But there is this great reset.

16528," My problem is nobody's looking at that. They're all looking the other way. But there is this great reset. And I'm really glad that we do have Jim Bianco on as we really not only look to earnings, but what this great reset in the yield space means for the broader economy. And Jim Bianco joins us now. He's president of Bianco Research, Jim. How much do you start to look at a 5% Fed funds rate next year and say maybe that's not even enough? Oh, I think that that could very well be the case. First of all, as historical as example is the two-year yield always peaks above whatever the terminal rate is. So if the terminal rates 5%, it should before the cycle's over, go above that. And if the terminal yield keeps going higher, you keep resetting the two-year yield higher. But it really comes down to inflation. Is it persistent? And let me be clear on persistent. Yes, there's signs it's peaked. And yes, there's signs that inflation is coming down. But if it stalls down, stalls out around 3.5, 3, 4%. Then these yields are appropriate. If it's on its way back to 2%, then these yields are too high. I do fall in the camp that we're probably going to see persistent inflation and that these yields are not all overdone, at least not yet. Jim Bianco, all of us have lived the John Taylor great moderation. It's been decades. You and I remember 14% annuities, 10% double digit yields on and on and on. We don't have a collective experience of going the other way. What do corporate profits do if we move the other way to a higher yield regime? Well, not only don't we have any experience going the other way, we have pretty much structured a lot of the financial market on the assumption that we were going to stay with low stable rates, a great moderation economy and no inflation liability driven investing in the UK being the headline child right now. And there's probably more to come. I think that as we move forward, we're going to find that this is going to be an even tougher environment than people think. And I've been advocating something I've been advocated for a long time. This might be the return to use the Wall Street term alpha. This might be the return of stockpickers and bond pickers as opposed to just buying decks and waiting for it to go up. You have to pick individual companies that can survive this environment because not all energy companies will do well. Others will. And no one's really ready for that kind of environment because it's been so long since we've had you do it. Jim, you're 15 years old when you're at first Boston. I mean, it was a few years ago to say the least. But the bottom line here is the overlay on that is transactions and combinations. I would suggest merger 2023, maybe that line. It could very well be because with this new environment, there's going to be opportunities for companies to pick up other companies that are not positioned for it and companies that will strengthen, you know, another Wall Street term is we're going to see the dispersion of returns be much wider than we've seen in the past. So it's not going to be enough to just like I said, pay by industrials. You got to figure out which industrials to buy. This is some, this is a big change from the last 20 years. I understand that there is this sort of bond stock picker bias right now because of the new regime change in both yields as well as just a broader economic shift. However, I've been really struck by what's going on in the high yield bond space. It has been so resilient. People seem to be saying companies are just doing fine. They have a lot of cash. This credit cycle is going to be a lot different and a lot less dramatic than previous ones. Do you agree? Well, I agree to some extent because first of all, remember the high yield space is largely a space of industrial companies, manufacturing companies, energy companies. Those are the companies that are doing well where the stock markets more of a space of growth companies like technology companies and when you get into the NASDAQ, unprofitable technology companies, those are the companies that are struggling. So that's definitely helping the high yield space. And the other thing is large nominal growth. When you have high inflation, these companies will see their bottom lines go up, whether they can beat the inflation rates at another level, another question. But at least their growth rates will continue higher. Nice analysis, Jim. But what does that mean for bonds? How, if I'm a bond person, clipping coupons, folks, for those of you younger scissors, Bianco sitting there with the electric company of Chicago, clipping a coupon, bond people don't have that advantage of the bright lights of nominal growth. The,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4874,2022-10-20 12:09:33
16529," There's Bianco sitting there with, you know, the electric company of Chicago, Clippin' a coupon. Bond people don't have that advantage of the bright lights of nominal growth the corporations have. Well, that's right. For a Bond investor, it's all going to be about rates. And it's all going to be about moving yields higher. Or, you know, this is something new. We've got yields that we've not seen before, and I think we're going to continue to see it. And that should be the focus. And I think that's where the focus is is on higher rates. Yes? Well, no, but Jim, I just before we let you go, I'm curious about whether we see a lost decade in this kind of regime. I understand what you're talking about with respect to specific bonds or stocks doing well. But on an index level, are we going to see meandering returns for equities because of this fiscal discipline and higher rates that completely change the value proposition? Yes, that's my fear is that it's a post pandemic economy that needs to change for the new world. You know, it's a work from home world. The supply of change still needs to have some work. We still need to figure out what we're going to do with China. And for the next several years, it's going to be a complete restructuring of what we're going to what we've seen. That means indexes sideways. That means yields higher. That means great opportunity within stocks and within bonds. Yeah, like I am I emphasize that's not what it was in 2010 to 2019. So yes, indexes sideways, but there will be opportunities within it. Jim Bianco Bianco research. Thank you so much. And I kind of want you to stay here for what's coming because I can just feel Tom Keen's energy and the vortex of the board is getting him to throw his tang at me. I mean, honestly, I got to be kidding me, Lisa. This is the greatest, you know, to the to the bulls out there when they hear people talk about the coming loss of decade. That's the precursor to the reformation of a new bull market. I mean, the toxic brew of a lost decade. I mean, you got to be kidding me. Okay, look, you can say that this is just gloomy, but you could also say that when you take a look at tech valuations and where they reset to based on where the nominal and the real yield are currently. If we're in an inflationary regime, it's hard to see the index level case in the same kind of way as specific names, which is the whole point. I'm going to go to what the major insight there from Jim Bianco, folks, which is you go back to stock picking where alpha matters and you and I see that in the earnings where you know, I get it. It's volatile, but United Airlines launching on all cylinders. And Elco is out there going, maybe not right. And this is the reason why people are saying stock or bond picking getting it right though. It's always been challenging and people have been saying this for the past 10 years and every time the index seems to perform if you strip out fees on an average level. Is this really going to be different? And if it is, what happens to ETFs? What happens the past of investing? What happens to the entire thesis that's transformed the investment management model into claims in 19 minutes. We're going to come back and look at the toxic brew of a lost decade. Okay, you know, I'm going to look at the toxic brew of claims. I'm watching letters claims. I don't know which way they go. They may show you tilting towards a toxic brew. If you if you keep this up, then I'm going to start talking about bad news. Be good. I'm going to go. I'm going to give my paper dissertation. We're doing a monologue.

Apple's the lane, its next major iPad software update, iPadOS 16 by about a month from September to October. Apple made the decision for a number of reasons, including a still buggy stage manager multitasking interface and an order to link the launch closer to the more similar Mac OS Ventura. Still, it's an unusual move. Since shifting the launches to the fall in 2011, Apple has released its new iPhone and iPad software updates simultaneously each year around September. By staggering the releases, users may find some issues around compatibility with cross-device features like retracting and editing messages in iMessage, the new shared iCloud photo library, and the new feature for transferring FaceTime calls between iPhones and iPads. It will also make it a bit harder for developers to launch apps that run on both the iPad and iPhone that require new APIs and features found across iPadOS 16 and iOS 16. Regardless, it was still of course the right move. Stage manager on iPadOS 16 is still quite buggy, I don't find it particularly intuitive, and it's not compatible with most iPads and many third party apps on the app store. The feature clearly needs some more polish, and complaints from consumers about Stage Manager will now no longer probably overshadow the earlier launch of the iPhone 14.

I do want to bring this to you, sky reporting, that there will be some sort of statement from Downing Street at 1.30 p.m. London time that would be in about 10 minutes plus or minus over here in New York. And how much is this going to be what Jim Bianco said where he's long let us not trust? Well, you know, I look at this and I go back with my my faulty memory. It's unfortunate. John's not here, but to Mr Cameron coming out on short notice in my basic take Lisa is the British are way more abrupt about this than the Americans. Things happen faster over there than they do in a media managed Washington UK. US faster either way. This has been warp speed even at a faster pace. I mean, this has been absolutely revolutionary in terms of its speed as well as the fact that it's really come on the heels of market movements. I mean, that to me also the market has just disciplined the political regime in a way that we've not seen until as you give me an intraday and sterling as you can as well. And what you see a sterling is not launched. That's not the right idea, but we've moved from sterling weakness up to some real sterling strength getting out well above recent resistance. 112 70 at 113 print there would be something about this announcement. At 18 19 Wall Street time. Good morning. I'm Bloomberg Radio and Bloomberg television. We're going to double barrel this as we look to the United Kingdom. Lizzie Burton is at 10 Downing Street, but also in 10 minutes. We have claims in America. Kathleen Bessiancik is going to join us now chief US financial economist at Oxford economics.

Guy Johnson in London. Kathy Bessiancik, I need a clinic on claims. What is your statistic to say claims have shifted? Is it to 30? Is it to 20? Dare I say to 50? A higher number is a grimmer number. What number matters to you? Good morning Tom. I'm happy to be with you. You know, right now, the media is going to be the first to tell you that. This is going to be a major concern for all of us. And you know, I think we're going to have a look at that. You know, it's not so much the level, but the change in claims that we'll be looking at. You know, certainly if we get a large increase this morning that someone could be reflected of, you know, the hurricane and Florida. So we'll have to dig through and look at the state data, although there's some delay in that reporting. But, you know, as we go forward, we've been Nikoli Laver,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4877,2022-10-20 12:22:55
16532," have to dig through and look at the state data, although there's some delay in that reporting. But as we go forward, we would anticipate that claims are actually going to just gradually increase, even if we do head into recession, which what we expect. Just because employers have had such a hard time finding skilled and appropriate workers, they're not going to immediately start to let them go. What they'll probably do is just pull back on new hires. And that alone will start to make net payroll gains slow. Does this mean that the initial jobless claims no longer matter, Kathy? They certainly do matter. It's just our expectation is that we're not going to see a large run up, as maybe you would see in previous recessions. In other words, maybe this claims, which is typically a leading indicator, maybe it becomes more coincident and laggy. Now, we'll have to see how that plays out. But that is sort of, I think, the thinking right now. Right now, we want to show you some film here. We've got 10 Downing Street. They're putting the podium out. The two guys just brought it out. They're picking it out on a board and rollers. And there it is. And it is always a sign of change within the United Kingdom government. We'll have more on that with Guy Johnson here. And a bit of Beth Gethling, Ms. Johnson, on the change in the American labor economy. Kathy, how does this dovetail into that jobs report early November? Yeah, I think we're going to see net job creation continue to slow. I think there's enough uncertainty with corporate America of what's coming that they're going to hesitate and be more cautious. And I also, let's be realistic, the pace of job games that we saw right after the end of the COVID recession, weren't sustainable. That was catching up and filling in the gap, the large gap that we saw during the COVID downturn. But going forward, I think it's this uncertainty that ways, on corporate leaders, is going to get them to pause a little bit. And we'll also see those job opening numbers start to receive as well. Given the pace of how quickly the market narrative is moving, is there anything in the underlying economy that gives you a feeling that we could be in recession now or headed to a rather deep one based on some of the pricing of certain stocks and some of the guidance that you're hearing out of Austria analysts? Well, certainly the equity market is also a leading indicator. And we do need respect that along with the yield curve, with that inverting traditionally, that has been a sign of recession. It doesn't tell you much about the depth, though. So even if the yield curve inverts further, it doesn't tell you that we're going to maybe contract 2% instead of 1%. Now, our own view is that we have somewhat of a mild moderate downturn, peak to trough about 1%. If you exclude the great financial crisis and the COVID downturn, the average post-war-req down turn was 2%. So it's about half of that. Cathy Bezdanczyk of Oxford Economics, you're going to be sticking with us through the jobs claims. We do want to get a sense of what's going on over at London right now, where they are setting up the stand and the microphones, the podium, as you pointed out, preparing for that statement. They are. They're setting it up with the usual thing. This is not Liz Truss, if we can go to that right now. But yeah, we make jokes about it. But this is really serious for this nation. And of course, we have seen this. I'm going to go back past Theresa made a David Cameron. I'm sure John Farrell could go back much longer. But I'm exhausted by this. Can you imagine the cross-section of people of the United Kingdom just? I mean, it's like Nixon for four years, sort of, you know, been consolidated into three days. I mean, this whole idea of how quickly she proposed a plan, she got a slap down by the markets, she got a slap down by her fellow Tory members. And now a lot of people are expecting her to resign. What comes next? This isn't the end of the turmoil. What comes next? And what kind of fiscal leeway do they have given where we are with respect to borrowing costs and where we are with respect to inflation? Guy Johnson has given us a sense of that. And his theme is that we have separated much of the economic battle from the political battle. And I see it was sterling 1,12, 79.

And you know and COVID has accelerated that. The industry cost $500 billion last year. The semiconductor industry overall. And estimates are a trillion dollars a doubling by the end of the decade. At that point I believe those estimates. It's not that there's not going to be some blitz and turns on the way.

We are awaiting US data, but we are more waiting what is happening in 10 downing street where we are awaiting for some sort of statement, potentially Liz Truss stepping down. We Tom are getting all sorts of messages about perhaps the latest one. Well, there's a zeitgeist that's on there. Guy Johnson standing by as well as we wait for this moment in British history, but with claims out with an extremely good number 214,000, that's a constructive number from 228. I don't have the revision yet. Yeah. Down to 214 is a number that I'm going to call that not Jerome Powell friendly. We're going to stay away from that right now. Equity futures lift on that. In yields here, I'm going to call it churny. Maybe yields pull back a little bit 4.56 in the 2 year and the 10 year 4.11 percent. I'm trying to squeeze this in before we go to the moment in history. Lisa, let us regroup here and I will go to the day. John Farrow did nine hours on TV on Brexit and somebody emailed into me how much of this moment and the moment of Theresa May redounds back to this arch debate of England, the United Kingdom, extracting themselves from Europe. How much is that really what we're talking about today? The post Brexit turmoil, I'm sure will be a discussion for the history books. Also, the post pandemic playbook at a time when inflation is one of the most important problems pressing a nation. Really, her agenda was to cut costs and to cut taxes and not cut costs, increased costs and cut taxes, it failed, at least with the market size. On radio on television, we show that Beth Rigby always informs says the Prime Minister quote is about to resign that according to Sky Television. Guy Johnson is an London guy. We're going to stay on 10 Downing Street until he with a podium set up a good 25 feet from that acclaimed black door. Guy Johnson, if the Prime Minister resigns, what happens next? That we don't know Tom. How is this process going to unfold? I think it's probably just been decided inside Downing Street. We've had this meeting taking place. You've had the chair of the Conservative Party in there. You've had the Deputy Prime Minister, Co-Fee in there. You've had the chair of the 1922 committee. Mr Brady in there. It's a great Brady in there. And I suspect they've been working out how this process is going to unfold. It's not just the 22 rules that need to be changed. The 1922 committee rules to be changed. Other rules need to be potentially altered here as well. I don't know what the process is going to look like, Tom. What is clear, judging by the shot we have up on the screen in front of us, is that something is about to change. We welcome all of you on Bloomberg Radio and Bloomberg Television to this historic moment for the United Kingdom. Guy Johnson in London with our government team as they report this story. Lisa Bramwell's in Time Keen tragically. I'm not kidding here folks. We make a lot of jokes. We have a lot of fun, but just too bad. John Farrow is off today. We look forward to his perspective in the coming days. Lisa, I look off claims it a higher real yield out to 1.71 percent. But separate from that is the economics here of stronger sterling and more stability for the next United Kingdom government. Well, more stability for now, which goes to the question, which you rightly ask, Guy, what comes next for all intents and purposes over the next two weeks, three weeks, four weeks, is the United Kingdom going to be run by a technician by Jeremy Hunt, who is taken over as the chancellor. Now we're going to have to see here. Here we go. And now the door opening at Downing Street in the Prime Minister walks to the podium in silence. Let us listen. I came into office at a time of great economic and international instability. Families and businesses were worried about how to pay their bills. Putin's illegal war in Ukraine threatens the security of our whole continent.

16535," Eagle War in Ukraine threatens the security of our whole continent, and our country has been held back for too long by low economic growth. I was elected by the Conservative Party with a mandate to change this. We delivered on energy bills, on on cutting national insurance. And we set out a vision for a low tax, high-growth economy that would take advantage of the freedoms of Brexit. I recognise though, given the situation, I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party. I have therefore spoken to his majesty the King to notify him that I am resigning as leader of the Conservative Party. This morning I met the chairman of the 1922 committee, Sir Graham Brady. We've agreed that there will be a leadership election to be completed within the next week. This will ensure that we remain on a path to deliver our fiscal plans, maintain our country's economic stability and national security. I will remain as Prime Minister until a successor has been chosen. Thank you. This trust turning to 10 Downing Street in the door and returning in to piece together a fractured government. Our Guy Johnson in London, we're waiting for John Mikkelsweigh to join us as well, our editor-in-chief with all of his experience of the politics of London, Lisa, your thoughts of this moment. Well, Liz Trust is about to become the shortest ever serving Prime Minister. She is stepping down. We were talking about this earlier at a time of incredible turmoil. She accepted the Prime Minister ship from the Queen and handed in her resignation to the King. We welcome all of you worldwide in extent addition of Bloomberg surveillance. We're going to move through the morning air with the two-malt of the British government. And of course on the Bloomberg, what we do is look at Sterling 11272 after the announcement. I believe with a move up to 113. Guy Johnson is here and Guy for Americans is so much formed by the movies and not the Crown and the rest of it. But I'm going to go back to every movie Judy Dunches ever been in, which goes back to Disraeli and Gladstone. And we really, Guy, almost have to go back to the 1820s and 1830s for a moment. Is that the historical perspective Britain has or are Tories in labor saying enough to move on now in the present? The Tory party would like to move on. I think that is certainly true. I think Theresa May has just set a record that was set by Prime Minister Canning previously. So there's some historical perspective here, Tom, as you take us back that far. I don't know what the rules are going to be governing this process. It's not just the 22 committee rules that need to be changed here. There's a bunch of other rules that need to be changed here as well. What process is going to unfold here, I think is critical. Is this going to be decided within the parliamentary party of the Conservative party? Right. Will they select their new leader? All this ultimately have to go back to the grassroots. If that is the case, that could be an elongated period in which that process unfolds and in theory during that process, Liz Truss will bring Prime Minister. We don't know yet. I suspect that policy is being made on the hoof. Rules potentially being changed on the hoof as well, Tom. How much to Tom's question earlier, Guy, how much is this really being driven by the tumult of a post-Brexit United Kingdom? I think it's being driven by that. Ultimately, Brexit was meant to resolve a number of issues within the Conservative party. I think we can clearly now make the decision that that has not been the case. The pandemic obviously has had a huge impact as well, not just in the UK. It has taken the UK to a fiscal position that was very different to the one we enjoyed in 2018 and 2019. A number of things have changed here. I think what is clear as a result of the pandemic is and the inflation that has subsequently been generated post that pandemic is at the market tolerance for a big shift in policy is relatively limited. Guy, I want to go back to what Prime Minister Truss talked about, which is this distinction of members of Parliament of",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4881,2022-10-20 12:39:46
16536," in policy is relatively limited. A guy want to go back to what Prime Minister Truss talked about, which is this distinction of members of parliament of her party and the people of the conservative party. How far apart are they? In America, we have liberals and conservatives far apart from their elected officials. But how big is that canyon between the MPs and the people? Right now I don't know, but let's put it this way. The parliamentary party, the MPs, did not vote for Liz Truss. The conservative party, the grassroots, voted for Liz Truss. So my understanding is that the parliamentary party would like to keep this within the parliamentary party in terms of making the decision. And there's some reasons for that. You can certainly get a more expedited decision on who will ultimately be the next prime minister as a result of that. So we are just getting a headline from the telegraphs. Hope that 1922 officers are meeting at 3pm in parliament. There are times, so 10am Eastern. How much is this setting up for a general election? And can you give us historical perspective on the last time that there was this kind of electorate outcome? The conservative party, the parliamentary party will not want a general election. They have two and a half years. The polling is abysmal right now. You would see a, a wipe-house, almost a complete wipe-house of the conservative party in parliament where you to see that happen, judging by the current poll. So they are going to be playing for time here. They are not going to want to have that happen. They are going to want to put in technocratic, maybe the wrong word, but that kind of government here, they are looking for stability. They are looking for a period of time in which the pantomime of what we've seen over the last few days can be forgotten. Guy, what is the percentage of people, either MPs or the party, saying Boris to the rescue? I mean, it just seems so painfully, I don't mean painfully, because I'm at a totalising, but it just seems so apparent that's one solution. Well, within the parliamentary party, I would have thought that number is relatively small. I've seen a tweet from Adin Dora's this morning suggesting that I haven't seen many others. But within the conservative party grassroots, I would have thought that arithmetic is slightly different, though, Tom. But within the conservative party that is represented in parliament, I don't think that number is high. I come back to the point they are looking for stability. I'm not sure the Boris Johnson administration really was emblematic of stability. Guy Johnson, whether it's if you're just joining us on Bloomberg Radio and Bloomberg Television, a special edition of Bloomberg surveillance, Lisa Brahmowitz and Tom Keenan-Jerk, John Farrell, regrettably off today here, is history is made in the United Kingdom. Joining us now, John McLeatwitt, he's the editor-in-chief of Bloomberg News, and of course, a student of this with his many years at the economists. And John, I'm going to go to a single sentence from your colleague in crime, Adrian Wildridge. You've written so many books with Adrian steeped in history. Wildridge, there are no parallels in British history. What is the Micklet rape parallel this morning? Well, unusual for me to agree with Adrian, but yes, I think he's completely right. There are no parallels. And indeed, you begin to have to look to places like Italy and the fast and over of Prime Ministers there. And it's one of those moments where basically it's possible to feel quite sorry for Liz Trust, but it's likely his guy pointed out that everyone else has probably lost even more the Conservative Party lost a great deal, British people have lost a great deal in terms of much higher mortgage rates. You could even argue that the Labour Party, their inheritance, if they are, eventually going to take over, has got immensely more difficult, because there is just less room for things. Britain has now, we went over the edge. And when you go over the edge with the markets, it takes a long, long time for the markets to forgive you. And you can already see the Tories have rode back on quite a lot of the more extravagant promises they made, but the markets still don't trust them that much as we can see in the yields. So I think in general, yes, technically I think she's the shortest since canning, but by any measure, you're not really looking at modern British political history, you're looking at places which rightly or wrongly have...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4882,2022-10-20 12:44:12
16537," Technically, I think she's the shortest since canning. But by any measure, you're not really looking at modern British political history, you're looking at places which, rightly or wrongly, have sometimes been perceived with more rapid turnover of leaders. You're saying the UK has gone over the edge with markets, which is a pretty dire tone and understandably so, because of what we're seeing in markets, is a general election enough to begin to restore some of the credibility, some of this stability. Is Jeremy Hunt a technocrat the person to do it, or is this something that cannot be righted for months and potentially years to come? Several things in that. Number one, Guy Johnson's completely correct. Nobody in the Conservative Party wants an election, because it's like a football match that you're losing 5.0 at half time. You're generally going to want to play the second half, if any, to see if you can recover a bit. At the moment, they would get trounced, and so it would be like Turkey's voting for Christmas. So that's really being parked in one area. I think that, so it's a less the Conservative Party pulls itself apart so much that some rebels begin to say, look, we'd be better having an election. I don't think that's going to happen. I think in terms of what the markets are going to do and what the way in which Britain is perceived in the world, I think you did see, notwithstanding my earlier comments, you did see a fairly robust reaction to Jeremy Hunt coming in and taking a more grown-up approach to what things do, what things could do. But as you pointed out in the IWZO saying earlier, it's very difficult. Once you've lost that basic sort of trust to get it back, if you look what Johnson, what Jeremy Hunt did, he actually renounced not just the stuff that the markets really hated, the kind of top-rate tax cuts and other things like that that took it into much heavier territory. He also renounced a degree of the energy price cap, which the markets had sort of forgiven Britain for earlier. But once you lose that trust, you lose that ability. So the Tories are almost back in an earlier position. So I think it will take a degree of time. And one very interesting thing is it's very hard for any government now to do much outside of fairly wide parameters. If you look at what Labour wants to do, look what the Tories probably will do over the next couple of years, it's probably quite similar. Right now we have a headline. I feel like this is something out of a Hillary Mantel novel. The leadership of France saying, quote, Mr. McCraw, hopes the United Kingdom can regain stability as soon as possible. Our executive editor in terms of Brexit non-stability is David Merritt. He joins us today from Washington here in our special coverage of the resignation of the Prime Minister. David thrilled to have you where this is. You are steeped in our coverage of Brexit. How much is this resignation of the Prime Minister linked to that day when Brexit occurred? Thanks, Tom. Yes. Well, a lot of commentators are looking back in history to that moment in 2016 when the chaos really started to set in. And we've seen since that vote, David Cameron, of course, resigned the morning after that vote in 2016. And we've had now three other Prime Ministers four stouts of office. And it's great to hear that bit of sledge there from the French president talking about the need for stability. But it's been a sort of accelerating process. And Brexit, we all lived in breed, didn't we, Tom? You know, the term or the twist and turns. Boris Johnson claimed that he'd got Brexit done. But obviously the after effects are still being felt. Many commentators talked about the extremities of the moves in UK markets of recent weeks. Being also linked to the fact that Britain was untethered, as it were, from the European Union. Made it more exposed to some of these effects around inflation and the like that are going around the world. That is one lens on it, of course. You know, the remainder voters still have a large voice in Britain. It will be fascinating to see, though, now who emerges from this leadership contest? Are we going to see somebody who wants to start to reforge some connections back with the European Union? If they can actually try to kind of end the infighting in the Conservative Party. Brexit has not gone away. Boris Johnson did not get it done. It remains an open argument in Britain. And you're seeing the effects of that still. David, to that exact point you're asking about who the leadership will be will...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4883,2022-10-20 12:48:34
16538," It's not going away. Boris Johnson did not get it done. It remains an open argument in Britain. And you're seeing the effects of that still. David, to that exact point, you're asking about who the leadership will be. Well, one just removed his name from the running UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt will not stand for Tory leader. That, according to the spokesman from his office, how much are we looking at something that is a UK story, David? And how much is this as we were just hearing from John McElthweight? Does this represent a sea change where governments cannot get away with certain policies that they could in the past because of the interest rate regime, because of the bond vigilantes coming back? Absolutely. The theory in the trust camp of the campaign was always that Britain has such a large and stable economy that the bond market will readily absorb all this extra debt to pay for, you know, we got away with it with the furlough scheme in Covid. They probably would have got away with it with this massive amount of spending to supplement energy bills, but they tipped it over the edge to borrow extra money just to cut taxes. And that argument seems to have now been settled, I think, probably, for many decades to come. If anyone thinks in any G7 country, perhaps it's completely United States that they can borrow to that level and the market will take it, I think Britain is now going to be the example why they can't. And Radio and television are extended coverage of the resignation of the Prime Minister, Liz Truss. Welcome all of you worldwide. We'll continue to give you market data with Sterling now 112 63. I'm going to call that a volatility and a little bit weaker here in the last number of minutes. Guy Johnson is with us, David Merritt is well with their wonderful experience on the British system. And of course, John McElthweight with us are editor in chief today. John, I want to speak to the middle ground. This ugly American says that means the liberal Democrats. Is there a middle ground in British politics? I think the middle ground is currently occupied by a mixture out of Jeremy Hunt and Kirstaama. And what's quite very interesting is the idea that Hunt, who in many ways seem to be the most likely compromise candidate. I went down to Hasid Polo at last night. You talk to people. He seemed to be the person who, rather weirdly, the right of the Tory party had forgiven for opposing Boris Johnson in his leadership election, but he hadn't been obviously disloyal. And they seem more angry with Rishi Sunak. And the trick really over the next few days is going to be to get somebody who most of the parliamentary party can you know it behind. But I think at the moment, the middle of the British politics is sort of occupied by Jeremy Hunt on the left of the Tories. And Kirstaama, who has not done as much to detoxify the Labour brand as people like me thought he needed to do. I mean, he renounced antisemitism. He's got rid of those sort of things. But he has not really moved the parties substantially to the middle, although he has talked about accepting some of the Tories tax cuts. But at the moment, I don't see that the Liberals don't say to be part of the picture at the moment. So what is so important here within, you know, the way I report this from New York is Mr. Sunak is a financial guy. Does the United Kingdom want a drug-yes financial guy to run the show to help get us out of the chaos? They want somebody who's competent. And at the moment, the sort of list of competent people seems to involve Jeremy Hunt. Sunak, who I think more than any other person in recent British political history, can justifiably say, I told you so, because what he said would happen during the leadership election to those aforementioned Tory members who guy was describing. He did actually tell them that if they elected Liz Truss, this is what would happen. And it has happened. But often in politics, the rewards don't go to the person who says, I told you so. Even if he tries very hard not to say that. So there's, I think him, I think Jeremy Hunt, I think there is, you know, there are some other people who they can bring forward. Grant Shaps, who they bought back in, is one such person. But there's not a lot of people who people would immediately turn to. I went to the Tory party conference two weeks ago and it did feel a bit like the end of the second term of a two term American president visiting the White House then. The Tories have been in government for a long time. A lot of the people who got them into government in the first place, people like George Osborne and things like that, who most people would say was very talented. They have all left. And that there is not as much talent now. It is very like.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4884,2022-10-20 12:52:55
16539," Got them into government in the first place. People like George Osborne and things like that. Who most people would say was very talented. They have all left. And that there is not as much talent now. It is very like the end of a second term White House. John McElthwaite joining us, David Merritt, as well of the executive leadership of Bloomberg about what just happened. Liz Truss saying, I cannot deliver on the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party. Resigning Guy Johnson in London, passing through all of the reactions, all of the headlines who is in, who is out Jeremy Hunt, not in the running guy. What is the latest? You do wonder whether Hunt could be persuaded. He has ruled himself out, but you do wonder whether, were the situation to develop, he may still be persuaded to occupy that role. I think that would be an interesting development here. I can possibly stand. I'm not going to stand. Well, we'll see ultimately what happens here. As John says, the bench is not particularly deeper at this point. They don't have in the Conservative Party the talent that some would argue they once enjoyed. But whoever it is, Lee Sir, they enjoy, I think, very limited room for maneuver. As John said, you are now from an economic point of view, tinkering. You can't make big bold moves. You can't make the kinds of changes that Liz Truss tried to do because you have been clearly warned off such moves by the market. So whoever comes in, be it the next incarnation from the Tory Party or the Labour Party, their room for maneuver is incredibly limited, unless they start thinking about pulling bigger levers. Immigration, how would that change the UK economy, rejoining the single market, how would that change the UK economy? Those are the only levers that are left, but recent history would dictate that those are very difficult and dangerous levers to pull. David Marrett, a guy, he was mayor for eight years, and then he was Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, leader of the Conservative Party, and then Prime Minister, where they believe a ginormous electoral victory. I am thunderstruck, we haven't heard from Boris Johnson, even if it's a fatherly word in time of crisis. Where is he, and can you get him on the phone, David Marrett? That is a very good question. And, rest assured, our reporters are definitely trying to track him down. There was some word that he might be in the carabin, I think, actually probably. I'll get on there right away, David. Don't make a point. I'll make a letter in hand watching all this unfold, but look, he's made no secret, or his associates have made no secret at the fact that he'd love to make a comeback, right? And the implosion of the Truss project so soon, we've had some of his former ministers coming out and saying, look, there's only one person in the Tory party who has a mandate from the British public, and that person is Boris Johnson. He won that stonking majority just in 2019. He should be brought back to steady the ship. Stranger things. Hold on a second. But David, is there really that much support for that? I mean, he says he'd be happy to step in and come back. I mean, people really doing this at a time when people are seeking stability. I did point out the poetry of Liz Truss accepting the Prime Minister ship from the Queen, and then putting her resignation in to the King and just days later, how much are people seeking stability, even if it comes in the form of Boris Johnson? I mean, I think definitely people are seeking stability, no doubt about it. You know, the death of the Queen was a huge watershed moment for Britain as well. And so, yes, some people are clinging to this idea that maybe Boris Johnson could provide that. Remember, he was the person who persuaded people across Britain to vote conservative for the very first time. And yes, through to a series of missteps, he was forced out of office. But he still does command huge loyalty from a big faction of the party. That's one of the reasons why Rishi Sunak is struggling so much. Now, I don't think it's yet broad enough, probably, to bring him back. But people are grasping around here, at the moment, for an answer to this problem, but how do you govern an ungovernable conservative party at the moment? John McElthweight, let's look at the wake up call here for the Conservative Party playing off your wonderful, highly readable monograph of a number of months ago. That's awesome. You know, I look, John, at the wake up call that is ensuing right now, lessons learned from Cameron.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4885,2022-10-20 12:57:16
16540," A month ago, you know, I look at the wake up call that is ensuing right now. Lessons learn from Cameron. Lessons learn from Theresa May. Maybe from Prime Minister Johnson. Certainly lessons learn from Truss. Is this the wake up call for the Conservative Party? There is a, it really goes back to what David Merrick was saying. What you said is completely correct. You know, Johnson is a big beast in this. The one thing nobody has ever associated Johnson with his entire life. In this case, I'm talking about Boris Johnson, not Guy Johnson, is stability. It is not what he does. But he did do one thing uniquely well. He managed to knit together both the kind of working class, somewhat socially conservative vote. You might describe it, pro-Brexit, with the more traditional of kind of free market, southern boats of the Tory vote. So he did have that ability to do it. But the fact is, those two are largely in conflict, quite a lot of the time. So the Conservative Party, you're right. I think they are reaching a period where they need to refresh. There is a reason why the Conservative Party is, I think, still the most electrically successful party in the Western world, depending on how you measure the Japanese achievement. They are very, very good at rebranding themselves. They were the kind of party of sort of posh, conservatism under Harald Mullen. Under Margaret Thatcher, they had radical free marketers. Cameron was a turn back to managerial conservatism, and he did pretty well until he didn't do well on Brexit. And then, our sits, then, they've been trying to mend these breaches. There has been this war within them over Brexit, and that could come out again in this. And I agree very much with Guy Johnson, is that actually Jeremy Hunt does want to be leader. The solution of coming out saying, he doesn't want to be it, could be the cleverest thing that he's done so far. As we try to understand where the trust lies or how to regain the trust, there's the divergence between what's happening on 10 Downing Street, and how to regain trust in the city. David, I love your thoughts on how the what the tumult is like among the financial players, and among such concern about the pound, amongst such concern about borrowing costs, and whether there is a feeling that they can be a retention of some of these financial firms that were threatening to leave post-Brexit. Absolutely, and I think the tumult that, you know, I think the city has looked on in horror at the last couple of weeks. There was a feeling in the leadership campaign that maybe Truss was pro-business, was going to listen to the city of London in their concerns. They had this big plan, they were calling Big Bang 2.0 to kind of turbocharge the city of London post-Brexit. All of that is now in tatters. We've got a premium on UK Government debt. Yes, it's come down a little bit, but it's still there. And the reputation for Britain as a financial destination, a stable destination for investors, has been shredded. And I think it's going to take a very long time for that to come back. In conversations we've been having, our report's been having with banks and investors in London, in the city, they are white with rage about the chaos that has ensued from this government, and investors around the world. You know, we've spoken to people who have called the UK, are uninvestable, and this is a direct fallout of a Conservative government. It's going to take a very long time, I think, with that reputation to be held. We welcome all of you worldwide. I'm Bloomberg Radio and Bloomberg Television. I would direct your attention to Bloomberg.com UK with wonderful coverage. Joe Mays and the team, they're really on top of this story, the resignation of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. It seems we've said that too often here in the recent years. It is truly, and I don't editorialize your chaos in Britain. Guy Johnson joins us this morning from Queen Victoria Street with our editor-in-chief, John Mikkel Tweet, and also David Merritt joins some Washington with his extensive leadership of our Brexit coverage. We do this with equities vacillating in the United States. Yeals move higher. I've been watching the real yield now stunning 1.72 percent, but everything today talking towards Yannet 150, and of course, Sterling, we're watching was a little bit of weakness here, 112.56. John Farrell off today, but Lisa Abramowitz is here and we re-wreck the gentleman from the Dartmouth bubble. Yeah, hum.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4886,2022-10-20 13:01:34
16541," watching was a little bit of weakness here. 112 56 John Farrell off today, but Lisa Abramowitz is here and we regret the gentleman from the Dartmouth bubble. Yeah, how much are we looking at a reset driven by market action, which Jenny Blancheflower has been talking about and watching? We pledge that we would get him back if anything developed, something developed, but Danny Blancheflower, Dartmouth professor joining us now. He is also a former member of the Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee. The key question, what does United Kingdom need to do both from a fiscal and a monetary standpoint to regain market trust? Well, obviously I think a period of calm is completely important. I mean, you use the word chaos. I mean, we spoke three hours ago about what potentially was coming. I think there's another party in group here we haven't really talked about, which is the general public who are going to be hurting. And if we look back in the poll tax, it was actually dissent from the public. They refused to pay the bills of the poll tax. They were demonstrations. So I think everyone's correct about financial markets being important, but in a way, when a government is so far behind in the polls, there's been no mandate from the people. Their credibility, both in financial terms, but actually, politically and real living day terms, if you like. The woman on the mile end wrote on the bus is going to say, what's in this for me? So I think any government is going to have to calm that. And it's pretty hard to see without a general election how that would happen. So I think calmness is important, but it's hard to see how that's going to come. I mean, we're going to have a week when we don't know there's a leader there. How long's that leader going to be there? What support will it be within the Tory party? But in the end, it's going to come down to what support is there from the people. And I suspect this government is 35 points behind in the polls. If you have an election today, they go from something like 356 to 4. So this baby isn't over, even when you bring in a new prime minister, you bring in a new chancellor, you try and calm the city of London, and in the end, the people will speak. David, what I'm going to do is watch K-Pail Blanchett tonight in Elizabeth, so I can get up to speed on this as well. What we need to do is revisit the comments of Prime Minister Truss. Here is the Prime Minister before her resignation. We set out a vision for a low tax, high-grace economy that would take advantage of the freedoms of Brexit. I recognise, though, given the situation, I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party. I have therefore spoken to his majesty, the King, to notify him that I am resigning as leader of the Conservative Party. List trust at the podium outside of 10 Downey Street this morning. John Mickletweight, Professor Blanchflower alluded to this, and we speak from the distance of the colonies, but there seems to be a system, a process of parliamentary process, I guess, is what I would call it in the United Kingdom. Do you see any groundswell by the people that David Blanchflower speaks of for constitutional or process reform in a fractured British system? I do not think I see much sign yet of demands for constitutional reform. I think a lot of people are very fed up and annoyed with the Conservatives. You can go to dinners in London and people will say, how on earth did this group of people get to elect this person, who the MPs didn't want in the first place? And the answer is that it's slightly the same. It's not a popular comment to make in America, but it's not dissimilar to the way that Americans choose your leader. Party members vote in primaries. Well, that's what we had a primary and we ended up with List Trust. And I think what's happened is the people in our Equivalent to Congress are now trying to re-elect somebody. It is a parliamentary system and you get elected for a term, and so the Conservatives will try and stick it out. And sometimes you stick it out and you lose at the end. That's what happened to John Major. But at the current moment, there is a faint hope, and I would not put it as very high, but this is a very fee-browl in the atmosphere. There was a time barely a year and a half ago that Boris Johnson looked completely indomitable.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4887,2022-10-20 13:05:55
16542," Very high, but this is a very fee-browl atmosphere. There was a time barely, you know, a year and a half ago that Boris Johnson looked completely indomitable, swept to one of the biggest election victories he was out really quickly. Things are changing one way and the other. Labour is still unproven. That is the kind of faint hope the Conservatives, again, I was in the House of Commons last night, that's the sort of thing they're clinging to. I think they think that the poll, even if the polls come down to a mere 10% Labour lead, that will be something where most of the people who are currently making the decision about which person will lead them now. That will make a big difference to a lot of them about whether they can hang onto their seats. But the key point is this. This is a parliamentary system. Parliamentary systems, in the end, it's about whether you have enough MPs to support the current government and the only way in which this government will go is if some members of the existing government party start voting with the opposition on no confidence votes. Because at the moment, whoever's prime minister is not going to call the election rapidly. Meanwhile, we are feeling the gallows humor of Great Britain right now. If you look at Twitter, it's lighting up with the lettuce one. The Daily Star coming out. The lettuce officially has outlasted Liz Truss. And one, Guy Johnson's still with us from Queen Victoria Street. And how much are we looking at a scenario where there is this deep feeling of sadness in the public that's represented by some of these humorous means, etc. But a feeling of chaos and anger. Frustration, I think, is probably the word that I would use, Lisa. The British probably is clearly frustrated with what they've seen over the last few days. Because it impacts their lives. Mortgage rates have gone up and gone up sharply as a result of this. You take a look at the latest inflation data. It is impacted by what is unfolding politically. So this is not something that is kind of distant to them in some ways. It is real and will impact the family finances on a daily and weekly basis. And I think that's where the difference between this crisis and other crises maybe is. It has had an immediate effect on so many people. And I think that they will be feeling that right now. They will be wanting stability. They will be wanting mortgage rates to come back down. They will be wanting a sense of stability in their own lives. Joining us right now is Lizzie Burden from 10 Downing Street as we try to parse through the rapidly moving backdrop of events. Lizzie, what is the latest in terms of who's lined up to succeed Liz Truss? What will happen in the time when she will remain Prime Minister until her successor is named? Well, Lisa, we know that Liz Truss invited Graham Brady to Downing Street today. It's not clear whether he told her that it was time to go or whether she felt like the stack of letters of no confidence was going to get so high it would be a humiliation and she's gone. But what we do know is that it's going to be a week long leadership election by the end of which we'll have a new Prime Minister. And the name's, well, the favourite right now is Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor who of course ran against Liz Truss over the summer and was the MP's favourite. But there are still, well, of course they are. Boris Johnson's allies are arguing that he's got the biggest mandate because he was actually chosen by the general public in 2019. But whether the public's forgiven him for all the scandals when he was in number 10 is another question. And I would just add where guy is saying that real people want, they care about their mortgages. They've not just had the chaos of the Truss government. They've also had the chaos of the Bob Johnson government throughout the pandemic and in the months leading up to his downfall. Other names on the list, Penny Morton. She's been pretty much auditioning in the comments. But Jeremy Hunt, who seems to be in charge here, has ruled himself out. Mr. Burton, thank you so much. Again, we welcome all of you. I'm Bloomberg Radio. I'm Bloomberg Television. We're going to say goodbye to our editor-in-chief, John McElthweight, for his perspective. John, thank you for joining us here out of your meetings this morning in London. And we continue with Guy Johnson, Professor Blancheflower, Dartmouth College. We'll get to here in a moment. I do want to continue to David Merritt right now. David, you live this. You let all of our coverage here forward out of Brexit. And I want to leave.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4888,2022-10-20 13:10:14
16543," to here in a moment. I do want to continue to David Merritt right now. David, you live this. You let all of our coverage here forward out of Brexit. And I want to link in here, David, that I will attend at the Metropolitan Museum of Art today. Their magnificent new show, The Tutors, Art in Magistrate and Renaissance England. A newly minted King Charles is very much aware of that. And his first order of business, David Merritt, was to visit repeatedly Scotland Wales and indeed Northern Ireland. How will the burrows of England take to this resignation? What does it mean, for example, for David Blanche Flowers' Wales? Well, yes, you know, the question of the unity of the United Kingdom has been under much debate in recent years, and aggravated since Brexit, of course, we had Mark Drakeford, the Labour leader of Wales, losing his temper in the Welsh Assembly this week, over the behaviour of the politicians in Westminster. We've had Nicholas Sturgeon saying that this is just another example of why the UK Government is dysfunctional, and Scotland needs a chance to go independent. So, of course, chaos in Westminster, fueling the, I mean, Mark Drakeford in Wales to be clear, is not calling for separation from the United Kingdom, but really fueling the chances of those national parties in the other parts of the United Kingdom. There is a case at the moment for the Supreme Court of where the Nicholas Sturgeon, the Scottish leader, can hold an independence, a new independence referendum next year without the permission of the British Government. That is not widely expected to succeed, but she's now saying the next general election will be a de facto referendum on Scottish independence. IE, if the SNP win a majority in Scotland, she will be able to declare that Scotland is an independent nation. I mean, the chaos that would ensue from such a kind of unilateral move obviously would be immense. We've seen examples of this in recent years in Europe, in Spain, of course. So, you know, stability in Westminster really being craved for those who want to preserve the union, as well as bring some sort of stability back to the economy. David Merritt, thank you so much, and we know you are incredibly busy, so we'll let you get on with your day, David Merritt. Thank you so much for your perspective, senior executive editor, for Bloomberg sticking with Wales, Danny Blanchflower, Dartmouth professor, and former member of the Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee still with us. Is this a concern for you, Danny, that there will be the beginning of, or the acceleration in the fraying of the union of the United Kingdom? Well, it certainly seems so. Obviously, the Scots did not vote to leave, neither did the Northern Irish, and in fact, what's interesting, if we've been talking about Brexit, the one place that actually has been growing pretty strongly is Northern Ireland, which is more closely linked to the European Union. So, certainly, I think that, I mean, I've spent a lot of time in Scotland, the Scots don't feel part of this English right-wing story of trickle-down economics. I think the answer is going to be over the next few months. What happens? Is this libertarian right, Lurch, has that now gone? Where do we go? I mean, the popularity of Brexit is declining even in England, and obviously, you're right. The first Minister of Wales this week, famously quiet man, got lost his temper with some of the comments that were being made. So, I think there's a real issue here. The support for Brexit, I think, seems to be declining, but ultimately, we're going to have to try and get through this chaos. I think that's the first order story. I mean, let's just go back in a sense to all of this. All of this came because trust didn't listen to comments of many people, including me. I've said, trust is going to have to go from Mrs. Stupid to Mrs. Sensible, given what she said as a campaigner. So, she didn't do that. So, we're in this position of chaos. Maybe this reordering will actually be, will bring the country together, I doubt it, but it's hard to think, where does this go? I mean, this morning, you didn't know where it was going to go. So, where is it going to go in a month? I don't know. David, I'm going to mention another, David, David Stockman. What has absolutely upset me in all of this Professor Blanche flower is we've been here before, and it's not a Daniel",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4889,2022-10-20 13:14:28
16544," David Stockman, what has absolutely stunned me in all of this Professor Blanche flower is we've been here before and it's not a Daniel Yurgen exercise at Granding Heights. What it's about is Reaganomics 1 to Reaganomics 2. Now within the American system, President Reagan didn't resign. From what you see here and with the harsh financial ramifications that we've seen including seven standard deviation moving 30 year guilt, was this just Reaganomics 1 that couldn't get constitutionally to Reaganomics 2? No, I mean in a sense I think that the big deal in many senses was that Reagan and Fattu, whether you agreed with what they said, they had a political mandate, the people voted for it. So that was the first thing, nobody voted for this and in some sense there was an economic credibility to what they did. I mean what you saw trust do very much linked to what courtaided was to essentially try and blow up the markets. I mean there was no possible way of having these enormous unfunded policies that markets simply couldn't sustain them. And so I do think that the lack of mandate, the lack of sensible pricing and thinking about what the ramifications were. So I don't really think there was much of an analogy. Ultimately comes down to, they didn't have a mandate. They're not only didn't have a mandate from the people, they actually didn't have a mandate from within their own policy. So that's what we're seeing is unscrambling. The party didn't vote for trust. 81,000 people out there somewhere in the Southeast of England voted for them. And so there was no political credibility and there was no economic credibility. So I don't really see that analogy. Yeah. I mean in a sense, I've never heard anything like it. The various economists, Chris Jars in the FT, Dario Perkins have said the cost of borrowing in the UK has gone up. And now they call it the moron premium. I wouldn't argue that anything may have a sore in the past, but it's bad as that. I certainly wouldn't say that. If you're just joining us right now, Liz trusts the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, stepping down announcing her resignation. She will remain Prime Minister as the race to figure out who succeeds her takes place. We are seeing a bit affirming up in the pound. We're seeing yields in, gilts come down. This is the stability people were looking for on a broader level. There is an issue, Tom, with is this the beginning of a trend of basically bond vigilantes of market participants controlling the political outcome at a time where there really isn't the same kind of appetite for fiscal spending that there was over the past two decades? Well, we're going to see how that goes on the next coming day. It was sterling 112 62 and we're watching, of course, a fixed income market in the United Kingdom with higher, with, excuse me, with lower yields. I guess, a vacillating yields here over the next number of, last number of hours. Yeah, although this really has been the theme of this morning, which is the reason why we've been really watching the yield story as a tea leaf, 15 minutes here at Head of the U.S. Open. Kathy Jones of Char Schwab joining us now. Kathy, how much do you really glean some sort of investment thesis from bond vigilantes rearing their heads and winning with political regime change? Yeah, I think the story here is that as interest rates go up for most governments around the world, that the debt sustainability question becomes, comes back into play. Now, I think the U.K. is kind of a separate situation than most broader markets in the developed markets. But the story is now we have higher interest rates and higher debt levels and it is going to be more difficult for governments to come in and use fiscal policy. They're going to be likely to be more constrained in this environment than they were over the last 10 or 15 years. And that's going to be a fact of life that we'll have to be dealt with. Well, this comes down to Kathy and this is your wheelhouse as we reinvent a risk-free rate. You're too young to remember this, but I remember when there was a normal risk-free rate with a 10 year real yield at 1.70, even printing 1.71 earlier for all, including a beleaguered United Kingdom, I'm sorry, that completely changes the framework of fixed income, doesn't it? Yeah, we're back to, and actually I do remember those days quite well. We're back to a different era.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4890,2022-10-20 13:18:49
16545," work, a fixed income, doesn't it? Yeah, we're back to, and actually I do remember those days quite well. We're back to a different era. And I think that we will stay here. It doesn't mean that nominal yields have to keep going up because of the fed succeeds and bringing inflation down that really yield can stay high with inflation coming down. But I do think we're in a positive, really yielded firement unless or until we hit some sort of a crisis. And something breaks again and the fed has to be lender of last resort. But I do think it has, there has been regime change and this is, frankly, this is great for bond investors, real yields are great. Kathy Jones with us from Schwab and we'll continue with this discussion on the markets. It had lined us up from the gentleman leading the 1922 committee. Mr. Brady says there will be a new United Kingdom leader in place by a week and one day out the next Friday, October 28th, which is, of course, very different than what we saw with the transition from Johnson to Trust. We are hugely advantaged at Bloomberg and in London, with on Bloomberg Radio, Stephen Carroll keeps us moving forward. He is encyclopedic on something less spoken of and that is Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom debate. Stephen, we were talking earlier about Scotland, about Wales, the Professor Blancheflower, with our David Merritt. There was, can Charles III visiting Northern Ireland. How engaged is Northern Ireland? How important is this resignation of the Prime Minister to the fructious Brexit debate of two Ireland's? Well, what's been considered or continued under Liz Trust's Prime Minister has been essentially the status quo in Northern Ireland. There have been high hopes from the unionist community that Liz Trust has put a bill to Parliament which would have allowed the British government to override parts of their Brexit deal with the European Union that they would find a deal that would allow the restoration of government in Northern Ireland. That hasn't happened despite the meetings that have taken place. Quite cordial ones in fact under the Northern Ireland's Secretary Chris Hitton Harris who met Ireland's Finance Minister only a couple of days ago. Ireland's Deputy Prime Minister was in London yesterday meeting with his counterpart Tarez Koffee. This is a series of relationship building which has now essentially gone out the window because the efforts that had been made towards progress are now essentially stalled again as the UK goes back into another set of political turmoil and there's a deadline in Northern Ireland. They must have a deal to restore power sharing by the end of next week or another election has to be called for the Northern Irish Assembly so people are watching this very closely because it has a real impact on government in that part of the UK. Stephen, my grandfather would say to me with great import that Dublin was closer to Wales than London was and there's a whole geography question here but the arch geography is the nation of Ireland. Do they tend to a unification now versus a few years ago? That's much closer now than before the Brexit vote. That has been a massive change in Anglo-Irish relations which had been largely improved after very fractious. You know, as we all know for many decades previously since Ireland's independence in the past 100 years but since 2016 things have taken a turn downwards and now it's a question of whether or not the new Prime Minister can set things on a path which allow for good Anglo-Irish relations. We already had the Irish Finance Minister saying that they're looking for stability out of the Anglo-Irish relationship because of course they want to resolve these problems. They want there to be good relations because of that open border on the island of Ireland between Ireland and Northern Ireland. We had that all important demographic survey telling us that for the first time Catholics in Northern Ireland who traditionally identify as Irish were in the majority for the first time since the creation of Northern Ireland that was only a couple of weeks ago were probably many years away from the vote that is legally possible under the Northern Ireland peace deal, the Belfast Good Friday agreement that could happen but that is in the gift of the Northern Ireland Secretary in London to give. So that will be something that certainly the nationalist side of the political divide in Northern Ireland will be watching very closely as the new government here is assembled. It's not a short term.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4891,2022-10-20 13:23:12
16546," It will be something that certainly the nationalists side, the political divide in Northern Ireland, will be watching very closely as the new government here is assembled. It's not a short term issue, it's unlikely to arise during the lifetime of this government, but it is something certainly people are watching on for the medium to long term. Meanwhile, we are looking at regime change in the United Kingdom. regime change in markets, regime change really spurred in part by inflation. And we have to keep going back to that as markets turn. We are seeing yields going higher as we try to figure out what this ends up as. And Kathy Jones of Charles Schwab is still with us at a time where Yef's UK is a specific story. But we keep talking about how this is really spurred by a 10 percent, 10.1 percent CPI in the United Kingdom, the US not far behind Europe there as well. How much Kathy are we looking at a lack of willingness to really make the hard decisions to cause inflation to come down because of the political turmoil also paired with the lack of perhaps the authority from certain central banking units? Yeah, well, I think most central banks, led by the Fed, have made the decision that fighting inflation is their first and foremost goal. And so they have moved pretty aggressively. As have most other developed market countries, I think the problem going forward is that this focus is on current inflation. And they're not looking at future lack of inflation or disinflation or what comes after this because they're so focused on achieving this goal in the short term. So it does set us up for a lot of volatility right now and probably a great overshooting in terms of yields because there's no confidence in the forecast coming from the central bank. Lizzie, excuse me. Kathy, it speaks to the political instability of the moment. Now we're not going to have resignations. I guess on the first Tuesday of November in the United States, we've got central bank meetings coming up the Fed, the Bank of England, ECB, I believe on October 27th is well. Kathy Jones, you expect the same political turmoil as Lisa mentions to high inflation as we crash through the United States elections? Well, I'm not a political analyst and clearly inflation affects a lot of people. Look, Kathy, today everyone's a political analyst. The prime minister just resigned. I've never aspired to that. But obviously inflation, particularly gasoline prices, we know are highly correlated with consumer confidence and spending plans and with political change. So that is clearly a big issue in the United States. I don't think it's at the acute level, however, that it was in the UK. Simply because gas prices have come down a lot from the peak and we have this rise in real interest rates already at work. And unemployment rate is quite low. We don't have the energy shock going on that Europe has with the Russia, Ukraine war. So I think things are a little milder here. I think there are other issues on the table as well. But clearly inflation is going to be an important one. Kathy Jones of Charles Schwab, thank you so much. And for putting on the political analysts, yeah, exactly. Although just to give you sense, you know, I mentioned the lettuce earlier. The political analysis of Twitter is ahead of lettuce that was put out by the tabloids who would last longer the lettuce or Liz Truss. And it has been declared in the victory of the lettuce this morning. How much does really highlight the sort of dark humor or deal with the moment where it's being taken to Greg's for potentially? I forget. As much. John Farrell working an 18 hour day at Bloomberg. And I went out for dinner in May, fair the day, the morning after the evening after Brexit and the numbness that I felt in the streets. I don't think that's anything compared to what we've seen over the last number of weeks. It is so great. We will continue our coverage.

Well, I think there's a there's a really important overarching theme here that we can divine from this whole truss episode here which is that look the the Fed has been on this sort of America first monetary policy that has been of course very hawkish as it needs to tamp down inflation here in the US but when you have fiscal experiments overseas that are that trust you know put forward and that are that are not sensible policies the the what it means for global risk assets is really really sort of magnify here. So you have a collision that what I'm saying here is that is that the range of big weird outcomes for the markets is much higher and you have this collision of bad fiscal policy with what the Fed is doing right now. And I think that's that's very very very important. I mean I think it's a fair statement that central banks generally like low currency balls here right it just makes the job easier and we're in a state of where you know we can talk about rate fall being super high and of course equity balls high but fx balls are super super high here and it ultimately makes the central bank you know we're all grappling through wind central banks are going to be more you know sort of not let around the nose by inflation and hydrocarbons and when they can actually lead as opposed to the reactive and these types of situations only make central banks whether it's the BOE or even spill over to the Fed more reactive. Michael that's right where I wanted to go you know sharing to join us later in this hour with a real focus on the United Kingdom economy but as Mr. Purvis folks talks about Val and of course his careful study of the Pacific Rim and ADXY it is thrilling to bring you this morning Nick Benenbrook he is Wells Fargo International Economist but he viscerally understands a Pacific Rim with his heritage of New Zealand and far more is the only person on the planet who has been award winning in foreign exchange in back-to-back years. Nick I guess it's good you're not an fx strategist this morning Purvis talks about FX Val give us the Val we're going to see on British pound sterling. Well I think certainly for the next few days we can expect this volatility to continue it might actually be in the upwards direction because you could argue that political and policy uncertainty is reducing in the United Kingdom and so we might see a bit more of a relief and go back towards the sort of even up to the one 13-1-14 level. So I think we're going to see some further up move. Over the months ahead you know I think as the settles we'll start to see markets calm down a little and we might actually start to see the pound when it's faced with the reality of the UK economy the pound won't start to give back some of those gains. Nick what Michael Purvis alluded to and if it is Britain and crisis maybe it's Hungary and crisis maybe it's Thailand and crisis will Jerome Powell need to blink because of the international economics and politics we observe. No I don't think you will have to blink I mean we would still look expect the 75 basis point increase at that November meeting from the field of view. This of course and and it's one of your country's",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4894,2022-10-20 13:36:12
16549," No, I don't think you will have to blink. I mean, we would expect the 75 basis point increase at that November meeting from the fairs. Of course. And as one of you are, and I think we still look for a 50 and eventually getting to five percent on the Fed funds rate, I think the UK events are instructive and the sense of it does come back as one of your previous guests said how sort of unorthodox or unusual are the fiscal policies. And they were fairly unorthodox in the case of the UK just in terms of the magnitude and the way that they were delivered. And it doesn't look like here in the US, for example, or even across the Eurozone in general that we're going to see such expensive fiscal policies. So for the major markets, I think it won't be an issue. But for the markets that you mentioned, the likes of Hungary and Thailand, they may face some challenges. Michael Purvis is still with us. And Michael, I'd love to get your take on what Nick is talking about. But there is some more stability, but the stability speaks to a more significant downturn, at least in the short run, based on the lack of borrowing. How much are you factoring that into some of your outcomes and your theses? Well, I think what this whole trust episode really sort of reiterates is that we need kind of boring policy, if you will, right? And I think there's this inevitable tension where, you know, like politicians biggest on one of their biggest enemies is surging food and energy inflation. And there's always sort of a temptation to put in novel fiscal policies when they're not, when they're actually the worst things for the situation. So we kind of need to see things get a lot more boring. But I agree with my co-guest that I think if the major markets here, if things can be a little bit more static and stable, then more of the blow up will be relegated to more than it's the niche markets here. But I think if the takeaway here from this trust situation is that, geez, go on and we're going to go to a much more tectocratic and less what will go innovative fiscal policies will, you know, responses to this high inflation, that's going to be state, you know, sort of enhanced markets stability here, which is, which is sorely needed. Perhaps another way of saying a talk of M.M.T. might have died a very rapid death over the past few months. Nick Benenbrooke is still with us. I am wondering what this means in terms of energy policy for Europe at a time when a lot of nations, including Germany, we're looking to spend extensively to stave off some of the gaps in the household budgets. Does this torpedo some of that, or does that pressure the euro and just German yields higher in a way that hasn't fully been realized yet? No, I don't think it's going to derail those energy price plans that we've seen across Europe. I did see some estimates the other day, maybe in the region of 40 to 50 billion euros to sort of help support the energy price plans there. And you know, even going back to the UK experience, it wasn't so much the initial energy price cap that caused the consternation on the part of market participants. It was the growth plan in late September and the unfunded policies there. So coming back to my earlier comment, I don't perceive the extent of fiscal support or fiscal expansion that they're talking about across Europe as being so dramatic that you know, have to move away from those policies. Nick Benenbrooke, just for you, there was such respect for your affectability to call over the years. I looked at sterling New Zealand dollar. I don't know what that's called. Is it sterling kiwi? I, you know, is that the fancy talk? I've never done it. I love this. I've never done it for Nick Benenbrooke. The bottom line is massive New Zealand strength over 20 years. And now we're buttress down at the low end of strong New Zealand dollar trading range. What are the ramifications for the global system? If we see things like sterling kiwi break out to new sterling weakness, that's an instability that Michael Purvis was talking about. Well, again, I think coming back to your previous comment, though, Tom, it depends on the extent of volatility and just how dramatic those moves are. You know, in my, I mean, I've been around for a while, 20 years, maybe even longer. We've seen someone, for me, and some unusual things, the Australian dollar.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4895,2022-10-20 13:40:34
16550," and just how dramatic those moves are. You know, in my, I mean, I've been around for a while, 20 years maybe even longer. We've seen someone, for me, in some unusual things, the Australian dollar trading above parity against US dollar, for example, would be one of those. So I think so, if this is just reflective of maybe increasing commodity prices in general and just the relative performance of these economies, then if you continue to move in that direction as long as it's orderly, I think it's not problematic. It does 20 years ago I was living in London for a couple of years. So, you know, maybe I should be living there now. It would have been much nicer given the key week's dealing exchange rate. Well, it's Fargo International Economist Nick Benenbroke. Thank you so much. Also our thanks to Michael Purvis for your guidance here. I do want to just bring you, and we've been talking about the lettuce concept for a while. But the reason why I find this interesting is because this has been just lighting up Twitter with all these stores in the United Kingdom, putting out a Twitter post saying, what a great day to be a lettuce. And it's gotten, you know, it's just, well, the reason why, the reason why is because it perfectly encapsulates both the issues with food, as well as, you know, just in terms of the gallows humor. I keep going back to this because where do we get that feeling of, oh my goodness, we're seeing our mortgage costs go up. We're seeing our energy costs. Oh, these stores. Yeah, this is all these stores in United Kingdom. What a great day to be a lettuce. And, you know, people are loving it. They're all sorts of other memes, etc. But it really does highlight the moment. That's why I keep highlighting it. We welcome all of you of Global Wall Street and all tuning in on radio and television and extraordinary day. I'm going to do a quick data check here. Starting with Sterling, 112, 58, Redding Green on the screen. Thankfully, equity markets not giving us a story in the middle of earning season. I guess I could say the 10 year real year after 1.71% is news and United States yields are higher today. It's all been overwhelmed by the international relations of the resignation of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Let us listen to Liz Trust earlier this morning. We set out a vision for a low tax, high-grace economy that would take advantage of the freedoms of Brexit. I recognize, though, given the situation, I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party. I have therefore spoken to his majesty, the King, to notify him that I am resigning as leader of the Conservative Party. Prime Minister Trust from that podium outside 10 Downing Street in the long, long back, the long walk, I should say, back through that famous black door. Joining Sal Lizzie Burton is at 10 Downing Street. She's been on this story from the get-go. Lizzie, a general question for those of us not up to speed. How unified is Liz Trust's fractured Conservative Party? Whatever the opposite of that is, completely divided and these divisions have been sown for years, perhaps going back before Brexit. That's what's so difficult in this leadership race. We heard from Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 Committee of Conservative Backbentures just now, saying that there's going to be a leadership election by Friday. And Rishi Sunak may be the book he's favourite, but he's incredibly divisive in the party, because he's seen as having brought down Boris Johnson. Even though he would be such a shoe-in to Jeremy Hunt's economic policies, he faces such a mountain to climb. But what you might see, even though this party is so divided, is that because there's such a fear of a general election, they know how divisive a leadership contest internally can be, that they all just fall behind one candidate and it doesn't actually have to go to the party membership. Is Jeremy Hunt just playing hard to get? Does he actually want to be Prime Minister? No, but this is all that Mark is care about, that Jeremy Hunt is safe. You've seen a lift in the pound and guilt the last time I had a look. And that's because Mark is a confident that these fiscal plans are going to go ahead. Graham Brady also said that the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4896,2022-10-20 13:44:49
16551," That's time I had a look. And that's because markets are confident that these fiscal plans are going to go ahead. Graham Brady also said that the fiscal statement on the 31st of October that we were expecting is going to go ahead. It means that the Bank of England can take account of that on November 3rd. And yeah, it's really all markets care about. Lizzie, thank you so much for your coverage this morning through surveillance. I know you're going to be there through the United Kingdom afternoon, but we all great. Lisa and I and John greatly appreciate your effort today at 10 Downing Street. We return to Guy Johnson getting ready for a 10 o'clock effort in New York and of course, not only up to speed on all of this elite talk, but I think Guy Johnson's got a spectacular knowledge about the other people as well. Can I bring this out? I'll let you bring this up from a very good source, Swinford over at the Times of London. And then you can go to Guy Johnson on this. Well, of course, Johnson. Yeah, exactly. At the Times of London is saying that Boris Johnson is expected to stand in contest at a time. When perhaps where was he, the Caribbean and people are wondering or trying to find this, but Guy Johnson is with us. Guy, your reaction to this headline. Maybe he will cut his holiday short. Maybe he will return. It's interesting. So you've got a sort of two stage process here. And I think we need to think about those two stages as being distinct. So it was interesting to hear what Lizzie had to say about the possibility of one candidate ultimately being put forward. Is there the tolerance within the Conservative Party after the, after the huge volatility we've seen over the last few days for a Boris Johnson return? Is that something, are they prepared to go back to what was a fairly chaotic effort inside 10 Downing Street from Boris Johnson and his team? Or are they looking ahead thinking what we need here is actually stability? And Boris Johnson as John McElfoy was putting out a little bit earlier on, not exactly synonymous with that. My image of take guy is Johnson was thrown out because of scandal, cocktails, whatever it was. I don't remember the details. I don't care. Are the Brits as Pharaoh would say? Are they forgiving of that to say you were thrown out, you served your punishment? And would we see a different or new Prime Minister Boris Johnson October 29th? There's been very little evidence of a new Boris Johnson, but I guess anything is possible. Boris Johnson, I suspect, is very popular within the Conservative Party grassroots, i.e. the party, but within the parliamentary party, which ultimately is going to decide which two candidates go forward, I don't know. And that is where the challenge for Boris Johnson is ultimately going to be here. Clearly he would like to return. Clearly he is interested in retaking 10 Downing Street. But nevertheless, he has got to convince the parliamentary party that that is a good idea. And I think they threw him out because they were sick and tired of the turbulence. We just had even more turbulence. I'm not sure that they want any more. But Guy, there's also a issue here with the overhang of Brexit because Boris Johnson oversaw the whole process how much is Brexit still a popular decision, especially in the wake of the turmoil that we've seen over the past couple of months? It is still a hugely divisive issue, Lisa. And as we were hearing earlier on, it is not a completed project. And therein lies the problem. Boris Johnson couldn't get Brexit done. Do we want to return to the instability also that the issue of Brexit when pursues aggressively can generate the Northern Ireland protocol? We haven't talked much about that, have we? But it's still lingers as an issue. It was interesting to hear what Mr MacRaw over the channel had to say an hour or so ago. Yeah. This is... The issue now is that the parliamentary party is in job preservation mode. Is Boris Johnson... Right...is that terrorism, is that takism going to be enough to get him back into prime position? I don't know. I want to frame the next 13 minutes for you folks. Why you need to stay with us on radio and television. Neil Shearing is going to be up next with piercing conversation.

16552," You need to stay with us on Radio Intelligence. And Neil Shearing's going to be up next with piercing conversation. But I've got to continue with Guy Johnson on the former Prime Minister. Is there almost a yearning by all for Boris? I can't believe I'm saying this guy, but Boris Stability, I mean, is that the emotion that we're going to see into the British evening? That's an oxymoron, Tom, but yes. I was going to say so. Let you put Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt together. Remember, they competed. You asked the question a little bit earlier. Come on, Jeremy Hunt wants to be Prime Minister. He competed to be Prime Minister. What I think isn't she about Jeremy Hunt is, has the borrower's wing of the Conservative Party forgiven Jeremy Hunt for basically competing with Boris Johnson? I suspect the answer is yes. Have they forgiven Rissi Sunak? I suspect the answer is no. And that's where I think all of this becomes extremely interesting as to kind of which factions are positioning, sort of behind which candidates. But I think I come back to this issue. We have just had a huge bout of instability. That is something that the Conservative Party I think is desperate to put behind them. Guy, how much, as we look to the likelihood of a Boris Johnson kind of Prime Minister ship, yet again, are people looking for a celebrity versus a technocrat? I think that comes down to the same issue, Lisa. They would like to be able to win the next general election. Are you going to do that with celebrity or are you going to do that with stability? And we've still got two, we've still got two odd years to go until that general election. The search light of public opinion has yet to really settle on the Labour Party and its leadership. It will do at some points and it will be a huge challenge for them. I think my solution there to Guy and to you, Lisa, is it Kenneth Branagh ought to come back and run for Prime Minister since he was just doing the Boris movie as well. Guy Johnson in London, thank you so much for your coverage throughout the morning. I'm sure you'll be hearing much, much more. And you'll be joining starting at 10 for full coverage. Right now, we want to get a sense, it's just going to the economic picture really at the core of the turmoil and the core of what's to come. Capital economics chief economist, Neil Shearing joining us now. What's your sense, Neil, of how the ramification of this will play out for the United Kingdom as the world's six largest economy at a time of such tumult both from the leadership as well as, honestly, from the inflation standpoint? We'll look, six largest economy at the moment, but factoring the weaker pound that may not be the six largest economy for much longer. I think that the key thing, and you touched on this as some of the reporting earlier, is less at the moment who's in number 10 and who's in number 11, who's running the Treasury, what they're saying about fiscal policy, the extent to which there's a steady hand on the tiller there in the context of all the tumult that we've seen over the past several weeks. Now, the news that Johnson might be back and put in his name on the ballot paper, I think, is literally the last thing that the UK bond market would want to see. So let's see how that one plays out. But the economic picture is pretty grim, I have to say. There's a huge squeezing real incomes coming down the track. Interest rates have got to rise further, irrespective of what's happening to fiscal policy. The housing market looks vulnerable to me. The bank of England needs to do more work to squeeze inflation out to the system every week where you work. There are challenges. Neil, I want you to talk, and you've done great work on this. I'm going to talk about the capital economics. I'd really say industry leading work on the polarity. The delusion folks, as I go from Heathrow in an limo to the fancy hotel, walk across the street, enjoy Queen Victoria Street, fly home, and say I went to England. And that's, of course, a complete fiction. Neil's sharing outside the elite climbs of London, how bad is it for the United Kingdom economy? It's bad in London. It's bad in the United Kingdom generally. I think you're right. There's huge disparity, both of economic growth and income growth and also wealth within the economy. And that's greater to the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4898,2022-10-20 13:53:35
16553," income growth and also wealth within the economy and that's greater to that's too much greater extent in the UK than in the case in other European cities and there's a lot of the European countries and there's lots of reason for that poor infrastructure, poor skills, poor dispersion of technologies across industries within the UK but you're correct. I mean London is London in the southeast incomes and income growth of far higher than is the case elsewhere in the country but let's not this is not the case that the rest of the country is suffering while London is powering ahead, London is going to suffer in this downturn too. You talked about this ex-logic economy for now and where it was headed. What do you see in terms of what kind of downturn you're expecting and how this turmoil really plays into it? Well in terms of the pure economic downturn I think we're going with looking sterrandan the barrel barrel of probably a 2% 4 in GDP, something like that peak to trough. I think a lot of that will be felt in the household sector, consumers coming under enormous pressure at the housing market and construction coming under pressure too. The question really is whether or not that in turn this feedback looks through the financial system that amplifies those shocks and makes things even worse. Now interestingly I think the interesting question for the markets perspective is how much of that is now priced in. It's interesting that the trust has resigned this afternoon London time and the bond markets didn't really move. The currency markets have not really moved. The big move came last week when Hunt came in unwiring the loss of the fiscal measures and so I think a lot of that risk pre-release went into the UK markets is probably already unwend itself. We are advanced to close with you today. Thank you so much Neil. Sharing for capital economics again I can't say enough about the firms where get their research from capital economics we protect the copyright of all of our guests. I'm going to say this now Lisa rather than at the end when we're rushing and crashing to break and we're worn out and all that. What an effort by our team today and that we really didn't see this coming. I would say last night about 11 p.m. New York time I was like oh tomorrow. Yeah. But we really quanted in the team really pieces together today where they think a great set of voices within Bloomberg and outside as well. And we have an incredible stable of talent here at Bloomberg just to take a step back to really paint the picture. The shortest tenure of a Prime Minister ship ever going back the second most going back to the 1800s. Yeah. The early 1800s and that was ended by tuberculosis highlights how fast this had moved. I keep going back to this that Liz Truss accepted the Prime Minister role from the queen and then handed in her resignation to the king because of the transition in power there the transition in the sort of metaphor of some of this turmoil. How much does this reshape politics in the UK going forward and I agree totally and highlight the turmoil stemming more broadly from an inflationary regime that is new at least over the past couple of weeks. Get jokes with the brilliant notice auction today on a 112 46 sterling alluding to resilient dollar sterling weaker. But I agree with you that there's ramifications here that are David Merritt talked about not only for England not only for financial London and Ed Merrill but also for Wales and Scotland and Northern Ireland. And John McElthweight saying that this political moment went over the edge for this market. There will be continued news as he burdens tells us into the evening of London.

Pepsi's number fever campaign in the Philippines has probably gone down in history as one of the biggest marketing disasters in history mainly because of a human error that led Pepsi to print more winning caps than they planned. The resulting chaos caused riots, civil unrest, and even deaths. Reporting this story took over a year and it resulted in me flying to Manila in the Philippines to meet unlucky winners and to find out exactly what happened back then in the 1990s. My name is Jeff Mace. I'm a journalist based in Los Angeles. I wrote the story for Bloomberg Business Week about Pepsi's number fever campaign. The Philippines is a really interesting country. It's made up of thousands of islands and it's also a country that's very heavily influenced by America. American culture is everywhere you look in the Philippines. They're obsessed with Frank Sinatra music for example. They love all things America and that extends to their love for soft drinks. Pepsi.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4900,2022-10-20 14:02:24
16555," They're obsessed with Frank Sinatra music, for example. They love all things America, and that extends to their their love for soft drinks. Pepsi Cola, Coca Cola. In the 1990s, it was everywhere. Pepsi and Coca Cola were embroiled in what is now known as the Cola Wars. It was a fierce battle for market dominance. Number fever was already a really popular promotion. It had been rolled out in America to great success. And so Pepsi decided to roll it out internationally, particularly in Asia. They thought it was the answer to their problems. They thought it could finally help them beat their biggest competitor. Internet, I want, I want! Look for the winning number in size size for every day. I'll find TV, radio, newspaper, you could be a millionaire. A million pesos or $68,000 doesn't sound like a lot now. But in 1992, that was a phenomenal amount of money. You've got to remember that in the Philippines at the time, the average monthly income was about $100. So a million pesos was wealth beyond anyone's wildest imaginations. Number fever caught fire in the Philippines. Kids were saving up their pocket money to buy a bottle of Pepsi. Parents were squirreling away all of the bottle caps in bags. You would walk down the street and people were going through trash trying to find discarded bottle caps. It was a national phenomenon. Pepsi boasted that half the population of the Philippines was playing it. Number fever boosted Pepsi sales every month from $10 million. It had a huge impact on Pepsi's bottom line. Number fever quickly became number hysteria. Mades were being jailed for stealing their employer's winning bottle caps. There was even some murders over winning bottle caps. People were fighting in the streets over these caps. There were signs that there were going to be problems with number fever very early. Pepsi had rolled out the competition in Chile and a garbled fax had caused some kind of problem with the winning number. They'd announced the wrong one in Chile, causing riots. There were signs that there could be big problems ahead if they didn't keep their eye on the ball. In 1992 Pepsi decided to extend the campaign in the Philippines and they announced that the competition would go on for a few more weeks. One night on the television news they announced the latest winning number. Three, four, nine. The problem was three, four, nine had already been allocated as a non-winning number in earlier campaigns. So there were literally hundreds of thousands of bottle caps with three, four, nine, just floating around the Philippines. Hundreds of thousands of people all across the Philippines, thousands of islands were finding winning bottle caps. Three, four, nine, three, four, nine. Some people had ten lucky three, four, nine bottle caps. People were dancing in the street celebrating. They thought their problems were over. They were millionaires. It's still not certain exactly how many winners there were of lucky three, four, nine bottle caps. But we know that Pepsi printed over 600,000 of them. Pepsi realized very early that there was a problem. Hundreds of people started arriving at their bottling plants with their lucky bottle caps. They realized something was seriously wrong. Pepsi tried to solve the problem by offering a small token donation to anyone that brought a lucky bottle cap to their bottling plant. But it wasn't enough. People didn't want just a handful of pesos. People wanted their million pesos prize. Within a year, violent protests and riots outside Pepsi factories would leave dozens injured and five people dead.

16556," injured and five people dead. At one Pepsi factory in the Philippines, a grenade was thrown through the window. It killed three Pepsi employees. Anacita Rosario was a schoolteacher, living near Manila in the Philippines. She was one of the tragic victims of this whole thing. She was walking to a nearby store to buy some rice one day when a Molotov cocktail was thrown at a Pepsi truck in a violent protest. It bounced under the truck and exploded. It killed her and an innocent bystander who was just a child and injured many others. When I was in the Philippines, I tracked down Anacita's daughter, Cindy and her husband, Role. It was clear to me that they were still very upset by the whole thing. You know, a family had been ripped apart by this competition. And Role told me that he'd never remarried. He'd told me that he'd gone to meet Pepsi executives after his wife was killed. And he was angry. He said to them, you know, this wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you, if it wasn't for number fever. The biggest revelation from my reporting was rumors that Pepsi was somehow involved in bombing their own trucks. I found a newspaper report with a headline that said Pepsi goons bombed their own trucks. And when I visited the MBI, the police department in the Philippines, they presented me with documents and interviews with people who claimed that Pepsi had paid them to cause riots and to cause trouble outside their plants. In order to destabilize the situation and to frame the owners of the coalitions that were fighting them to try and curry favor, I just thought that was so shocking. And of course, Pepsi denied it. But how bizarre that a company would be accused of bombing their own trucks. The contest had sparked so much anger in the Philippines because it landed at just this really weird time in the Philippines' history. It was during a crazy election that was racked with allegations of fraud. The Philippines was in a kind of love-hate relationship with America. They loved, obviously, the American aid and for the American aid. They loved, obviously, the American aid and finances that was pouring into the country. But at the same time, they yearned for independence. They wanted to be their own country. Vicente Del Fiero was a local preacher living in Manila and he hated the number fever campaign. Del Fiero thought Pepsi's number fever campaign was just one of the many ways that America was asserting its dominance over a third world country. He hated seeing his fellow countrymen get ripped off in his eyes by this huge multinational American company. He wanted justice. Del Fiero rounded up over 800 winners of three, four, nine bottle caps and he got them all together to sue Pepsi for over $400 million to be divided between those holders of lucky bottle caps. Del Fiero took money from some of the people who could afford it. They paid him 500 pesos to help with legal fees but for people who couldn't afford the money he would just represent them pro bono. I love him. He's the new member of the company. And for the new people, I might be the new. So he had mounted that on the tampon and then he flew to America and he hired two consumer lawyers here in America to take on Pepsi. He had a meeting at Pepsi's headquarters to try and resolve the problem but he said he wanted to take it all the way to the highest courts in America. When those cases were heard in America, those courts...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4902,2022-10-20 14:10:59
16557," Quarters to try and resolve the problem, but he said he wanted to take it all the way to the highest courts in America. When those cases were heard in America, those courts decided that this was a problem that should be heard in the Philippines, not in America. Back in the Philippines, Delphiero continued his case in the Filipino courts. At one stage, there were arrest warrant, handed out for nine Pepsi-Cola executives, which he saw as a big victory. We don't know if those arrest warrant were ever upheld, but it made newspaper headlines across the country. Pepsi did not take kindly to Delphiero's campaign. They tried everything to shut him down. They sued him for libel. My father had to attend three times a month for a branch, one for the five, and another heating for the branch, one for the 13, also three times a month. Also, there was a time my father's hospital, who had to attend the two branch heating of otherwise, for not attending the judge, will issue water to the next one of the father. My father passed away on what it was in the 13th, then after staying for almost one year in the hospital, he died of complications due to heart failure. After the death of my father, I was inspired to do the website. Pepsi could be remembered for what they did to the consumer in the Philippines and to my father. When I reached out to Pepsi for comment for this story, they claimed that they didn't have access to anyone who was working at Pepsi that was around in those days. They also said that during COVID-19, they didn't have access to their documents about this, but they were very careful to say that they were sorry for everything that happened. We do know that Pepsi did try everything to try and make this right. The Pepsi number fever disaster cost the company millions. We know that they paid up to $10 million in those good-will payments, but the financial effect could be much greater. After the disaster, we know that Pepsi sales dipped. They were overtaken by Coca-Cola again. Pepsi's number fever disaster changed the legacy of that soft drink in the Philippines forever. Some people of certain age won't touch it. For many people, Pepsi is a taboo word. A lot of the people that I spoke to were still quite traumatized by their experience, by that experience of winning a million pesos, losing it, and then returning to their normal life in poverty in Manila. In Manila. And the news of the farming came out. It was a massive story in Germany. The news coming to us out of Dortmund in Germany. It was covered by all the media. Three roadside explosions triggered at the same time last night as the coach left its hotel in the south of Dortmund. Public figures commented on it. We should not let them affect our life wherever it was. The media echo went far beyond Dortmund. I think it was front page news in every single big paper around Europe. Everyone thought of like a terrorist attack and people were scared that throughout the city in Dortmund there was more attacks to be happening. Unbeknownst to investigators just after the bomb went on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4903,2022-10-20 14:15:18
16558," I thought it would be like a terrorist attack and people would get that throughout the city and the development there was more attacks to be happening. Unbeknownst to investigators just after the bomb went off and the players of the team were shell shocked. The person who had mastered the attack was actually sitting in the hotel, eating steak and sweet potatoes. My name is Thomas Rogers. I'm the journalist who wrote the article, The Get Rich Quick Scheme, that nearly killed a German soccer team. Dortmund is a mid-sized city in the western part of Germany in a state called North Rhein-Westphalia. And it's a former industrial city that's kind of fallen on hard times in the last few decades. It was severely bombed in the war. So the center of the city is quite stark. Some of the few high points include its soccer team. My name is Aikening. I'm a reporter with Bloomberg News and I'm a great fan of Borussia Dortmund. Dortmund fans are super loyal. On all matchdays, the entire city is in black and yellow. It's like a religion. I think more than most German cities, soccer does play a very large role in the identity of Dortmund. In October of 2000, the BBB became the first team in the Bundesliga to actually go public. Salaries for soccer players in the Bundesliga have gone up very dramatically. With such high prices, they thought that by going public, they would be able to compete better with big teams like Bayern Munich. Unfortunately that didn't go too well. Dortmund bought too many expensive players, high wages, and the club almost went bust in 2005. The price of their shares, it has sometimes gone up but mostly gone down since they made that decision. So on April 11, 2017, the team was staying in a hotel on the outskirts of Dortmund. Matchdays are always special in Dortmund. Everyone is looking forward to it. The team always meets in the same hotel ahead of matches. They stayed in this hotel in order to have a kind of neutral space before games so that they could concentrate, be isolated from distractions, things like that. Everyone was pretty optimistic they had a chance to go really far, maybe into the finals. I was in the office and getting ready for matchday. I was going to meet with a friend, a fellow Dortmund supporter in the pub. As always, the fans are very excited about matches. On that day, we're heading to play in the quarter-final against AS Monaco at Signal Iduna Stadium, which is in the centre of Dortmund. Shortly before 7pm, the players of the team boarded their official team bus. When the bus took off, the parking lot of the hotel and turned on the street. There were three detonations, three bombs that exploded and hit the bus off Dortmund. Three explosions occurred close to the Borussia Dortmund team bus. The B team bus had just left the hotel. The explosions destroyed two windows in the rear part of the bus. People screamed, people jumped to the ground. The fellow Dortmund fan I was supposed to watch match with. He called me and said, turn on the TV. There was an attack of the Dortmund bus. And I thought he was like, there was impossible. Some of the players screamed at the driver to keep driving as fast as possible, because they were worried that people might storm the bus. German investigators say the explosive devices, used in the attack on the Borussia Dortmund bus, contained metal pins, and the one had pierced a seat headrest. Unbeknownst to the team members, the actual mastermind behind the attack was, as they were disembarking the bus, was actually eating steak and sweet potatoes at the hotel. They had just left. Authorities were attempting to verify a letter left at the scene, claiming Jihadists were behind the attack. Because there had been a series of attacks.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4904,2022-10-20 14:19:40
16559," Tell, they had just left. Authorities were attempting to verify a letter left at the scene, claiming Jihadists were behind the attack. Because there had been a series of attacks by Islamic terrorists in Germany and Europe, there was a widespread suspicion in the media that this was another Islamic terror attack. Three letters were found at the site of the bombing that took credit for the attack on behalf of Islamic State. There were however reasons to doubt this particular narrative. Would actually be a surprise if ISIS were actually part of this attack. Possibly could be employed by other groups like the Far Right Wing to try and shift the blame. The letters had some strange qualities. They were written in a strange German that used big sophisticated words, but had basic grammar mistakes. As if someone was native German speaker but pretending to be a foreign person. Federal investigators have detained one man suspected of links to Islamist terrorism, one of two suspects whose apartments were raided this morning. Shortly after the bombing, a man in Austria named Rudolf, who was a big BVB fan, noticed that something strange was going on on the stock market related to the team's shares. He emailed the lawyers of BVB who then forwarded that email onto investigators. The email stated that someone had bought 60,000 BVB put options, a wager that the value of the shares of the team would fall below a certain amount at a certain date. Why would someone buy that ahead of a match and then three bombs go off? Something isn't right here. For the person to make money off of that, it required the stock to go down quite a bit in a fairly short period of time. And it wouldn't just be the team losing a match, it would require something much bigger than that. There was another big red flag about this purchase, which is the fact that it had actually been made. Number one on the day of the bombing, but also from an IP address that had been traced to the actual hotel where the bombing had taken place. When three explosions targeted the bus carrying the Borussia Dortmund footballers on April 11th, written notes left at the scene, claimed the attack was the work of ISIL. The truth, as is now alleged, is remarkable. On April 21st, the police arrested a man in a southern German city called Tubing, and it was on his way to work. And his name was Sergei Bina-Gaude. He seemed like an unlikely suspect, because he had no known connections to the Islamic terror world. He didn't seem like a far-right extremist. He didn't seem like a left-wing extremist either. He seemed to be a completely unremarkable young man. A 28-year-old German Russian man named only a Sergei W, stayed in the same hotel as the players on the night before the bombing. He specifically requested an upper room overlooking the bushes where the explosive devices were hidden. The media dissected why he would do that, what was his past. He had been inspired by the 2015 terror attack in Paris. And he noticed that in the aftermath of the attack, the stocks of French companies went down. And he believed that if an attack took place that was directed at a specific company, that the decrease in stock price for that company would be even more dramatic. It never occurred to anyone that someone would do that out of greed. We now know that the suspect bought three different derivatives on the Borzi-Adortman shares, with all these derivatives he bet on falling shares. The suspect bought the majority of these financial products on the 11th of April, the day of the attack. If the plot had been complete, successful, and the stock had reached a value of zero, the intergolds would have made up to 570,000 euros, or the equivalent of about $608,000. Ultimately, the plan completely backfired. The attacker, Sergei Winnigold, didn't make any money, in fact, he lost money. In court, he would be extremely quiet.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4905,2022-10-20 14:24:00
16560," Gold didn't make any money, in fact, he lost money. In court, he would be extremely quiet. He usually kept his hands clasped together. One of the lawyers actually commented that he had never seen a defendant act so calmly. Venergold had served some time in the German military. From that information and from online research, he was able to figure out how to assemble remote, detonated bombs that would do what he hoped to do. There were a few days of extremely emotional testimony, including the soccer players who described, doubting whether or not they could ever play another game again. It brought everything back up and it didn't quite help them to kind of process what was going on. Throughout it all, he sat there completely silent. The big mystery that was swirling around the trial was the question of why he may have simply done it because he wanted to impress a woman. Rebecca is a young woman who has a very troubled home life. She ultimately sees her relationship with Venergold as an opportunity to leave that troubled home. Venergold is a Russian immigrant to Germany. He speaks with an accent. He has anxiety in large groups of Germans. She begins to resent the fact that he has these fears and feels a little bit trapped. Rebecca attempts to dump him on multiple occasions and he threatens to commit suicide if she leaves him. Venergold apparently told Rebecca that she would soon be seeing a surprise. After being dumped via text message, he apparently began planning for this attack in earnest. Venergold was charged with 28 counts of attempted murder, which carried a maximum sentence in Germany of life in prison. He claimed that he had nothing to do with the attack, but as time went on, he admitted that he had actually been the person who had built the explosives and had set them on. But he claimed that he didn't want to actually kill anybody. Ultimately, Venergold didn't receive the harshest possible sentence. He was given 14 years in prison, but it's still a considerable amount in jail in Germany. The threat of an asteroid hitting Earth is very real. If it's big enough, it's also very final. These are very, very infrequent events. The probability is not zero, though. A blinding flash of light streaking across the sky. About 100 tons of space rock falls on Earth every day. Most of it is so small, it burns up in our atmosphere, or lands unnoticed away from major populations. No human in the past thousand years is known to have been killed by a meteorite, and according to NASA, no large object is likely to strike the Earth any time in the next several hundred years. However, one thing is certain, we haven't found them all. There are thousands out there, and we don't know where they are. There are a lot of asteroids in our solar system. They don't...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4906,2022-10-20 14:28:15
16561," There are a lot of asteroids in our solar system. They number in the billions. Scientists all over the world are working toward detecting and deflecting the most catastrophic of natural disasters. The race is on to find as many of these objects as we can. Yes, the way of calculating whether or not an asteroid is potentially dangerous or not. I mean, I think it's something worth investing in. It's our existence at stake, right? Amy, let's get this one out of the way. It's probably the question you get asked the most, but how scared should we be? Asteroids and comets are a natural hazard that's out there like a lot of other natural hazards. These are very, very infrequent events, these collision events where an object actually impacts the Earth. The most important thing that we need to know about asteroids is when the next impact is going to happen and how bad it will be. What we know is that an object that's about, say, a kilometer across is capable of causing very, very wide devastation across the planet, really, truly global devastation. The object that wiped out the dinosaurs was somewhere in the neighborhood of five to ten kilometers across, so even bigger than that. At a kilometer, it's still going to be very bad and will have global effects. For objects that are capable of causing what I would call sort of regional damage, kind of a large major metropolitan area, a city in its surrounding environments, sort of around a hundred-ish meters. It depends on the details of the composition and so forth. By the 1980s, NASA was cataloging near-Earth objects. In 1994, Stargazers watched as comet Schumacher-Levy 9 hit Jupiter. The resulting zone of chaos was estimated to be as large as the Earth, and the event became a turning point in the search for asteroids and comets in our solar system. In 1998, Congress tasked NASA with finding 90% of asteroids and comets, one kilometer wide, or larger. Soon after, Hollywood blockbusters Armageddon and Deep Impact brought attention and fear to the masses. The great news is that the vast majority, more than 90% of all the really large, one-kilometer near-Earth objects have been found. The challenge now is working down to these smaller sizes that are still quite capable of causing a lot of damage, but they're just harder to spot because they're fainter. They're smaller. Can you give us a sense of how many are out there in our solar system? We know that there are a lot of asteroids in our solar system. They number in the billions. Most of them, however, are between Mars and Jupiter in what we call the main asteroid belt. This is a region of space where most of the asteroids in the inner part of our solar system live, and they stay there for many billions of years. There is another population, though, that kind of leaks inward and gets into the region somewhat close to the Earth. We call these near-Earth objects. We think that there are millions and millions of near-Earth objects that are out there in the total population. As of today, we know of sort of around 20, 25,000, something like that. When we first spot an object, we really know very little about it. We just see something moving across the sky. All you get is just sort of a handful of snapshots, just enough to be able to tell that this isn't an asteroid that we've already seen before. Then once we can calculate the distance to it, we can now start to make predictions about its true size. Is it large or is it small? We have a lot of information that we have to get pretty quickly to really understand what's going on. Finding asteroids is just one piece of the puzzle. Planetary scientists are extremely skilled in determining the orbits and speeds of asteroids based on relatively small amounts of data. NASA runs simulations of the trajectories asteroids could take, which is useful, but time-consuming. A team of scientists in the Netherlands have found a way that could buy us more time. Our methods is very quick. So you can very quickly get an assessment of whether or not the objects is danger or not. If you look at the classical way of determining the danger of an asteroid, it may take a day of computing time on very big machines to determine this hazardous.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4907,2022-10-20 14:32:42
16562," way of determining the danger of an asteroid, it may take days of computing time on very big machines to determine this hazardousness. The current problem is that there's just too many asteroids out there to spend a huge amount of computational power on all of them. So the neural network allows us to focus on what really could go and pose a hazard to Earth. The neural network is a computing system that mimics the way the human brain operates to find underlying relationships in a set of data. By training the network in this way, you train it in recognizing those objects that are most likely to hit the planet. And once it's trained, you can apply this network to all the unknown asteroids. And then you can make a selection and say, hey, this is these are the ones which appear to be having orbits similar to the ones which we know are hitting the planets. That doesn't mean that they do, but it only means that they look very similar to the ones we know they do. What else did you find? Should we be particularly concerned about anything? One thing that we did find is that our neural network was able to go and identify a handful of asteroids, which weren't considered potentially hazardous, that when we went into the gradient and forward in time, they came quite close to Earth. We find a handful which were not detected before or not considered being dangerous before and we think they are potentially dangerous. It's very hard to simulate kind of going forward in time and asteroid that's going to hit Earth because what the Earth is really small and what space is really big. And then you have to have very exact parameters to shoot an asteroid that goes and hits exactly here and then Simon had the ingenious idea of not even trying to do that and just launching the asteroids from Earth's surface and integrating backwards in time. It's very hard to make it hit. So you need a lot of calculations which all end up in nothing. And the idea was then like, well, let's not do that. This is basically what NASA is doing. NASA is taking an asteroid, making multiple copies of them, shooting them all forwards in time, calculating their orbits, and then see what fraction sort of gets close to Earth. Well, even hitting Earth but getting close to Earth and that they call it a potential impactor. So you calculate the solar system forward in time for let's say a thousand years and then you launch asteroids from the surface as if they if you go forward in time would fall on the surface, you calculate them backwards due today and then you get your orbital parameters of today's asteroid which you know will land on the planet. And those you can use as known impactors and come here with all the other asteroids in the solar system. Consimulations and AI can those things fill in the gaps where perhaps telescopes and other imaging tools can't. Absolutely. Since the observations get more complex, the physics gets more complex and if the physics gets more complex, the mathematics becomes more complex. And at some point you can't solve your problems analytically anymore and then this is where the computer comes in. Now we have this trained neural network. We have a way of calculating in a fraction of a seconds whether or not an asteroid is potentially dangerous or not and therefore deserves more attention or more time to spend on for redefining out if it is dangerous. When it comes to hunting asteroids, time is critical. What we can do about a potentially hazardous object depends a great deal on what we know about it and how much time we have before the encounter. We really like to find them when they're decades away because the more time you have, the more options you have and the less energy it takes to move an object aside. It also means we might not have to resort to launching a nuclear warhead as an asteroid until recently pretty much our only choice. That's an option of last resort in my opinion, yes. We have lots of options available. You can simply bump into the object and just nudge it out of the way. That's one possibility and that's kind of in a way sort of the simplest thing to think about just nudge it off its path a little bit with a massive object, a spacecraft one. It's kind of like bowling if you have a long time or a long stretch of runway in the lane. Just a very small twist on the bowling ball will make a big change in where it ultimately ends up.当然.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4908,2022-10-20 14:37:06
16563," A long time or a long stretch of runway in the lane, just a very small twist on the bowling ball will make a big change in where it ultimately ends up. Another option would be something where you take a very big, big, massive spacecraft and you park it next to the object and you use the force of gravity as a towing rig. That takes longer, though. And you need to be able to send a pretty massive spacecraft and obviously depends a lot on how big the asteroid is. Other options start to get more and more complicated and they range from painting one side of the object of white color and painting the other side dark and letting the pressure of lights or perturbates orbit. In a departure from the lab and computer simulations, NASA has real plans to rehearse kinetic impact deflection. In 2021, the agency will launch Dart, the double asteroid redirection test mission, which will intercept a 160 meter asteroid in 2022. Better to practice now before we have to deal with an actual threat. In the meantime, discovering asteroids is our best bet. Thousands of scientists and amateur astronomers around the world make up an informal network that surveyed the heavens. But that may not be enough. NASA wants more resources to map our solar system and better technology. We need to ramp up our network of sensors and also we need to just continue to strengthen our network of international observers so that we can get follow-up because we find these objects when they're distributed all over the late sky. Once we get more observations, we get better data, we can make better predictions. If you look at the big impactors we have had in the last, let's say, 20 years or maybe 30 years, 50 years, most of them we haven't seen coming. So the danger, the real danger, I think comes from your objects we don't know about and not from your objects we do know about. This particular natural disaster, like a lot of natural disasters and like climate change is a problem with the global commons. So the thing that we risk collectively is that it sort of then becomes nobody's problem and nobody takes our ownership over it. Asteroids are all over the sky. They just truly cross boundaries and borders with a second's notice. I kind of imagine in the future, maybe he walks a small satellites around the Earth that are always going and looking outward. I mean, I think it's something worth investing in. Sorry, existence has stayed, right?

16564," platform Reddit have shaken up the stock market in a big way. The stock that everybody's talking about right now is GameStop. Video game retailing, GameStop is set to continue the headspinning ascent today. The revolutionaries on Reddit are spanking Wall Street's ass. The more these stocks go up, the more the big guys are getting creamed and losing billions of dollars. This is in a wealthy person's game anymore, anyone can play it. I took up a little bit of a new hobby and I am interested in day trading is an investor nowadays. You don't have to look a specific way. You don't have to wear specific clothes. You don't have to be doing it from a trading floor on Wall Street in like a high-rise building in downtown Manhattan. The narrative of what's driving the markets is no longer being held in secret offices in New York and Boston of privileged people talking to other privileged people. It's right out in the open. It's on Twitter. It's on Reddit. From brokerage apps to discord channels and subreddits to TikTok Fin influencers. One of the last holdouts in the world of disruption, finance is next in line. The investing should be as you pick with us as shopping online. That's Vlad Tenif, the CEO of Robinhood, the online brokerage app, talking about how he wants his app to disrupt the world of stock trading like Amazon disrupted the world of home shopping. And I think that speaks to exactly the mission that a platform like Robinhood has, which is to democratize investing. Robinhood was started in 2013 by Vlad Tenif and by Jubat in where else Silicon Valley as an alternative to the big brokerages, but with one big difference. As they were building the social network around finances for people, they realized that there was a gap in the market and that free trading could become something that they could bring to the markets. They could disrupt the industry. While no fee trading is industry standard today, it was unheard of when it was first introduced. The online brokerage industry was really innovative when they came on the scene 10, 15 years ago, but they kind of stopped innovating where you haven't seen those commissions come down beyond five or six or seven dollars. Robinhood, think that by offering zero commission that they're going to push people onto this platform. And on top of no fee trading, the customers Robinhood was courting have been long overlooked in the world of finance. So the typical customer of a Charles Schwab, for example, is putting a lot more money in that brokerage account than the typical customer at Robinhood. Even today, with all of its popularity, the median account size is about $240. There's fiddellities in the Schwab, in the e-trades of the world. They look down their nose at those kind of accounts. I don't want a $1,000 account. They're just a headache. I want a $100,000 account. And this is key here, right? Because the thing about Robinhood that's different than every other single brokerage platform is how easy it is to use. The design of the Robinhood app really has in mind a user who might be coming at this absolutely cold. The fonts are very well-sized. The shapes, the colors, all of that is something that the founders of Robinhood paid really close attention to. And by creating an interface that catered to a newer investor, they were able to gather a pretty healthy group of customers. And by 2019, they had about 10 million customers. Those 10 million customers were a huge success story for Robinhood. But no one could have predicted its explosion after the arrival of COVID-19. Remain indoors to the greatest extent. And 100% of the non-essential workforce must stay home. What we saw when the pandemic hit was the growth of Robinhood users absolutely turbocharged. And oddly, you saw this surge in interest in stock trading. Then they saw the absolute surge in 2020 in customer growth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4910,2022-10-20 14:45:38
16565," And oddly, you saw this surge in interest in stock trading. Then they saw the absolute surge in 2020 in customer growth. And now by many accounts, they have more than 20 million customers, which is pretty extraordinary. So the next step for them is to figure out how to monetize those users and how even with their small account sizes to get them to grow with the company and as it releases more products, come along with them. Robinhood would become one of the COVID economies' breakout successes. Robinhood traders, as they're called, became the shorthand explanation for the frenzy of often speculative retail investing after the pandemic lockdowns. Kids wake up in the morning, they go on Robinhood. They're, you know, in the shower, they check Robinhood. Kids are learning how to monetize their own products. Kids are learning how the stock market works at 18, while they're at school, you know, checking their phones in between classes because notifications pop up telling them what their stocks are doing that day. With these new tools, millennials and Gen Z are investing in the market and ways their parents could have never even dreamt of. That is sort of key when we talk about the divide between older and younger generations is that the younger generation was exposed to so much more information and tools at their disposal to do what they want in the market. The older generations, you never had the technology or the cost structure that you could play the markets like you can today. So you were stuck with giving your money to a professional investor paying them a fee to do it. When I speak to young kids, they tell me, I'm making mistakes. I'm losing money. I'm not a perfect investor. But I'm 18 and by the time I'm 30, which will be, you know, 10 years from now, I'm going to have interacted with the markets for a decade. And so it's a learning experience more so than anything else. And you can look at it and you can say, wow, that's, you know, that's risk taking that's dumb. But, you know, if you could possibly shave 10, 20 years off your working life versus adding five years, I don't think you can fault people for that. But Robinhood is only part of the puzzle. Sure, you can trade on it. But without research, information and data, you're just blindly throwing darts at different stocks and hoping to strike it rich. Wall Street forever has always run on what we now call narrative needs. You know, people telling rumors to each other, it's been around for a hundred years. On Wall Street, information is its own currency. Historically, either you had it or you didn't. And the people who had it had a huge advantage. In the past, those narratives and memes didn't have a network effect. It would be one person telling another person over the phone. In fact, when I broke into this business in the 80s, a lot of people used to complain that they weren't on the call list to get those ideas. Social media changed all of that. It's as far as 2021, that's being done on the internet now. And that's being done on Discord and Twitter and Stocktwits and Reddit. And the impact is very similar, but orders and orders is meant to too larger. As social media has played a bigger part in our lives, it's also played a bigger and kind of more important role in how people find investing ideas online and on these platforms. How do those ideas spread on TikTok? Yes, that TikTok. Two people have come to bring a sugar and tea and rum. People aren't just going to see shanty videos. The personal finance hashtag on TikTok has garnered 3.5 billion views from its 1 billion monthly active users.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4911,2022-10-20 14:50:00
16566," The personal finance hashtag on TikTok has garnered 3.5 billion views from its 1 billion monthly active users. By comparison, videos found under the cooking and health tips hashtag have 2.6 and 2.1 billion views respectively. The trajectory of Robinhood and TikTok were literally on part. What happened in the second market this week? So the word of the week is expectations. Absolutely essential that you just understand the risks of short. And Kayla Kilbrady and Kyla Scanlon are two of those financial influencer TikTokers, also known as Finn Fluensers. I think people still care about fashion, they care about culture, but it's also like there's this big behemoth thing called the stock market that we really don't know a whole lot about and it's gay kept behind the industry. And so people like want to unpack that. And so my audience is a lot of them are younger investors who are looking to hone their skills. Tech in right up. Kyla and Kayla are two of the more let's say professional TikTok influencers. The Tesla Arc Bitcoin Biotech Risk Cluster. I've been trading since high school and it was a really interesting way for me to fill out my decision making frameworks and to think about thinking. And I think that the more that we can have people thinking about finance, the better that we're going to progress as a society, I think it's a huge gap in our educational system. If you're going to buy an option for stock, you can just go up, it's a call. So think of it like this. And you get the options video where I was like options are just like shopping. Rumor has it that this pal is a backscope in price. So if I come in tomorrow, can I still buy a debt set price? And a ton of women just like attacked that video and we're like, you explain things so much better than my boyfriend or my professor or like I could sit and listen to you all day. And I was like, this is what I was looking for. But TikTok's algorithm does not reward common measured videos about responsible investing. It rewards this watch this video for 30 seconds and you'll be rich for the rest of your life. I try not to say the a word, the ALGO word because TikTok listens to us. The algorithm does impact how you feel. You know, you do notice which videos do better versus which videos do worse. How do you touch some of the tension in less than 60 seconds? And how do you make it something that they're like, I need this in my life? Nearly impossible to do that in 60 seconds. But the people who perfect it are the people that you're going to watch and get to stick around. And where people are sticking around, Reddit. And it's nearly countless subreddits about finance. And by far the biggest one of those is Wall Street vets. There's a lot of social media platforms out there. But Reddit is like the social media platform for finance. Places like Wall Street vets is where it all goes down. Started in January 2012, it wasn't long before Wall Street vets adopted a 4chan-like etiquette. Leading to their tagline, like 4chan found a Bloomberg terminal. We had all these unexplained stockings and we would be grasping for wide stock XYZ jump 20% in a day. And you would look at Wall Street vets and you would see people there talking about buying options in that stock and it sort of squared the circle so to speak and started making sense. And it was at that point that it was like, wow, we have to start paying attention to this. Some people on the platform really spend tons of time and others are just looking for entertainment and to have a little bit of fun effectively gambling or looking for an outlet trying to make a little bit of money. Then on top of all of that, there were stimulus checks now clearly this money is going to people who need to use that to eat to live, but there's a lot of people who use this money to invest in the stock market. And it's not just stock tips. People quote unquote, yolo their entire life savings or stimulus checks on a single stock. They post what is called gain and loss porn. Screen grabbing staggering hits and misses on stocks for the entire community to see. I am back to lose everything. And while some of the people on Wall Street vets are novice investors, the community contains multitudes. In one respect, what it did show us among these network groups is they are very sophisticated. They're not a bunch of ignorant people talking to other ignorant people. And this is where the pieces of the puzzle upload existing pressure Europa Best Network brand.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4912,2022-10-20 14:54:28
16567," in these network groups is they are very sophisticated. They're not a bunch of ignorant people talking to other ignorant people. And this is where the pieces of the puzzle all come together to wreak havoc on Wall Street for a solid week in early 2021. It's pretty clear that the combination of more people having retail brokerage accounts and trading apps and more people being stuck at home looking for some kind of entertainment and some kind of community online came together in this very singular way. What came together is GameStop. Let's go back to the beginnings of what happened with GameStop a couple of years ago on the boards like Reddit and Stocktwist. A lot of people were talking about GameStop as being attractive value. Some of them are even Wall Street alums who left the industry and now still have access to tools that they can use to improve their financial well-being and make very good decisions. And I think roaring kitty is a perfect example of that. GameStop is one of the most compelling asymmetric opportunities in the market today. Really, I don't understand how you can disagree with that. At the same time that this crowd was talking it up, the hedge fund institutional crowd didn't like the stock at all. And it had the largest short interest of any stock in the New York Stock Exchange going into late 2020. Short selling is a bet that a stock price will fall and it's a fairly simple concept. An investor borrows a stock and then sells it. The investor is betting on buying the stock back later for a lower price before returning it to the original owner pocketing the price difference. What a short seller would tell you is that they almost act as a policeman in financial markets or they're at least looking for companies that aren't what they say they are. And that can range anywhere from an outright fraud that some short sellers try to expose to just a company that's not worth as much as investors think it is. The problem is if the stock price rises, the short seller has to come up with the money to buy the stock back. And the more it rises, the more it costs. And that's what's called a short squeeze. And the hedge fund Melvin Capital is on the wrong end of that squeeze. Melvin Capital lost over 50% of its money in the month of January alone just from being caught in the short squeeze of the stock. This is where the disruption comes in. One of the most wild stories you're ever going to see GameStop shares absolutely going nuts. In less than a year, the company's stock has jumped from less than $3 a share to almost $350. Cheers everybody! Roaring Kitty has turned $50,000 or so investment into some $14 million. Investors all over social media use the free trading app Robinhood to wreak havoc on Wall Street. They're actually piling on into some of these stocks to really hurt the professional short sellers. And they all used Reddit, Twitter, TikTok and Discord to tell one another to keep buying and quote, hold the line and not sell GameStop. People are getting cheerleaded for jumping in, buying at the highs, they're saying keep going. And it was working too until... Thursday morning, the trading app Robinhood sent out this tweet. In light of current market volatility, we are restricting transactions, including GameStop. People were really angry. Robinhood was supposed to allow the regular people to play the same game, these big boys are playing. But instead, we were all taken for schmucks and they screwed us. Shares of GameStop are jumping again now that retail investors are being allowed to buy shares of the stock. But what we learned is that when people organize online, they have the ability to disrupt the market. And it was a big sign that ivory rolls of institution are just powerful. It's maybe the institutions let them to be. I don't know if pumping out GameStop was the best use of billions of dollars, but I think that as a signal to society, it was pretty interesting and powerful. The GameStop saga was so impactful that both Vlad Tenev and Roryn Kitty were called into testify before Congress to clarify each of their roles in the saga. One thing that's emerged from the Congressional.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4913,2022-10-20 14:58:39
16568," Vlad Tenev and Rorynkitty were called in to testify before Congress to clarify each of their roles in Missaga. One thing that's emerged from the congressional hearings is that they're interested in how retail brokerages make money and whether they're keeping the best interests of their customers in mind. But it's pretty fuzzy as far as what they would actually do as a result. While the frenzy around GameStop eventually subsided, it didn't take long for retail investors to find other areas to invest their money. Take a look at Bitcoin going bananas over the weekend. Bitcoin forms a brand new all-time high. It was after GameStop started to drop that we saw Bitcoin really go up to over 60,000. How much further does this rally have to run? It's compelling to say that money shifted from one venue to the other. While correlation doesn't equal causation, there's a chart out there showing an inverse correlation on mean stocks going down and cryptocurrencies going up. There's definitely an aspect where people are making money on stocks and then moving, you know, they're agnostic, they're not hedge funds, they can invest wherever the hell they want. It's a classic sort of momentum trade they're going to wherever the winners are and they're willing to jump on and, you know, ride it. So whether it's mean stocks like GameStop, mean coins like Dogecoin are entirely new ways to invest in art like NFTs, the new kind of retail investor is making its presence known. For the next 10, maybe 15 years, you're going to continue to see whether by choice or by force, that baton go from older generations to younger generations. I don't think any single app is going to be the thing that disrupts. I think people are the disruptors. How people get ideas about what to invest in has become increasingly entwined with social media and as social media companies govern more and more of our lives, the fact that now they're tied in more intimately to people's wallets is something that we might want to understand better. Usually what disruption I think means is technology comes in whether it's blogs to the newspapers or online, retailing to brick and mortar. They come in and they're in the same business, but they just do it in such a gigantic cost savings that it causes everybody to switch. Well, that's the risk that happens here is that it's so much cheaper to just manage your own money. We're not there yet, but costs and conveniences are moving in that direction. So I'd say Wall Street, you haven't been disrupted yet, but you could be in the coming years and that the final chapter on this story hasn't been ripped. Meet Bloomberg's own David Nicholson. Now his happy place is out in the field, on the open road. But like the rest of the world lately, he's been working from home a lot more than he's used to. COVID-19 has prompted a massive urban exodus as professionals of every ilk yearn for more space to live and work. As a result, rural areas have exploded and they're poised to experience a resurgence as more and more families pack up and leave the big city to try out life in the berms. But there's one problem with that. Not all internet speeds are created equal. Someone who might need to upload or download large files for a living may not want to pack up and move to that cabin in the woods just yet. God, what?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4914,2022-10-20 15:03:01
16569," Anyone who might need to upload or download large files for a living may not want to pack up and move to that cabin in the woods just yet. Now David's house isn't a cabin, but it is in the woods, and inexplicably, his internet is workable. My internet is okay, I pay a lot for it, it's around $140 a month. The download speed is great, and the upload speed is terrible, which is really bad for my work because I have to upload these massive files. But I'm definitely one of the more lucky ones in this community. Just a few miles down the road, my buddy has awful internet. It's usually under two down and under point two up, so it's often unusable. Some days it's around one, and other times it'll drop down to about point two, point three. I just want to be able to have internet at my house without having to go outside the normal ways of acquiring internet. It's really frustrating. We're literally miles, a few miles away from downtown, and it just cuts off. This is a problem, and the solutions are not there yet, because getting high speed internet and rural areas on mass is something our providers may simply not be ready for. If your internet service doesn't have fast download and upload speeds, then you don't have high speed harmony. You have. Americans on average pay about $70 a month for internet at home, but in rural areas it could cost a lot more for a lot less service. So the pricing for a fixed wireless provider here can be something between $80 and $150 for about $25 megabits per second. However, Gigabit service, which is a thousand megabits per second and symmetrical, is running at about $119 a month or $130 a month. That's John Paul. He co-owns Spiral Fiber, an internet service provider here in Nevada County, California. And for the past 10 years, he's been trying to bring an affordable fiber optic network to town. It all started when he applied to be part of the pilot program for Google's fiber service. Across the country, civic boosters have been going to extreme, chanting, singing, and marching, trying to get the search engine giant to look at their town. The internet these days is crucial to be in the world, to be a part of the world, and to be connected to your community. Google ultimately went with Kansas City, Missouri, which left Paul on a mission to get funding to lay out fiber optic networks for Gigabit service. Over the next several years, he would attend conferences and pitch venture capitalists and apply for grants to make his vision come to life. One of the biggest roadblocks to building infrastructure for the internet here in the United States are the existing large providers. They have their landstaked out. They would prefer that nobody come in and compete against them. In 2013, we applied for a grant. We went down and met with the commissioners at the California Public Utilities Commission. It was an arduous process to get funded. But we finally did against all odds. We got a $16 million grant and then we went out to seek venture capital. Then in March of 2020, the pandemic hit the world. Everybody got locked down and everybody came home and everybody started using the internet. And I remember seeing on one of the local fixed wireless providers websites, they've said, hey, we know you're all staying home, but please don't use too much video and please don't use too much bandwidth. And I thought that doesn't work. The US connectivity gap is far greater compared to countries that are considered its peers economically. Some developing nations actually have better internet than rural America, like in Kenya, which has a state-of-the-art fiber optic network fed in from their coastline. The American connectivity gap does largely affect rural areas that are either outside of service coverage or simply prohibitively expensive. This is Rebecca. She and her family moved to Nevada County just a couple miles down the road from David. They took for granted that high-speed internet would just exist in the area and it's not something they even bothered to check on before buying their house. Turns out all they got was dial-up.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4915,2022-10-20 15:07:20
16570," And did that high speed internet would just exist in the area, and it's not something they even bothered to check on before buying their house. Turns out all they got was dial up. We wanted to move where we had a little more space, room for the kids to run around, just be out in the mountains a little bit more. Having come from a bigger city area where Wi-Fi is pretty readily available, we hadn't really considered that in our purchasing of the house, whether that would be an option or not. When school started, and now that we are remote learning with our children, and we're doing everything from home, we didn't have the option to do that at our house. So every day when school would start, we'd have to pack the kids up and we'd go to my in-law's home. They have a little cabin up in this area that does have Wi-Fi already. Rebecca's situation is the norm in rural America. According to data from the Federal Communications Commission, just 4% of urban Americans lack access to broadband internet. That's compared to almost 40% of people who live in rural areas. While that was the case, there were also racial and socioeconomic divides in terms of who had that access. In addition to that geographic difference, low-income African American students, Latino students, and first generation of college students, were more likely than others to have only one device at home that shared among multiple siblings and or lack access to that actual connection. For most American towns, there's also a lack of competition, forcing internet prices up. And large providers like AT&T and Comcast aren't incentivized to expand service to these rural communities. This is how Xfinity makes life simple, easy, awesome. So in our area, we have a small imprint of Comcast, but they're not going to go out to the more rural areas. It's just not cost-effective for them to do it as a large company. In order to lay fiber cable, you're actually physically digging trenches into the ground. And for internet service providers, they're primarily focused on maximizing their profits. And so the fewer customers you have in any square mile and the more fiber you have to lay, that's just kind of harder to pencil out from a purely economic standpoint. AT&T released a statement on the matter, expressing the need and desire for government assistance to fund fiber optic expansion to areas deemed unprofitable. Comcast released a similar statement, encouraging more public-private collaboration on this effort. Federal agencies do offer grants to help communities build broadband networks, but many have argued that there's not enough flexibility on how to use these funds. The COVID-19 relief package passed by Congress in March and signed by President Donald Trump awarded $43.3 million to 51 projects on the East Coast alone. But it also stipulated that these projects needed to be up and running by December 30th. For contractors who plan projects months and years in advance, it's a scramble to rearrange their schedules to meet that deadline. So what we've been asking the federal government to consider is at least as long as the projects are getting started, knowing the projects are being put into place to expand both remote learning, working from home, and opportunities like that that are truly driven from COVID. We're moving as fast as we can regardless, but hopefully they'll give us some more time. Talking to John Paul, it's clear that he believes broadband is something that can transform a community and should be considered a public good. One of the first communities to come on in the United States with full on gigabit service was Chattanooga, Tennessee. Now, they're a bigger city, but they're a city that was economically in a downturn. In the last 15 years, the city of Chattanooga has turned around in an amazing way. It's a nexus for young people to move to. It's a place where technology happens. It's not just about logging on to Zoom, you know, to connect with your colleagues who might be in New York City. It's also your ability as a small business, you know, operating in the town of Nevada City, or wherever it may be, to, you know, quickly upload your payroll documents or something onto the cloud, or to quickly, you know, swipe a customer's credit card. There's just some really basic business functions and mechanics that I think people in big cities really take for granted, and that are just going to be a much bigger challenge for small business owners and rural areas.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4916,2022-10-20 15:11:44
16571," They take for granted and that are just going to be a much bigger challenge for all business owners and rural areas. One, two, five, six, eight, seven... Tencent! Tencent! Tencent! Tencent! Tencent! Historically the marginalized people you call them as untouchables or dhaliths, they have been kept away from the center of the knowledge. Once you are born into a caste, it is very difficult for you to grow beyond that. You are stuck in that identity. I think education is the best way of liberating them. So that's how I chose to work in education sector. The kind of education that we are giving to the marginalized people is going to change, not just the fate of these communities in Telangana, but it is going to be the source of inspiration, or the source of hope for all the marginalized in this country. Greatest flight in India is the system of caste. For generations of Indians, the social code known as the caste system has defined how people earn a living and whom they marry. Although outlawed seven decades ago, caste remain a significant factor in deciding everything, from family ties and cultural traditions to educational and economic opportunities. Dalits, people who are on the lowest rank of the caste system, constitute almost one-fifth of India's population of 1.3 billion. Not able to afford the high tuition of private schools, many are forced to attend government-funded institutions, which in the past have suffered from poor infrastructure, lower education standards, and high student-to-teacher ratios. But Dr. Praveen Kumar is trying to change that. I am currently working as head of the Telangana Social Welfare Residential Schools. So totally, above 400 schools I manage, these are all residential schools for the students who are historically marginalized but talented and then poor. Of them, 60% are girls and then 40% are boys, because girls are more marginalized among the marginalized. Their voices are always suppressed. My approach to improve the conditions in the schools has been put your eyes and ears on the ground always. Stock to the parents, stock to the teachers, stock to the students, stay in the schools, and then understand their problems, their challenges, both in classrooms and then the corridors and the dorms. Then go to the dining halls and see what kind of food they are eating, and then go to their homes and then what kind of food they are getting, and what kind of challenges the parents have. One of the important changes that I brought in after I took over was to complete the transformation of mother tongue to English medium, because English medium, as I said, English is the language of emancipation, and language that connects you to the whole body.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4917,2022-10-20 15:16:06
16572," for mother tongue to English medium because English medium as I said English is the language of emancipation and language that connects you to the whole body of knowledge in the world. So we had to train a lot of teachers. It's like a big thing also. Hey Richie, how are you? I see you fine, thank you. I'm having a good view. Identity is extremely important. There is a scientific evidence to prove that your sense of identity is extremely crucial to your growth as a successful human being in your life. If you accept an identity which is very humiliating, which reminds you of a very painful past, I think that identity will not help you to grow. I'm not saying that you should forget your past, I'm not saying that, but that should not be in the bubble in which you must live always. Sweros is an alternative identity. S stands for state, W stands for welfare, Aero, SW and then Aero is Swero. So the idea is your dreams have to be skybound. So that is what we are trying to achieve by changing the identities. You know, you say I'm a Swero and I aim to be a doctor. I am a Swero, I aim to be a top-notch engineer, I am a Swero, I aim to be a top bureaucrat of this country. I'm a Swero, I want to be a very good actor or a musician in this world. So these are the positive images that are associated with the identity. Just to give an example to you. See, in 2012, in our institution we used to produce about six doctors per year. But because of our, you know, this self-eliberating ideology of Sweroism, we have this year, we have produced about 189 doctors. This is phenomenal for any tourists of the poor people. You know, how difficult it is to get into a medical college in this country. So, but today, because of this ideology, the students have been able to achieve this, you know, feet. Pujita has been a form labourer, a parent, the angels are agricultural labourers. And then this girl used to sell vegetables, but thanks to the residential education institutions, she came to the Gowl-Edo D campus and then she toiled very hard for one year, despite many problems. And today, I'm so happy to share with you that, you know, she has joined one of the prestigious medical colleges in the state of Telangana, Usmani Medical College. And then in future, she hopes to be a gynecologist. So this is the journey our children are hoping for. Similarly, the Mount Everest Expression. Mount Everest Expression, we are very fortunate enough to place the youngest ever female in the history of this world on the peak of Mount Everest. How did this happen? It's all because of an ideology that helps you to liberate yourself. There are a lot of extra-curricular activities and most of them got institutionalized now. So for example, music. Similarly, the games, we have so many coaching academy, boxing academy, we have a Brazilian academy, we have a handball academy. So we have a, you know, a Kabadi that traditional Indian sport. We have gold. We have introduced the gold falls, like gold fees generally played by so-called rich people. But today, even poorest of the poor people also are being trained in gold in our schools. So our intention has been to give all 360 degrees, you know, type of opportunities to the students so that, you know, whoever is interested in whatever activity they can go and then do it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4918,2022-10-20 15:20:20
16573," You know, type of opportunities to the students, so that we are interested in whatever activity they can go and then do it. Break the barriers, break the fence at least mentally, because poor people have been programmed to be victims, programmed to be subjugated, programmed to be on the margins, always programmed to feel inferior. We wanted to change all that. There are certain games which are exclusive to rich people. There are certain languages which are exclusive to middle class and upper middle class in this country, to put it in one world. The sole aim of introducing all these co-curricular activities is to break the stereotypes which are recklessly imposed on these people. Their stereotypes, Dr. Kumar knows all too well. Born a Dalit, his grandparents were labourers and access to the village well was restricted. Dr. Kumar credits his parents' belief in the power of education with helping him realise his aspirations. He went on to join the Indian Police Service, attended Harvard University and then began pursuing educational reforms back home. I attribute whatever I am today to my mother primarily. They educated me in the village, although there were no good schools. So then I stayed in social welfare hostel, the hostels which are managed by government for the poorest of the poor kids. I passed with reasonably good grades. Then I went to university and then I faced a worst form of discrimination in the universities like. In those days I am talking about the bathrooms and toilets were exclusively meant for social care and so on. I used to fight discrimination on one hand and then again try to excel in academics day in and day out. That's how I came to education because I deeply believe that education is the only important weapon that can really place the poorest of the poor people from a very victimhood or a bit to prosperous or a bit. I think in future this is going to be a game changer for the marginalized in this country. I think that's going to be a game changer for the poor people. I think that's going to be a game changer for the poor people. I think that's going to be a game changer for the poor people. If you look at a thermal image of a city and then compare that to a map of vegetation, you'll find that where there's greenery the temperature is lower. That's because things like asphalt, concrete and shingled roofs absorb more heat from the sun than trees. This is the urban heat island effect and it accounts for higher temperatures in cities often by several degrees compared with their surroundings. It's becoming a huge risk to human health as growing urban populations exacerbate the heating effects of climate change. Heat waves kill more people than any other extreme weather event, more than tornadoes, hurricanes and even floods. That's why urban heat island mitigation strategies are being studied in Singapore by a group of researchers. The government back project called Cooling Singapore is now in the process of combining everything they've learnt to create a digital tool that can help cities all over the world. Starting with...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4919,2022-10-20 15:24:32
16574," The project called Cooling Singapore is now in the process of combining everything they've learned to create a digital tool that can help cities all over the world, starting with Singapore. In Singapore, close to the equator, temperatures regularly rise above 32 degrees Celsius, or 90 degrees Fahrenheit. And the city structures only make it worse. And that is also the case for Singapore, which is basically a concrete jungle, more urbanized, more developed city. And even in Singapore, what you have is a situation whereby there's a temperature difference of 7 degrees Celsius between the more urbanized and the more rural areas. The government has taken drastic steps to keep temperatures down. This is Gardens by the Bay, an award-winning park. And inside this greenhouse is a pleasant 24 degrees. That's because the dome, along with two dozen nearby towers full of thousands of people, is chilled by what's probably the world's largest underground district cooling system. It uses a large central plant that cools water and then pipes it into banks, residential towers, an exhibition centre, shopping malls, and the city's iconic Marina Bay sounds hotel and casino complex. So one of the biggest perks of using this system for the buildings is that they can save 40% in terms of electricity usage compared to your traditional air conditioners. And with Singapore relying on natural gas for most of its power, this new system means emission savings equivalent to removing 10,000 cars from the city's roads. That has big implications for the rest of the world. If things stay as they are, more than a third of the world's electricity could end up being used to cool buildings and vehicles by 2050. As the world gets hotter, gets warmer, there is a greater need for air conditioning and as well as refrigerators for instance. And the more people are buying these household appliances, the more energy usage they use and they release heat more and that then exacerbates climate change. It's a vicious circle and so since 2017, researchers at cooling Singapore have been identifying design solutions that reduce our need for so much cool air in the first place. One thing many cities have in common and that's the importance of vegetation. That's a very important measure to mitigate the urban heat because of the shading effect of course and the psychological effects of the vegetation and also because of the possible evaporative cooling effect of the vegetation. Vegetation can be of course on the ground floor in form of trees and shrubs and you can walk under them. This is the so called canopy layer that the vegetation forms above us. That vegetation can also go up the facades of buildings and it can go to the roof of the buildings. Luckily, Singapore has been striving for the garden city feel for quite some time. It was a vision initially introduced by them Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in 1967 to make life more pleasant for people and today Singapore is one of the world's greenest cities in terms of urban vegetation. In the Temple Abmarlty, a community centre that contains health facilities and social spaces now provides more green space than the plot of land it was originally built on. It's topped by a roof scape of staggered terraces covered in local plants which functions as a community park and a village green in the centre that contains farm plots for residents to tend to. Park Royal on Pickering was designed as a hotel in a garden that doubled the green growing potential of its site. There's now 15,000 metres of sky gardens, reflecting pools, waterfalls, plantar terraces and green walls and the government has big plans as well. Singapore actually has a plan to plan 1 million trees and add more green spaces over the next 10 years. killer garden here made one bigger floor over the zone. There are also other districts that want to lay-sh� trees over-h grazing windows.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4920,2022-10-20 15:28:58
16575," to test them out. It's called a digital urban climate twin or duct. The will calculate how each element of the city's design will impact the urban heat island effect. That means we model not only the geometry of the buildings digitally, but also we model the transportation, the insulation, the temperature, the radiation coming from the sun, the weather, the local weather, the local climate, the even very, very micro climate of the city. The water, the movement of people in the city, we can invent scenarios. We can design scenarios, test them before we actually build them. And if they test very well, and we are sure that they will function, then we can start to build them and put them into reality. Singapore will be using this new tool to figure out which actions it should take next. And the model can be applied to any city, whether it needs to keep heat out or keep heat in, which will ultimately save energy, slow climate change, and improve our quality of life. So this is something that Singapore will be able to export, maybe even together with its city development systems that it already has. Singapore is one of the very few cities in the world that really combine this scientific approach with a very well-established urban redesign and design approach through its agencies and the combination of its agencies. It has achieved a lot in the past. If it keeps following the scientific path and the combination with the other knowledge in the city already, we think that it will be a very comfortable and very livable city in the future even more than today. Time's a tough job. Jobs are scarce. It's risky to be outside and around others. Seems like there's very few ways to make extra money during a pandemic. So I guess I'll just hunker down and binge social media until this all blows over. Baaah! Wait, don't these people make money? How do these people make money? Streamers, YouTubers, Twitch stars, how do they make money? Is it a lot? Is it a lot of work? I know. I got to ask somebody in the biz. And I got just the guy, Austin John plays. This is your full-time job now, right? As of November of last year, yes. This was always just a side thing. Any money that I made from doing my videos and whatever else, I never touched that. Because I didn't really think of that as being real money. And then it started coming in more and more. And then I hit my first day that I broke a grand. And I was like, this is actually going to be money. How did the YouTube channel come to be? When the game Pokemon Sun and Moon came out for the 3DS, there was things that I learned about the game. And then I wanted to just share that information with people. And at the time, I didn't have any way to capture screen or anything. So I found like generic footage and I kind of put it all together with so much editing. And that video got 6 views.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4921,2022-10-20 15:35:26
16576," way to capture screen or anything so I found like generic footage and I kind of put it all together with so much editing and That video got six views and then two days later I made another one and that one got 12 views and then I Just started pumping out more and more content and people were like this guy knows what he's talking about It really just started building on top of itself and then it was like my channel really focuses on tips and tricks so I Play a straight 18 hours and I'll finish the game or get to about the 40 hour mark And then I'll make my first video while I'm going through I've a giant no pad and just Scribbles everywhere and I make these notes of like the things that stumped me So I know the things that may stump other people What do you need to think about if you're building your YouTube channel one? You need to do something that you're passionate about Not that you like now that you think you're gonna make money on something you're passionate about This other thing is something that other people are passionate about it holds a special place to them And third is it needs to be something that people are gonna seek out information on In order to enter into the marketplace you either need to be better than everyone else You either need to be faster than everyone else or you need to be more accessible than everyone else And you can't be more accessible because it's already on the platform granted if you understand how the algorithm works Which is very similar to Google Analytics then yeah, you can have a little bit of a head start But if you're not doing it faster and if you're not doing it better than everyone else then why should in one watch your channel? So my income as a youtuber kind of breaks down to three different ways one Which is the bulk of it which is ad revenue whenever you go and you watch a video and then there's an ad and then you wait five Seconds and hit the bottom right corner and then you go on to the next video or a non-skippable ad or The video starts immediately you get the little banner at the bottom or If you scroll down from the video the first thing that shows there is an ad those are the four different types of ads that can appear on Every single YouTube video and all of them pay a certain amount it varies on lots of things like the country Of the person who posted the country of the person who watches it The time of year where you are in the quarter if there's anything going on with a Reduction in ad revenue like great example COVID-19 Companies weren't as spending as much on advertising so because of that CPM went down CPM stands for a click per thousand and using the Roman numeral for a thousand and that means that for every 1,000 views you get a certain amount of money now on low ads when I first started off my CPM was 30 cents so every thousand views. I made 30 cents But then once I signed with an MCN and I started making more quality content and more engaging content Some of my better videos and certain times of the year I can see CPMs as high as 12 to 14 dollars and There's a big fluctuation between you know if I post a video when there's no ads being spent like January and February That's a reason a lot of your favorite YouTubers and also TV shows don't post new videos In that time of year because ad rates are down. Why are they gonna make content then instead? You're recording and you're bulking up for when ad revenue is higher The second way that a YouTuber makes income is Support crowdfunding things like that when I first started off patreon was really the only option But then they started rolling out supporters and members for YouTube channels So whenever I have a live stream you can click a button and then you could become a member and then you get a Special icons next to your name. I believe they're called badges or on any video You can hit the join button and that helps support the channel and then the third aspect of that would be merch and For me my merch has been somewhat basic in fact I'm wearing one of my t-shirts from last year right now You have to endure the times that your first video gets six views that you posted on Reddit and they say shut up And then an auto mod bands you you have to go through that because until you go through that and And you discover why you're doing it. You're not doing it for other people. You're doing it for",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4922,2022-10-20 15:39:43
16577," You have to go through that because until you go through that and you discover why you're doing it, you're not doing it for other people, you're doing it for yourself. If you're not loving what you do, then it's not worth it. Huh, so make a channel about something that I'm passionate about. Oh, sweet. I guess I can make the channel about that. Now, how do I grow an audience? How do I get popular? It's all about diversification. You have to have a massive Twitter following. You have to have a massive Instagram following. You have to have a massive YouTube following. Of course, you have to be on Twitch, which is the key platform. But basically, anyway, you can get in front of your audience. You can engage with your audience. It is going to drive those clicks, which ultimately drives the advertiser revenue that you get back from all of these platforms. It's me and Dan playing video games and talking in a funny manner over them. They're not just people who are good at games. They're actually people who are good at online engagement, online entertainment, first and foremost. You have to write to remain stylish. Anything you wear can and will be used to do in the quarter fashion. The streamer is either very, very talented at the game. The best player in the game is generally going to draw a crowd because people like watching people who are very good. On the other hand, they're either very, very good or funny, charismatic, whatever it is on that side. Oh, no. You know, it becomes more of a show where they talk about other things outside of the gaming world and gaming becomes really just a backdrop and an excuse to engage with our audience. There were those weird Ronald McDonald, like straight to VHS movies, remember those? I'm personable. I'm chatty. I would kind of, you know, when boring things were happening in the game, I would ram ballon about, you know, movies I'd watched or books I'd read or conversations I'd had and stuff like that. So I think being personable was a big part of that. It's not just getting on and playing games, it's getting on and being an entertainer. You are putting on a show. All right. Now, let me go ahead and grab the samurai sword that every gym has. Okay, he's dead. To have a larger audience and to have that audience, I think, stay with you. You have to bring something extra, you know, you have to find your niche. You have to find what works and what connects with the audience and what makes them laugh and what makes them keep coming back. Then you got to make it a little more exciting. All right. Throwing a hanging bishop, have everybody in suspense for a moment. I think the real most important thing is to just get used to being on camera. Like in any sort of performance thing is get used to talking on camera. You know, my first few videos were terrible. But because I sat down and did it for six to eight hours a day, I just got used to talking and I got over that uncomfortable hump. If you go into Twitch purely with the expectation that you're going to make money, make a job out of it, have all this growth and it's going to be great. You're probably going to burn out prior to getting to that point because there's very little payoff for a long time, right? Like multiple years generally before you really start to see a payoff. And so, you know, those first few times you're streaming, nobody is there. One person shows up every 30 minutes says hi, maybe, and leaves, right? Like, it's very discouraging, I think, for a lot of people. And so you have to be there just loving it. You have to love talking to yourself when nobody is around. You have to love just the game that you're playing, all of that stuff because it takes a while and I think a majority of people burn out prior to getting to the like profitable point of it. And there you have it. My very own YouTube, Twitch, Discord and streaming channels all ready to go live. It's a veritable social-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4923,2022-10-20 15:44:03

This is live stream shopping, one of the hottest trends in China. Every night, tens of millions of people watch live shows hosted by influencers like the media and buy the products they recommend. The internet craze has taken over China. By the end of 2020, the country had almost 400 million live stream shopping users. China's live stream e-commerce market has also grown dramatically, with an estimated value of $161 billion in 2020. It's becoming popular outside China as well. So it's live streaming the future of shopping. Live streaming is not a new thing, and China is started in 2015 with the rollout of 4G. And it was first used for entertainment and socializing. Many live streamers perform for their followers or chat it to them, making money by receiving virtue currency and gifts. And the last live streaming is mainly the doing of avid gamers. In China, it's broken into e-commerce. China actually has a very big e-commerce empire, so it uses these super apps, what we call that you have payment, you have search of information, you have recommendation system, and you have huge amount of goods available on the platform and as well as a lot of consumers. So with this advantage, they merge these features of live streaming to make the influencers actually sell goods. Here is a perfect choice, nice neutrals, beautiful prints, nothing overwhelming, and the warmth and comfort of flannel. Traditional TV shopping involves a one way direction whereby a host introduces a product, demonstrate some things and say call this number or something, but live stream shopping is live. Live stream shopping is a very entertaining way of engaging someone else. When you shop, actually this live streaming video will continue, it will minimize into a corner and you can buy the items and pay all on the same app. After that, the live streaming screen will just enlarge by itself and the promoter will come back to screen. So it's like very convenient. How about one of China's biggest e-commerce platforms owned by tech giant Alibaba added a live streaming function in early 2016.

16581," extend down several hundred meters. It gets to the near shore from about 50 meters. The whole water column is moving backwards and forwards. As we search for ways to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, some are looking to a largely untapped potential source of renewable energy. In theory, waves off the coast of the United States alone could generate over two trillion kilowatt hours of electricity a year, enough to power more than half of the country. Waves intensify and subside not just quickly as the wind, and that means that it can produce a smoother power generation curve. One of the potential advantages of wave energy is that it could act as a complementary source of power compared to other renewables on the grid if it were to be scaled up to commercial scale. For decades, engineers have been trying to convert wave energy into electricity, but a host of technological and financial challenges have complicated their efforts. In the years from around 2006 to 2015, there were a state of bankruptcies in the sector, and this was largely because of a lack of kind of continuous proven projects out at sea with reliable electricity generation. Since then, companies have been trying to develop the technologies at a steadier pace and with a smaller cash burn. But the same questions remain. Can companies develop devices and technologies that actually work? Is wave energy just a novelty or something that can become a major renewable energy source? The sea is a very challenging environment within which to operate a power project, so sea water is corrosive and conditions are very rough, so this means that power projects don't have a very long lifetime and it increases operating and maintenance costs. Partly because of that, many early wave energy projects hit rough waters, such as the Pellarmus Wave Energy Converter in Portugal and the Isle Olympic Project in Scotland. But that hasn't stopped others from trying. Companies are focused on testing projects out at sea, proving their durability, trying to raise capital and bring down cost. The sector hasn't really converged around one single technology design and companies are kind of undersided about which design works best. Finland-based AW Energy is a veteran in the sector. The first proof of concept of the company's device was made in the 90s after diver Rano Coivissari observed the strong back and forth movement of a hatch cover in a shipwreck in the Baltic Sea. The waves are generated far from the coastline, so the wind blows on the surface of the water, causing the water particles to rotate, and that rotation extends deep down below the surface and the waves can be very long, they can be several hundred meters long. And as they come into the near shore, this rotational energy turns into an elliptical energy and eventually back to the point that you probably noticed if you've been swimming on the sea shore in large waves, you're pulled in and out. That's the energy that we're extracting. There's a sweet spot where we deploy, so around 10 to 15 meters of water depth, that's where there's still strong wave energy coming in. After years of research, prototyping and testing, the company has deployed Wave Roller, a 350 kilowatt device in the waters of Portugal. Wave Roller has an 80 meter wide and 10 meter high steel panel fixed to the seabed via a flotable foundation. The panel moves back and forth with the waves, capturing the energy. It's submerged in the depth of 15 meters, so it's protected from the extreme waves. We generate electricity by capturing the movement with hydraulic circuitry in a machine room underneath the surface that hydraulic energy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4927,2022-10-20 16:01:19
16582," Capturing the movement with hydraulic circuitry in a machine room underneath the surface, that hydraulic energy we turn to electricity with hydraulic accumulators and hydraulic motors and also our generator. The wave roller has survived large waves at sea for over a year and delivered electricity via an underwater cable to the grid in Portugal. Meanwhile, the company has won a 2.5 million euro grant to work on an upgraded version of the wave roller, aiming to increase the electricity generation capacity to 1 megawatt. The upscale device would have a bigger panel, two power takeoff units and improved software to control the energy production. We have taken into use a very prediction algorithm that tells us what kind of waves are coming into our device. That gives us a few seconds to prepare for capturing more energy and the difference in that is significant. Our future plans are to deliver technology around the world. So I'm hoping we can be working on delivering technology to projects in Asia and also in American contents as well. Meanwhile, Israeli company EcoWavePower is taking a different approach to capturing the power of the ocean. For the company's founder, in a braverment, developing new sources of renewable energy is a personal mission. I was born in Ukraine in 1986 and two weeks after I was born, the Chernobyl nuclear reactor exploded, causing the largest in history, nuclear disaster. I was one of the babies that got hurt from the negative effects of such explosion. I had a respiratory arrest and a clinical death. Luckily, my mother and nurse approached my crib on time and gave me a mouth to mouth to my frustration with saving my life. I got a second chance in life and decided to do something good with it. Growing up, Anna wanted to be a politician to positively change the world. After working as a translator at a renewable energy company, she decided to change paths. Solar and wind energy were fully commercialized. There were a lot of amazing technologies implemented everywhere. I saw that wave energy, although it's an immense source of electricity, the biggest companies in the world are trying to develop wave energy with no success. And there was kind of a race going on in the world of who is the company that is going to develop a viable wave energy solution first. In 2011, the then 24-year-old inner co-founded EcoWave Power. Instead of installing devices offshore, the company's devices are attached to existing breakwaters, jettys and peers. Our technology is very cost-efficient, especially in comparison to the offshore technologies, because we don't need any ships, divers, underwater mooring or cables. We install on existent man-made structures, and all our expensive equipment, the generator, the hydraulic conversion unit, the automation is located online just like a regular power station. This is the EcoWave Power conversion unit that has been operating in Jaffa port since 2014 until 2020. Here you can see how the technology works. Basically, the floaters are going up and down and pushing the hydro cylinders which transmits by the gradeable fluid into land-located accumulators. A pressure is being built, the higher the waves, the higher the pressure, which is used to turn the hydro motor, which is turning the generators. The whole system is controlled by a smart automation system, which you can see right here, and in case of a coming storm, the system automatically raises the floater above the water level and keeps them in the upward position until the storm passes. The company has been operating a 100-kilowatt grade-connected device in Gibraltar since 2016, which is enough to power 100 households. Currently, Inu and her team are working on another 100-kilowatt project at the Ported Jaffa.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4928,2022-10-20 16:05:37
16583," in the Baltas since 2016, which is enough to power 100 households. Currently, Innu and her team are working on another 100 kilowatt project at the Ported Jaffa in Tel Aviv. The project will be also the first time in the history of Israel that wave energy will officially connect to the electrical grid. And our goal going forward is to expand it to all suitable breakwaters in the city of Tel Aviv and to supply a significant part of the city's electricity needs. Today, engineers and entrepreneurs are still trying to crack wave energy. Globally, only a few hundred kilowatts of wave energy are deployed compared with gigawatts of offshore wind. But the filters come a long way in recent years, and with the right engineering solutions, this new power source could eventually become competitive with more mature renewables like solar and wind. I would have a lot more confidence in the success wave energy companies today as opposed to like 20 years ago. But in the next few years or maybe the next couple of decades, it will be more likely to be used in remote locations like islands that are otherwise dependent on expensive diesel power or out-it-see on gas decommissioning rigs or for powering underwater autonomous vehicles. So definitely, wave energy can compete with other renewable energy sources, but I personally believe that this is not a competition. In order to have a 100% renewable energy-friendly world, we need all renewable energy sources to work together. So can you please tell me? I'm not going to... please wait. You know, I've covered a lot of companies, I've covered a lot of Machiavellian companies where people play rough. I don't think I've ever seen anything on the scale of Nissan.

In the past few minutes, Nissan has revealed that its chairman has been arrested after allegations of serious misconduct. He was tasked with investigating Carlos Gough. And he was told conduct an internal investigation and get to the heart of the manor. And then along the way he started to notice serious conflicts of interest. He is one of the few people who knows an extreme amount of detail regarding the alleged crimes by Carlos Gough. And he's now ready to tell his own story on the record about some of the events that happened. My name is Rivinda Passey. I'm the former Global General Counsel of Nissan Motorco Limited. And you could say yes I had a front rose seat in terms of what was going on. When Carlos Gough saved Nissan years ago, he was depicted in Japanese comic books as this hero. And now maybe we'll see comic books where he's the villain. In corporate Japan, Nissan was quite an unusual company. It was led for two decades by a non-Japanese executive. Well, Carlos Gough was a hero in the Japanese business world. If you had a global business celebrity in Japan and worldwide, it was definitely Carlos Gough. In a country with few foreigners at the top, he stood out. But over the years, he saved Nissan from bankruptcy, allied with Reno and Mitsubishi, and turned the alliance into one of the most competitive in the world. Yet as the years went on, you know, I think his ambitions changed a little bit. He started thinking about legacy plays. And one of them was to really tighten the alliance between Reno and Japan. And unbeknownst to him, there was a contingent of senior Nissan executives that were really felt threatened by that move. They really thought that they would lose complete control of the car company. And even in the government, there was probably a little bit of anxiety about a national champion in the auto industry, falling under full-blown foreign control. Carlos Gough was an auto industry leader, respected by many in Japan. Now he's in jail. The rest of Carlos Gough came completely out of the blue. This was in November of 2018. He was coming to Japan on Nissan's corporate jet for a regular executive meeting. And he was met on the tarmac by Japanese authorities who whistled him away to jail and charged him with financial misconduct crimes. So what happened was a power struggle ensued inside the company and somewhere along the way it was criminalized. By that I mean that there were allegations leveled at Carlos Gough about the way he reported his pay to Japanese authorities, the way he handled money inside the company that in other contexts might have been a board action, might have been handled internally. A number of executives at Nissan decided to take this this difference and take it over to the Tokyo Prosecutors office. And that unleashed a chain of events that would shake the entire auto industry. So after Carlos Gough was arrested, Nissan launched an internal investigation into the events that led up to his arrest. So Rob Pasey was tasked with investigating Carlos Gough and he was told get to the heart of the matter. Find out what Carlos Gough did wrong and bring it to our shareholders.

So in our story, we really took a close look at Harinada and his role in Carlos Gones downfall. Harinada is one of the most fascinating figures inside Nissan. He's also a lawyer. He's originally Malaysian. How do Mr. Huddy? And he had a meteoric rise through the company and became very, very close to Carlos Gones and other top figures. He had a front row seat at all the major strategic deliberations at the company. And when he discovered that Carlos Gones as his final legacy play was going to tighten the relationship between Renault and Nissan, he made a decision to go against Carlos Gones and he became one of the key figures that decided that Carlos Gones had to go. Harinada was somebody who actually recruited me into the company. So I have a long-standing relationship with him or did have a long-standing relationship with him. For many, many years, he was a mentor. I had doubts about the credibility of the process right at the start. Harinada had a plea deal with the Tokyo prosecutors. Now that suggests he was intrinsically involved in some of the wrongdoing or the allegations of wrongdoing. And it just didn't smell right. It just doesn't sit right. So there was a basic conflict of interest. In other words, Harinada had to deliver results to Japanese prosecutors to avoid his own criminal liability and he's accusing and leading the investigation of Carlos Gones. Some of the people who had been involved in the original alleged crimes were also looking into the affairs themselves. Revinder Pasi began pointing out some of these conflict of interest issues. And the reason for that is essentially his concern was for the company. If the company's own investigation into itself was compromised, that could lead to a very weak position in various lawsuits that it was dealing with across the world. I had discussions with Harry discussions about with the statutory auditors about these conflicts, discussions with HR about some of these conflicts because at that point, we reported into him. At the time, everything was quite, as you can imagine, it was, we've got to do this, we've got to do that, we've got to move fast. But when you step back and look at some of these things, you just think, my God, what was going on here because your chairman's been arrested, a representative director's been arrested. They both happened to be foreigners and then now what we need to do, we're being instructed to do is certain compliance professionals need to go into properties in Brazil, for example, and retrieve evidence. They've got to do it very carefully because if they don't do it carefully, they're going to get convicted of criminal activities. And likewise, when a team of lawyers were commissioned to go to Lebanon, I mean one of my immediate concerns was why are lawyers from Nissan being sent to go to Lebanon to retrieve evidence? These are just lawyers, they're corporate lawyers from Nissan. You had revelations that a number of executives had benefited from",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4931,2022-10-20 16:18:43
16586," These are just lawyers, they call for lawyers from Nissan. You had revelations that a number of executives had benefited from share appreciation rights and they shouldn't have. I mean, you know, substantive amounts of money been taken by these guys when they weren't entitled to take them. And you do think, yes, how is this going to look later on? It's going to look quite concerning. So that triggered, for me, the sort of assessment that, well, I'm going to have to do something because up until this point, I haven't put down on paper these conflicts and these issues. So Rob Posse makes a fateful move. He writes his letter to the board, listing every suspicion he has and great detail backed up by evidence backed up by memos of why this internal investigation had serious problems. He sends a letter to the board and it's crickets. He doesn't hear much of anything. Nothing happened then, often. Nothing at all. Just like it just gone into a black box. And he began to suspect that there was a desire, even at the highest level within Nissan, to kind of sweep these conflicts of interest under the rug. Unfortunately for me, I think, again, with hindsight, people must have thought that this is the nail that's sticking out and we can't have this. Within three days of me submitting that to the board of directors, that letter to the independent board of directors, I was removed from the go-and-executive conduct matters. I was then told that I could not attend board meetings anymore. And up until that point, I had attended every single board meeting. I was then also told that after eight years of being in Japan, I'd be going back to the UK. It eventually transpired that I'd be the VP of projects and transformation, managing a team of three. So you can imagine what this feels like at this stage. Almost an arbitrary removal from Japan where I've lived for eight years, had three children there. My family has grown up and we've been saddled there. Having a few months earlier been promoted to vice president at a global level to being almost demoted. So Pasi was essentially being reassigned to get him as far away from the internal investigation as possible and also to a certain extent in retaliation to some of the issues that he brought up regarding the internal investigation and Harinata. What happened to Rob Pasi can be seen as a series of corporate humiliations. I mean, first of all, his immediate responsibilities were taken away from him. Eventually he'd lost the coveted general counsel title. But it didn't stop there. Toward the end of his stay in Japan, Rob and his wife were convinced that they were being followed. During that period, I'd noticed that once driving my car, I'd have other cars following me. First time I noticed this was around mid-March and I was driving. I can't remember where I was going but this grey van, small van, just literally started following me. And I know just that there was somebody.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4932,2022-10-20 16:23:03
16587," And I was driving, I can't remember where I was going, but this grave van, small van, just literally started following me. And I noticed that there was somebody in the car taking pictures. And lo and behold, we were absolutely being followed by either by people on foot or other individuals. Two or three normally two burly men in a car, different cars at different times following us around. They were following the family as well. And given we'd seen, right seen the Nissan Security Department, behaving a very, very egregious manner with others in terms of following and surveilling. I was very concerned as to what they were doing and who they were giving this information to. Because if they're giving this information to the authorities, you do think, why? What's going on there? I mean, this is just not normal behavior. And this all culminated in a rather dramatic event in the middle of 2020. Who are you people? Where Nissan had hired a legal team and had obtained an unusual court order from the district court in Yokohama. To basically do a search end of his home and seizure of his corporate laptop and phone and other documents. If you don't let us in now, we have to break this key. So it's a pretty extreme way to treat someone who had spent 16 years at the company. These people have all come in. We don't really know who they are, apart from the fact that I've been shown a badge that says the Yokohama Court. And they hit to recover a laptop and a mobile phone. It was even more weird because I'd highlighted to the directors that there, that certain Nissan executives were trying to recover this laptop and this phone whilst I was still in Japan. And I was very concerned because it had evidence on there that related to misconduct matters and other forms of inappropriate conduct. It was just another form of intimidation, another form of harassment, forcing me almost to leave the company and the country. Because once they'd retained and obtained these items, we were still followed. Which again, I just couldn't understand what is the point of doing that. You know, this is not a car company, this is not the KGB. I think it's fair to say that Rob Posse didn't have full battlefield awareness of all the intrigue going on at Nissan. I mean, Harry Nata is interesting because he's both charismatic and charming and one of the most brutal corporate infighters one could ever run across. With a confidential company email, right? You should not have this. If he had fallen into line, he would probably still have his job at Nissan, be paid very well and continued his work. A career that he spent, you know, 16 years building at Nissan is irretrievably broken. It's been smashed to smithereens. He and his family paid a huge price certainly, but in terms of being able to sleep at night, I think, you know, he's come out ahead. I highlighted issues to the highest levels of the company so that they could be dealt with appropriately by those in charge. There was no response to those and there was retaliation against me. What's really profound, like absolutely profound, is that none of your colleagues, I mean people who you have known for years, forget it. You're on your own. And, yeah, you got to be ready for that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4933,2022-10-20 16:27:27
16588," I mean people who you have known for years, forget it. You're on your own. And yeah, you've got to be ready for that. You've got to be ready for that. If you take it on anyway. This is the awful truth. There's always someone in the family that's pushing it. This lady does not deserve to be taken advantage of. Expressionally at your age with your own grandchild. My grandma is having to sue them. I'm testifying against them. Nobody's talking. They're one floor below right now. I get afraid to go on the elevator. It's sad that it had to devolve to this. It's like a soap opera to me. It's a very sad thing. It's a family feud. A family feud. Here's a family that on paper you would think has the wealth that so many people seek yet. At the end of the day, it's seen to rip everybody apart. My name is Tom Schoenberg. I'm a senior reporter here at Bloomberg News. Cover financial enforcement. I was approached by someone close to the Shottenstein family and asked whether or not I would be interested in writing about Beverly Shottenstein in this case that she had against JP Morgan. And it was immediately clear that there was a great story here to be told. So I started just, you know, assembling all sorts of documents that the family made available to me. They included a diary that Beverly had begun writing when she started having suspicions about what was actually going on with her money. Beverly obtained her wealth from the Shottenstein kind of retail empire that has at times included big lots, value city, American Eagle outfitters, DSW shoes. Beverly's husband died and at which point they sold off their portion of the company, bringing them an enormous amount of wealth at around 1990. Estimates of her wealth were around $90 million. She for many years had that pool of money being managed by outside advisors. Her grandsons in the late 2000s had both graduated and were becoming financial advisors. She gave them a little bit to work with and...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4934,2022-10-20 16:31:52
16589," Ezers, her grandsons in the late 2000s had both graduated and were becoming financial advisors. She gave them a little bit to work with and over time, her grandson Evan became the trusty of her entire state. Managing sort of family money is not a conflict. In fact, some ways in wealth management, it's kind of how you get your start. It's kind of the seed that you need to sort of get going in the business. But, Beverly started having suspicions that something was wrong probably in around 2016. Well, there were suspicious things, but taken separately without everyone talking about their own experiences, it was hard to really put it together. She had written a check to her caretaker Dawn that bounced. So she went down to her local Chase branch to sort of find out what was going on. She wasn't getting paper statements in the mail, so she asked them to print out a number of her statements having to do with her checking account and her credit card account. So we went to the bank and asked for the statements. And she got a whole year and going through all of them, page by page by page. And it was there. She saw all sorts of charges that she said she did not the rise or didn't know about. I was becoming very, very suspicious. I would start to look in the money part, and that's what bothered me more when I saw that money was going. And I was not a big spender. Around the same time Dawn, she starts noticing Beverly's son, who lived in the condominium below her, came up with Evan with a shredder and started grabbing papers in her office area, including some with JP Morgan Letterhead, and just started sitting at the kitchen table just shredding documents over and over. Yeah, they came in one morning, used to do it the back through the back door, and they brought this shredder inside, and then they went in the drawers in the office and took out all the papers, and they started to do it. I was very suspicious because I know you don't go around and get in destroying papers. Beverly said that they had done this many times before. That's when she said to me, you know Dawn, I'm going to write my feelings in this black book. Diary. And she started writing each day. She would write a little at a time. We're on the holidays of 2018. The package had arrived. The FedEx package. And in it were materials about a venture capital fund based out of the Cayman Islands. Dawn and some other family members take a look at this, and they see that Beverly's signed up for this fund to the tune of a $5 million over the course of several years. And that was really the beginning of it. That was sort of the tip of the iceberg when it became obvious that something was going on that my grandmother really wasn't aware of this fund. You know Beverly started to panic. She was got really upset and called you know JP Morgan's headquarters in New York and asked for Jamie Diamond. She said she was told someone would call her back, but she says that that never happened. She wrote a letter to Evan and Avi. And in there she laid out a number of things that were concerning her on authorized trading, the checking account she had about a million dollars worth of jewelry in a safe deposit box. And that her son Bobby had the key to that box. And that that jewelry had gone missing. All this was kind of packaged in this you know five page handwritten of Memantor Will and Trust. They're such an evolving narrative about why the jewelry was taken. The only truth we really know is that the jewelry is gone. But why it happened there have been a lot of different stories. You just don't take your mother's wonderful things and hand it out. And they email that note to JP Morgan to seize all activity on her account. And it ended up setting off a firestorm after that. As soon as they got this email that there was a season to assist and that she wanted to send her money.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4935,2022-10-20 16:36:05
16590," setting off a firestorm after that. As soon as they got this email that there was a season to assist and that she wanted to send her money and change brokerage firms, they were actually vacationing one floor below downstairs, they're there right now. The next day Beverly's in her place, the granddaughter's still in her place visiting. Dawn is there and up comes Bob, he's kind of barging through the door and he's screaming about what was sent to the JP Mora and they're now investigating them and he's furious, takes his mother and sort of puts her into a chair, gets pen and paper and she says physically forced her to write a retraction letter. They were pushing me around. It was a scary time, I was really afraid too. I had to take her to the doctor and she did an x-ray because she was in so much pain. The locks had to be changed, the phone number had to be changed. I really thought we were gonna have to hire guards to be outside just for protection. Oh, it was terrible. A horrible scene. Beverly brought her case before the financial industry regulatory authorities, usually known as Finra. She had took several months' hearings. She sees all sorts of transactions that's going on. Hundreds of them that she claims that she never knew about, never authorized. But yet we're logged to JP Morgan's files as having been direct requests from her. That included the sale of a large amount of Apple stock worth several million dollars as well as all her stock and big lots. You know, over the course of their time with JP Morgan, Evan and Avi were making all sorts of trading on her account that was generating millions of dollars and commissions for themselves in the bank. Yet she was not sort of getting any of the type of gains that you would expect sort of an 80 million dollar account in a bullish market to be able to get. They issued a ruling entirely in her favor, finding that her grandsons as well as JP Morgan, they were liable for violating their fiduciary duty, misrepresenting themselves. And they also found that the bank and her grandson, Evan, reliable for elder abuse. Evan and Avi, they were fired from JP Morgan. They issued an award of about 19 million dollars. I reached out for comment and JP Morgan emphasized that Evan and Avi were no longer with the firm and that their actions do not represent the sort of values of the bank. I reached out to Evan and Avi, heard back from their lawyer saying that, you know, they disagree with, you know, the law and the facts that Finra kind of used to decide the case against them and aren't seeing if they can have it withdrawn. Her son, Bobby, wrote her a letter, said his son's weren't criminals, and he also admits to taking her jewelry. And he says he needed it to pay off some bad business debts he had. They never once came up to say, I'm sorry. If there had been an apology and some acceptance and asking for forgiveness from my grandmother, I don't think we'd be in the position that we are now. Since the piece came out, we've received dozens of messages from people, many of whom are telling their own sort of personal tales of, you know, kind of financial advisors gone bad or family members who got control of in a state and abused, you know, those within. Seems that it's really resonative with a lot of people. I keep, you know, hearing a lot of feedback about Beverly and how, you know, a lot of people feel she did the right thing. You're never too old to stand up for yourself and try to write an injustice. She was adamant that she wanted to stand up for herself. At the end of the day, they did wrong. It's a painful life lesson. You know, Beverly taught them that you don't mess with grandma.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4936,2022-10-20 16:40:30
16591," On April 20th oil markets did something they never had before and they crashed, went into negative territory and closed the day at minus 40 dollars. Meanwhile in a place called Thaden Boyce in Essex, a group of nine traders, led by a guy called Cuddles, made $660 million over the course of a couple of hours. The price of oil has collapsed to a record low. We've never really seen anything like it. WTI this morning down more than 35%. People maybe wouldn't have been so surprised if the oil price had fallen to zero. But the oil price went to minus 38. It went far lower than anyone had expected. And so lots of people in the market were saying, well hang on, something else is going on here. A couple of months later, I started to get wind through a kind of network of sources. A tiny firm in the outskirts of London had made a huge amount of money that day and potentially had some parts to play in what happened. The information we got was that nine traders at Vega Capital London had made in the region of $660 million in one day. As a group, I think they made as much money in one day as Apple makes from its international sales in one day. I mean, it's an insane sum of money. Did they pull off a fantastic trade? Did they predict the way the market was moving and get it absolutely right? Or was there something else going on and had they actually done something that breached market rules in a bid to push the market? And that investigation is ongoing. So Paul Cummins is a trader who cut his teeth in the pits in the 80s and 90s when everyone had a nickname, his was Cuddles. If you can imagine that was a very sort of cut throat type of world where people are doing hundreds of thousands and millions of dollar trades by shouting at each other, giving hand signals and then scrolling on scraps of paper. The culture of the trading pits in London was very influenced by the working class guys who became traders there. They weren't like the city bankers that had gone before them. They weren't usually Oxford or Cambridge. They didn't wear saddle rose suits. They were ordinary working guys who happened to have a talent for trading and a lot of them came from Essex. I think it was 400 traders in the pits and Cuddles in his oil and gas pit was described to us as amongst the top three in amongst that. It was very successful and made very large amounts of money as a young man. But inevitably mechanisation and the arrival of electronic markets was the kind of death nail for the pits and in 2005 the IPE closed down. And when the pits shut down, a lot of the traders who worked there lost their jobs or quit or went to work for financial institutions, but Paul Commons decided to start his own trading collective out in Essex. Some of them are ex-pick guys, cut from the same cloth as him, lots of them are actually in their twenties and they're drinking buddies' son or their own kids' friends from football. Their young lad's hungry and ambitious and he brings them into the fold. And fairly shortly he's got maybe a dozen or so traders. They're independent, let's be clear, but they're all part of this collective. Yeah, I'll let Liam do it Essex. I am from Essex so I feel like I'm free.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4937,2022-10-20 16:44:55
16592," Yeah, I'll let Liam do with Essex. I am from Essex, so I feel like I'm free to get into it. Sweet, as they say. If you were to ask someone in Britain how they would imagine a kind of Essex person, they would see someone who's maybe slightly flamboyant with a cockney accent, a guy which you start accent. You know, not afraid to splash the cash, but it's probably pretty bright and it's done well for themselves. Don't even make sense, does it? But you know, these guys, they drove around very nice rolls, roises and bentonies. They went to places like Marbaire on holiday. Fade and voice is a very wealthy place. You have to have considerable income to be able to afford to live in that village. It's a really nice place to live and it's 20 minutes to chew right away from the city. Earlier in the summer we have this lead, which is that there's this tiny firm called Vega Capital London, and they were the biggest winners from the biggest oil crash in history. You know, anyone that covers markets, it's going to be surprised about that. You know, you're thinking, you're BP's of the world, you're Glen Cores, but there's this tiny firm. And one of the big challenges that we had was actually finding out who worked with Vega Capital. It wasn't immediately obvious, but at first we had absolutely no idea. If you go to the Vega Capital website, it says it's under construction. If you do basic online searching, it's very difficult to find anyone who's publicly connected to the company. So inevitably we're incredibly curious at this point, like who the hell are these people? The more reporting we did, the more it became clear that this group were connected socially as well as professionally. They went to weddings together, they played golf together, they would go and holiday together. We found out that a number of them were members of the West Ham supporters club in London. A few of them started companies together, so you could see all the connections between them and start to see a distinct group emerging. And it really just was this kind of shock that, you know, this wasn't just like a hedge fund or a firm you'd never heard of. This was actually a group of buddies who all had the same experience on this day and had all made a huge amount of money. So if you're an oil trader, there's a number of different ways you can trade. And probably the most popular is WTI futures contracts. And it's basically a contract that says, I'm going to buy a thousand barrels of oil from you at this point in the future. Or I'm going to sell a thousand barrels of oil to you at this point in the future. It's actually just a financial contract to gamble on to predict where the oil was going to go up or down. On the 20th of April in Essex, there had been signals for a while that this was going to be an exceptional day in oil markets. And we know that some of them arose early and started their trading and the early hours of the morning while it was still dark outside. Essentially what they were doing is buying contracts that gave them an obligation to buy oil at whatever the price ended up at 230pm. So they're basically placing a bet that oil was going to fall throughout the day. But they're simultaneously selling lots of oil as well. And whether they make a profit and how much profit they make is the difference between what they buy the oil for and what they sell the oil for. Now of course we now know throughout April 20th the price dropped and dropped. So this is going very well for them. You know they are committed to selling oil at these prices and the prices are continuing to fall which means they're going to be able to offset it and buy oil at cheaper at the end of the day. Now once it gets to kind of 130pm that's when things start to get really interesting. Suddenly there's a kind of influx of buyers and sellers you know as desperation increases in the market and trading volumes go up. Now at 2.08pm exactly something bizarre and unprecedented happened which is the oil passes into negative territory. And it fell to a record level of minus 38 dollars. We've never seen anything like a period in terms of the contraction of the global economy. That huge gulf between what they were buying the oil for and what they were selling it for and able them to make more money than they ever thought possible. So their profit was the difference between minus 37 and all of these positive numbers on every contract they sold. The price of crude briefly hit minus 37 dollars a barrel for one group of traders operating from a small...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4938,2022-10-20 16:49:18
16593," Minus 37 and all of these positive numbers on every contract they sold. The price of crude briefly hit minus $37 a barrel. For one group of traders operating from a small office, it was a very, very profitable day. It's important to remember this, this had never happened before in the history of oil trading. No one could have predicted it. I can't think of another example of where you enter a trader, you get paid on both sides, you get paid both to sell and to buy. You know, it's unthinkable. One thing we know about the Cuddles trading arcade is that they were very comfortable taking large risks. And you know, you have to be clear, this was a large risk. Yeah, we spoke to oil traders, both people that know these guys and people that don't. And they all say that this is, you know, incredibly risky. And that's actually what stops a lot of oil traders doing trading like this. They simply aren't willing to stomach the risk. But Cuddles and his friends were. So when the kind of final calculations came down, the group of the nine most profitable traders made $660 million or thereabouts between them. I mean, if you can imagine, I think three or four of them made in excess of a hundred million each. One of the astonishing things about this trade is that two of the individuals who made more than a hundred million dollars in a single day were in their twenties. One of them was 22 years old, you know, and a few years earlier, he'd been posting on his social media about doing teenage stuff with his mates in town and going to see girls and rap music. And here he is a few years later making a hundred million dollars in a single day's trading. When we in Liam discovered that, we were just, we couldn't believe it. We couldn't believe what we were seeing. All trading is a zero-sum game. Anytime you're making money as an oil trader, someone else is losing it. Amongst the biggest losers were the investors in this Chinese fund, crude oil treasure fund. There were thousands of them and they lost everything. Lots of people have put their savings into oil funds. They lost money that day. Big banks and brokers who sort of stand in the middle of trading parties, they lost money that day. And another interesting thing is that oil producing countries like Q8 or Canada, they sell oil as an average of the WTI closing price over the preceding month. So the fact that one of those numbers in that average was minus 37, men, if you can imagine, countries like Saudi Arabia and Q8 potentially lost a couple of dollars on every single barrel of oil they sold that month. Vega Capital's traders may touch an extraordinary sum of money that it was inevitable there would be some scrutiny of what they did, but it wasn't just the sums of money they made. In the vital half an hour before the settlement price was set, they were by far the biggest sellers of oil futures in the market, which is an incredible thing to think about. When you consider that the other participants in that oil market are going to be the world's biggest banks, you know, oil majors, BP and Shell, and here you have a group of nine guys in Essex who are having this significant influence over a global market for oil. I mean, I think you have to assume that if these guys have made seven million or ten million dollars, they probably would be celebrating in Essex right now, but the fact that they made closer to 700 million has meant that they are facing understandable scrutiny. We wrote individually to all the Vega traders who did exceptionally well that day, and we got a letter in response from a law firm representing the group. The law firm was at pains to point out, number one, that they haven't been accused of any wrong doing, that they all traded independently and separately, and they basically all made up their own mind that this was what was going to happen in oil markets based on publicly available knowledge and decided to execute this trade. What I love about these stories is there's a real variance of opinion, and some people will look at what happened and think that must be dodgy, they all traded at the end of the day, they all made a huge amount of money while all these people lost. That's shocking, but lots of people say these guys are at acute disadvantage. They're in a market that's inhabited by huge technology driven, funds and firms and oil giants that have got all the advantages in the world, and when you get a bunch of Essex geasers who essentially beat the market and find a way to make a huge amount of money, that should get a pat on the back of it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4939,2022-10-20 16:53:36
16594," and instead of got all the advantages in the world, and when you get a bunch of Essex geezers who essentially beat the market and find a way to make a huge amount of money, they should get a pat on the back really, because that's the dream. Since this happened, a lot of the guys have stopped trading the monthly settlements that they've done so well out in the past. Several of them have set up new companies. They've essentially gone very quiet. You know, any kind of social media presence they had has kind of closed down. By all accounts there, you know, waiting this out. It's certainly too early to try and predict how the regulatory investigations are going to pan out. You know, we just don't know. There's a number of potential outcomes for these guys. You know, potential punishments, if there are any findings of manipulation against Vega or anyone affiliated with it, might be you could be fined, you could be banned from trading, and you know, in most extreme cases there have even been criminal prosecutions in the past of people who have been found to have been manipulating the settlement and misconduct related to trade settlement. There are other outcomes too. You know, one obvious one is going to be they're able to walk away from this life-changing trade with all the money that they made and celebrated as heroes in the trading community to see that they'll go down as legends. So It's very important given the nature of the climate crisis right now for the general public to have an understanding of what progress is or is not actually happening. And I think many readers right now, they'll see these hundreds and hundreds of companies making these big bold climate claims. They would be forgiven to think that, you know, we're well on our way to meeting the emission reduction trajectory we need to be on. And the reality of the matter is we're just not on that trajectory. And a key reason for this sort of disconnect is the use of offsets that aren't doing what they claim to be doing. We have a massive potential for sort of willful blindness. We can convince ourselves of things regardless of what the facts are. And so that's what tends to happen in these cases. It's not that anybody is setting out to commit climate fraud. They sort of walk themselves into a situation and they convince themselves of one thing and that allows them to convince themselves of another thing. But at the end of the day, they're doing something that makes no sense at all. My name is Ben Elgin. I wrote the story about how the billion dollar market for carbon offsets is setting back the fight against climate change. So one of the challenges in reporting on carbon offsets and trying to figure out what's going on is really finding good experts who have been steeped in this marketplace and are willing to candidly talk about it. One of the best people for this is a fellow named Mark Trexler. And I've been talking to him for more than a decade. My name is Mark Trexler. I've worked in climate change for the last 30 years. I was actually hired by the World Resources Institute in Washington to work on the first carbon offset project in 1988. In terms of defining a carbon offset, one of the beauties, so to speak, of greenhouse gases, the silver lining of greenhouse gases, when you put up a molecule of CO2 into the atmosphere, it can be anywhere in the planet in seven days. And therefore, if there's an option to reduce emissions.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4940,2022-10-20 16:57:55
16595," will see a two into the atmosphere, it can be anywhere in the planet in seven days. And therefore, you know, if there's an option to reduce emissions on the other side of the planet, and you can do that very cheaply as compared to doing it in your factory, for example, then why not pay that person, that factory on the other side of the planet to reduce their emissions? Then you are in a sense offsetting your emissions, and the atmosphere doesn't really see your emissions anymore. So carbon offsets have been around for quite some time, and they were actually key with these international climate agreements, such as the Kyoto Protocol, which mandated the wealthiest countries reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The trade was signed on the 11th of December 1997. Decided. The business community in general saw carbon offsets as a huge opportunity to comply with whatever policies and measures might be coming down the pike on climate change much more cost-effectively. We've seen a huge surge in companies making big proclamations about how they're going carbon neutral or zeroing out all of their carbon emissions. We're going to reduce our carbon footprint to net zero. Unilever is committing to net zero emissions. We can achieve a net zero emissions world. We began looking at these corporate claims of dramatically reduced emissions, and we noticed so many of these companies were using carbon offsets to achieve these aims, and as we began to look at the carbon offset projects themselves, what we found is that the environmental benefits claimed by these companies are not actually what they seem to be. As we sort of saw and spotted a number of these very aggressive carbon offset projects, which appeared to be generating inflated credits or bogus credits, we saw a number of them were associated with the Nature Conservancy. This surprised us. Nature Conservancy is the world's biggest environmental group. They have about a billion dollars a year in revenues, and they've been around for seven decades. They've preserved about 125 million acres of land. They've done so many good works over the years, and they've been very strong in terms of working with corporate partners. The Nature Conservancy has taken a different approach, a very pragmatic and pro business approach. They've come out and criticized a big polluter, but they're very happy to work with them. Some might say that, well, that's selling out, but others would say, and those at the Nature Conservancy would say, these companies have deep pockets. They can help fund important preservation work, and we have absolutely no problem working with them on this stuff. Companies are very warm, and they've partnered with the Nature Conservancy for many years. And yeah, it definitely lends a sheen of credibility to these projects. Here are twenty-narris. This is the business of Disney World this year. If you look at, for instance, Disney. It's a sprawling company with theme parks and cruise lines that burn up diesel fuel. They have office buildings and television studios that consume electricity. So these companies are trying to make major, major reductions in their carbon footprints, but it's very difficult to change these fundamental ways their businesses operate. So Disney has been a big buyer of carbon offsets that are orchestrated by the Nature Conservancy. One of the projects that they buy from is called Pennsylvania Riges. And that's a plot of land. Most of the land is actually about a three-hour drive outside of Philadelphia. Interestingly, this land, 3,000 of these acres, was actually acquired by the Nature Conservancy in the late 1990s. This land was eminently threatened. There was a pending logging contract on this land. So they do what they have done so well for all of these years, which is they go out. Under £39 labor promises to lead the state of power.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4941,2022-10-20 17:02:24
16596," Imminently threatened there was a pending logging contract on this land. So they do what they have done so well for all of these years, which is they go out. They raise money from local philanthropists and they go buy this land to protect it from developers and loggers. And at the time, according to an archive version of the Nature Conservancy's website, when they were proudly announcing this deal, they said these threats have been abated because of this acquisition by the Nature Conservancy. So it's really interesting now fast forward two decades to earlier this year when they put forward this carbon project. And if you look through it, this land is a key part of that carbon project. And what they're now saying is this land is now, once again, imminently threatened. 72% of the trees are going to be cut within five years. Now this is just astounding because this land is owned by the Nature Conservancy. They do not clear cut land that they've bought through philanthropic donations. So this scenario that they've put forward to get carbon revenues is not really plausible. And what that means is when you have Disney coming in and buying these credits, when it eventually lowers its carbon footprint because of these credits, well that won't be a credible or truthful claim by Disney. So this is an organization that truly understands the threat of the issue of climate change and is wanting to do its part to address this. However, in this situation, it just appears they're their drive, which they've had for decades, to increase the amount of revenues that it can use for land preservation work. Nature Conservancy and many others see that carbon credits as a pot of money that they can tap into to further their own benevolent aims. But unfortunately, what this has resulted in is claims of climate progress that just aren't really happening. So the Nature Conservancy defends vigorously these deals. And they and others will say, look, our projects are just following the rules that these registries set up. So some would also put some of the blame on the registries themselves because they're setting up the rules which allow these vapid projects to get up and sold. So we've reached out to all of the companies we mentioned in this story, including Disney, they didn't want to be interviewed for this story. But they all told us that, look, we have to rely on the experts out there. And those experts, they say, are these carbon registries that have been set up. Most of these Nature Conservancy deals are set up and sold on this exchange, it's called the American Carbon Registry. Now, it's the oldest of these registries that allow voluntary carbon credits to be sold. They've been around since 1996. What these offset registries do is they set up rules and any carbon offset project has to follow those rules. But there's this tension that's always there. If the rules are too strict, then it's going to be very hard for carbon offset projects to get up and running. So there's this balance going on where the registries want rules that attract projects. But they don't want it to be so strict where it will disincentivize projects from getting listed. One of the challenges with designing carbon offset systems is that there are normally two people at the table. You have buyers and you have sellers. And to some extent, you have policymakers, but the buyers and the sellers are really the ones with the expertise, with the incentive to really participate hard, make a lot of things happen. And the challenge there is is that both of them sort of want the same thing, or they're both happy with the same thing. They're happy with low cost offsets and a lot of them, because that works for their business model. You end up, though, with nobody really representing the atmosphere, so to speak. Nobody's really representing the climate in those discussions. And so the policies end up biasing the whole system. And you end up in sort of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4942,2022-10-20 17:06:35
16597," the climate in those discussions and so the policies end up by useing the whole system and you end up in sort of a race to the bottom and that's what we've seen happen. You know, when it comes specifically to the topic of carbon offsets, I am a fan of carbon offsets in the sense that they can help mitigate climate change. They absolutely can, but you know, if we're not going to do it correctly in a way that actually does help mitigate climate change, then it's nothing but a distraction. And you know, after 30 years, you have to start wondering, is it really just a distraction? And that's really unfortunate, but that's where we are. Ultimately, what needs to be what needs to happen is systemic change. You know, we're sort of nibbling around the edges with some of these different things. We need to change how we produce energy. We need to change how we transport ourselves. We need to change what and how we eat. You know, we need systemic change associated with transitioning to a low carbon economy. A lot of what we're doing today is not promoting systemic change. It's sort of trying to stick your thumb in the dike to preserve the current system and at the end of the day, that can't really work. You You You The hyperloop. There's a good chance you've heard the name by now. This is the hyperloop system. It can take people hundreds of miles in minutes. The hyperloop, a series of tubes that would transport people in pods at ultra high speeds over long distances. This is a remarkable new form of transportation that can whisk people from city to city in a flash. 29 minutes from New York to DC, 30 minutes from LA to San Francisco. For years, we've been seeing these futuristic utopian renderings of some cross between a spaceship and a monogale. But lately, the hyperloop is becoming much more real. Yeah. It was surreal to be sitting inside a hyperloop and just even more incredible to actually be like riding down a track in something that was nothing more than a crazy. I've got crazy ideas six years before. Companies all around the world have been developing and testing the technology needed to propel passengers of speeds of over 1000 kilometers per hour. But for many, speed is only the first step to unlocking the full transformational effects of a new mode of transportation. Fast is what we just sort of take for granted in the hyperloop world. It's the network effects that really deliver the benefit. And that opens up a completely different scale of economic opportunity. We've got planes, trains, automobiles and boats for getting around Earth. But what if there was a fifth mode? And I have an aim for it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4943,2022-10-20 17:10:46
16598," This trains, automobiles and boats, we're getting around Earth. But what if there was a fifth mode? And I have a name for it, which is called the Hyperloop. The Hyperloop? Hyperloop, yeah. In 2013, while riding high on the growing success of Tesla and SpaceX, entrepreneur Elon Musk released a white paper outlining the basic framework of the technology he called Hyperloop. The basic idea goes a little something like this. A tube reduces the air pressure to a near vacuum like environment. A Hyperloop pod is then suspended in the tube, usually by magnetic levitation. The whole pod can then be propelled forward. Because there's no traditional friction sources like air resistance or rolling friction that would push back against the pod, the Hyperloop is able to move at incredibly high speeds and do so fairly efficiently. Despite its futuristic name, however, the general concept behind Hyperloop is actually pretty old. In fact, New York City's first attempt at an underground public transit system in the 1870s was based on a similar principle. The pneumatic transit system was short-lived, however, only stretching one block and topping out at a rather leisurely 10 miles per hour. While Elon would make some 21st century improvements to this concept and bestow a very 21st century name, he wouldn't end up pursuing the technology itself. Instead, electing to focus his efforts on something a little bit deeper, literally digging the requisite tunnels by a his boring company. It would take another billionaire industrialist who dabbles in spaceflight. No way, not that one. Yeah, that's the one. After Richard Branson would make a large investment in the company Hyperloop 1, it would be renamed to Virgin Hyperloop. What we've always been trying to do as a company is show that this technology could work, that it could be made safe, and that ultimately it's something that's happening in the next couple of years, not the next 20 years. Josh Geigel is the co-founder and CEO of Virgin Hyperloop. In a familiar tech startup story, he's seen the project go from a garage to a large-scale testing facility outside of Las Vegas. So we started building the first kind of Hyperloop system in 2016. We've done a lot of work, about a 500 tests that we've done on that over the last five years. And what we realize that we need to do is take that technology, show that it can be commercial. So drive the cost down, improve the efficiency, improve the performance. But the key thing is, you know, is actually making it approachable and safe for individuals. In order to do that, Josh, along with Virgin's head of passenger experience, Sara Luchian, bravely volunteer to take the inaugural ride. What her and I were realizing is like, we're the first two people sitting in a Hyperloop. The only type of people that have gone through this environment are in spaces. And there we are in just like normal clothes because of the system, the safety of what we designed. Three, two, one, launch. And then once we started going, you felt a bit of acceleration. We accelerated a little bit harder than we would in commercial. Be like a sports car. Yeah. We got about 108 miles an hour on that test. And it's a short run. It's about 500 yards or so. And came to a stop. The test lasting only about 20 seconds and covering only a quarter of a mile at just over 100 miles per hour is a long way away from a true functioning Hyperloop. But as for optics, it's a crucial step for the future of funding. The number one question we got from investors or from project proponents, or just people in general was like, is a Hyperloop safe? And what better way to show something is safe than by actually getting people on it? But convincing investors and governments that would likely be fronting some of the construction costs for an unproven technology is no easy task. First and foremost is the question of safety. Most people don't know how an airplane works, but yet they get on an airplane. They get on an airplane because it's faster than driving. And most importantly, they've probably gotten off of one before. They've seen someone get off of one before. And so what we set out to do was actually show that Hyperloop could be safe. With two normal people, not astronauts, not adrenaline junkies or test pilots or anything like that. Two normal people getting on a Hyperloop. And then most importantly, those two people getting off. But beyond safety concerns, constructing Hyperlips will undoubtedly be a good way to do it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4944,2022-10-20 17:15:16
16599," or test pilots or anything like that, two normal people getting on a hyperlube, and then most importantly, those two people getting off. But beyond safety concerns, constructing hyperlubes will undoubtedly require a significant capital investment to the estimated tune of around $60 million US dollars per kilometer of track. So a track from San Francisco to Los Angeles, for example, is likely to come with a price tag over $10 billion. And before large governments are willing to come in in front of those costs, investors who are funding hyperlube development, must accept it as a long-term mixture of technology and infrastructure investing. Investors that are used to short returns because you're developing apps or something to that effect. Those aren't the investors that really get excited about hyperlube. What you start to see is the people that are looking at platform technologies. So this idea that because this smartphone existed, Uber could exist. So who are the Vanderbilts of this century? And that's the part where you're going to get a lot more nose than yeses. But those people that have the ability, that afforded to stick it out to see the game-changing platform here, those are the people that we're looking for. And since we've done that passenger test, there has been a lot of interest that's really, oh, this is a lot sooner than I thought. fragrant morning In visioning the ripple effects of what Hyperloop could achieve, though, is fairly challenging at this stage of development. It's fast, yes, but for point-to-point travel, traditional maglev trains can move pretty fast as well. And outside of China, South Korea, and Japan, even those haven't seen much adoption elsewhere due to the high costs and questionable profitability. The Shanghai line in China, for example, loses around $100 million every year. Hyperloop companies, however, believe they can offer something different than traditional railway lines. My name's Alan James, and as far as I know, I'm the only guy on the planet who's written the government-level business case for 300 kmH conventional high-speed rail, 500 kmH maglev and 1000 kmH Hyperloop. It's fundamentally about moving people from where they are, to where they want to go, when they want to make those journeys, and doing it in much smaller numbers. So pod designs for Hyperloop range from 12 to 28 seats, typically. Why are they small? It's because small enables the network to operate flexibly. And a great example of that is the East-West strategic route across the north of England, from Liverpool to Manchester to Leeds. So to get from Liverpool via Manchester to Leeds by train is just short of two hours a day. It'll probably take you two hours driving as well in average traffic conditions. That result is those three city regions remain three separate entities. Liverpool Manchester Leeds, there's very little commuting traffic between those urban areas. Hyperloop absolutely changes that from the ground up. Liverpool to Manchester is a five or six minute journey. Manchester to Leeds is also a five or six minute journey. What effectively does is create a single super city economy. In this vision, the Hyperloop acts a little more like a highway, where pods have fixed destinations and don't need to stop along the way. Meaning you can travel on a Hyperloop network from, say, Liverpool to Leeds, while the pod behind you travels from Liverpool to Manchester. And if that metro Hyperloop network is connected to other networks from the same location, you could travel from Liverpool to Paris or Liverpool to Amsterdam, all without making a single stop. There are passing-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4945,2022-10-20 17:19:49
16600," Work is connected to other networks from the same location. You could travel from Liverpool to Paris or Liverpool to Amsterdam, all without making a single stop. For passengers, for business, for leisure, that is utterly transformational. For high-value freight and logistics, it's equally transformational. But critically, if you do a hyperlute network at scale, you begin to deliver massively significant carbon savings to it. A multi-regional hyperlute network could become a replacement for both short-haul passenger and cargo flights and traditional ground transportation, both of which are significant carbon producers. One hyperlute connected distribution hub, perhaps at an airport that is predominantly used for international air freight, replacing maybe 10, 12, 15 distributed road hubs. It takes a lot of polluting and inefficient truck haulage off the roads. That itself means roads gain extra capacity. Hyperloups will still need to use electricity to both move pods and maintain the near-vacuum environment and the tube. Proponents of the technology believe that this can be done by using renewable sources, including a combination of solar panels and battery technology that could be used along the hyperlute itself. But even with all multipliers of time and carbon emission savings that a hyperlute network may provide, the investment capital required to actually build such a network becomes even more economically and politically daunting. Committing doesn't mean spending billions on day one. Committing means how do we phase it? One company in the Netherlands is working to develop that technology, and perhaps more importantly, the international coalition needed to make the hyperloup network a reality. So we are here in Europe's first full-scale hyperlute test facility, where we can already prove every conceptual technology of the hyperloup. This is Tim Houter, a co-founder and CEO of Heart Hyperloup, headquartered in the city of Delft. And while this testing tube might not seem as large as others, inside is a key technology to create the on and off-ramp type infrastructure of a hyperloup network, that is, a lane switch. That's something we can already test here. You can actually see it here. The track is diverging from one track into two. The next possible to eventually split up the hyperloup track into two sections, and in that sense you can create a complete hyperloup network, but in the end, we'll make it possible to travel for example over a whole continent, and take Europe for example, with the same ease as you can now travel with a metro in the city. The nice thing about this magnetic levitation system that we have developed is that there's absolutely zero moving components in the track. So for example, if you have to do a lane switch, all you do is that the tube basically splits up, and statically the tracks also split up, and whenever the vehicle enters a switch, it either pulls itself to the right with its magnets, or it pulls itself to the left with its magnets. Lane switching on traditional rail requires the physical movement of the rail. Even modern magnetic levitation tracks use lane switching techniques in order to transfer trains from one track to another. And this is a very crucial element, because this is the thing that limits the capacity, and in the end the usefulness of the real network, because the moment that the vehicle is moving, the usefulness of the real network, because the moment that a track is switching, that means that at that moment you are creating an unsafe environment for the trains behind it, so you need a lot of space between trains. Then a high point because you have no moving components in the track, all the vehicles can be much closer to each other, you can achieve a very high frequency, and basically have vehicles moving and merging in and out of the network very much like a highway. For now though, testing has been limited by the size of their tube. Because the test track is only 30 meters long,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4946,2022-10-20 17:23:50
16601," For now though, Hart's physical testing has been limited by the size of their tube. Because the test track is only 30 meters long, they haven't tested this lane switch at speeds greater than 20 kilometers per hour. However, the company is working to build a new test site, where it plans to increase that testing speed to 300 kilometers per hour. We're now in a phase where we have proven most of the most important technologies in the test facilities that we already have. And we have also demonstrated the viability and the feasibility of a network. If you look at all the top systems that it consists of, most of those are proven systems already demonstrated in lab conditions. So we don't really believe that the technology itself is going to be the biggest challenge. Because for all Hyperloop companies out there, actually building a Hyperloop system requires more than just a good product. We're talking about the safety aspects. We're talking about integration into the environment. We're talking about social aspects. Do people feel comfortable traveling in such a system? So it's about all these different aspects. And the complexity is really getting all the different stakeholders that are relevant and that they need to contribute to bring this to market. To get them all following the same roadmap. In order to help build this coalition of private and public interest in Hyperloop development, heart in 2018 partnered with other Hyperloop companies from Europe and Canada. The goal was to define, establish and standardize the framework to regulate Hyperloop systems. Right now we are working with all the Hyperloop developers together in setting up the first structure for starting the standards drafting. One of the most important goals for heart is interoperability, which is essentially making sure the different systems can communicate with each other. Interoperability is so important because what we want to achieve is actually have this seamless travel experience. So you don't want to end up, for example, going from Madrid to Paris and then switching because you need to use a different technology to get, for example, to Amsterdam. The idea being that as companies ran Europe, create the first commercial Hyperloop tracks between individual cities, one day those can all be connected to a larger network. Everyone that believes that Hyperloop is a future transport system also realizes that there is a need to have this network because that's where Hyperloop thrives. Hyperloop is such a huge project. It's definitely not something that you can do in your own or as a single company. So you need to do it with a lot of other companies. You need to have the governments. I think in that sense, the biggest challenge that we've encountered is to really get all the required parties together to take the steps in development and in commercial implementation. Hearts Next plan is to build the European Hyperloop Center, an open testing facility which will include a 2.6 kilometer test track. And the company hopes to test travel speeds there at up to 700 kilometers per hour. Virgin Hyperloop is also racing to construct the first commercial Hyperloop route with projects in various states of development in India, Saudi Arabia, and the United States. Recently, the company announced plans to build a Hyperloop certification center in West Virginia, which will include a six-mile long test track. Proving the technology here will be crucial. If Hyperloop networks can find a home among infrastructure investments, that the Biden administration hopes to make. The idea that there's multiple Hyperloop companies, I think is a redeeming aspect in the business. People really want to see something happen, so having multiple people move forward is good for that. I was struck when...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4947,2022-10-20 17:28:09
16602," I really want to see something happen, so having multiple people move forward is good for that. I was struck when Josh and Sarah rode the pod. Two or three of the major outlets used the phrase, we now have a new mode of transport. And although all of that technology had existed before those two human beings rode it, it was the moment at which those two human beings traveled that short distance down the tube that in popular imagination Hyperloop became a mode of transport. The metaphor I use with my team is that, you know, the Wright Brothers refers, but none of us fly on Wright Brothers Airlines anymore. If you don't continue to innovate, you're not going to be around, and so we'll continue to be at the forefront of building our boot. Back in 2013, Elon had an idea. I think the difference now in 2021 is some brilliant engineers have spent real time grinding out the details. And I thoroughly expect the next three to five years to be decisive. This week, how hydrogen can transform our energy usage. We'll look at why the universe's most abundant element could be a game changer in the climate revolution. Hydrogen technologies are not new. They are used in other sectors. We use them in space on our rockets, and we don't need the laws of physics to change to be able to use hydrogen on our planes. From iron ore to green hydrogen, one of Australia's richest men tells us about his pivot to sustainable energy. Let's take action. It's practical. It's implementable. Let's do it now. Plus, the hydrogen revolution. We'll speak with the CEO of Italian Utilities firm, Snam, about his new book and how green hydrogen could be competitive within five years. Coss are coming down, and people are waking up to the fact that it's the only way to decarbonize certain sectors. From Bloomberg's Global Headquarters in New York, I'm Kayleigh Lyons, and this is Bloomberg Green.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4948,2022-10-20 17:32:41
16603," Fortress in New York, I'm Kayley Lines, and this is Bluebird Green. It's a new year, so here at Bluebird Green we're highlighting new solutions in the fight against climate change. And one of those is as old as the universe itself. Hydrogen. It's the simplest element around, but could well be a game changer when it comes to turning around our dependence on fossil fuels. Today, hydrogen is used in the chemicals industry to produce petroleum products. It's also starting to be used in steel production and industry under a lot of pressure to decarbonize. But it has far more uses as well, from power and cars to heating our homes. And Bluebird New Energy Finances is a seismic shift in the sector in the next 10 years, as green hydrogen squeezes out dirtier alternatives. So-called grey hydrogen dominates today. But as renewable electricity gets cheaper and more accessible, so will green hydrogen. In this week's edition of Bluebird Green, we'll explore what this push into hydrogen means for tackling climate change. We'll hear from Australian billionaire Twiggy Forest about his pivot from Iron War II hydrogen. And we'll also speak with the CEO of Italian Utility Company Svamm about his book, The Hydrogen Revolution. But first, what are we using hydrogen for? And why does it actually matter? Christine Lee Edwards explains. Hydrogen, the most plentiful element in the universe. On Earth, we find it mostly bonded to oxygen in the form of water. Or in other gases known as hydrocarbons. Hydrogen gas, H2, burns hot and clean, making it an attractive tool in the race to net zero. But isolating hydrogen from other elements is no easy task. Today, the cheapest way to do this is via chemical processes that break up natural gas. This releases a lot of carbon dioxide. Another method is to use electricity to split water molecules in a process called electrolysis. Although there is no carbon byproduct, a lot of electricity is needed. And if this power comes from burning coal or gas, it negates to zero emissions goals of using hydrogen to begin with. Hydrogen produced in this way, powered by fossil fuels, is called gray hydrogen. If carbon capture and storage is used together with fossil fuels, then it becomes blue hydrogen. If nuclear power is used, it's called pink. And finally, green hydrogen is what is produced via electrolysis and powered from renewable sources. This method is considered emissions-free. It's predicted that by the early 2030s, H2 made for renewables will be cheaper than that made from fossil fuels. But that hinges on the cost of electrolysis declining, which will be achieved through larger projects and an expansion of manufacturing. To be clear, vast amounts of H2 are already used today. Global production in 2018 totalled 117 million metric tons. This hydrogen is mostly used for its chemical properties, not as a source of energy, and very little of it is clean. Some sectors like steel could start using hydrogen for these chemical properties, replacing coal. Industries like cement and glass may also use hydrogen as a source of heat. Another advantage is its energy storage potential. It can be stored over long periods of time and used when more power needs to be added to the grid. It also could hold an advantage over batteries and heavy transport and shipment. The promise of hydrogen for energy has been around since at least 1874, when Jules Verne wrote about it in his book, The Mysterious Island. But the future of hydrogen will depend on policy. Countries with net zero targets, carbon pricing and hydrogen strategies with investment mechanisms are likely to see the highest H2 demand. That was Bloomberg's Christine Lee Edwards explaining what hydrogen needs for the energy transition. But how are businesses approaching the sector? Well, one of Australia's richest men is making a big play into hydrogen.

16604," Made his portion from iron ore, being the chairman, former CEO and major shareholder in Fortescue Metals, one of the world's biggest miners. But after having made over $10 billion in profit from the metal in the last fiscal year, Twiggy wants to transform Fortescue into a clean energy company. He's been scouring the planet in search of investment opportunities in hydrogen and renewables. The firm plans to allocate up to 10% of its annual profits for green energy investments and is exploring projects across the globe from Indonesia to Argentina. Prancing Laqua caught up with Twiggy Forest. There's only one type of clean hydrogen. All the rest is dirty. That is green. If you just say, green hydrogen is clean, the rest is dirty, then you've actually nailed it. And anyone else who produces any other hydrogen, any other agridist, look at me and say, why is global warming accelerating if anything you're saying is true? And then you'll know, actually, it's greenwashing. Yeah, but there's a lot of greenwashing because I keep on being told it's a transition. We can't just, you know, make the transition at a click of a finger. So what are we doing wrong? What can we do better? I don't remember the personal computer having to transition the typewriter. I really don't remember that. I don't remember the smartphone having to transition the pocket calculator and the old landline. You know, it's transition line is complete rubbish. The light got put to it. What was that? Two days ago when JCB, a really loved British company, you can every right for the country to be proud of JCB. And Portuscue, I think a bit of a similar reputation, fantastic track record. It was from Superwell from Portuscue, huge balance sheet, super strong. When those two companies got together and agreed, a 79 billion USD green with dirt atom. Right, then that's a real wake up call to say, hang on. Greenhagen is obviously commercial now. You know, every other form of fossil fuel, fossil fuel, hydrogen, you know, it can compete with it on price. It can probably lose on price, but what we know, it is cooking the planet. And only greenhagen zero methane, zero carbon in the supply chain. Don't worry about the molecules in the supply chain. But at the moment, we're not even facing out call if you'll get the G20 company case. So we have a long way to go to talk about only using green hydrogen. Yeah, so look, I have a call, which I'd like to make now, that the world should not fund any more coal-fired power stations, coal mining projects ever. We should wind them down as quickly as possible, because they are cooking the planet just like grey and blue hydrogen. It's cooking the planet. Yeah, you know, hydrogen to not make renewable electricity is releasing 10 to 16 times more carbon. Let alone the methane, which is worse than it is hydrogen. So we've just got to stop doing things which are self-harming under the guise of greenwarchina. So why are leaders so slow? Even if you look at the appetite for EISG investments, they're growing exponentially. So are emissions. So where are we allocating capital? Okay, so take the recent G20. There's probably a reason why there was a strong action coming out of the G20, because people were not aware that major transactions between large companies were taking place now on greenhutchina, that actually this pollution-free, all the way to the supply chain fuel, was now being transacted at multi-billion dollar scale. If that none that I don't believe any sovereign leader or any energy minister, or climate change minister, could not take ultra-seriously, that greenhutchina is never here to stay, it's broken through, history has been made, it will never go back. Okay, what is the one thing that you would tell leaders today, and business leaders? How do we transition faster than what we are now, because we're at real risk of missing our targets? Oh, so that's really simple. And you stop funding, you stop subsidising, you stop using money into possible. Right. It could be carbon sequestration, it could be fuel rebates could be anything. Hundreds of billions of dollars getting ashed, while we ashed the planet on fossil fuel subsidies, because we haven't had that renewable energy, because we haven't had that greenhutchina, it's kind of been pushed down, pushed down, it's also, excuses are never become commercial.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4950,2022-10-20 17:41:13
16605," Because we haven't had that maneuver, because we haven't had that brain hydrogen, it's kind of been pushed down, it's also excuses, are never being commercial, they're never being supplied to the quantities we needed. Now, blah, blah. Now we know it, let's take action. It's practical, it's implementable. Let's do it now. Okay, if we do it now, is there going to be a shock to the energy system? Is there going to be a shock actually to economically? And is it worth not talking about transition, just going from A to B? Yeah, it's a fantastic person. A to B is the solution. Let possible fuels do what possible fuels do. Just burn their coal, burn their oil, burn their gas, at least they're pumping up carbon and methane into the atmosphere, honestly. Well, not that honest, because they don't mention methane, which is 90 times worse than carbon. But at least the carbon has been done honestly. It's a very important thing to do, to encourage the Green Hatchel sector to come in really fast. It's there. When you look at power all over the world, we now know how to make electrolyzes much cheaper, like 25% of the original cost. We know how to do that now, we don't have any excuse to get into it. Does it need to be cheaper than oil and fossil fuel for it to be viable worldwide? Well, right now it is. Okay, so let's just swallow that bit of financial data. Right now it is cheaper. And it's getting more check. It's the high fuel you know, just declining in value. You don't have enough of it, right, to power the world. Yes, that's only because we haven't had policies to support. We had policies to support it five, ten years ago. It would be everywhere. You'd see the global warming budget start to come down. Now, we've got five or ten years to make a huge difference. And he policy leaders all over the world to appreciate now, okay, big business is transacting with green hydrogen in multi-billion dollar agreements. We now know it's here at the state that's spread everywhere. Coming up on the program, the hydrogen revolution. We'll speak with the CEO of Italian utility firm, Snam, about his new book. And why he thinks green hydrogen will be competitive in just five years. Plus, how are airlines working to become more sustainable? We'll look at how Airbus plans to step up in the climate fight. And this is the green. And this is the green. And this is the green. And this is the green. And this is the green. And this is the green.

16606," Music From Bloomberg's World Headquarters in New York, I'm Kayley Lines and this is Bloomberg Green. What will the world look like in 2050? Will global temperatures have stabilized, electric vehicles be abundant and solar and wind power homes around the world? According to Marco Alvera, the CEO of Italian Energy Company Snam, that vision of the future could be a reality. And he says that hydrogen will pave its way. As he tells it in his new book, The Hydrogen Revolution, Alvera's moment of reckoning came in November 2018 when he tasked the Snam scenarios team with studying how Europe could reduce its CO2 emissions to zero by 2050. Looking through the results of the study, Alvera said he was struck by how much hydrogen was in Europe's energy mix by that year. Beyond the abundance of hydrogen, the Snam model also predicted that it would be the cheapest form of decarbonized energy for many sectors, and that it could be cheaper than today's prices for oil, coal and nuclear power. Our Maria today has spoke with Alvera at COP26. It's happening all very fast. We see the cost of hydrogen coming down a lot. Hydrogen will play a big role in the energy mix. I don't know if it's going to be 15 or 25% of a fully decarbonized energy system, but it's going to be big. Coss are coming down and people are waking up to the fact that it's the only way to decarbonize certain sectors, so called hard to obey sectors. And you say it's the only way in the cost are coming down. Where do you see prices moving? Because a lot of the reticence of times has to do with the pricing. That some argue will still not have the cheapest option out of the market. So when I was first working in hydrogen in 2004, it was costing $1,000 per megawatt hour, $2,000, $1,600. Today, 100, and we see it going down to 50 and five years' time, and to going down to $25 per megawatt hour in the next 10 years or so. Which is a quarter of what is today. That's really because renewable energy, and we're talking green hydrogen here. Renewable energy costs are falling, but the cost of making the electrolyzer, which is the kit that you use to convert solar or wind energy and water into hydrogen. The cost of this kit is falling a lot because it doesn't really exist on an industrial scale. So as we build up capacity, we industrialize it, we standardize it, and we squeeze costs out. That's really the cost trajectory. And for that, of course, you need demand, however, for governments and also institutions to kind of buy into this idea that it is a future and we want to invest in creating infrastructure. What are they telling you? When you speak to governments, when you speak to officials, are they keen on this? They're very keen. So the Department of Energy shares our view in the states of getting to below $1 a kilo, which is $25 a megawatt hour. The European Union has a hydrogen strategy, which is very clear, and several member states have the same. Chile wants to export a lot of hydrogen. China's big on hydrogen. Australia's very big on hydrogen. Japan is blending already hydrogen. So I would say the world is now really focused on this because it's the only way to store energy for a long period of time economically, is to convert it into either a liquid or a gas. And of course, you talk about the price, but the other big component is the volume. How big can you go? Where do you see that on a time scale? So wherever it's sunny or windy, you can produce very cheap hydrogen eventually. And so compared to oil and gas, which are concentrated in a few parts of the world, it's going to be very democratic from that point of view. So every sunny place, every desert, every ocean wind can be turned into hydrogen that we can put on ships in pipes and really start trading it around the world. So it's going to happen a lot faster than a lot of people think. And will you say a lot faster? What is that in time? As they said, $50, which is essentially oil parity within five years, and then depending on how quickly we ramp it up after that, we could get to $25, which is coal parity before the end of the day. And in big scale. In big scale, because once you get to coal parity, that's the only way we're going to get China and India to stop burning new coal. We have businesses in China and in India, and I see a lot of hydrogen development, a lot of renewable development in both countries. The Indian announcement was incredibly strong on 2030. Some people were upset about the 2017 at 0 deadline, but when it comes to 30, he announced a big, big commitment to get to 50% renewals. Where is the price? Buy it. I was surprised that they would make it so explicit. And even the net zero is a big thing for them. And so I think it will happen faster than...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4952,2022-10-20 17:49:54
16607," the big commitment to get the 50% renewables. I was surprised that they would make it so explicit. And so I think it will happen faster than 2070 because of the falling cost of renewable and hydrogen. India's burning 80 gigawatt of oil, diesel to keep the lights on. So there's an immediate opportunity there and we're very interested in working that country. And with regards to China, perhaps the fact that we haven't really seen them active, I guess the diplomats are working on this, but we haven't really seen the leadership. It's going to be technology, it's going to be industry, I think China has committed to a net zero, which is very important. At the G20, China was clearly behind the one and a half degrees. So I think a lot has been achieved between the G20 and COP and I think what's really important is to see in the coming years, how quick it's in our hands to make part of this happen in five years or could otherwise happen in 15, 20 years. It's about building the project. The capital is there. We saw how many trillions of dollars are already committed. What's missing is really the projects and that's where companies like us step in. Marco Alvera, CEO of Snam there speaking with our Maria Tadeo. Let's turn now to the aviation industry. It's a big contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions and it's under pressure to change that. In October, the International Air Transport Association, a trade body representing airlines, approved a target of achieving net zero emissions by 2050. To achieve that, many airlines in the US and Europe are looking to buy sustainable aviation fuel made from renewable sources like used vegetable oil. Initiatives like these are pushing plane makers to come up with some radical new aircraft that will eventually cater to our growing appetite for travel without hurting the environment. We took a look at how Airbus, the world's number two aircraft manufacturer, is stepping up to the challenge. How long until we can fly emission free? Airbus says it's more confident by the day it can be done by its 2035 target. Airbus a CEO spoke about its ambitions for hydrogen powered planes at the company's summit in France. The physics works. Hydrogen technologies are not new, they are used in other sectors. We use them in space on our rockets. And we don't need the laws of physics to change to be able to use hydrogen on our planes. So every day we become more confident. But we think we need to have a plane. We need to have the right fuels, the hydrogen available in the right quantity at the right place at the right time. And we need the regulations to be ready. So we really need the work and the collaboration of many people on the globe to make it happen on time. But it could be a long wait until green passenger jets go mainstream. Larger aircraft with more than 150 seats are not expected to feature globally until about 2050. That means manufacturers and airlines today are undergrowing pressure to ramp up short-term innovations to cut their carbon. In a long term, meeting the ambitious plans for so-called green hydrogen means building a giant industry almost from scratch. To make that happen, British airline easy jets as among those saying governments need to get involved and fast. Aviation's emissions over the last three decades leading up to the pandemic grew by about 80% to over 1 gigaton. And that's projected to double by 2050. According to Bloomberg, NEF, about half of the airlines with the largest global market share have set net zero targets by that same date nearly three decades away. Coming up from Blue Sky projects to the bottom line. We'll speak with our Bloomberg NEF expert Meredith Annex and dig into their models about how hydrogen fits into the future energy mix.

16608,"从南西步步都语着从南南步步最蹈从南纸的路边从南地十邊 ages从南洲之間从南洲都比较少 Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. From Bloomberg's World Headquarters in New York, I'm Keeley Lines, and this is Bloomberg Green. Now let's bring in Meredith Annex, our Bloomberg N-E-F Hydrogen Specialist to talk more about how hydrogen could change the energy landscape. Meredith, what place do you think hydrogen is likely to have in the future energy mix globally? Hydrogen is this incredible solution for us as we look to decarbonize because it's a perfect solution in areas that are hard to electrify. So we're really like to think about hydrogen playing a role. It's in things like heavy industry, especially where you need a feedstock as well as energy source, and in things like dispatchable power, long-called transport, maybe even shipping and aviation. That sounds great that it can be used for such diverse industries. At the end of the day, though, how much is this going to cost? Well, that's the amazing thing about hydrogen because depending on how you make it, it can actually see significant cost of clients in the future. So when we're talking about clean hydrogen, we usually mean green hydrogen produced for renewable electricity. And in that case, your hydrogen is almost as cheap as the renewables that are used to think it. So if you're in a place with really good renewable resources, you'll be able to have cheaper hydrogen. But even in places with less good resources, we think that hydrogen can be cheaper than a dollar per kilogram, which is the price of unabated hydrogen today, and around $8 per million BTUs for those who prefer to think in energy units. And that can be changed anywhere in the world by 2050, we believe. All right. Let's talk about the pros and cons list. I don't know where cost fits into that. But what are the advantages to hydrogen over other renewables and then what are the drawbacks? Yeah. Main advantage is the fact that hydrogen can serve roles that electron struggle with. And that's things like seasonal storage, for instance, or just anything where you need to store ability, where your electrons are harder to store, hydrogen is going to be easier. It also leads to a downside though, because hydrogen is less energy dense than the usual things that we use for storeable energy today like coal or oil or natural gas. So you will need more volume of storage to handle the same amount of energy. Let's talk about the viability as well and how it may differ in different geographies. What is your view on that? Yeah. So for green hydrogen again, from renewable electricity, really places with the best renewable resources, things like Latin America or the Middle East, even southern Europe have really really good potential for producing hydrogen. And then when you're looking at blue hydrogen, which is produced from natural gas or coal with carbon capture and storage, we do see that becoming more expensive than green hydrogen in the future, especially as renewable electricity costs come down. So that can be a viable option in places like...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4954,2022-10-20 17:58:48
16609," storage. We do see that becoming more expensive than green hydrogen in the future, especially as renewable electricity costs come down. But that can be a viable option in places like the US Gulf Coast or Russia, where you've got good geological storage for the carbon, as well as ample natural gas. That's quite cheap. All right, great breakdown. Thank you so much to our Meredith Annex, our Bloomberg NEF Hydrogen Specialist. And of course you can get more from the Bloomberg NEF team on the terminal and online. And they've recently done a podcast called Hydrogen 101 as part of its switched on series.

From Bloomberg World Headquarters, I'm Charlie Pellett. We have got the Dow, the S&P and Nesdenk, all trading lower after hawkish comments from federal reserve officials swaps down pricing in a 5% peak rate in the first half of next year. The pound rose after Liz Truss resigned as UK Prime Minister. A rally in the S&P 500 fizzled after Philadelphia Fed Chief Patrick Harker said policymakers are likely to raise rates to well above 4% this year and hold them at restrictive level. Right now we have got the 10 year yielding 4.20% the two year, 4.59%. The S&P is down 24, a drop of 7.10% of 1%. The Dow is down 50, a decline of 2.10% as decked down 58, a drop of 6.10% of 1%. Spot gold of a dollar 80, a drop of 1.10% to 1631, West Texas, in a media crude of 1.4%, 86.73 a barrel on WTI. Again, the 10 year worth repeating right now, it is at 4.20% as for the rate outlook, Julia Carnotto is president and founder of macro-published perspectives. If you look at the rise in yields and the rise in the 10 year is one story which is significant or at the highest level since 2008 I believe. But then if you look at other fixed income markets in particular the mortgage market, we are seeing investors step back. It isn't a time where people are really incentivized to take risk and bet on the end of this, you know, bet on the peak rate of the cycle.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4955,2022-10-20 18:03:00

Inside from the reporters and editors who bring you America's most trusted business magazine, plus global business, finance and tech news, as it happens, Bloomberg Business Week with Carol Massier and Bloomberg Quick Takes Tim Stenevig on Bloomberg Radio. And very good afternoon, everyone. I'm Mark from the Bloomberg Interactive Broker Studio. Yes, we are streaming on YouTube. Tim Stenevig is on assignment. So joining me for the next three hours is Bloomberg Market Senior Editor Mike Regan and Mike Markets, man, the darn hawkish fed speak weighing again on the trade today. Absolutely, hey, we're up for a little bit. We're down again. You know, if you don't like the weather and these markets stick around, it'll change. You take a nap, you might come up to it and wake up to a different market. Hey, listen, we're going to talk about the markets. We're also going to talk about the story heard around the world, the resignation of UK Prime Minister Liz Trust, top of mind. And on that, we've got an amazing lineup, including a former UK monetary policy official and a former British trade official who recently represented the UK government to Wall Street and the US official sector. So two smart voices, Mike, to weigh in on that. Absolutely. What a just dramatic story. I mean, it's like a one of these British dramas, you know, that we watch from the BBC. Multi-towers, I think. I've never seen it, but maybe that's the one. Yeah, exactly. We've also got the CEO of New Balance. We're going to talk about manufacturing in the US, the holiday season. We're going to talk about small gun makers getting around state laws. That is the Bloomberg big take. And then snap earnings after the bell. And we're going to do a preview of all of the big tech earnings that are coming out next week as we get into full swing. But first up, let's talk the markets and the market drivers report. All right, let's set the business week agenda. Yep, on this Friday's evening. Pretty good. Anchor and markets correspondent at Bloomberg are going to interact with broker Studio along with Abigail Dulittle. She is markets reporter here at Bloomberg News. Kreeti, let's kick it off with you. As Mike said, blink and the markets change. It feels like. Yeah, it really has. Look, I think there are two ways to look at this market. One is from a purely American point of view where you do have a lot of major earning stories coming out. Earnings that are, by the way, much better than a lot of people expected. So kind of that call the G. Bar is low. The bar is low. I was going to say the call the G. and our net is made in that expectations have decreased by such a margin. It has made a lower bar. And that has created a lot of massive earning speeds and massive earnings rewards as well. Some of the post earnings stock reactions have been pretty enormous. For example, like a almost 6% rally off United earnings was very large. Those airlines have been on a tear. They absolutely have. But then you do have to factor in the macroeconomic as well. And this is where I think the UK has a little bit of a spillover effect, a contagion effect, a domino effect for lack of a better term in that. And I'm going to kind of very quickly walk us through this in that when you have a positive market development like the resignation of Liz Truss, which a lot of the market was kind of expecting would happen sooner or later, you do have a strong reaction in the pound. So you do have a stronger pound, which means a weaker dollar. That weaker dollar is going to reflect into games of the S&P 500. But that turnaround that we saw, I want to say, about midday here, almost about around noon, a lot of that turnaround happened at the same time as the dollar did as well. And that dollar is following the move that you're seeing in yields as well. And then in another kind of channel, what's happening in the UK, guilt markets, then it's also impacting the US Treasury market. Well, no to everybody. The UK still has to figure a few things out. And it kind of mean that's so great over in the UK. So Abigail, come on in. Yeah, we just another very volatile day. And I would agree with Crete that a lot of it has to do with the dollar and yield. We have that dollar, which had been down significantly earlier is now basically flat and yield. I was just thinking, look, at the 10-year yield, it's at its highest since 2008, the two-year yield at its highest since August of 2007. So fresh highs there. And that, of course, pressures the valuation on stock. I think it returns to that simple equation. Now, this said, we are in an up week. And we are off.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4956,2022-10-20 18:07:21
16611, 2007 so fresh highs there and that of course pressures the valuation on stocks I think it returns to that simple equation now this said we are in an up week and we are off the bottom by a few percentage points for most of the indexes and it looks like at least technically that we're seeing some sort of the beginning of a bear market rally which would make sense relative to a better than expected earning season. Yeah Abigail I love to catch up with you because you see stuff in the charts that the rest of us miss and I wanted to sort of talk about that bottom you know we've seen so many false bottoms in the S&P 500 this year is there anything to suggest that that mid-October bottom is the bottom or you know it does in a way does the technical analysis take a backseat to basically whatever the Fed decides to do this year? Well first of all thank you very much Mike that's very kind of you and then I would say you know the thing that's so great about technical analysis it captures everything in the market so it captures what the markets think the Fed is going to do and perhaps ahead if you assume it's an efficient market market and buyers are buying it the lowest level possible and sellers at the highest it's already in there to answer your question about whether this is the bottom I would say absolutely not that we're probably going to see some kind of rally back above 4000 and then I think that we're going to see a continued slow study drip down to the bottom I think that Noreal Rubini who's been very oppression in many different market environments he's kind of comparing this I think to the 70s and the financial crisis and I think that he's probably right I mean I know I've said a few times before here you know 2000 to 2003 I think next year is going to be difficult but there are these bear market rallies that investors can take advantage of uh... kreeti what um what does it take to think to get this dollar rally to to stop I mean is it just a pivot from the Fed is there anything else there do you think that would uh... cool this dollar hot dollar off I don't think it's the pivot from the Fed which is a contrary intake uh... my my day Adam I'm taking my cue from Vince Signorella here but I think it's really dependent on Europe and I think there is a case to be made for Europe in that uh... they have an economy that is more travel based if you're confident on an American consumer then you should be in theory confident on European travel and leisure and banks and all of that right now you're not seeing that because of the energy crisis and I think there's been a consensus here that the minute that gets fleshed out the minute Europeans kind of have a recession and that all uh... kind of flips and turns around that's when more and more money is going to go to Europe and you're already seeing that in the private markets you're seeing that in terms of Americans physically moving to Europe for better quality of life post-COVID here you have yet to see that in in the public markets and I think that pivot is what it's going to take it's going to have to be flesh out the energy crisis let's get to next year then people be more bullish on the euro and it's not necessarily a dollar story is a function of what's happening in there let's say you might see some Europeans traveling over here just to warm up in the in the winter never know but you do wonder about right here though it is cold already I had layers on this right but you do wonder whether or not this Fed has the spine that's needed to fight inflation or global central bankers whether or not they have the spine which is what Rubini's getting into any's worried about right I think that they do at least right now I don't think that there's any sign that they're going to back down if anything I think that they're more worried about getting into a situation where it's hyperinflation runaway although it's interesting I think that the Philadelphia index that came out today was pointing there are some indexes that are actually pointing to the problem of the last 10 to 15 years disinflation but I don't think that they're they're paying attention to that if it goes into hyperinflation just a little problem all right guys great macro setup for us on this Thursday critical to thank you anchor markets correspondent Bloomberg and of course Abigail do little markets reporter at Bloomberg News all right let's get to world the national news off to DC and Nancy Lyat he nets Carol president Biden is vowing to continue close cooperation with Britain following the resignation today of Liz Truss she stepped down after a six-week premiership that was marred by political and economic chaos given the situation I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the conservative party I have therefore spoken to his majesty the king to notify him that I am resigning as leader of the conservative party Truss says a new party leader and prime minister will be chosen by next week she'll go down in history as Britain's shortest serving prime minister president Biden is in Pennsylvania today where he's visiting a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4957,2022-10-20 18:11:33

The Biden administration is trying to tamp down those prices, releasing more oil from strategic reserves, and gas prices typically fall this time of year as summer driving ends and refiner switched to cheaper blends. But with Russia's war in Ukraine and fuel exports surging, U.S. inventories are at their lowest seasonal level since 2008. In Washington, I made me more as Bloomberg Radio. Global news, 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quick Take, powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. I'm Nancy Lyons, now back to Carolyn Mike. All right, Nancy Lyons. Thank you so much, Karl Maser, along with Mike Regan in Fort Tim Stenevich on this Thursday. As we mentioned at the top, really, the news heard round the world. And that was the resignation of UK Prime Minister Liz Truss, a top story without a doubt. So with what you need to know and the implications of the instability, let's get to Ed Price, principal for geopolitical forecasting at Ergo. It's a global consulting and forecasting firm. Ed is a former British trade official representing the UK government to Wall Street and the U.S. official sector. That was from 2017 to 2021. And he has also advised members of the European and British Parliaments and worked in the city of London. I lay it all out because this is why you want to listen to him. He joins us in our Bloomberg Interactive Broker Studio. Welcome. How are you? I've been better. I'm not going to lie to you. I'm not going to lie to you. Busy man these days, I imagine. I feel slightly busy right now. I have to say, going around the newsroom, we've all kind of laughed and not laughed that this whole idea of what's going on in the UK is making the U.S. and its politics that are not always so stable as well. Looking rather good at this point, explain what is going on in the UK. Okay, so what's going on in the UK is that a Prime Minister has resigned after 20 minutes, which is never a good look. For 20 minutes you can read 44-45 days, depending on how you count. And that obviously is the result of a period of some confusion over UK fiscal policy. The former Chancellor, Cossie Quartain, decided that it would be a good idea to cut taxes during an inflationary spiral. The macro-text books will tell you that's not in fact a very good idea, which he found out, unfortunately. But now we're seeing that filter through into the Prime Minister and really see her sort of bad the brunt of that on a delayed action. You know, Ed, I think the most surprising news event of the day for me after Liz Truss' resignation was the possibility that Boris Johnson might throw his hat in the ring. I have this image of Boris when he was mayor of London on that zipline with the two British flags. You know, what are the odds of him actually ziplining on the Downing Street again and taking the job? Right. I'm sorry that image is still in my mind. I'd like to apologise on the behalf of the troubled nation. I think they're relatively low. They're very high that he will stand. It's a very high chance in my mind that a lot of people will think, you know, let's get him back in. I mean, that's not something that hasn't happened. Churchill was out and back in. Heath was out and back in. So the so-called big beasts have done it before. But it does seem to me if you look at the betting houses that Rishi Sunak is leading. Which, I mean, you guys tell me that seems like a problem in its own right. Because of course, Rishi just lost the popular vote within the conservative party to Liz Trust. And if there's something about Brexit, it's democracy and populism. So I don't know if that's quite going to work. So help us understand what went so wrong so quickly for Liz Trust. Is it a case of unpopular policies? I mean, I get the whole idea of as someone who studied economics, like there's just certain policies you don't do in certain environments. Right. But is it her misread, bad advisors? What went so wrong? Because safe to say all leaders, many leaders in developed nations are in a tricky spot right now. We feel it in the United States with high inflation, right, toxic recession, you know, global central bankers continue to raise raise raise.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4958,2022-10-20 18:15:59
16613," It all leaders, many leaders in developed nations are in a tricky spot right now. We feel it in the United States with high inflation, talks of recession, global central bankers continue to raise rates. It's not popular. Well, that's a profound point. Like the outcome of populism isn't necessarily popular, but that doesn't mean that populism won't continue a pace. If indeed it might actually be pushed further because of that, because of those wobbles. What went wrong? Ideology. You don't get to decide what the bond markets think. That's the whole point of the bond markets. Right. They don't, they decide for themselves. And I know a lot of advisors in the UK system, and I know a few bond traders, they're pretty smart people. What you don't do is get up in front of everybody and say, this is how it will be. We have a 45, then 43 billion unfunded tax cut. Everything's going to be fine because my copy of Out of the Shrub told me it was going to be fine. It doesn't work like that, right? Am I wrong? No, she totally disregarded so much within the system, in the UK system, and probably warnings, and understanding what the implications were for her policies. I think it's that simple. And so, but I think there's an optimistic tone to take, which is that the systems wrenched around. So we can't do that with puting. We can't do that with Xi Jinping. Right. The system, the markets, the democracy that we have, it's turned around and it said, no, that doesn't quite work. Reality check, it's time for the next person. Right. It looks bad on the surface, and I'm not going to tell you otherwise. But, you know, and smart fiscal policies, such a linchpin of British politics. I guess politics everywhere in general. And I wonder, does this give labor sort of the upper hand enough to sort of change the balance in the next election or our attention spans? Sure enough that it shouldn't matter. You're asking me if the labor party's going to win the next election? Basically. 100%. Yes, I think we've got to the point now. In an objective opinion. Of course, that's my forecast in case. And so it swings. And so it swings. Well, look, the Tories have been in for 12 years. If a customer mines back to Thatcher, she began her supply side reforms at the very start of a political cycle. So she had time for that pain to go through the labor market and for things to adjust. Trust was, of course, at the end of a political cycle, which means that I would have thought the labor party would win whatever it was going on, regardless of whether or not the Prime Minister has been compared to a lattice on television. So yes, I think the labor party will win. I was obsessed with the lettuce. I'm just going to say it's a bit weird. Please continue. No, it's a bit weird. And maybe I'm fair to the lettuce. But I think that what's interesting is that the labor party is going to have a mess to clear up. And if I was being cynical, I would say to myself, well, maybe now is the time, if you're a conservative, to sort of wash your hands of it, say, well, let the other guy clean it up. Because this is a sort of two, three-year process at least. Well, here's our Bloomberg story. Whoever wins or loses, trust a successor to inherit a grim UK economy. Like, you can't change any of that. And there's some tough things that need to be done, correct? Again, correct. Yes, I'm not going to lie to you. So the OECD is forecasting 0% growth. Your listeners are mathematicians of finances. They'll know that 0 is a bad number. That's probably optimistic. But again, I'll go back. And of course, I would say this given my background, I think that the UK is very good at imposing shocks on itself early. It's kind of ahead of the globalization curve every time. So this does look ugly. Sterling's taken a hit, obviously, and probably, cable rate parity is something that we should talk about. But I don't look at the country and think, right, it's completely finished. I think, right, this shock that it's going through, in the manner of facture before, will result in something else. And I think I know the answer to this question, given your resume and work as a trade official guy. Does Brexit make the situation worse or better for Britain right now? So Brexit was always going to be a short term hit to GDP. Brexit was always going to take the form of a supply shock. It wasn't always apparent in my mind exactly how the policy mechanisms would respond. Because on the one side, you could say, well, look, that's going to be inflationary, because supply shocks are inflationary. So the central bank will have to hike. On the other hand, it might have been that sort of demand destruction and a recession had a different response. But it was always going to be something that was tricky. I don't think that Brexit's the only factor. Of course, we had this, we had COVID. I'm sorry to remind everyone, we had COVID. Right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4959,2022-10-20 18:20:27
16614," It was going to be something that was tricky. I don't think that Brexit's the only factor. Of course, we had this, we had COVID. I'm sorry to remind everyone we had COVID. We still have it actually. We still have it. How's on the vaccine line that I saw last night? I've already got it right now to be honest with you. Okay, I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm just going to score this man. I'm not. I'm not. Chuck this guy out, yeah. Just kidding, but it's also. Not kidding. You're not kidding. No, I'm, it's British COVID though. It's much more charming and that's right. That's right. That's right. Good to know. Good to know. But then the war in Ukraine. Indeed. Well, that's a big, huge factor. I mean, it's, you know, every day we come in here and we just think we figured out the big macro things that we're facing and then something like, of course, earlier this year, the war in Ukraine. So how do you factor that, you know, and then today it's, of course, not surprised, but to see the resignation of trust. So how do you factor Ukraine then into all of this? Well, I think that Ukraine is a sort of signal to everyone that you're not. Not necessarily safe, right? And I think it's the first time. I mean, it's like tank battles in, in Eastern Europe. I mean, that's wild. That's from seasons one and two, right? It's crazy that it's back. Right. So if my father who fought in World War II and his brothers, well, like it's like, that's what I think about. It's crazy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But I think that that's, that's number one, speaking people to some degree, speaking markets. That's part of why the dollar is so strong. I would imagine including fed hiking. But I think it's also something that it's sort of feeding into the zeitgeist in another way, which is, well, let's stress test everything. I mean, let's really think about how safe we are or are not. And I would suggest to you that maybe that's what sterling is going through. So now we've, you know, back to your point on Brexit, people are looking at sterling and thinking, well, does it really deserve to be one to one with the dollar? So if you're asking me how that affects the country, well, I would say probably not. Yeah. Probably not. I imagine that we're going to see parity. Yeah. How will that be received on the ground in Britain? You know, is that considered a disaster? Or does the old trope that, you know, weaker currency is going to help the domestic economy? Will people rally behind that? Or will they say, oh boy, we're at parity with the Americans. This is a disaster. Well, yeah, go back, I mean, go back to OECD forecast for 2023. And that zero figure, if you break it down, it looks like 0.7 positive for government consumption. It looks like 0.7 negative for loss of exports. So if you're thinking about a sort of medium term correction, if you're thinking about global Britain, if you're thinking about the reason that we did exit the European Union, or be it purportedly, the purported reason, a part of that was, you know, trading in the world and trying to get our exports back, I'm not sure that that factor, because it will be on a lag, of course, it's a supply side issue. It takes a long time to book capacity. I'm not sure that that issue is as important as the psychology of not being able to visit Fifth Avenue at Christmas. Really powerful, right? And we felt that certainly during COVID, right, when all of a sudden things that we just took were granted shut down. So as I said, you have advised, you represent the UK government, you know, representing and talking to folks on Wall Street. We've got a very smart investment audience. So what would be your takeaway or something for them to think about over the next couple of weeks as we continue to see what's playing out in the UK, and then more broadly about what's going on in Europe? Okay, well, I mean, I'll take the UK first, and of course, I would say what I'm about to say, which is don't count the UK out. This is the country that brought you 1940. Democracies look messy, but the markets and elections are for- They are messy, they're not telling you that. They are messy indeed, yes, I stand corrected indeed, they are messy. But I think it's going to be okay, medium term, and I wouldn't write the UK off, because as I said previously, we're very good at corrections. We're very good at them in ways that, you know, let's segue into Europe. I don't think that other countries are. So I think that while there's a question over the value of sterling, and that's a justified question, there's still a question mark over the existence of the Europe. And if we start to see those bond spreads widen again, which are, I imagine we will at some point, you guys again, tell me if I'm wrong. And then I think the capricious attention of markets will sort of drift away from the UK and start looking at the Euro area again. Well, right now, the spreads are about 30 basis points in the favor of the guilt market, well below treasure yields. Did they belong there? Thanks.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4960,2022-10-20 18:24:41
16615, your area again. Well right now the spreads are about 30 basis points in the favor of the guilt market well below treasurer yields. Did they belong there? Do you think? I think guilt's look healthier if I can put it like that. I mean what? The 10 years 3.9 and the 30 years 3.95. That's better. I think their reaction to to trust his resignation was met in a way. I don't think that they worried about it too much. You can't do that. I always say met. Do you? I'm doing copyright. I've broken copyright. It comes in with COVID takes my mind. I'm terrible. I'm just kidding. Now you know just got about a minute left here and I do think about you know here in the United States we look over at the UK in terms of politics and we're like oh my god it's crazy but in some ways it does feel like something's not working it's like next and let's figure it out. Is that fair is there efficiency to it? Well I think so. I mean I'm someone maybe I'm maybe I'm based. You're subjective yeah. Yes I'm totally subjective. That's okay. I'm totally biased. But I look at the UK and I think to myself well this is a wobble. This is what we would call a wobble. It's not good but wobbles end and so I would again say to you our cycles seem a bit nastier. We've gone through any number of moments in our history where it looked like it looked like game over if I'm being frank right. I think we left out the most important question. Right. You wrote it up that recently you talked about the possibility of 14 pound pites in the pub. Did I? I must have forgotten about it. Was that how you maybe someone else? Maybe someone else. 14 pound pites are you trying to you're trying to give me a heart set? On air. What are the odds of 14 pound pites in the pubs in London this year? Listen if if the pint goes to 14 pounds I will go back and stand myself with one platform and one platform only which is getting the price of a pint back down to five. And you will have people voting for that plant price. Ed Price thank you so much really a pleasure. Principal Ed Ergo I told you about his background Google and you can hear more former British trade official and so much more joining us here in our Bloomberg Interactive Broker studio. You are listening and watching Bloomberg Business Week on this Thursday Carol Maser along with Mike Regan and this is Bloomberg Radio.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4961,2022-10-20 18:29:02
16616," Between. Bloomberg 960 to the country. Syria's XM, Channel 119 and around the globe, the Bloomberg Business App and Bloomberg Radio.com. This is Bloomberg Business Week. All right, you are listening and watching Bloomberg Business Week. On this Thursday, we're talking about the markets. We're talking about a lot of different things. And of course, that resignation of the UK Prime Minister, but we're keeping a watch on inflation because a hawkish Fed is certainly putting pressure on the markets. We're going to talk about it, Mike, when it comes to healthcare specifically. Yeah, amazing how high the inflation is in the health insurance industry. My eyes sort of popped when I read these figures. So we'll have to unpack it. Yeah, absolutely. We'll share that in just a moment. Do you want to exit theallow declaration?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4962,2022-10-20 18:33:47
16617," the inflation is in the health insurance industry. First up, though, back to the markets that sell off the Bloomberg Professional Service Credit Suisse, the FX rates developing story mortatels as they become available, but again, repeating the headline Credit Suisse clear of claims it conspired to fix FX rates. The Dow, the S&P Nezdaq all lower after hawkish remarks today from Federal Reserve officials. We've got the 10 year now at 4.21% the two year, 4.59%. Choppy session, but right now, equities at the lows of the day with the S&P down 37 drop there of 1%. The Dow down 136 down by about 5.10%. Nezdaq down 93, a drop there of 9.10% of 1%. Spot gold little changed down 24 cents to 16.29, and West Texas, in immediate crude up 5.10% to 1%. 85.98 a barrel on WTI. Investors meanwhile are digesting the latest batch of earnings reports. Last night we did hear from Tesla. Tesla shares down now by 7.4%. IBM shares up 4.7%. As for the broader earnings outlook, Deborah Cunningham is chief investment officer for global money markets that federated investment management. Two thirds of the earnings that have come in for the third quarter have come in beating estimates. It's not beating by very much, but beating estimates. So there's cash on a homegrown basis to be used and to keep the market very highly liquid at this point. Transportation stocks having a tough day specifically railroads union-specific fell after cutting its forecast for volume growth to reflect quote a challenging year shares of the rail road union-specific down now by 6.5%. Also reporting earnings last night, trucking firm Night Swift Transportation. It's warning of a rapid slowdown in the freight market and Night Swift down now by 5.8%. Briefly on the railroads among the names reporting after the close of trading today, CSX shares down now by 3.2%. Recapping S&P down 30s, 2 points now, a drop there of 9 tenths of 1% to 10 year, 4.20%. I'm Charlie Palette, that is a Bloomberg business flat. Great update there from Charlie Palette. Well inflation and rising labor costs will increase US national health care spending by 370 billion in the next 5 years. According to a McKinsey report, consumer prices are rising faster than health care inflation. But general inflation has recently driven up health care supply input costs. So when thoughts on that and more with us as he is every week, Dr. Ian Lussbader, clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langoen, back with us on the phone in New York City. Ian, we love having you here. Great to have you here on this Thursday with Mike Regan and myself. How are you? Always a pleasure. Thanks guys. Hope everyone is staying healthy and well with new COVID variants out there. But it seems to be under control. But what's not under control, unfortunately, is health care inflation. We're seeing rises of over 6% a year. Health care is 20% of the GDP over $4 trillion a year. And really estimated by 2030 to be up to $6.8 trillion a year. And there were a lot of reasons, unfortunately, why we're seeing health care inflation. And we can talk about that. But certainly part of the problem is our per capita cost. You know, it's about $12,000 per person per year. Other countries like France, Canada, about half that, 5 to 6,000 a year. So the real question is, why are our costs higher than other countries? Yeah, with that guy, I would like to unpack a little bit some of the main drivers of that inflation. You know, my guess would be that there were so many health insurance claims for COVID, whether it be testing or treatment. Is that one of the big drivers of the increase in particularly health insurance costs? Yeah, there really a number of drivers. One is hospital care, which is very expensive. You know, you can just look at the bills from even an ER visit. That's about 30% of the cost. The workforce is about 40% of the health care costs. And we're really seeing wage pressure, you know, both physicians and RNs, because there's a labor shortage. A number of physicians have retired. A number of nurses.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4963,2022-10-20 18:37:34
16618, and we're really seeing wage pressure you know both physicians and rns because there's a labor shortage a number of physicians have retired a number of nurses are leaving the workforce so there's really wage pressure in that area and definitely illness things like the pandemic and aging population and unhealthy population about 40% of the u.s. is obese overweight they use a lot of resources diabetes hypertension more technology also you know we have robotic surgery and all of those are very very expensive they're high quality high tech but also very expensive so we're really seeing a combination of things and the pandemic did not help with resource utilization all of those nasal swabs that people are doing sometimes on a daily or weekly basis really add up and that's you know government money that's been printed in order to give out those kids so we've really had a number of forces that are raising prices and there are not a lot of market forces competition advertising prices to help lower that that's part of the challenge so not a new right we talk about this for a long time the cost of health care but Ian I do feel like there's expectations among Americans that I want a certain level of care when I walk in a hospital I want xyz I mean how do we change the thinking or how do we really constructively get the price of health care down you know you're exactly right Carol the we want Cadillac care and we do have amazing high tech care really the state of the art but we don't really want to pay for it and we unfortunately we will have to choose in other countries there are delays if you need hit elective hip surgery knee replacement you can't walk in if you're eighty five years old and get it the next week in the U.S. we can so I think we need to shift expectations and really say without rationing care per se can we change our expectations we certainly want high quality care but if we give high quality care to everybody all the time without any competition or cost market forces we're going to be in trouble with higher percent of our budget all right thirty seconds left I got to ask you because I want to know I'm double boosted I'm double-vaxed I've seen the line to the vaccine who should get that next booster just quickly and when yeah yeah the by-valent which is the before and five are it's important to get certainly if you have chronic medical issues or if you're older above 65 it makes sense it is available for everyone young and old but certainly the the target audience should be people with underlying medical problems there are a couple of new variants out there too which may be a bigger problem yeah don't really know how effective the new vaccine is for those but probably will help certainly if you have medical issues it makes sense to get it how how long do you wait after you've had covid yes I'm asking you doctor less better for me just quickly I you're anabody and he sells are good for at least three to four months so I would not rush to get the vaccine if you had covid within the last few months there's really no data on that your your antibody should be fine for at least three months thank you so much as always and smart to talk about inflation and health care because it's certainly something that's very persistent doctor Ian Lossbater over at NYU Landgon Medical Center off to roll the national news and Nancy Lions hey nants thanks Carol president bygnazine Pennsylvania promoting the bipartisan infrastructure law that has helped repair a Pittsburgh bridge that collapsed earlier this year Pittsburgh is a city of bridges but too many of them are in poor condition like this bridge behind me before collapsed with the bipartisan infrastructure law we're doing something about it this is just one of 2400 bridges across the country they're being repaired just this year because of this law from Pittsburgh Biden is traveling to Philadelphia to stump for John Federman who is in a tight Senate race with Dr. Mement Oz Florida is still working on recovering from the damage from Hurricane Ian and today Governor Ron DeSantis announced that a special session of the Florida legislature will be held to consider providing property tax relief for people and businesses whose property was destroyed he's also extending the deadline for those residents to pay their property taxes more political upheaval in the UK today with British Prime Minister Liz trust resigning 45,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4964,2022-10-20 18:41:53

He's in for Tim Stenevich here on Bloomberg Business Week on this Thursday, Tim is on assignment. So we've got a great guest coming up in just a moment. Great check on the retail on supplied chains. We're going to check in once again with Joe Preston, president and CEO at new balance. In the meantime, just thinking about prep for that, a story came to our attention, Mike. And it has to do with Adidas, Adidas, however you'd like to say it. If you're Matt Miller, you say Adidas. Adidas, I still say Adidas. Adidas. Do you say Nike or Nike? Are you kidding? Is that a thing? Well, what's fun? What's the right thing? I say Nike. I just say Porsche too. All right. Adidas Ward, Adidas. Warning that unsold goods are piling up as consumer demand is weakening across China and Western markets, prompting a fresh profit warning from the sneaker maker. This certainly caught our attention. Yeah, absolutely. And actually, you know, the latest in some troubling news for Adidas. Remember, they are on cold ice with Mr. Kanye West, when his sneaker brand called Yeezy, put that under review him, a mid-growing acrimony and erratic behavior from the hip-hop icon and designer. I wonder if any of Kanye's shoes are among the unsold sneakers piling up. I doubt it. I think they sell pretty quick. I was going to say, and they're pretty expensive, right? And you know, these brands, these kind of iconic brands, or brands that have been around, they often partner up with a designer or celebrity, and it often is a great driver of revenue for the company. You're right, right. But it really seems like the, their problems are running into now are centered in greater China, just a slow down there, given, you know, a weak currency, and still all those COVID lockdowns, I guess, people just aren't wearing out their sneakers like they once did. Yeah, I feel like all those macro issues, right, whether it's COVID over in China, just the global inflationary picture. We are seeing that certainly impact as companies are reporting their earnings. Adidas now expecting an operating margin of 4% this fiscal year. That's down from a prior forecast of 7%. So that's a pretty big haircut.

There's no question because there are just so many different things that are being thrown at any company out there for the past two and a half years. And I think for us the biggest challenge is balancing the momentum that we have, which we're seeing here in the US and around the globe, with those macro economic trends, because we don't want to miss the run that we feel like we're on right now. And the brand is resonating with a younger consumer like never before. We've just had our strongest back to school in our history. And we can see from who's buying on newbalance.com, the age, the demographics that are coming into the brand for the first time. And then we're in close contact with our customers, our trade partners, and they're telling us the same thing. So with that being said, we also know that interest rate heights in the inflationary pressures and all of that, and the supply chain still is particularly from a logistics standpoint, is still struggling. And so we're trying to balance all of those pieces together. Which I wanted to ask you about those supply chains. I think new balance is somewhat unique in that you have some big factories here in the US in Massachusetts and Maine. Does that make dealing with these supply chain issues easier or harder when you have your actual factories in the US? Well, I mean, they're challenging throughout the past couple of years. There's no question about it. But yes, we have five factories in the US with the only athletic brand that has a presence here in the US. We also have a factory in the UK. And again, the only athletic brand to have a factory over there. And it's a limited portion of our overall revenue and pairs, but it's an important piece of our business. We think it helps our quality scores. And it just allows us to be a better partner with our contract manufacturers because of the fact that we're making shoes and we know the processes. And then we can pass along those tips to them as well. Is it more expensive though? Like I always think about, I love talking about anybody who's manufacturing in the United States because we're all trying to, we're talking about more companies doing it. Is it more expensive? Well, the labor is definitely more expensive. The cost of the materials are the cost of the materials. So it really resides in labor. If you look at it strictly from a P&L standpoint, you could make one decision. But there's also getting closer to the consumer. There's also the fact that you can run your inventory's leaner because you're not relying on a supply line that's halfway around the globe. Right. And with the factoring time to try, you know, write ship it and so on and so forth. Exactly. And then the, you know, the cost of capital is rising as well, which makes all of the contract manufacturing a little bit more expensive because you're financing at some point. You know, John, I have to tell you so I come from Philadelphia and in 2019, I had my heart absolutely broken by a man named Clyde Leonard of the Toronto Raptors. He hit what's been known as the shot to knock my sixers out of the Eastern coast finals. If you can't tell him still a little sore about that. But I know new balance here, new balance is famous for its running shoes mostly, but you are in the basketball market now with a Clyde, Clyde Leonard shoe. I'm guessing it's not so great in Philadelphia. I gotta say, but, but how's it to and nationally and how's the basketball business for you? Is that, is that an area of growth, do you think? Well, I think first of all, I guess what is the expression? I'm sorry. I'm not sorry. But yeah, we re entered basketball. Actually, we were the first brand to endorse a NBA play with a million dollar contract. It was James Worthy back in the day. That's right. I remember that. Yeah, so then a number of things transpired. We got out of the endorsement element of it. And then we got into baseball about 10 years ago. And today about 25% of major league players wear new balance. And then that led us to getting into global football or soccer. And we have two of the top five players in the world in Saudi Amane and Rahim Sterling, wearing a product. And then we got into basketball with with Kauai Leonard being the the brand ambassador. Every time I hear his name, I, it's been really good. I mean, that moves the needle. Those collaborations are having that the sports, the professional sports aspect of it. There's no question. You know, young younger athletes are looking to what they're what is being worn at the major league level, whether it's baseball or football or basketball. And so I definitely think that's that's helped us. I just want to say just a follow. I mean, I have a teenage daughter.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4967,2022-10-20 18:54:58
16622," or at the major league level, whether it's baseball or football or basketball. And so I definitely think that's helped us. I just want to say just a follow. I mean, I have a teenage daughter in college now, but I mean, sneakers are like a consumer staple for her. And numerous kinds like that's her footwear. And you talked about the growth in the younger audience. Is it those collaborations with athletes? Or what is it that you think is all of a sudden getting a younger generation which you know can switch in a dime in terms of their preferences? Why do you think they're attracted to the new balance brand? Well, I think it's the brand. I think the brand efforts that a marketing team has been doing have just been excellent. But you can't just market. You have to have products. So we have multiple new products that we've been introducing that have been resonating. We have been using collaborations with athletes and entertainers that have provided energy. There's no question about that. That combination as well as the other things that we've done to attract the consumer and then make it a more seamless consumer experience when they come onto our website or come through our stores. We also know that is part of why we are successful today. Joe, obviously here at Bloomberg we are laser focused on Wall Street. And obviously new balance is a private company. But I have to wonder how often some banker shows up at your doorstep, you know, the flashy suit and new balance sneakers on and tries to get you to go public or has an M&A offer for you. You've got a common experience for you and what do you tell them when they show up? Well, over time it's obviously been pretty common. But the company's owned by the Davis family and it's Jim bought the company in 1972. It's initially founded in 1906. It's had three owners since then. And Jim just celebrated, Jim and Andrew celebrated 50 years with the company and that absolutely no plans. No plans. Well, as someone who works, the two of us working at a privately held company, you understand kind of the perks and the positives of being privately held. What does that allow you guys to do? We've just got about 40 seconds left. Well, it allows you to take a longer view. And I think domestic manufacturing is a perfect example. We've seen public companies in our space come in, make statements that they're going to make product here and pre-quarters later they're trying to explain it to an analyst and suddenly it quietly goes away. When you're private you can take a longer view. One last question, 30 seconds, if you had to describe the environment for the next six to 12 months, what's one or two words that you would use to describe it or three words? Uncertain. I think that is definitely one that you have to keep in mind and for us it's balance. It's both balancing the momentum that we have with the macroeconomic headwinds that are out there. You're using that because your brand is new balance. That's what's going on here. That's the most fun. What a pleasure. It's so nice to have you in studio, be well and we look forward to you coming back real soon. Joe Preston, his president and chief executive officer of new balance joining us here in our interactive broker studio. Come on up in just a few minutes. We join our TV colleagues for a look at the market stocks hovering near their lows of the session on a spike in yields once again.

16623," You Come down to the clubs, Bloomberg's comprehensive cross-platform coverage ahead of the U.S. market closed starts right now. and we're still under water by 7 10% on the S&P car. Yeah, real slog for equities. As you said, though, Caroline, coming off our worst levels of the session. Some outperformance though we are seeing once again in the semiconductor area. We've got the socks up about three quarters of a percent was up almost 4% earlier in the session, but off those highs, the real reason why they'll land research, first quarter beat, and a reset on expectations on the record. We're still under water by 710% on the S&P car. Yeah, real slog for equities. As you said, Caroline, coming off our worst levels of the session. Some outperformance though we are seeing again in the next session. We're still under water by 710% on expectations. A lot of analysts weighing in saying that forecast as a necessary resetting of expectations for the semi industry. Because we know there has been so much negative news out there. Land research right now, Mike, is up more than 7%. Ray Carol, and speaking of negative news, obviously another down day on the market. If that seems familiar, it should actually it's a stat courtesy of LPL financial. There's only been updates 43.5% of the days this year. That is actually the lowest percentage since the last year. The next year, the next year, the market is 10% of the rebound. Usually somewhere in the range of 15%, 17%. I mean, it feels like there's 43% of days, swiftly followed by an up day. I mean, we never seem to have any consistent days of trade at the moment. Another moment where we are off by 710% having been higher in the earlier in the training session. We're now off by 26 points on the S&P 500. We're off by 68 points. We're looking at the down. The Nasdaq is off by 63 points. That's 6.10% lower. Only means to stop ever so slightly about 6% on the day for the down. From the Nasdaq, I mean, I'm not just 2,000 once again in the Ivo storm. It's underperforming off by 1.2%. We are marginally seeing some improvement on sector levels. We are now within one hour to that closing bell. Instead of communication services being the only sector in the green. There's a few weather. There's energy and technology. Of course, as we keep our eyes on some of the big quarterly results. Snap, of course, we'll get today and some of the bigger guys next week as well. On an individual basis, though, I really sort of went negative here. I wanted to start with the airlines. Carol, I start thought of you when I did this. She got some decent results from American and Alaska. But a little bit of a roll over here when you think about some of the profitability and how we're thinking about these individual numbers. All state came out with them. Stay to that group has had such a run tail. You know that she followed those trend lines. I mean, they were up for like six days in a row. So yeah, you can see why there is a change in discrimination, also because workers are pale, especially women's Change and it think it's a shift in their positions. The measure, legs, legs. simple y rykses. No one would say the position just Revolutionary acceptor violation. If you changed your number, the numbers will",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4969,2022-10-20 19:04:18
16624," Allstate came out with them. Stayed to that group has had such a run tail. You know that she followed those trend lines. I mean, they were up for like six days in a row. So yeah, you can see why there might be some disappointment. Yeah, a little bit of a breather there. All states also thinking about disappointments. Carol, when you think about they pre-announced and really looking at and expected adjusted in that loss now with about 400 to 450 million dollars. And quickly, of course, L.I. financial, you're only off Caroline, one half of 1%. But we were talking earlier. If this is a company that's starting to see cracks within the auto market, you now have autos and housing under pressure. And these higher rates are impacting some of these sectors now. That's really smart to point out. What's also been a volatile day of trade for equities? Ain't nothing when you're looking volatility in the FX space. And I bring this chart for a radio audience. I'm just going to explain it because the pound volatility has been rising. It's the white line at the bottom has been creeping higher. We talk again once again of UK instability over changing of the garden prime ministers, the shortest 10-year prime minister ever. And then we actually see it basically in line with crypto volatility. Bitcoin volatility has been falling. But now down to the Heideheight, so basically where the FX volatility is out for the pound at the moment, Carol. I love that chart, right? The volatility. And I was thinking about Caroline and Taylor. How much is facing investors at this point so much to take in. And Chennai Basak cut up with John Gray, who's Blackstone Group president and CEO earlier. They own a portfolio of companies. So they get to see a lot of things about what's going on. And I think bottom line, it's just more nervousness among those who are running some of their portfolio companies. Here's what he had to say. If you talk to our companies, they are becoming more cautious. Their CAPEX plans are being lowered. Their hiring plans are slowing. And so we see this happening with the lag. I was talking this week with a developer of apartments who's building this year, 15,000 units across the US major developer. And he said next year he's cut his plans by 75%. Yeah, so interesting to see nervousness among some of the heads of their portfolio companies. Of course, John Gray, Blackstone Group president and CEO. He did say, though, he thought that maybe we're getting close to inflation peaking at least. We'll see what happens. He spoke pretty eloquently as well, Carol, about the UK, saying about the great attributes that the UK does indeed have, and the large transparency, the liquidity, and other great attributes that the UK has, is one guy, Johnson, who stands by waiting to talk to us about what is, of course, the top story in game of play today, the UK Prime Minister is trust resigning from office. Just talk to us, Guy Johnson, staying late once again, host of Blue Moon markets, the close over in Europe. What are you making of this narrative, the way in which we now look to a new leader? Does the pound fading mean anything for you, do you think? Not really. I think what is interesting here, Caroline, is that we've seen over the last couple of days, since the appointments of Jeremy Hunt, a separation of the political pantomime that is taking place at Westminster, and what is happening in the city of London, and what is happening with the financial markets. So there's been a certain level of stability that has been reached. I think the markets are watching what is happening cautiously. They're at the moment prepared, not really, to react very much to it. In theory, we might have a new Prime Minister by next Monday. At the latest, we will have a new Prime Minister by next Friday. I think the arrival of Boris Johnson on the scene has shaken things up a little bit, but nevertheless, the growing expectation is that it will be either Rishi Sunak, who is probably going to be greeted fairly well by the city of London, or Penny Warden II is the leader of the House. Be one of those two candidates going forward here. But the critical thing is that Jeremy Hunt will likely stay as Chancellor, and as a result of which, the city of London financial markets are taking maybe a slightly more relaxed approach here. So Guy, once we'll eventually know who takes over as Prime Minister, but as a result, whoever gets into that spot, they're inheriting a grim UK economy. I mean, there's a lot facing them right out of the gate. Absolutely, Carol. The UK economy is slowing down fairly rapidly here, and we've also got super high inflation. We've got an inflation read this week. It is at 10%. The UK consumer is being squeezed from a number of different angles. You've got the energy story on the one hand. You've got rising mortgage rates on the other. You've got a slowing economy that is pretty pressure on everything. So yeah, it's a really tough mandate that...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4970,2022-10-20 19:08:01
16625," The one hand you've got rising mortgage rates on the other, you've got a slowing economy that is pretty pressure on everything. So yeah, it's a really tough mandate that the next Prime Minister is going to inherit and they are definitely going to have to hit the ground running. They are going to need basically to not put a step wrong. They need to continue to keep the financial markets on side. We've seen what happens when the financial markets are not on side and I think everybody in the UK has learned that lesson very, very quickly. So it's going to be a really tough challenge, a really difficult story to navigate going forward for whoever does become that next Prime Minister. Yeah, investors not bashful about just saying how they feel. That's for sure. Guy Johnson, thank you so much. Long day for you and some great coverage in terms of the political instability, if you will, and nervousness in the financial markets. Our Guy Johnson there over in London. All right, that's a wrap. We're going to be back on radio and TV and YouTube. Our cross-platform coverage beyond the bell. We're going to count you down to the close on this very busy Thursday. We'll be back at 4pm Wall Street Time. You're listening to Bloomberg Business Week with Carol Maser and Bloomberg Quick Takes Tim Stenevig on Bloomberg Radio. All right, yes and deed. We're going to rejoin our TV colleagues in less than an hour's time to wrap up that Thursday trade. In the meantime, Carol Maser, along with Mike Regan, Tim Stenevig, is on assignment on this Thursday. We do have equity markets. Mike, you know, once again, it's a trade we've seen. We've seen strength. We've seen a pullback. We've seen rounding off the bottom. And here we are with what about 40 minutes to go here. What is the old expression if you don't like the weather in Chicago, stick around a little change? Well, and I do wonder, you've watched a lot of market cycles. To me, I've seen a lot of market cycles. I'm not about to call a bottom at this point, but I do feel like when you have incredible swings and reactions in the market, it does feel like investors are trying to, you know, such out where the low is. Yeah, yeah. And, you know, it's just been such a strange year. There's very little you can go back to in history as a comparison and use this sort of your playbook, you know, it's just... You don't remember coming out of a pandemic before? With 8% inflation. No. A major war going in Russia. You know, yeah, not in my lifetime. I'm old. I'm not that old. No, exactly. And there was some great stuff. I keep repeating this on surveillance yesterday morning about just this whole idea of that what will be kind of the real rate when it comes to the Fed going forward? Can we really think 2% as it or is it more like a 4% to 5% and a guest on surveillance is talking about these massive changes we are doing and the impact of climate change push back on, you know, globalization and also demographics and aging population. These things have costs. That de-globalization, I think, is a very underappreciated element of all this for sure. Right? Right? All right, we're going to continue the conversation, Mike and myself right now, though. We're going to hand it over to Nancy Lyons. She's in DC with World and National News. Hey, Nance. Thanks, Carol. The political landscape, as you've been discussing, is changing once again in Britain. Liz Truss is stepping down as British Prime Minister after her government collapsed in the wake of a budget plan that included unfunded tax cuts. Bloomberg's David Merritt says her departure is not a surprise. It's been clear to most observers actually for some time since that economic blowup of her first budget, her big attempt to remake the British economy a couple of weeks ago now that her position was going to become untenable. She sat the Chancellor and blamed him quasi-quarting, but the market's lost confidence in her vision. Again, Bloomberg's David Merritt. Sir Graham Brady is the chair of the Committee determining next steps. He says a new leader will be selected next week. It will be possible to conduct a ballot and conclude a leadership election by Friday the 28th of October. Brady says nominations will close on Monday. Ukrainians are being warned of rolling blackouts because of damage to the country's power grid from Russian missile attacks. President Volodymyr Zelensky is urging residents to conserve energy when possible. The former US ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor says Vladimir Putin's bombing campaign is the only thing he's capable of doing right now. He's losing on the battlefield.

Nancy Lyons and her 991 newsroom in Washington, DC, Carol Master, along with Mike Regan. Here in our interactive broker studio streaming on YouTube. I hate doing taxes. I'm just going to put it out though. Even though I get an assist, it's like just the prep work. My wife fired me as our tax accountant after too many hours. You're done? Yeah, even with turbo tax. Did she do it then? No, we hire a guy. Yeah. But even like all the prep that you have to do, it's just call the documents. And when you have two states going on, I live in New Jersey working New York. It gets complicated. Right, the crisscross. All right, so the IRS, we've got a story by our Paulina Cichero add on the Bloomberg and Bloomberg.com. The IRS has raised tax brackets and the standard deduction by about 7% for 2023 as a so-and-cost of food, energy, and housing continues to batter Americans. So what does that mean? I think it's the one positive about inflation that we've heard so far. The IRS, obviously, as the story says, adjusts the tax code annually. And the goal is to shield the money. I know I do that they did that. Yeah, yeah. Well, I don't think it ever usually goes up as dramatically as it does because of this inflationary environment where social security payments are going up. That I get. I guess if you have to look at us overlining in this environment, there you go. All right, so it is apparently the 7% increase. The largest increase to the standard deduction since the tax system was first indexed to inflation back in 1985. Will reduce the amount of income subject to taxes for most people. And as Mike was saying, they IRS, suggesting the tax code annually to shield Americans from paying higher taxes as rising prices, erode the value of the dollar changes have been, as he said, fairly incremental the last few years. But that decade's high inflation prompting an unusually big tweak for 2023, according to the folks that our team talked to. Yeah, and the standard deduction goes up. It rise to 13,850 for single filers and $27,700 for couples filing jointly. So, er, so reason to be happy about paying taxes. Yeah, but I'll still pry mess up the taxes. Hopefully my account will be fine. To my ex-wife, I totally get it. Totally get it. All right. You're listening and watching Bloomberg Business Week on this Thursday.

I'm going to go in 43 minutes to go ahead of the closing bell with the Dow, the S&P, Nezdak, all in the rev. We're on the minus side right now. Let's find out what's happening as we head over to the first word breaking news desk for today's afternoon call. Here he is, Bailey Lipschultz. And good afternoon, Charlie. As you said, stocks are trading lower amid fears over further rate hikes from central bakes. The Dow is down 40 points, S&P lower by 20 with an Azac falling 55 points. The US 10 year yield is at 4.22 percent and small caps are down 15. Eight of the 11 main S&P sectors are trading lower with utilities and industrials providing the biggest drag while communication services, energy and tech are trading higher. Nasak Browtex fall 20 points, transports sink 260. Semis are higher by 1 percent. Wallyvix is down 1.3 percent. Leaders in the Dow, IBM, Salesforce and Verizon, while Home Depot, Travelers and Caterpillar are the worst performers.

All right, Charlie Pellet, thank you so much. I got to say, I was certainly glued to the Bloomberg this morning listening on my phone as I was commuting in as we covered the UK Prime Minister. This trust quitting 44 days, that was it, and a very brief and chaotic 44 days it's been. That's our announcing massive package of tax cuts before unwinding most of it in the face of a market route. Well, I got to say, he was on with our surveillance team with us earlier today. Great to have him back on air, former UK monetary policy if-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4973,2022-10-20 19:21:06
16628," of it in the face of a market route. Well, I got to say he was on with our surveillance team with us earlier today. Great to have him back on air. Former UK monetary policy official Danny Blanche flower, a British American labor economist, Professor of Economics at Dartmouth, college great insight. And if you were following his work in writings, you wouldn't be surprised by what happened earlier today out of the UK. Danny joins us via UK in Hanover, New Hampshire. Danny, how are you? I'm very good. Good to talk to my friend Carol. Well, it's how I wanted today. Oh my. I'm on Bloomberg today. Oh my goodness. First time on at six o'clock where we said, I don't think she can last the day. And then eight, twenty Bloomberg calls me and goes, Danny goes back to the cap. We're about to put the announcement. Entirely expected, though, Carol. I think entirely expected from the moment they did is at the mini budget. I think the economics have driven everything. And then the politics collapsed around it. But eminently predictable, disastrous. And obviously it's put the UK in a very, very bad position now, an advanced country that just looks like it's lost the plot. You know, Danny, as the conservatives look for a new Prime Minister, how important is sort of market savvy, economic savvy going to be in that decision? Is that going to be their top priority, do you think, after this fiasco? Well, I think there's two parts to it. Clearly the priority is you have to ditch all of that stuff. And you have to sit there and try and calm nerves. But with the understanding that the risk premium on UK assets has risen, and I suspect it's risen, whether it's permanently or not we'll see. So that's going to be really important. And the second one is that the people are going to be really important in all of this, because we're looking potentially at big spending cuts as people have had pro big rises in the mortgage cost, big rises in their energy bills. And in the end, I think the people cannot be ignored. If you look back to what happened in Margaret Fatcher, essentially Fatcher was pushed out because the people have. Oh, a little bit of freezing there on Zoom. We're hoping to get Danny back. We're talking with Danny Blancheflower, Professor of Economics at Dartmouth College, of course, former UK monetary policy official. But I know my team is working on it. So we'll see if we can get Danny back in just a moment. But I'm thinking about what Danny's saying in that, the tough environment we talked about it with our earlier guest as well, in terms of popularism. And what people need right now, I mean, doing policy in an inflationary environment, slowing economy, this is not easy, Mike. Right. And like I was saying before, Carol, there's really no playbook for any policy maker or investor in this environment. So some people may be a little bit more forgiving of Liz Trust's mistakes than Danny. I don't know. But it's certainly quite a mess. And really, with that winter coming in Europe, you really have to start to get concerned about what the costs are going to be, the heat homes across Britain and Europe. And what is in store for all those countries in the next few months? Yeah. At Price, over at Ergo, talking about this earlier, like you've got to put this against the backdrop of what's going on in Europe, specifically. And so you think about people saying that they're hoping for a warm winter over in Europe because of concerns about energy access and energy costs in particular. So that is certainly something that we've got. All right, we want to get back to Danny Blanche flower. Professor of Economics at Dartmouth. And as we said, former UK monetary policy, so glad we got you back. Technology keeps us on their feet. I didn't drop you. I blame you. You did. I'm sorry. All right, so pick it up. So in terms of what's going on and what we need to know and where we go from here. Well, so what we saw was a budget that did not make any sense. It was going to have an amount of borrowing that simply looked too big for the markets. It was not costed. And the chancellor made a set of schoolboy errors. So what you had to see was the bank being had to step in on the Monday and rescue UK pension fund as it were basically going bust because they had to essentially have a fire sale to get assets. On the Tuesday, the mortgage markets basically.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4974,2022-10-20 19:25:24
16629," fire sell to get assets on the Tuesday the mortgage markets basically couldn't price things but and then the economic then the political chaos comes as Essentially that it was clear that that that budget didn't have any support at all So the politics have now got itself to a point where once again we see a prime minister Resigning how are they going to decide who's going to be the prime minister? And so well maybe 350 MPs are going to sort of wiggle it around and try and sort it out amongst themselves But maybe if there's two candidates then we'll allow the same 81,000 people who voted before for this trust who is such a disaster I mean the end you have to say Does this government have a mandate and the answer has to be no? I mean think back Reagan and that should did things they did you know all sorts of stuff at the end in the end Whether you agree with it or whether you didn't they went to the election they want an electoral majority and that's what Democracy's about so democracy's under threat and the markets are under threat because of this all right hang on Danny We're going to come back. We're going to continue with Danny Blanche flower professor of economics every Dartmouth And as we've said former UK monetary policy officially we're going to come back with him just a moment right here on Bluebird Business Week",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4975,2022-10-20 19:29:53

16631," Don't want to forget snapping down now by two tenths of 1%. I'm Charlie Pellet. That is a Bloomberg business flash Right snap coming out with earnings a little bit later on all right Charlie. Thank you so much Let's get right back to Danny Blanche flower former UK monetary policy official He's a professor of economics at Dartmouth College Check out his writings if you aren't already because it really gives you some insight into what's coming Danny still with us via zoom in Hanover new ham sure hey, so Danny you have written you wrote over the summer I'm just looking to make sure I got the day. I think it was back in July you talked about how Liz was not an economist and that would be pretty Significant you also in early September wrote the likelihood of a depression on a scale not seen since the 1930s is Very high act now you are very sensitive to what's going on with a lot of people in the UK And I would say globally in terms of those that are just having trouble Getting by paying their bills and making a go of it in this environment Talk to us if we don't get it right here what it means for the UK and maybe more you know as well globally Yeah, yeah, I mean since I've written that car. I have a sense relevant to the United States I thought that these policies were going to be disastrous and I thought the bond markets and the stock market and the foreign Exchange markets would respond and at one point a month or so I said short the pound But I think what I what a couple of things I want to say I think but it surprised me Was actually the sheer speed of this and the conclusion I kind of draw from it is perhaps these economies right now including the US economy It's more fragile than I thought and I know that the Fed and the Treasury are concerned about that thinking What does this kind of knife edge problem our market sitting at a knife edge and can be easily knocked off? I mean, I know Janet Yellen apparently was not not happy with Quasar Quarting at the IMF meetings so I think that's the first thing but again, I think people lose the discussion About what's going to happen to ordinary people in Britain I like talking Britain about the war I called it the woman on the myelin road only bus and the myelin roads east end of London It's got brick lane and pedicote lane markets in it, but why it's so relevant dates from 1100 But it's called the myelin road because it's one mile from the city of London and the question is what do the bankers do in the city? What a blumbox headquarters are so but the question is what happens to ordinary people and what you're seeing in the UK is that ordinary people are struggling that they've never struggled before They can't pay their energy bills and their fate. I mean there's one and a half million people I think it's about 200,000 a month whose mortgages are coming off fixed fixed rates so they're going from three to six in a day And so this the problem what happens to the real person and to poor people is something we must not ignore They are really struggling and then when the government says we're going to put another 20 million 20 billion pounds of public spending cuts This is about real people and it's probably going to have to go to the national health service and just say it to people for the understanding There are six million people today in Britain waiting for surgery So we mustn't forget that what happens in war streak what happens in the city of London in Canary wolf There's another group out there which is the people and I think the problem we have here that the UK has is that Sometimes pretty soon the people are going to speak and I think we have to be mindful of that And what's happened is that they have there are a bit severe consequences to them to that and we've seen that the so-called Trust premium and in fact some commentators have called this the moron premium and there's something to that So I think we just have to be mindful that if you do stupid stuff and I warned in these columns that are said Markets don't like clueless amateurs doing stupid stuff and that's what we've seen So I think we really have to be mindful that the politics and the economics and the well-being of the ordinary person I kind of linked in together and we have to worry about that in the US and the issue here is Does the Fed go too far, raise rates too much and crash the economy and that's still on the table That moron premium I think that's what the car salesman say when I come to buy a car Is that rough? But they sell you the limit at the back of the way But but Danny I'd love to do a hypothetical and let's pretend I had the power to promote you to head of the bank of England Oh god, two questions. When do you take the job or do you run in the other direction as fast as you can? And let's say",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4977,2022-10-20 19:38:31
16632, one do you take the job or do you run in the other direction as fast as you can and let's say what's your priority right now well i i mean you know that obviously that it's a poison chalice joe uh... i mean you know here's the poison chalice second prize you get to them right i think it's i think it's i think the governor of the bank of him has not performed well i think what we have it's actually pretty interesting have a committee of nine people we've not heard from eight of them and what's happened is trusses that has not absolutely threatened the independence of the bank and and when you have an intervention for the i met which says the criticizes the government because it doing one thing and it's forcing the bank of England to work against it i think it's a very difficult environment and i was taken by marty carney who basically diplomatically said uh... you don't want to be here and i sort of start myself if carney was there i don't think it would have been it you know i'm gonna i'm gonna stay away from the poison chalice that's very much uh... just got thirty seconds here i think about the investment audience here that are listening to any what do they need to know and just quickly if you could but it's is here i mean that this is that it seems to me that the other thing it says is that there are mistakes and i think you would be we're just you're just talking about market's moving because of bullish talk from fed governors based on guessing so they're literally in a guessing game they're saying things where they hoping and things crossed economics right that markets will respond in the will not be a crash but they have no basis for belief or actually showing that it's not going to happen so i think you have to be very much like what it reminds me of is almost exactly what the same people i've bulleted others were saying in september or eight you look back and they were saying exactly the same thing the u.s. had been in recession for nine months and we should do all of this stuff so we could history grind but sometimes repeats be careful i'm going to start a t-shirt company because i'm going to print up t-shirts with moron premium poison chalice job and fingers crossed oh no oh no you're going to get one with eleven you're going to get money up every t-shirt that's printed dandy thank you so much i know busy day and you've been really generous to all of us at bloomberg as we try to make sense of what's going on over in the u.k.b.w.l. of course dandy blanche flower professor of economics at Dartmouth joining us via zoom from handover all right back to roll the national news lots going on as you know nancy lions and dc all over it hate ants thanks carol it is the story of the day list trust now holds the distinction of being the shortest ruling prime minister in british history she resigned today after her tax cut plan back fired given the situation i cannot deliver the mandate on which i was elected by the conservative party trust has been prime minister for just 45 days anger in her party had intensified in the last 24 hours after trust fired home secretary suele braverman and then a parliamentary a parliament vote descended into chaos president by missing results of the bipartisan infrastructure bill today he returned to the firm hollow bridge outside pitzburg that collapse back on january twenty-eighth when biden was heading to pitzburg to speak bloomberg's earth chatman reports president said the infrastructure bill is paying for twenty four hundred such bridge projects in this year alone pennsyman he's been able to repair fern hollow bridge in less than a year total project cost twenty five million dollars fully paid for by the federal government some modern bridge of the twenty-first century four lanes for vehicle traffic a path for cyclist and pedestrians president cited infrastructure projects nationwide from water pipes abroad band to roads and railroads then he headed to philadelphia for a fundraiser for senate candidate john feterman in washington her chairman bloomberg radio researcher say gas stoves in california homes are leaking cancer causing benzene though they say more study is needed to determine how many homes have leaks global news twenty four hours a day on air and on bloomberg quicktake powered by more than twenty seven hundred journalist and analyst and more than one hundred and twenty countries i'm nancy lines all right now thank you so much care master along with mike reagan live in our bloomberg interactive broker studio check us out on youtube we're streaming there right now to send my co host he will be back on monday uh... in the meantime a story about our tom meloney and shri nard arjan uh... definitely catching attention and being read,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4978,2022-10-20 19:42:53

This has to do with former star bankers at Goldman Sachs reuniting and backed by Del's billions. I love that headline, mate. That's right. And now, combining the firms to lead after exit, Trots Merchant Bank, we're talking about Byron Trot and Greg Lemcow. Yeah, by Byron Trot and Greg Lemcow. Yeah, so a really big sort of, I guess, happy reunion among the Goldman alum. Yeah, they climbed the ranks within Goldman, sending to the top of its prestigious investment bank. I know we've had Greg definitely on this show and on air. As you said, they're combining the firms that they led after exiting Goldman. So Trots Merchant Bank, BD&T, is merging with Michael Del's MSD partners, which Greg Lemcow joined last year as Chief Executive Officer. It's expected this transaction to close early next year, and we'll create a firm overseen by Trot and Lemcow as co-CEO's according to a statement that was put out in out Del, who has a net worth estimated by the Bloomberg billionaires index of more than 43 billion will be chairman of the advisory board, fascinating. Yeah, right. And these guys are not exactly light weights. These two firms combined, they've invested more than 50 billion since 2010. BDT specializes in advisory services for high net worth families in MSD. They invested in private firms, while also making credit real estate and growth equity investments. So pretty diversified portfolio there. So the letter that has been made and put out public, Trot saying these, or those three asset classes are, quote, areas that many of you have told us are important to you. MSD specialist expertise and technology will also expand both our advisory and investment competencies, which we believe will benefit our core BDT funds. I mean, this is money out there, lots of firms going after it and looking to do deals.

Farm Bloomberg World, hand quarter, Simon Charlie, Pellet stocks are lower across the board on track to close at session lows. 13 minutes to go ahead of the closing bell with the S&P now down by 28 points.

The following is an editorial from Bloomberg opinion. This editorial was written by the Bloomberg editorial board. With its ground war in Ukraine faltering, Russia has intensified its use of unmanned drones to attack Ukraine's critical infrastructure and signaled a willingness to conduct similar strikes against the West. Last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested that any critically important object of transport, energy, or utilities infrastructure, regardless of location, could be fair game. In the face of such threats, US and European leaders should ramp up efforts to protect critical infrastructure and make clear that any deliberate acts of sabotage will bring an equally punishing response. Russia's threats against critical infrastructure represent a dangerous escalation, swift and coordinated action to strengthen the West's defenses is the best response.

16635, uh... i'm going to challenge the premise of the question a little bit i'm not sure that i want to play defense right now you've already had a big market sell-off as you say the most of the defense sectors are expensive so you i think you want to avoid the the the expensive defensive uh... uh... utilities would fit the bill there were saying a lot of inflow's it uh... ETF inflows into the utility sector valuations look fairly rich to us that's not where i would be hiding if you really need to be defensive i think health care is probably your best bet uh... you get good solid growth and uh... good defense of this good dividend yields out of pharmaceutical companies you don't have to pay a lot for them so that's the one to set a defensive sector i like but otherwise incrementally at the margin i'd be looking to play more offense uh... by buying uh... things that are beaten up uh... both uh... cyclical stocks in the u.s. and some of the uh... the european uh... names that are now looking very cheap uh... relative to history you know i do we've seen the beginning of earnings season here uh... kind of a mixed bag uh... you know some good news bad news uh... everyone i've talked to sort of racing for uh... a nasty revision to estimates uh... in this quarter for the rest of the year and and twenty twenty three how are you thinking about that uh... is that priced in already for the most part or is there more sort of pain to come in the market because of it i think it's the most over discussed topic in the market actually i think uh... if i if i had a dollar for every strategy strategist i've heard say hey two hundred forty on the s and t's twenty twenty three numbers not right the real numbers two hundred if i had a dollar for every time i heard that i probably have two hundred dollars and uh... everyone knows the numbers two hundred or maybe it's one ninety or two ten but uh... we all know earnings have to be cut uh... anyone who doesn't have been paying attention and the market forward looking so some of that maybe all of that is already in the price and i think you have to look through that and ask yourself what is the underlying earnings power beyond twenty twenty three of these companies if twenty twenty three is a recession year then you don't want to be putting a p multiple on that number because that's a trough number so what is the normalize through the cycle earnings power these companies has it been permanently impaired by co-vid or geopolitics or anything else is going in the world i think the answer is no for the most part most cases and therefore you should be capitalizing a number higher than two hundred for the s and t uh... and putting you know whatever you want eighteen twenty times on that and you're into you know price target for the s and p to start with a four it does that mean we eventually revert back to that sort of that you know pre-covid leadership with tech and growth and and that sort of thing being the real uh... drivers of the of the indexes higher i think that's a good question my answer is uh... it's rare when you get a big market sell off that coming out of that you have the same leadership as you had before so uh... you know technology companies growth growth tech is a is a great companies there's but they were very rich coming into this and i think we probably have had a regime change where it's now going to be more about value stocks on that means uh... financial stocks particularly the banks it means commodity stocks like energy which is but performed very well this year and yet is still under owned by most investors and it means finally finally uh... investing overseas europe and uh... japan uh... international stocks to me look uh... more compelling on a valuation basis granted the economic news is is pretty ugly uh... one thing i want curious eddie i mean you guys the invans portfolio there's a lot of choices for investors out there fixed income side equity side where is the money flowing right now in and out uh... you know i think you see a lot of investors want to avoid anything that's credit sensitive so uh... you know i think the bank loan category so mutual funds that invest in bank loans are seeing outflows across the industry uh... anything most active equity funds are seeing outflows as well uh... we run uh... calvert funds calvert brand eds g funds and we're seeing good in flows in a number of those uh... calvert equity strategies well eddie uh... is it a fools uh... errands to try to time this market right now quickly i think we got about uh... mic you know the answer now i don't set them up i think it's not a softball i think it's always a fool that errand to try and time the market i think that's what everyone's trying to do you have a lot of people who recognize that a sentiment is very negative cash levels are very high if you have a lot of people saying hey early twenty twenty three the market's gonna rip the problem is if you wait for the perfect moment you might miss it and so the best advice is it simple,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4981,2022-10-20 19:58:22
16636," levels are very high and you have a lot of people saying, hey, early 2023, the market's going to rip. The problem is if you wait for the perfect moment, you might miss it. And so the best advice is the simplest, state diversified dollar cost average your weight in. Relieve yourself of the psychological imperative to time the market perfectly and just make sure you're there at the bottom when it comes and you do that by dollar cost averaging. I'll leave it in cash for a little bit longer until you really get some clarity. Dare I say, dare I say. Actually thank you so much Eddie Perkin, chief equity investment officer for equity at eat and dance joining us on the phone from Boston. But I do, you know, I do wonder though, like at a moment where there is still so many questions. I can't time it, but you can certainly do, you know, preserve some, you know, what's in your portfolio. Well, yeah, and you're, you're point about cash. I mean, it's finally has a yield, a real yield on it, you know, not a real yield above inflation, but a noticeable yield that doesn't round down the 0%. So it makes that decision a little tougher to try to take on risk. Exactly. All right, folks, just about two and a half minutes left in today's trading session. We've got equities just rounding off the bottom, but we're down across the board. It is time to head over to our TV colleagues for Beyond the Bell, our cross platform coverage, live on Bloomberg Radio TV and YouTube, we're counting you down to the close. Beyond the Bell, Bloomberg's comprehensive cross platform coverage of the US market closed, darn it right now. And we are about two minutes away from the end of the trading day. Caroline, hi, Taylor Riggs, can you down to the closing bell? Here tell us, take us, be on the bell. It's a global simulcast. There's Carol Maser and his Mike Regan, and there's him for Tim Stenevich. And we want to go across our audiences of TV, radio, and YouTube. I said, one is a day of yields pushing higher of volatility across the pond and of volatility in the equity markets. I want to push Beyond the Bell to Saturday. I don't know about you guys. Because it has been a dense, dense, day, dense week again, really broad based for the most part in terms of selling. And I'm going to go back to what I talked about earlier. Semicindectors continue to outperform, certainly seeing it in land research, and you're seeing it in the sock still holding on to a slight gain. Well off its highs though, but Mike still up about eight tenths of a percent. Yeah, Carol. And I've got one number in mind right now. And that is the number five, five percent. The Fed Fund's futures are finally fully pricing in a terminal rate of five percent, and even a little bit higher. And not only that, Taylor, they're also not really pricing in much of a cut for next year. So markets right now pricing a five percent interest rate on Fed Fund futures starting in March and pretty much staying there for most of the year, Taylor. Mike, what is the three, six, six on the S and P mean to you as well? When we think about the significance of these numbers, that was the big June lows. We seem to retest that a few times dip below it. Now we're right back there. Yeah, right. And we just had Abbott Gail do a little, our colleague on saying, do not expect that low earlier this month's hold. She's expecting even lower lows, Taylor. No, we're lows at the moment. We are below that three, six, six number. As we hear the closing bells were off by eight tenths percent. We just dip into that closing bell eight seconds until trade holds and we're at three thousand six hundred sixty five, so we trade on the S and P five hundred thirty one points. Let's call it thirty points to the downside. That is eight tenths percent lower. Bloomingdale's ringing that bell over at the moment and we're seeing those still no love for any of the benchmarks in the NASDAQs off by six tenths percent. We see the Dow Jones industrial average off by three tenths percent, just 91 points lower. And then we have a look at the Ross 2000 which has been an under poor former throughout the day of trade off by more than one point two percent. Yeah, and interesting Caroline with a day with again another about a volatility. Maybe we understand why it happened, but nonetheless some swings here. The VIX moving down Taylor just a little bit down about half a point staying at about thirty. Take a look at where we are on the sector level, Carol, because you have a few names in the green, but it's really not my tone to write home about when you think about the breadth of the sell off telecoms or the big outperformer today. You're up three percent. Otherwise that semiconductor software and energy, wow, a my broken record or what energy is still one of the top performers here, but you're only up about one to two tenths of one percent. Everything else is in the red. Carol, and this is sort of the significance, even though we're not getting a two to three percent sell off, you're getting some decent number.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4982,2022-10-20 20:02:35
16637," Fikens, even though we're not getting a 2% to 3% sell off, you're getting some decent number sectors that are still in the red. I'll bring you down to the bottom. Some of this does feel like that inflation story with household products, utilities, transportation. We've talked a lot about the weak numbers from Union Pacific as we wait CSX. And then those key auto components as well. You're off about 5.7%. I'm looking at you, Tesla. Tesla, right? Down what? 6.7% are pretty significant decline there. All right, let's get you some of the gainers are actually some real big outperformers despite so many names lower in today's session. And that includes lamb research up more than 11% at its highs today, finishing the day with a 7.8% gain. Top in the S&P 500 NASDAQ. We talked about the earnings briefly last night. Semi, a capital equipment company, the first quarter results that did beat. And it also gave an outlook that analysts said should result in a more realistic consensus, expectations reducing some downside risk. So there was some upgrades from the analyst community, others cut their price target. But that reset about maybe what our expectations should be for the semi sector. Analysts really liking what they heard. IBM outperforms. Up 4.7%. Sales topping estimates affirming its cash flow forecast or anoragrana saying that was an important thing and assign the demand for software, mainframe computers and hybrid cloud services remain steady. So there was a strong turn in today's trade. 18T, one of the older, old guard, if you will, when it comes to the equity universe. Up, almost 8% in today's session. Top in the S&P 500. Biggest gain since the early days of the pandemic after reporting. Better than expected profit and customer growth. It was up you guys up within 10% at its highs today. Mike. Yeah, Carl, let me get back to Tesla. A bad day for Tesla. Obviously down 6.7%. Boy, third quarter sales still rose 56% to 21.5 billion. But that wasn't good enough for analysts. They expected 22.1. Elon Musk acknowledging that the downturn in China and Europe and the Federal Reserve's interest rates increases all the things we've been talking about are having an effect. It demands a little harder than it would be otherwise. The other big dramatic move today, all state shares down 13%. That's the most since 2020. Ensure basically saying that it expects a third quarter net loss of as much as 725 million. Hurricane Ian claims from that is one issue. But really inflation is that nasty word popping up again, even for an insurance company. Piper, a similar analyst saying they just struggled in recent quarters to get ahead of accelerating claims inflation. And finally, Union Pacific where it fell 6.8%. Another sort of macro warning here from this company, they cut their forecast for volume growth to reflect a quote challenging year. Adding their concerns about inflation and bloated inventories. They expect car load volumes to increase roughly 3% this year down from an earlier forecast of as much as 5%. Meanwhile, we look across the board of global macro movers. I look at an FX space that is once again a story of dollar strength on the day. This is we see the Federal Reserve members. This time perhaps coming from Elisa Cook on one side, you also get utterings coming from the Fed governor over in Philadelphia, Harker talking about where the terminal rate will have to go for this year and maybe continue to go higher at at least a 4% by the end of this year. Dollar strength means weakness, Swedish Kronen, Norwegian Kronen, Japanese yen, busting through that 150 level. Of course, all important as to what the B O J N indeed other authoritative figures over in Japan do to try and get some sort of strength within their currency. They're somewhat worried about the amount of weakness. I'm looking at commodities. Then of course, have been topsy-turvy. We did have some hopes, some utterances, some rumors that maybe China would be looking towards alleviating some of those quarantine periods. That did well for the likes of oil that pushed a little bit higher and sustained a little bit of the day. It was up as much as 3%, we'd put our back from that. Metals got to lift perhaps, our nor is that 1.5%. We're also seeing their natural gas falling back lower for more than 2%. Again, finally some production alleviating some of the concerns when you see the pricing pressure on that gas come off here in the US. So, Rimbons and mixed picture, you have money sort of in the UK, we saw some stability in the gilt yields at least, but over in Japan we saw yields push higher for example, and in Canada they were up some 12 basis points. Huge story, that is the same Caroline within full faith and credit. Think it is fascinating that earlier just a few days ago we were looking to see if a 30 year could hold on to that 4% level and we really started to drift upwards at 460 on the 2nd level.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4983,2022-10-20 20:06:57
16638," that earlier just a few days ago, we were looking to see if a 30 year could hold on to that 4% level. And we really started to drift upwards at 460 on the 2 year, a 4 and a quarter on the 10 year, and almost 4.23% on a 30 year. So you're really well above 4%. I think it's interesting. We're also getting some interesting earnings as well. Carol, I know that you're looking at a few. I'll just quickly hit CSX as well. A better top margin bottom line, 3.9 billion for third quarter revenue ahead of estimates, better operating income, and a better bottom line, 52 cents a share relative to estimates of 49. And they're coming out and saying that they still are targeting full year, double digit revenue operating income growth, a good improvement here for that company. You know, one stock too, that was definitely a pandemic play whirlpool, right? Really, when everybody was living at home, they were buying lots of appliances. Well, it's a different tone certainly in this latest earnings report. Stock down almost 6% here in the after hours. And it has to do largely too with the outlook. Seeing fiscal year ongoing EPS, we're talking about $19. It had seen 22 to 24. The estimate on the street was 21.85. So cutting that year, ongoing EPS view. You know, Caroline, I think about right. This was something that just couldn't keep up with really demand during the pandemic. This stock, by the way, did hit a 52 week low in the regular session and says elevated inflation resulted in slowing demand. Whirlpool saying it's these challenges persisting into the first half of 2023. So again, here's something when it comes to outlook. As a strategic review, when it comes to some of the emerging markets and other markets on nearing a conclusion. Yeah, in AMEA, so that's Europe, Middle East, and Africa. It's interesting that they talk about this challenge of 2023. That seems to be the narrative coming from some CEOs. It's fine for the time being, but next year is when the headwinds are really going to hit from a demand perspective added as over in Germany, talking about, of course, a dialing back in demand overall. And as you say, this is such a pandemic dialing as everyone is so desperate to get their hands on new goods. But notably, the housing roll over. The fact that we are seeing concerns coming to the cracks forming in the US housing and real estate sector and indeed worldwide as rates push higher, that's got to be an overall headwind on this company. Yeah, and also I've put out 10 health care out with guidance saying they see fiscal year adjusted EBIDA of 3.38 billion to 3.48 billion, a little bit of a tighter range than the 3.38 to 3.58 billion that they saw. But where the stock is not taking it well down, about almost 9% in post market trading there, Carol. All right, so certainly some names to follow into the Friday trade, as you said, 10 it down about 8%. All right, folks, that's a wrap. A lot going on wrapping up some of the earnings after the close. We will be back our cross platform coverage radio TV, YouTube beyond the bell. We will catch again, same time, same place tomorrow. This is Bloomberg Business Week with Carol Maser and Bloomberg QuickTakes Tim Stenevig on Bloomberg Radio. All right, everybody. Our thanks to our TV colleagues just following those earnings names in the after mic. You were breaking down 10 it. It continues to be down about 6% here in the after market. So we are seeing some selling. I'm thinking about we talked about health care earlier. This has often been, I think our market guests actually said, if you're going to look for kind of a defensive play, health care, he liked it. But yeah, not so much this time. But really, it just gives to show you a lot of surprises in this earnings season. There are positive surprises, negative surprises. But we're seeing some really dramatic moves. Because I don't think anyone really had too much confidence in what any company was going to really meet or miss their estimates. Yeah, and we know the bar was brought down low. And I do think those pandemic plays continuing to do a reset. Whirlpool off its lows in the after market, but still down about 1%. All right, let's get back to World of National news over to Nancy Lyons in DC. Hey, Nancy. Thanks, Carol. President Biden is vowing to continue close cooperation with Britain following the resignation today of Liz Truss, his prime minister.

I have therefore spoken to his majesty, the King, to notify him that I am resigning as leader of the Conservative Party. Trust says a new party leader and Prime Minister will be chosen next week. She'll go down in history as Britain's shortest serving Prime Minister. The U.S. says not only have Iranian drones been used by Russia to attack Ukraine in recent days, but Iranian operatives have had boots on the ground in the region. State Department spokesman Ned Price. We assess that Iranian military personnel were on the ground in Crimea and assisted Russia in these operations. State Department's Ned Price, officials say the Biden administration is looking at imposing new sanctions on Tehran and making it harder for it to sell such weapons to Russia. President Biden is in Pennsylvania today where earlier he visited a Pittsburgh bridge that collapsed earlier this year. It's been repaired and updated as a result of the bipartisan infrastructure law. Pennsylvania's been able to repair Furn Hollow Bridge in less than a year, and by Christmas God will be walking. I'm coming back to walk over to Stuckern. Biden is also stumping for Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman in Philadelphia. He's in a tight Senate race with Dr. Mehmed Oz.

Carol Masser along with Mike Riegan here in our Interactive Broker Studio. We are watching shares of SNAP dive in the after hours, right now down more than 16 percent, 17 percent. So a big drop off this after the company, Third Quarter Revenue, 1.13 billion. The estimate was 1.14 billion. So a slight miss there, but also catching our attention, not providing formal financial guidance for the fourth quarter. The company did authorize a stock buyback of up to $500 million. Third quarter daily active users, $363 million. That's better than the estimate of $358.7 million. And if we look at the adjusted DPS 8 cents, a share, the estimate was for a loss of 2.2 cents of share. But Mike, this stock is selling off. Yeah, it's just shows you any sort of crack in the numbers that don't meet estimates and you're going to get punished in this. I was impressed by the rest of the world revenue, 155.5 million, up 22 percent year over year. So they're finding growth outside of the US and Europe, but clearly not enough to sort of counteract that huge North American audience revenue there, 811 million as you pointed out. But there is some growth there. So there's an interesting story to be told, but boy, the market's not like any of it at all. So 18 million compared with 52 million in the prior year, just looking at the press release, they say, Evan Spiegel, the CEO, this quarter we took action to further focus our business on three strategic priorities, growing our community and deepening their engagement with our products, reaccelerating and diversifying our revenue growth and investing in augmented reality. So we'll look for some more color. We're going to actually talk with our Alex Beringa in just a moment to get a little bit of insight into that. In the meantime, we're going to talk a little bit about women when it comes to investing and the importance of it. We're going to talk about gender or being gender smart when it comes to investing. So we're going to get to that in just a moment with Suzanne Beagle. She's co-founder of a company called Gender Smart and she's going to join us in just a moment.

The S&P 500 index that did end the day down by 29 points, dropping 8 tenths of 1% the Dow down 90. A drop there of 3 tenths of 1%, NASDAQ composite index down 65 points today.

While West Texas, intermediate crude oil was up 5 tenths of 1%, 85, 98 a barrel. I'm Charlie Palette and that is a Bloomberg business fly. Just to reiterate, SNAP still down about 21% reporting its slowest quarterly sales growth ever saying that a decline in ad spending on a platform continues to drag on results. Speaking of drag, it's dragging meta down about 5% in the aftermarket and Pinterest is right now down about 9% as well in sympathy. Our next guest website notes that they coined the term gender smart and is not focusing on the now is now, excuse me, focusing on the integration of gender analysis into a newer existing investment process for better social and financial outcomes. Suzanne Beagle's co-founder of Genders Smart. It's a community of individuals across the finance ecosystem and they're working on moving more gender smart capital more strategically around the globe. So let's get more on her efforts and outcomes. She joins us via Zoom from the UK. Hey Suzanne, nice to have you here with Mike Regan and myself. I want to start if I can with some of the news because you are in the UK and of course we've been focusing on UK Prime Minister Liz Trust resigning women in leadership roles. How does a development like this impact the narrative around women leaders or how we think about being gender smart if at all? Well, I think the reality is that for women or male leaders, the key is to be paying attention to what people really need. Healthcare, access to affordable energy, access to goods and services that make their lives better and that gender balance leadership and leadership that's really paying attention to the stakeholders that are involved is what we need. So I don't think that Liz Trust's particular position says anything about gender lens investing. Well, Suzanne, if I'm an investor, how do I approach this issue? Is it a matter of sort of counting up the number of women on boards and in management positions? Is there more to it? How do I invest with a gender lens? Thanks for asking that. So the first is that we're really thinking about where we see women in leadership, governance, employment, supply chains and customers. And the key is to really be thinking about not only counting, so where do I see a woman on a board or where do I see a woman entrepreneur, but really looking at is that entrepreneur creating something of value in the market? Do they really have product market fit? Do they understand how to really value their labor and their supply chains? And are they creating good policies and practices? And it could be male or female led businesses, but where do you see gender balance and where do you see attentiveness to what the needs are of those different kinds of stakeholders? So in a bigger company, in a listed company, you might be thinking about the policies and practices. Do they have good care benefits? Do they have good leave benefits? Do they have pay equity? What does it look like from a recruitment, retention advancement, promotion perspective? And what we see and what the market sees is that where you have better gender, attention to gender and those gender balance practices, you get better financial outcomes and you get more access to talent, you get access to customers, you get access to innovation on a different level. So as with some Dr. Mijie Sherr with us, and we talk about this a lot that diversity, including women and just in general having a more diverse senior management, diverse boards, it does lead to a better financial outcome. What are some of the numbers that you are finding and some of the work that you're doing with investors or the investment community? What are some of the outcomes that you're getting? So I look at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, I came out with a report at the end of 2020 at where you have public education.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4987,2022-10-20 20:24:10
16642," are some of the outcomes that you're getting. So I look at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, came out with a report at the end of 2020, looking at where you have publicly listed companies with better gender diverse leadership and governance, better climate outcomes, better innovation outcomes, and better financial outcomes. And so I think about anyone who is looking in the 21st century at a climate, who is a climate smart business, and who is really gonna be paying attention to the trends and the indicators that we need there, is gonna be looking for gender balance and diversity, equity, and inclusion as part of this solution. And if you're in that, oh, I'm sorry Susan, if you're an investor, assessing the entire investment landscape, is there a solution to do this efficiently, sort of a technological way to score gender equality, the way you would some of the ESG factors? Yeah, so there's a company called Equal-Ep. I mean, Equal-Ep, MSCI, and a number of others are doing this work. And if I think about Equal-Ep, which I think is the top at this level, they're looking at 19 variables. So they're looking at, again, where do you have not only women and boards, but what roles are they in? They're looking at women in leadership, again, what roles are they in, and what's going on with pay equity, including by the way bonus compensation, which is an issue that people often will leave out when they're talking about pay equity. When you're looking at employment, again, there's different factors around the policies and practices. Similarly with supply chains. Do you have a resilient supply chain, where pay is fair, where working conditions are fair? And in some places, obviously, there's legislation and mandates around that. Here in the UK, Modern Slavery Act, and in other places, we don't have that requirement for data collection. From a customer standpoint, you'd be looking at, again, where do you have customers who are, where do women customers really value those products and services and improve their life? So they look at these 19 variables, they compare across 4,000 companies, and they are feeding. Their data is feeding about a billion and a half in funds. We have to run, but hopefully we can catch up with you again in the near future. Suzanne Beagle, co-founder of Gender Smart, joining us via Zoom from the UK.

16644," Bloomberg Business Week. All right, you are listing and watching Bloomberg Business Week and this story is among our most red on the Bloomberg Terminals. Also the Bloomberg Big Take. Mike, we're going to talk about small gun makers in just a moment. Yeah, there's really a million of them these days, I guess. They really sprouted up building these AR-15 sort of knockoffs. It's kind of a scary time. Yeah, and figuring out how to do it without catching the regulator, the glare regulators, I should say. All right, we'll get to that in just a moment. First up though, back to Charlie Pell and all that news after the closing. Take a look at my lots going on all about earnings and look at snapshairs. Plunging now by 24% snapping, reporting its slowest quarterly sales growth ever, saying that a decline in ad spending on the platform continues to drag on results, again, worth repeating, snapped. Now, plunging by 24.5%. Social media companies spent the quarter shrinking and refocusing its business, announcing at August that it was cutting 20% of its workforce. Social pool is reporting lower than expected sales and earnings for the third quarter, and it cut its outlook for the year, citing softening demand and rising inflation into 2023. The 111 year old appliance manufacturer sells all manner of appliances ranging from refrigerators to stand mixers. So with all of the earnings, what about the overall outlook? Eddie Perkin, his chief investment officer at For equity at Eaton Vance, and he was our guest right here on Bloomberg Business Week. We all know earnings have to be cut. Anyone who doesn't hasn't been paying attention and the market's forward looking. So some of that, maybe all of that, is already in the price. And I think you have to look through that and ask yourself, what is the underlying earnings power beyond 2023 of these companies? If 2023 is a recession year, then you don't want to be putting a P multiple on that number because that's a trough number. And today it was a down day stock swiping out a 1% advance S&P ending lower by 29 points down 8, 10, 1%. Treasury yields climbing amid Fed speak. We had the tenure now at 4.23%. Two year yield 4.61%. Again, the S&P down 8, 10, 1%, the Dow dropped 3, 10, 1%, down 90 points, and has stacked down 61. Spot gold down 1, 10th, 1%, 16, 27, the ounce, West Texas, intermediate crude up 5, 10, 8, 85, 98, I'm Charlie Pellett. That is a Bloomberg business flash. All right, Charlie. Thank you so much. I want to get to a startling story that's on the Bloomberg terminal. It is the Bloomberg big take. It is also among the most red. It is about the small gun makers finding state weapons, bands are offering up a lucrative niche. What exactly are we talking about? Let's go to our Chicago Bureau on the phone there. Jason Grotto, he's Bloomberg News Senior Investigative Reporter joining Ne and Mike Reagan here. Hey Jason, tell us about what's going on. Well, so over what we found is that over the past nine years or so, a real explosion in the number of gun manufacturers in the US licensed gun manufacturers, it's doubled now to more than 18,000. They're pretty much in every state of the country operating out of strip malls, warehouses, and some folks making guns and their garage. It's really been driven by a few things. One is the changing technology, the low barrier to entry now with machine technology that allows folks to easily make guns. That's number one. Number two, the regulations surrounding gun manufacturers are, create a pretty low bar. You don't have to have any experience. The fees only $150 and as long as you have a place to do it, they'll give you a license to start making guns. Jason, somehow they're designing these guns to get around what restrictions are in place for say an NAR 15. How exactly are they doing that? Yeah, so there's about a dozen states around the country that I have some type of restriction on firearms. What that's really done ironically is it's created these niche markets for some of the smaller gun makers. The big guys like Smith and Wesson and Colts, they're not going to retool their operations to be able to sell certain kinds of weapons in New York or Massachusetts or Connecticut. So gun makers there have used the really intricate technology.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4990,2022-10-20 20:37:14
16645," to be able to sell certain kinds of weapons in New York or Massachusetts or Connecticut. So gun makers there have used the really intricate technology of gun manufacturing to find ways around efforts in those states to restrict the type of weapons that folks can buy. So for example, the IR-15, which is a very controversial firearm, some folks call it an assault rifle. Others call it a modern sporting rifle, depending on which side of the fancy stand. Well, so the state of New York in 2013 after the horrific Sandy Hook elementary school mass shooting, past legislation that tried to limit the type of firearms that folks could buy. And one of the things they said is you can't have an AR-15 type weapon where you could have a detachable magazine. So a company that we profile in our story, a dark storm industries patented an AR-15 style design where there's a small screw that fixes the magazine in the firearm and only has holds 10 rounds to get around that law or to comply with that law, again, depending on which side of the fancy sit on. The lawmakers who wrote the law, some of them are upset and are now trying to find ways to close some of these so-called loophole. I wonder, do they stand a chance, in this political climate, do they stand a chance of being able to close these loopholes, do you think? I'm sure it's a state-by-state basis, but it seems like a tricky thing to do given the political environment today. Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, and that's why we have a piecemeal or patchwork regulatory system right now where state-by-state, the laws are very different. The other issue is just the complexity of gun making, or gun manufacturing. There are so many nuances that go into making a gun. And a lot of these laws, some would say, they're too specific about what constitutes an assault weapon, let's say. And so advocates who are looking to place more restriction on guns in the US are saying the laws need to be broader. We need to not get into the weeds with this, so that the gun makers who are very nimble and smart can find ways around it. I wonder, obviously, the prices of these would be some sort of a barrier to how much they flourish around the country. How much are they selling some of these guns for these sort of niche, smaller manufacturers? And Jason, just got about 30 seconds left. Yeah, sure. That's really great question. So one of the things driving this is the fact that the R15 is component-based. So you can really buy components that make up the R15 and the basic component the receiver can go for as little at 80 bucks. And then you just buy the stuff from there. That's nuts. There's a quote in your story. First of all, I recommend everybody to go to Blumber.com because it's interactive and it's really, really impressive and powerful to read online. But there's a quote by a former ATF agent. We've just got to a point where the average Joe, like building Legos or a kit, can build their own guns. Jason Grotto, great reporting. It's the Bloomberg Big Take. Jason is senior investigative reporter at Bloomberg News, joining us on the phone from our Chicago Bureau. But again, you can find this story. It's the most read on the Bloomberg terminal and also check it out at bloomer.com. All right, let's head back to World of National News and to Nancy Neuens over in DC, hey, Nancy. Thanks, Carol. President Biden is in Pennsylvania today promoting the bipartisan infrastructure law that has helped repair a Pittsburgh bridge that collapsed earlier this year. Pittsburgh is a city of bridges. But too many of them are in poor condition like this bridge behind me before it collapsed. With the bipartisan infrastructure law, we're doing something about it. This is just one of 2400 bridges across the country that are being repaired just this year because of this law.

The first step shares in the after hours down 25% this mic after reporting its slowest quarterly sales growth ever. Company coming out saying that a decline in ad spending on the platform continues to drag on results. Pinterest is down more than 7% in the after hours following that drop in snap and we're seeing meta shares down about 4% in the after hours. These stocks tend to move in a flock of course, the social media stocks, but here's what is kind of surprising to me, Carol, is they still managed to add 57 million daily active users in the quarter for a total of 363 million. And look, as the father of three daughters, I know they're still using this app. This is still very popular. It's not like nobody's using it, right? Right. It's just so some issue with monetizing it. I guess there's so much competition with TikTok and whatnot. And I know we have a guest coming up who will help us sort it out. Yeah. The company spent the quarter shrinking and refocusing its business. Remember back in August, it said it was cutting 20% of its workforce and slashing projects that don't contribute to user or revenue growth or to the company's augmented reality efforts. Changes were in response to plunging sales, which snap contributed to a slowdown in market or spending. I mean, that is fair. We've talked about it, right? There's so many social platforms. They're all competing for these ad dollars. And the big guys seem to, you know, whether it in general, but it's some of the smaller players relatively speaking, it's a little bit tougher. Yeah, right. And just with such an uncertain outlook, it's safe to assume a lot of companies are probably cutting back on that ad spending. So it's a bunch of apps fighting over a shrinking pool of advertisers. Yeah. Snap saying in its prepared remarks, her investors quote, we are finding that our advertising partners across many industries are decreasing their marketing budgets, especially in the face of operating environment, headwinds, inflation, driven cost pressures and rising cost of capital. I mean, it's the stuff we talk about all the time. It's all coming home to the roof. It's not easy. It's not easy. It's not easy. It's not easy. It's tough. It's tough. And there's stuff coming at us from all angles. We're going to talk a little bit more about this with our Alex Boringa. We're going to talk about that plunged snap in just a moment. Yeah. Yeah.

16647,".... Markets, headlines and breaking news 24 hours a day. Quick take, this is a Bloomberg Business Flash. From Bloomberg World, Hank Waters. I'm Charlie Pada Snap, plunges after ours and companies are rely on digital advertising or tumbling in post-market trading. After Snap Inc reported its slowest, quarterly sales growth on records, Snap, down now, by 25%. Pinterest, so leading to clients with a slump of as much as 9.4%, meta-platforms, falling 5.2%. And again, we did have Snap down now by about 25%. It was a down day on Wall Street, stocks managed to wipe out a 1% rally with Fed speak boosting yields. Today we had the S&P down 29, a drop there of 8, 10% of 1%. The Dow was down 90, a decline of 3, 10% of 1%. As Jack lower by 65 points today for the Nasdaq Compositive Index, that is a drop of 0.6%. The 10-year yield, 4.23%, the two-year yield, 4.61%, spot-goal down $1.40, the ounce 16, 28 lower by 1, 10th of 1%, and West Texas, intermediate crude up 5, 10th of 1%. 85, 98, a barrel. I'm Charlie Pada Tendette. It's a Bloomberg Business Flash. All right, Charlie, thank you so much. We've been talking about it a lot. She has a Snap just plummeting in the after hours. We've seen a drop of as much as 25%, but really under a lot of pressure. Trying to make some sense of it, we did report that the company reporting at slowest quarterly sales growth ever.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4993,2022-10-20 20:50:34
16648," of as much as 25% but really under a lot of pressure trying to make some sense of it. We did report that the company reporting its lowest quarterly sales growth ever saying that decline in ad spending platform continues to drag on results. But might keep pointing out right people are using it. Yeah, right. That had 57 million daily active users in the quarter for a total of 363 million. That's the type of stat alone that used to really pop the shares of a company like this. But it's all about how are you monetizing it now and if you're actually able to monetize it. All right, so let's see what Alex Borinca has to say. She's Bloomberg News Technology reporter. She covers the company. She is on the phone from LA with that and some more as we get ready for a day lose, a big tech to report earnings. All right, Alex, what do you make of this report? I think Mike was spot on there. The user growth here actually does look strong to his point. But the big question for Snap has been how much of this pie, the big pie of money that advertisers spend on social media platforms and internet platforms, how much does Snap get? And we've seen over the last few quarters that they've really struggled in a time where marketers are frankly spending less to advertise online. The CEO of Enceagle has pointed to things like macroeconomic uncertainty. They pointed to things like the changes Apple made to its privacy policy, which make it harder to track the efficacy of ads. When you look at Snap itself, this is a platform that their ad products have mostly been what we call upper funnel. There are things that tell you a story about a brand. They're less about converting to purchases and that has been a tricky wicket for them and that tricky wicket has apparently continued into the third quarter. Yeah, Alex, I wonder as a father of three teenage girls, I gotta say, my daughters are being monetized left and right by the pie. So we get it every possible way. Is that part of it, our Snap users, I'm assuming they skew younger and it's harder to convert to sales from that age group? And you also have, you speak of that share of the pie, TikTok certainly is taking a bite of that pie as well. Are those valid challenges for Snap at this point? Yeah, I think they are. And to your point, Snap's kind of a known as the owner of the youth online and TikTok is kind of pushing in on that. So if you put yourself in a marketer's shoes and you have really, really reliable ads on Google and Meta's platforms like Facebook and Instagram and you're looking to experiment somewhere with a younger demographic, you might have in the past gone to Snap. Well, TikTok is kind of pushing in for that ownership of the younger generations and that proved a bit of a challenge that I think will continue as they fight for these ad dollars. What else are you expecting this week? It's really getting into the heavy season of tech earnings. What else are you watching this week? Yeah, so we'll start with social media. So Snap is kind of a bell weather for kind of the health of all of these independent internet platforms. Not so much this week, but next Tuesday Meta will report it's earnings, the owner of Facebook and we will be paying attention to kind of what Meta has to say in terms of the, in terms of ad growth. The other companies reporting next week are the two Meta retailers, Apple and Amazon. Look, it's been an interesting year with a lot of questions around what is inflation's impact on consumer spending and these two tech giants will kind of give us a little clue into how were they spending on things like Apple iPhone 14s over the past quarter and how do we think they will spend in terms of holiday shopping on platforms like Amazon. So those are the big things on my mind with this kind of snap of court being the first early clue into the social media world. If we can go back a little bit to Meta because Alex, obviously this pivot from social media to the Metaverse has not exactly been warmly received by investors. If I say it politely. You're being kind. What are any idea, you know, it's, I'm assuming it's still too early to kind of start gaining significant revenue from the Metaverse. What do you think the focus will be there on that earnings call and in the statement regarding that balance between social media, your Instagram and your Facebook and this big experiment in the Metaverse? Yeah. And, just, if you can just, dumbad camera glasses, mixed aperture or limited zoom. You could just stick down or find ways to possibly buy and contain on your own. You end up building labels for pretty cheapaire sites.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4994,2022-10-20 20:54:46
16649," in the statement regarding that balance between social media, your Instagram and your Facebook and this big experiment in the metaverse. Yeah, and the experiment is quite large for meta. So they're spending about $10 billion a year on development for the metaverse. That equates to almost 10% of what we expect them to make in revenue this year. So it's an experiment, but it's a really big one. So we'll definitely be paying attention to that. As you said, we don't necessarily expect a lot of monetary numbers around the metaverse because it is still early days, but for meta, they still have their Instagram, Facebook, and what's that platform, which are kind of going to be the funders of these aspirations to create this next generation of the internet and the metaverse. So similarly to what we're looking at with Snap, with Meta, we'll be looking at Instagram and Facebook and seeing our advertisers spending more money there, they have continued chasing TikTok themselves, pushing into new content formats, like short films video. And in the past couple of quarters, they've really started adding new ads formats to that type of content, which again, for investors around earnings season, it's really important to see how those are staring. So it'll continue to be this balance. And I think the more that Facebook and Instagram continue to perform, perhaps the more applications investors might have with Meta. But Mike and Carol, if you look at Meta's shares this year, they're down to... I'd rather not look at that stock. They might not rather either, but it seems like there might be some questions around what level of applications investors might have as they continue to push in new areas while hoping that the old areas continue to perform. Yeah, great story by Max Chaffkin from Bloomberg Business Week about how basically Mark Zuckerberg is just all in on the metaverse and not really paying much attention to the company, the part of the business that still is so important to Meta and we're talking about what used to be the name brand Facebook that is just much more consumed with the metaverse shares in meta by the way, down about 60% so far this year. Alex, we have to run really great stuff looking forward to your coverage. Alex Bering, a Bloomberg News Technology reporter joining us on the phone from LA. And as we get ready to wrap up, shares of Snap though, Mike, you know, you bring up some good points, people still using it, but nonetheless, some disappointment over Snap and not some. I mean, shares are plunging in the after-hires. They're down 25%. We're talking about a quarter haircut right there. Well, 25% and a stock that was already really beaten up this year, but... Yeah. It's kind of dumb luck in a way when you have to report earnings on a very negative day in the market, a very risk off day. You tend to get a perhaps an exaggerated move. So, you know, this seesaw has been going all over the place in the stock market. So I'll be interesting to see if we get that bounce back tomorrow and how much they recoup. Yeah, that's a really good point. Meta, by the way, was also down. Pinterest is down almost 8% in the after-hours. And if I take a quick look at meta-platforms here in the after-market, it's down about 4.6% and Alphabet's down about 2.6%. So... Ugly day in the metaverse, that's a great... We'll see where there are people coming to buy ahead of the weekend tomorrow. Alright, Mike Riegan, thank you so much. Well, anytime. Thank you, Carol. Yeah, I love having you here and I love your market perspective. We really appreciate it. Mike Riegan, our Bloomberg News Team covers the markets. For the Business Week team, I'm Carol Maser.

16650,"56 from the heart of where innovation, money and power to lie in Silicon Valley and beyond. This is Bloomberg Technology with Emily Che. I'm Emily Cheg in New York and this is Bloomberg Technology. Coming up the next hour, snap plunge. More than 20% after posting its slowest quarterly sales growth since going public. This could spell trouble ahead for Twitter and meta results we will discuss. Plus, are people working more but getting less done? That's what Ariana Huffington thinks. But new studies show productivity is best if employees have flexibility over when they work, not necessarily where. And artificial intelligence is creating a new type of artist with the explosion of apps like Dali. Later this hour we've got the founder of the world's first talent agency for AI artists. All that in a moment but first I want to get a check of the markets are a blood low here with that. And of course the monster drop in snap share. Yes, slowest revenue growth on record. They've suspended guidance for the fourth quarter. By the way, they dangle to $500 million share by back in there. And yes, look behind me, there is literally a giant wall that says minus 25% in after hours. And the reason that's dramatic is this is a stock that's already down 80% year to date. It's going to be fascinating to see the broad ramifications of this in Friday's market when we look across the technology sector and the story around this earnings season specifically the company citing an active pull back from advertisers but other headwinds including what they call platform policy changes. Of course they're referring to Apple iOS ad tracking changes which we know have been a big problem for social media platforms this year. In terms of the broad.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4996,2022-10-20 21:03:35
16651," Platform policy changes, of course, they're referring to Apple iOS ad tracking changes, which we know have been a big problem for social media platforms this year. In terms of the broader markets and what we saw in Thursday's session, another day of yields-up tech stocks lower. It was interesting, and as that 100 was up 1.6 percent at one point, and then fell, erasing that gain, ultimately closing down half a percent, but fairing better than the broader S&P 500, we continue to see that push higher in yields. We continue to hear Fed speak the latest on Thursday being Philadelphia Fed Chief Patrick Harker, who says he expects policy makers to raise rates beyond the 4 percent mark and hold them at elevated levels well into next year. But green, there is some, look closely, there is green on the screen there just, 710 to 1 percent higher in the Philadelphia semiconductor index. Semiconductor is interesting. We're up for the four straight day on the stock to pretty good run of form for that index in best running more than a month. The only real news out there was a Bloomberg scoop that China's tech ministry has summoned key China chip executives for a meeting to discuss the latest US policy actions around exporting tech. It's not clear if they had a direct result, but we continue to regain what has been a lot of lost ground in that sector. Let's end on snap. It's been pretty brutal in the last hour or so and after hours trading, snap, dramatic. You look at the ripple effects is having for met to the parent company of Facebook Pinterest, as well macroeconomic headwinds at play here, high inflation, all of these things are causing advertisers to pause. And I thought they'd already pause once to discuss. Indeed, let's talk a little bit about that more now, Ed. Thank you. For more on snap in the future of social media, let's bring in tech economy founder and editor-in-chief, David Karpakstrich, as well as our own Kurt Wagner. So David, big picture, what are your takeaways here? Well, I think the big picture is that the economy is getting worse faster than most of us had hoped. And in fact, snap is the first prominent victim. Unfortunately, we'll probably see more in the near future. Kurt, walk us a little through a little more through the numbers. What are you seeing in here? And how does this compare to what we've seen in the previous quarters? Yeah, well, as Ed mentioned, it was the slowest year over year revenue growth that we've ever seen from snap, which is never, never, ascendance you want to say when you're talking about earnings. But I think the issue is that it wasn't that far off of the streets' expectations. But I think those have already been depressed. There was already this feeling that it had been a really tough summer that a lot of the issues, the war in Ukraine, certainly the Apple iOS changes had had a serious impact on the business. So I think this was considered a low bar for snap to clear, which they didn't do. And as David just mentioned, this is a really terrible sign for sort of the rest of the digital advertising industry, which hasn't yet reported earnings will in the next couple of weeks. It's just a sign that anyone who is trying to make money from digital ads right now and use their attention, they're really struggling. For a number of reasons and snap, of course, is the first to have to go. It's interesting, David, because you could look at what's happening with meta, trying to make this big pivot and Twitter in the middle of this legal drama as an opportunity for snap. And it's interesting that it hasn't necessarily been. Well, you know, snap has the benefit of having a brilliant CEO who's at least very focused on the actual business he has, unlike meta. And I have a lot of confidence in Evan Spegel's ability to sort of surf this wave. On the other hand, it's like a tsunami that's hitting him in a way that he didn't expect. And, you know, it's weird because user growth was good. Revenue wasn't good, but they still lost $360 million. This company has never made money. And it's not, I don't even know why they would do a share by back when they're going to have to conserve cash going into this situation. Can you remind us of some of the innovative things that Evan Spegel has been trying Kurt over the last year? You know, and he also has an sort of anti-meta view on the metaverse, which is informing his strategy. Well, I'm with David in the sense that I think Evan's a really smart person. And I think that as a product thinker, he's one of the best, right? I mean, he has been routinely copied by Marxist-Occaberg over at Facebook and meta. And, you know, we constantly kind of coming up with new things.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4997,2022-10-20 21:07:38
16652," I think that as a product thinker, he's one of the best, right? I mean, he has been routinely copied by Mark Zuckerberg over at Facebook and Meta and, you know, he's constantly kind of coming up with new things. And he is also focused on augmented reality, similar to Mark Zuckerberg, but in a very different way, right? He's trying to build that kind of stuff into the camera, into something that people already have in their hands versus sort of like a metaverse idea that still years off. But you know, some of the stuff they've tried to do, they've tried to build a subscription product, right? They're not quite as reliant on advertising, kind of give people, really access to new features. You know, they've talked about Emily, you remember they've done spectacles, they're kind of building other augmented reality glasses that are not here yet, but are coming. So you know, those are the types of projects I wonder if they'll continue to invest in. They have started to pull back on anything that isn't directly related to revenue and user growth. And I think AR, you know, while it's certainly some, he's been passionate about for years, he does make me wonder if they can continue to invest in that the way he would like to given everything that's going on at the company right now. You know, meantime, meta had another, you're another high profile executive leaving today, the vice president of corporate development. And obviously, David, you've chronicled so many years of meta and clearly we're moving into a new phase. The anti-trust suit, you know, surrounding the within unlimited deal, you know, you used to see more kind of M&A in the social media space when there was turmoil and resizing if you will like this, but maybe in this environment, we won't. Right, if you're the M&A guy at meta Facebook, you know, what are you going to do right now if the government won't let you do anything of substance? Plus, I think it's increasingly the case that employees throughout meta, including a lot of the senior leaders, are feeling somewhat disenchanted. I don't know if this is an example of that, but an awful lot of senior people have left that company. And it must be very disheartening to work for a company with 3.5 billion users whose CEO is thinking about something else. I got to believe that is a problem for everybody at that company. Meantime, can you give us an update on the Twitter situation we did here a little bit from Elon Musk yesterday on the Tesla earnings call, you know, Twitter's earnings are coming up pretty soon. How's that going to work? Yeah. You know, give us the latest. Well, we think they're coming up soon. They haven't said an earnings date yet. I'm wondering if they're just hoping that this whole thing gets closed before that they have to go through with that, right? Because not only are they already projected, I believe I saw, I saw projecting a revenue decline for them as well, but you saw what just happened with SNAP, right? The last thing they want to do is have to go through something like that publicly while they're still waiting for this deal to close. But as you mentioned, Elon Musk yesterday on Tesla's earnings, in my opinion, he said some stuff that made me think this deal is going to happen, right? He was normally when he talks about the deal he does so in this way where he's like, well, you know, if this thing finally happens, maybe this not yesterday, yesterday he seemed to say he was excited about the deal. He even said I'm overpain for the deal, but you know, it wasn't that it was suggesting that he's, you know, already done this thing. I don't know. I just got the sense when I listened to it that I walked away, that he feels this thing is done. And if he feels it's done, of course, well, that makes me think it's going to get done as well. David, what do you think? I mean, gosh, we're about to enter a very new era. Well, the eras are just cascading in on us in so many ways. I don't know what it's going to be to have Twitter owned by Elon Musk. I'm not sure it's all bad. You know, Elon Musk is the ultimate cipher because he's so brilliant and so important as an innovator and so crazy and putting those two things together is extremely difficult, especially predicting the future. But do you think there's going to be a huge brain train or maybe there'll be an influx of people going to Twitter who want to work for him? And there's certainly going to be a time of transition and gosh, what happens to the platform in the middle of this transition? Well, a bunch of people are definitely going to leave because he's insulted them in the course of this process for one thing. I think he does have people who want to work with him. I mean, he is a brilliant manager and maybe that's an asset. One of the things that he always talks about, which I really like, is genuine identity for Twitter users. That is plenty of issues.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4998,2022-10-20 21:12:05
16653," And maybe that's an asset. I, one of the things that he always talks about, which I really like, is genuine identity for Twitter users. If they were to do that, it would fundamentally change the platform, and I would love to watch that because I don't like anonymous social media myself. Yeah, Kurt, I see Smiley, you know, where are you on this? Where are Twitter employees on this? Well, I'm smiling because I'm agreeing with what David said. I think both that there will be a brain drain, and at the same time that there are plenty of people who would love to work with Elon Musk, who will be lining up and throwing their resumes at Twitter if he gets this company. So I think it'll sort of be maybe a change in of the guard, if you will, at the company soon. And as David said, I am thinking that the biggest change is going to be around the content policy, right? And all this stuff Twitter has been trying to do to make itself less terrible, less toxic for years. We've been talking about this. They've been putting all these rules and policies in place. And it gets the sense that he just wants to rip those out. He wants to gut that. And so, you know, it'll be interesting to see what the culture on Twitter feels like a year from now if he takes over because it may feel very much like it did in 2015, 2016 than it does today. Change coming indeed. All right, Kurt Wagner, thank you. Tecony, David, Kurt Patrick, always good to see you and here in person to appreciate it. Coming up, is our world too globalized?

Bloomberg Television is brought to you by CDW. Supply campaign is still wreaking havoc in our post-pandemic world. A wake-up call about the inherent precariousness of global trade and maybe even globalization itself. That is the topic of a new book, Homecoming the Path to Prosperity and a post-glow.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4999,2022-10-20 21:16:31
16654," The inherent precariousness of global trade and maybe even globalization itself. That is the topic of a new book, Homecoming the Path to Prosperity in a post-global world. Author and Financial Times call on this, Rana Faruhar joins us now for more. On this, so Rana, you know, we've heard about supply chain issues, but you take it a step further here and argue that maybe we're too dependent on other countries, too dependent on globalization. Are you saying we need to completely rethink supply chains? Well, I'm saying we need to rethink more than that, actually. You know, for the last half century, we've had a process of what I would call neoliberal globalization, which is, you know, about the idea that capital goods, people can move wherever they want, and that they're always going to land wherever it's most productive. And that worked really well for capital, and the biggest beneficiaries have been multinational companies and the Chinese state. It's the cheap capital for cheap labor bargain between the US and Asia. But now that is just fundamentally shifting and it's been happening for a while, but I think the pandemic and war in Ukraine were really almost like a scrim that was pulled up and suddenly people thought, oh, maybe it's not a good idea to get our energy from an autocrat or gosh, maybe it's not such a safe thing. If 92% of the high end chips in the world are produced in one island that's, you know, maybe going to be blockaded or even taken over by China. So I think that these are things that are now in the felt experience of most people. But even before the decoupling that was about geopolitics, which we all know is happening, there was a lot of regionalization and even localization happening in supply chains for all kinds of reasons, one of which is wages had risen in Asia, you know, that whole arbitrage between productivity, wages, energy costs was changing. You know, a lot of companies were starting to say, oh, you know, low margin stuff, we don't really want to tow it a long way through the South China seas. Maybe we'll do it regionally. Now, I think with ESG concerns, with energy prices, with the Europe, China and the US in different ways, but all kind of pushing in the same direction towards, if not a price on carbon, at least some sort of accountability for carbon, those long supply chains will become even harder. And then finally, we've got one more really important tailwind, which is high tech manufacturing. I mean, we are about to see, I believe, what we saw when the iPhone came out and the consumer space, just that boom in the app economy and all kinds of growth, that's now coming into the industrial space through decentralized technologies like 3D printing or vertical farming. I mean, we are really about to go through a massive technological change. It's just going to make it a lot more efficient and resilient to hub production and consumption more closely together. Is more localization or the pendulum swinging back that way, though? Could that also be seen as a step backwards? Is there a healthy middle? Well, for sure, there is a healthy medal. I'm so glad you said that, because oftentimes when you have the globalization debate, you know, on the one hand, you've got people that say, we've got to go back to the 90s, and then on the other hand, you say, oh my gosh, if we don't go back to the 90s, it's going to be 1930s. No, we're in a whole new era, you know, I think economic pendulums always swing throughout history. You know, that's true. You go back to 18th century mercantilism that worked until it didn't, and then you got laissez faire, and then you got keen thienism, and then, you know, we've had now a half century or so of neoliberalism, you know, most recently in the form of the Reagan Thatcher Revolution, which maybe with the collapse of Lystrus's government and the disaster that is Trusonomics, we may see this as the apex and the kind of end of that old era before we move into something new. How do you see the relationship between the U.S. and China evolving, especially with the actions that the Biden administration has taken on chips and what we heard from Xi Jinping over the weekend? Yeah, for sure. So the U.S. is reacting basically to China. I mean, as we all know, China is always very clear about its five-year plans. It lays them out. They're available for people to read. Xi is, you know, adds another layer of complexity, the nationalism, the populism that's gone along with him is a little bit off-piece for China, which tends to produce more sort of middle-of-the-road technocratic leaders. But I think that it's been clear for some time that China wants to decouple from U.S. technology. It wants to have what it calls a dual circulation economy, which essentially means the same thing, regionalism.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5000,2022-10-20 21:20:43
16655," But I think that it's been clear for some time that China wants to decouple from US technology. It wants to have what it calls a dual circulation economy, which essentially means the same thing. Regionalism, hubbing production and consumption. They've got enough rich consumers now. They want to keep some of their factory production at home. They don't want to be the factor of the world anymore. They also want to become less coupled with the dollar, which is a whole another part of this. I mean, what we've seen so far is shifts in supply chains and trade. What we've made now start seeing is shifts in the financial markets as China tries to do more digital R&B business. You see the weaponization of the dollar with sanctions. So there's decoupling in financial markets too. Before we go, I have to get your quick thoughts on Liz Trust resigning today. Obviously a fierce neoliberal advocate, which in the end certainly didn't work out so well. Are we witnessing a major ideological shift here? It's hard to look at what's happened. Liz Trust comes in and says, hey, we've got a growth problem. Let's cut taxes on the very wealthiest even as we spend on energy subsidies. And wow, the markets didn't like that. We've had about 20 years, I would say, in this country, in the Anglo-American world in general, where it's been pretty clear that trickle-down wasn't working. Until the recent bout of inflation and there are other reasons for that, wages for most Americans have been flat since the last 20 years. The same has been true in the UK. Cutting taxes on the rich is not the solution. The Reagan-thatcher era is over. We don't have a sort of post-game strategy yet completely, but we have some ideas about where to go and trickle-down is not it. So look, where do you see the world going? Like five years from now, how much more localized will the economy be? Will the economy be in better shape? I mean, we're about to go through what could potentially be a two to three year downturn? Yes. So let me raise one issue first, and I'll kind of put the caveat to my own thesis, which is inflation. We're moving towards a world of more redundancy of supply, more resiliency of supply. And that's inflationary, right? Cheap is not cheap. People are going to have to pay more for stuff. That's an issue. Are they going to want to do that? And then are we going to go back kind of pushed back into the old model? I don't think so, because I think that geopolitics have fundamentally changed. You just could look in the last 48, 72 hours, what Biden has done with dual use chip technology exports. That's changed the semiconductor supply chain overnight. I think we're going to see a lot more localization for all kinds of reasons. And ultimately, after what maybe a bumpy five years or so, I think we're going to come back into a better place in this country, because making things has always been important. Everybody that has ever spent time in a factory floor, and I did, I grew up, and then my dad ran factories, kind of knows that that's an important part of innovation and iteration. So I think having an economy that's based on something aside from finance and software, and it's more diverse and inclusive in this country is going to be a good thing. All right. Rana Faru, our congrats on the book, Financial Times, Colnist, and author, the author of Homecoming. Good to have you. Now, speaking of China and supply chain issues, the country has been struggling with containing COVID cases in recent weeks, and now officials are said to be debating whether to reduce the amount of time people entering the country must spend in quarantine.

16657," Don't you think they have long時間? What a heavy meal they have million tickets. Welcome back. We've got some breaking news now coming out of the Washington Post that Elon Musk plans to cut Twitter's workforce by 75 percent. The post reporting on documents detailing these plans to allegedly cut Twitter's workforce. Of course, we've been talking about whether or not Musk would make big changes, especially when it comes to staffing. Now, of course, the deal is not done yet. Still waiting for that October 28 deadline for a deal to happen. If Elon Musk does indeed close this deal to buy Twitter, does indeed cut 75 percent of the workforce. You're talking about thousands of people. Twitter's workforce is currently at about 7,500 people. So 75 percent of that is a significant cut. We're going to continue to follow this story and bring you more headlines. As we have them, meantime, I want to talk a little bit about workplace trends. The pandemic, of course, has brought about many changes, one of them being hybrid work. But it's not the only metric that matters. And we're going to talk about this all with Ariana, Happy Ten Founder and CEO of Thrive Global, Ariana. So great to have you back, as always. We've been hearing this term quiet quitting over and over again, which speaks to this idea of employees deciding not to go above and beyond their listed responsibilities. Why do you think that is? So I really great to be with you. I'm here at the Masters of Scale Conference that read Hoffman and the white one team are organizing and quite quitting. The great resignation, the great break up for women, have been big themes of the conference. And what is interesting about quite quitting is that it's really a rejection of the hassle culture that we've all been bemoaning. But also, it's like a false choice between hassle culture and burnout. And giving up on having an engaged job that you love and brings you joy and a sense of purpose and meaning. And so a lot of the conversation here has been about how to recognize that we don't have to buy this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5003,2022-10-20 21:33:56
16658," And so a lot of the conversation here has been about how to recognize that we don't have to buy this false choice that we can be engaged in our jobs and said boundaries. And also if you look at the great break up that the McKinsey-Lee-Nine report talked about with many more women leaving the workplace because of burnout compared to men 43% versus 31%. You see that burnout is at the top of the conversation everywhere. Well, and I wonder do women and underrepresented minorities have the luxury of quiet quitting? Or is this something that you know more men have the luxury of doing? Well, it's not just quite waiting for women. They're just leaving the workspace in unprecedented numbers. And that's all the bad news. And believe the good news is that these conversations are no longer just the province of the HR department. And satia Nutella spoke here yesterday morning and he spoke not just of the digital revolution and AI breakthroughs, but about the need for leaders to acquire soft skills and not just to demand that their employees return to the office, but to become like event organizers. He called it where he gives them a reason to return to the office where leaders acknowledge that people come for people and not because of mandated policy. Also, he talked about the productivity paradox. 85% of leaders think they're doing enough to prevent burnout and promote well-being and 85% of employees feel burned out. Quite a lot of their managers think they're sliking off. So there's turmoil in the workplace. But frankly, Emily, a lot of these things have been happening before the pandemic. And now everything has come to the surface and we have an opportunity to redefine how we work and live. I have to ask you about this Twitter news since it just broke. And I can imagine a few people have probably been quiet quitting at Twitter over the last few months. Now we're learning from this Washington Post report that Elon Musk plans to cut 75% of the workforce. Elon Musk has also come out in favor of in person work. But what's your reaction to this? Well, first of all, there's been so many rumors about this Twitter deal. We don't know what is true and what isn't. And also I'm wondering how much Elon Musk is regretting this impulsive decision to buy Twitter. It's been a huge destruction. It's definitely affected the Tesla stock. Because shareholders obviously don't like the CEO being so distracted by a major deal that's in the news every day. You know, as someone who has played such a prominent role in media, do you like the idea of Elon Musk owning Twitter? What concerns you about the idea of Elon Musk owning Twitter? What do you think is going to change? I mean, this could really dramatically change how a lot of us get our news. Well, if you look at the power of TikTok and the incredible popularity of TikTok and the sea of TikTok is here and talking to him, it's clear that there is real moderation there. And they have 12 rules around moderation, including preventing and and rejecting violence and pornography. A lot of it is moderated through AI, but there is also human moderation. So the idea that you can have a free for all in the name of quote unquote free speech is definitely traveling. Because there's so much misrepresentation and it's impossible to have a functioning demotion.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5004,2022-10-20 21:38:06
16659," because there's so much Mr. Presentation and it's impossible to have a functioning democracy without moderation. So clearly, you know, the Twitter and Elon Musk case is a unique story in itself. We are going through what could be a very prolonged economic downturn. For all of these, should rapidly shifting workplace trends, as you discuss, what's your advice to employers right now? What's your advice to businesses about how they should rethink their workplace policies and what they expect of their employees? Well, the priority, Emily, has to be to recognize that investing in the well-being and mental health of their employees is not a warm and fuzzy HR benefit. It's a business strategy. It's a necessity in order to prevent attrition, improve productivity and actually reduce healthcare costs. I mean, you saw the the the leak document two days ago that Amazon is losing eight billion dollars a year because of attrition. So the connection between well-being and mental health and attrition is very clear. We have a lot of data here. So leaders are recognizing more and more that this is the moment to redefine the importance of human capital, invest in the well-being of their employees in the workflow and bathe it in the workflow. It can't just be a mental health day here or a yoga studio there. It has to be embedded in the daily work so that people can actually take these little breaks that prevent stress from becoming cumulative and from becoming burnout. And there's been so much focus on where we're working and how that impacts productivity. But now there's new research that shows maybe it's when we're working that has a greater impact on productivity. What do you think? Yes, and all the new research that shows that what actually leads to more productivity is not having to be at work nine to five but being able to work when it's more convenient for you if you have children to take to school and the lily parents to take care of. So there is no way Emily that we are going to go to a normal nine to five five day in the office reality. But there is a lot we have to do to rebuild the social capital that we are losing when we are working remote. Being together has a big impact on creativity, on relationships, on a sense of meaning and purpose about work. But it has to be organized. It can't just happen. And that's where so many people came here for this conference. We could have done it on Zoom, but something special about being together. How concerned are you about the economic downturn in general? We just had Ben Lair on the show yesterday and I know you go obviously way back with Larry Hippo. He painted a pretty dark picture of how bad it's going to get for startups, for founders, for people running businesses and that this could last for a pretty long time. Well Emily that's really quite a struggling that we don't know how it ends and when it ends. But that's why investing in employees mental health is more important than ever because already Karen Lynch, the CEO of CVS Health, has called the mental health crisis the second pandemic. And we are not done with it by any means at all. So every business now is in a way a healthcare business and they have responsibility for the health and well-being of their employees, which is only going to be made worse by the stress and the fear and the anxiety about the economic downturn. All right. Well Ariana, thank you so much for always trying to-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5005,2022-10-20 21:42:26
16660," fear and the anxiety about the economic downturn. All right. Well, Ariana, thank you so much for always trying to get us to think about the important things. Ariana Huffington, founder and CEO of Thrive Global. It's always good to have you here. Appreciate it. Thank you. I'm a gemmy lady. Okay. Coming up, DeFi is dealing with a major problem, financial, acting. We're going to talk about that in our crypto report. Coming up next. This is Bloomberg. The crypto industry is reeling from a new threat to the decentralized financial system. And that is hacking for more on this. Let's bring in Bloomberg, Shanali Bostic. So what exactly is happening, Shanali? Well, it's not the hacking you would think of. This is not people attacking code and then taking money out of a protocol or token. This is financial hacking, which is really debated very heavily. This is people buying certain assets using stablecoins on swap and inflating those assets and then using them as collateral to take out loans. Sounds very complicated. Not an easy maneuver to do, but people have figured out these DeFi protocols have the ability to, you know, some people call it market manipulation instead of hacking. You know, so is it illegal? Is it not illegal? It's a gray area, but in a lot of places people just call it trading. So that's the debate we're talking about here. There's nothing necessarily wrong with it legally. It's a lot of gray area for a market that is being defined as we speak. Explain how this is technically possible. And also, why are we so surprised that this is happening? Shouldn't this be expected? It should be expected, especially with all that we've seen throughout the entire year when it comes to DeFi, when it comes to who's borrowing, when it comes to instabilities and prices because now so many new financial products, loans, swaps and other products are being created around the initial tokens themselves. Interestingly enough, too, the most recent one we've been talking about is mango. It's governed by a DAO as well. So you have a whole community of people here who are being affected and have to vote on...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5006,2022-10-20 21:46:59
16661," themselves. Interesting, and we'll end up too. The most recent one we've been talking about is mango. It's governed by a DAO as well. So you have a whole community of people here who are being affected and have to vote on how they retrieve money from this financial hack or trading strategy, whatever you want to call it, that is being conducted. How are crypto experts reacting? I think one interesting thing to look at here is San Benjamin Fried's framework he created for this kind of a thing. Because again, you can't stop people from doing this. This is essentially a way to find a hole in the system and then profit from it. And so what you're seeing is he's saying that the hacker should keep 5% of the taken funds and this should be a community-wide rule. But he's also saying that the community and the customer must be made whole first. If that doesn't happen, then the hacker doesn't get back the funds. And they have 24 hours to return those funds. He calculates that the impacts of the hacks can be reduced by 98% if this were to happen. Now I also want to hedge this by saying in his blog post that he said he feels very uncertain that this is a standard to have. However, it is one proposal. He's open to suggestions. I would be interesting to also hear what those suggestions are as people try to figure out how to change the market and the rules around it for really what's not a technical hack. It is a different way of trading different products around strategy that is losing a lot of people some money. All right. Well, thank you for breaking down a very complex topic for us. Yet again, you are very good at that. I always could see you. Good to see you here. Interesting. All right. Coming up, the Good, the Bad and the Truly Ugly side of AI-generated art. We're going to talk about that. Next, this is Bloomberg. Artificial intelligence is driving a new era of artistic talent. Apps that generate images from simple text descriptions are growing more popular as a source for people with little artistic ability to create unique work for more on this. I want to bring in Edgy Evans founder and CEO of Tessai, the world's first talent agency for AI artists. So explain how an AI artist talent agency works. Are you representing the humans using the AI to create art? Or are you representing the AI?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5007,2022-10-20 21:51:13
16662," Explain how an AI artist talent agency works. Are you representing the humans using the AI to create art? Or are you representing the AI itself? So the answer is probably a little scary for most people, because we are representing the AI brains that are on their own creating art without input from humans. So it's slightly different from the programs that most people have probably heard of where you input some words and then you get a painting. We're talking about AI's that are creating their own artworks out of their own brains whenever they want and however they want. So who creates the AI though? So there are developers that create the AI brain and then the brain interacts with different inputs and creates its own artistic style. What do you think the potential is here? I think it's basically a creation of a new type of artist and a new generation of artists that we can't really imagine from where we sit right now because all we can imagine from where we sit right now is an AI that needs you to tell it what to draw and needs you to tell it what to paint and when to do that. And actually that's not the future of AI. The future of AI is much more autonomous, artificial intelligence beings than what we actually can see right now. So what exactly do you do for the AI? So each of these AI's at the moment is an NFT on the blockchain so they have technically an owner. So at the moment they are owned by somebody in the same way that an NFT is owned. So we would interact with the owner and represent their AI brain that they own. How does the AI then decide if the agency is doing a good job? Well, that's a good question. I mean, at the moment the AI probably can't do that but that's not to say that in the very near future they will be able to do that and that they will actually want representation which is decision they can't really make for themselves at the moment. Now, some of this AI generated art is not so pleasing. In fact, some of it is downright ugly or disturbing. How do you think about that? Yeah, so I think regular art is not always pleasing. In regular art is always, you know, has the chance to be pleasing or disturbing depending on who's looking. I think the most important thing is to make the designation between art that is original which most people don't think AI art can be original and that's what we are trying to change because if you fall, you think about AI art is that it comes from an algorithm and it can't possibly come from any kind of creative process that's similar to what humans undergo then you'll never appreciate it. Whether it's disturbing or beautiful or not, you will never appreciate it. But when you do appreciate that it comes from a unique AI brain, then you might actually grow to appreciate it and that goes to value as well. It will develop its own value in the marketplace. All right, we've got some quick breaking news just to report that the Biden administration is exploring now the possibility of new export controls that would limit China's access to some of the most powerful emerging computing technologies according to people familiar with the matter, these potential plans which are in an early stage are focused on the still experimental field of quantum computing as well as artificial intelligence software speaking of that. Industry experts are weighing in on how to set the parameters of the restrictions on this technology and of course this is an extension of what we've seen the Biden administration doing on chips when it comes to supply chains as well. This is a developing story that we're going to continue to follow actually speaking of China. And G, how do you see the role of China in the artificial intelligence and F.T. space? I mean, obviously the U.S. is very concerned about its ability to compete with China on technology. Where is China in your world? I think one of the things that makes us unique in what we like to think of as a liberal democracy is that we actually really value creativity. And I understand that that's one of the issues that some artists have been having. But when you compare us to China, for example, I mean, we have a completely open world of expression here. And I think if we can offer that also in the AI space, then that also gives us a leg up on China in terms of our creativity, because the world is...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5008,2022-10-20 21:55:30
16663," I think if we can offer that also in the AI space, then that also gives us a leg up on China in terms of our creativity, because the world is heading in an AI direction. So whoever is more creative in that space is going to be far ahead. How do you respond to those who say that the idea of AI art be little's natural human artistry? Yeah, I mean look, as you know, I have an art background, so I'm completely sympathetic to people who feel that way. But I don't think we will ever lose our desire for human creativity. You know, you can't say that one replaces the other, but I think also you can't say that an AI brain can't have a creative process in the way that a human brain has a creative process. One artist doesn't cancel out another, so it's really... So what do you say that the folks whose mind just goes to a very scary place? In talking about... I would say to those people you need to... It's a little terrifying. It's amazing, but terrifying. It's terrifying, but I think we all have to start embracing that really scary place because we're going in that direction. So you're either going to kind of stick your head in the sand and just stick your fingers in your ears and be like, I don't want to go there, I don't want to go there. Or you're going to figure out a way that you can maybe interact with that place. And maybe you could even wind up having collaboration with an AI artist. If you don't start thinking about that, the world's just going to leave you behind, so you have to start thinking about it. Well, thank you for starting to open our eyes to this. Angie Evans, founder and CEO of Tessai, the world's first AI artist talent agency. Good to see you, and that does it for this edition of Bloomberg Technology. Don't forget to check out our podcast, wherever you get your podcast. I'm Emily Chang in New York. This is Bloomberg. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

16664," 🧐 The Great Sci-fi Art of the mid-20th century teased the vision of the future with one distinct element and common, a life for humans in outer space. Whether vacationing on an exotic new planet or commuting to the moon for business, space travel seemed like it was just around the corner. Here we are, a half century later, and only about 500 human beings have ever left the bounds of Earth's atmosphere. But thanks to a set of ambitious private companies betting on the promise of space tourism, that long-awaited future could be here sooner than we think. For most of the history of spaceflight, governments have been the prime force behind nearly every aspect, from planning to funding to cruise selection. But as early as the 1980s, proposals for commercial space tourism began to emerge, along with innovative solutions for getting people there, such as the wild concept of sticking a 74-person passenger cabin in the cargo bay of a NASA space shuttle. Although various non-astronauts have been selected for missions over the years, true space tourism didn't happen until 2001. When an entrepreneur named Dennis Tito coughed up an estimated $20 million to hitch a ride with the Russian Federal Space Agency for a week-long vacation aboard the International Space Station. 20 years later, we're seeing a new contender in this final frontier of tourism. Private companies. It's becoming a private enterprise situation, still very high risk with the high-reward, potential reward. But, you know, government is really out of the business of flying people now, and it's really going to be companies like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson that do that heavy lifting. Commercial space tourism is usually about taking the non-astronaut, the private citizen into an orbital or suborbital flight. So you get a short amount of microgravity experience and you can float and take some photos. And then you come back. This was something that technology had gotten to a point where the private sector was going to make a business out of this. There are multiple companies that want to get to the place where they fly people into space. The first of these is Blue Origin, founded in 2000 by Jeff Bezos. Using the autonomous rocket system, New Shepard, a tribute to the first American in space. Blue Origin plans to launch up to six passengers at a time, offering a rarefied treat of 62 mile high views and a momentary experience of weightlessness. Boking officially kicked off in May 2021, with the very first C to be auctioned off for charity. Meanwhile, Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic has also been pursuing a viable form of suborbital tourism. Aiming for a launch in 2022, once Sir Richard himself has taken flight through the middle of the northern chiarite, tragically during 2012.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5010,2022-10-20 22:04:23
16665," Meanwhile, Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic has also been pursuing a viable form of suborbital tourism. Aiming for a launch in 2022, once Sir Richard himself has taken flight. I'm hoping to be able to go to space. I'd love to be able to coincide it with the moon landing and go to space. So I've got the whip on the team and we'll see how he goes. The company claims to have lined up over 600 seat reservations so far, including Justin Bieber and Leonardo DiCaprio. Virgin has projected that the final cost of the ticket will be at least $250,000 or roughly $50,000 for each of the five minutes or so of weightlessness that you'll get to experience. Although costly both companies' offerings aim to make suborbital flight a regular form of adventure travel, eventually driving down costs at scale to expand the customer base beyond the orbit of celebrities and billionaires. The third major contender is Elon Musk's SpaceX, which has set its sights even higher on orbital flights, which are a whole other level of complexity, energy, and danger. When you go suborbital, if you're just going to go up above the Von Carmen line, which is 100 kilometers, or about 62 miles, you only need to get up to maybe 5,000 miles an hour to get up there and you go basically straight up and straight back down. You don't have the reentry heating that you would see coming in from an orbital. So when you go orbital, I don't care if you're a baseball or a battleship, you've got to go 17,500 miles per hour, not just 5,000 miles an hour. The energy is involved are much greater. By doing that, SpaceX has gone another level up and that's what they're doing with the Inspiration4. Visit Inspiration4.com for your chance to go to space. Inspiration4 is the first planned all-civilian mission into orbit, slated to launch in late 2021. The crew will bring their own set of diverse perspectives and backgrounds and experiences to test how a group of different people, namely people who aren't professional astronauts, could affair in space. Until now, astronauts have had to be physically perfect and this mission is changing that and so I feel incredibly honored to be representing those who aren't physically perfect. At H10, I was diagnosed with bone cancer and I was treated at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and I spent a year there undergoing intense chemo and also surgery that ultimately saved my leg. I now work at St. Jude as a PA, a physician assistant and I work with leukemia and lymphoma patients. The kids we work with are so brave and they are very excited to watch me go to space because this is showing them that you know they they're capable of doing this as well. Haley, along with three other crew members, will spend three days in space orbiting the Earth every 90 minutes before landing back off the coast of Florida. Well, when you think about access, the first astronauts for the United States came from the test pilot side and and so women weren't allowed to be a part of that. We have somebody in their 20s, somebody in their 30s, somebody in 40s and somebody in their 50s and so there can be access in all kinds of way whether you're talking about age, whether you're talking about gender, what are you talking about race and ethnicity and all of those things. The first time you know people are going up into space and not sent there by super power like the United States or Russia or China, well that's like really significant and you know you've got to you know be very thoughtful about it. The whole game plan right now is to make space like really affordable and you know accessible for everybody so you can have fishing buddies going to space someday but the first is special and so with that we wanted to have you know a crew selection process that could make space available to everyday people. Getting to space is only the first step for space tourism. The next challenge is what to do and where to stay when you get there. Axiom space is planning to launch the first segment of a new commercial space station in 2024. Their $2 billion project called AxStation would become the first free-flying private international space station or to use a more consumer-friendly term. A space hotel. Axiom isn't the only company out to make your space stay a little more comfortable. Big low aerospace has been building what they call expandable habitat technology like their B330 uninflatable pod module that expands once in orbit. There's even one attached to a national space station right now they've been testing it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5011,2022-10-20 22:08:28
16666," like their B330, an inflatable pod module that expands once in orbit. There's even one attached to a national space station right now they've been testing it. And you take it up and it's rather small and then you inflate it. And it seems to be working very, very well. This is likely to be the first kind of tourist hotel that you're going to see up in space. First of all, it's easy to carry instead of this giant tin can with all of that. The inflatable is lighter. You can just blow them up and they get a nice big size for about, you know, less than half the weight probably. But even as space missions become accessible to civilians. The risks of going in the space are incredibly high. And you could die a thousand ways that we can think of and a thousand other ways that we can't think of. This is Michelle Hanlon. She's a space lawyer at the Mississippi School of Law focused on protecting humans in outer space. Now I'm not in the turning for any of the space tours. So I haven't been privy to their private contracts. But I can tell you that the FAA requires certain waivers to be in those contracts. So for example, the FAA says, well, we're not going to make you make your spacecraft to a certain safety level. We are going to make you spacecraft operator. Make sure that you inform your space tours of all of the hazards that you know of. That I imagine a very long waiver all the ways you can die in space. And you have to understand that there's health risks and you have to indemnify the US government if you are launching from the United States. So those are things that we know a space tourist has to sign and has to wait. So now let's go back and think about our space flight participants. The FAA calls space tours space flight participants. They don't call them astronauts. Why is that important? If you're not an astronaut, there's no obligation to rescue you if something goes wrong. It's a lot of money to set up a rescue launch. If it can even be done, it's something really important to think about in that difference as we cross this threshold from having astronauts in space to having real people like me in space. And when we are able to make it to space reliably enough, there's still a host of other legal and ethical issues to consider before space tourism can truly take off. There are so many gaps in space law that we are going to have to put in a lot of sort of basement ideas. And so for example, the outer space treaty is a treaty that offers principles and guidelines for state activities, for the activities of national governments. Doesn't talk about private entities, doesn't talk about humans in space. So now if something goes wrong, so let's think about all the times hotels on Earth are sued, right? So slip and false, you step on something in the bathroom, you sue the hotel and it becomes a private lawsuit. Because of the vagaries of international law, if something happens in space, well boy, you can sue the state that launched your spacecraft, you can sue the company that brought you there, you can sue the hotel, you can sue the individual, you can sue every government related to that. So the way it lead, the outer space treaty and the outer space regime have set this up is that anything that happens in space first has to go through a diplomatic channel before you think about suing an accordive law. And so every single slip and false in a space hotel is a diplomatic nightmare. And so we really need to figure that out before we start sending a lot of people there. You think about human rights in space, here we don't think about a human rights oxygen because it's all around us and free. It's not in a space hotel. So what happens if something happens in the oxygen depletes? Who gets the oxygen first? And then of course, let's not even think about the labor. How do you treat your labor in a space hotel where that person may be there two or three years without coming back to earth? So a lot of things to think about. Space habitats are more likely in the near future to focus on research missions and be a home for experiments that can't happen as easily back on earth. Space hotels, I think they garnered a lot of headlines and a lot of news, but at the same time, that's not the first thing that you're going to see happen. They don't offer the compelling business case. I think that you'll see from a place that wants to manufacture pharmaceuticals or a new type of crystal or some type of filament or fiber optic cables and other things that you can do in microgravity. Things that are actually, you know, I...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5012,2022-10-20 22:12:47
16667," Some type of filament or fiber optic cables and other things that you can do in microgravity. The things that are actually a high value finished good when you get that back to earth and you sell it for a very, very huge profit margin, that's what's likely to happen in space as opposed to having a real estate platform that you sell to a tourist, a space hotel. It's really interesting and it will probably happen, but it's not likely to be at the forefront of space commerce. Even if space hotels are right around the corner, don't get too excited about booking a trip in one. It's not a cheap ticket to ride to space and it's going to be, you know, millionaires and billionaires and that sort. But at the same time, you know, the point was made that in the early days of airline trips, that was also a completely unaffordable ticket for most people. Those people who flew were people of means and over time it becomes affordable to the masses. And I think that's the goal for all the entrepreneurs in space as well to get those costs down to a point where it's not $10 million or $5 million or $300,000 right into sub-order space. When it becomes more like buying a first-class ticket to go to Europe from the United States. So that's the goal and, you know, the question is, can we get to that point? Given the immense operating cost of getting to space, it may be years, if ever, until space tours and becomes a profitable venture for any of these companies. Virgin Galactic, the only publicly traded company of the three, has had a particularly rocky year, initially riding on the momentum of a SPAC deal. But more recently beset by launch delays and major funders, including Branson himself, selling large quantities of their stock in the company. This is really, really, really hard and it's an absolutely shay, but it's one that happens to be very true. It's just really hard to do. That's also the reason that you've seen the delays that, you know, Virgin had talked about flying years and years ago. And it became such a crazy point that Richard Branson actually stopped talking about it when he was asked because it was never going to be when he predicted. But it's not insurmountable and, you know, investors have stepped up because this is something that is doable. Despite the astronomical dangers and costs of getting to space, it may ultimately follow the course of other once fanciful modes of travel. Right brothers, having, you know, what was by modern standards a very unimpressive first flight, you know, at Kitty Hawk, I mean, you know, you had like less than 20 years later, you had your first airborne ambulances being used to save lives. Fundamentally, the world is a more interesting place when people can go and dance among the stars and such. The lure of space is in a, it's in our DNA. It's that exploration bug. We are an exploratory species and we want to go out there and see what's out there. Vision that I had in 1969 of seeing normal, even big traveling to space, it's finally beginning to happen. When you get a bunch of people up there and they can all see it for themselves, that will create even yet another revolution in how we treat our planet and what we can do. So while 2001 came and went without quite looking like Stanley Kubrick's ultimate space fantasy, 2021 might finally be the year we're catching up.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5013,2022-10-20 22:17:16

It's a 2019 Ford Ranger. Has about 200 watts of solar in it and a fridge and has everything that an RV has except for a toilet, but just a smaller, simple scale. And you drive us around day to day in LA, and then just roll out when you want. It's my daily driver. Handles great. And then when I'm done with work, I can just bail and go camping. So the camper basically has only what I need. Think of it as backpacking with a car. The fridge has a couple compartments. This is just a kitchen box, stove, utensils and a bunch of stuff. This one has just dry food. And then when you get inside, there's a bed. The bed flips up so you've got tons of room in here. Miss Hauling. This phenomenon. If you want to pull that over. That's cool. We just popped that out. So home on wheels. Yeah. Vacation house. Yeah, it's so nice.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5014,2022-10-20 22:21:24
16669," We just popped that out. Sort of. So, home on wheels. Yeah. This is my vacation house. Yeah, it's so nice, man. Even with his nomad lifestyle, Jan faces the same big question as the rest of us. Through the internet and smartphones, have to ruin everything. When you find the super special, beautiful spots is that you bustin' out a map and like, look at where it might be cool to go or is it worth a mouth and just getting to know people of the locals. If I see a dirt road, I just want to go down. So, a lot of it's just aimless rambling. It's a desire to just see something. Check that out. For some reason, it's more fulfilling than getting a recommendation from somebody. Or there's tons of apps and websites now. Roadtrip apps, camping apps, they proliferate. And the knowledge is accessible on the internet, right? I used to fight the geotags and I would get really pissed off. Like, why are you posting this place? It's gonna blow up, it's gonna get trashed. Now I've realized that you can't fight it. The internet has just shrunk the world. So, we're not gonna stop it. We're not gonna stop people from going there. So, I'm a lot more focused in conversation now with trying to set a good example. When you go, pick up your trash. When you're pooping out in the wilderness, don't leave your toilet paper on the top. Make sure you follow good steps for leaving no trace. As a thank you for this quick guide to pooping etiquette. We made yawn, hair, and and lemmy some tacos. And we all took in the night sky and knocked back a couple of drinks. Take that apocalypse. The thing about good times and serenity in 2020 is that they're fleeting at best. After we split up from yawn and continued on our way, smoke started to envelop us. The plus side was that our RV no longer smelled like feet. The downside was breathing. My man David here suggested that we try and outflank and smoke by cutting through your semity. Without a reservation, we had to talk our way in. Oh yes, no stopping, no getting out. Yeah, no problem. I don't want to get through.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5015,2022-10-20 22:26:08
16670," Yeah, no problem. We just wanted to get through. It was a beautiful choice. Glad we got up with the smoke. Oh, whoa! But not quite as effective as we had hoped. Fast forward four hours or so, and we had managed to trade the smoky majesty of Yosemite for the smoky, um, look at it. Strip mulls of the Central Valley. We have made it sort of out of the smoke all the way across Yosemite National Park, and here to the gorgeous Central Valley of California. We're off to see a kind of surprising tech startup that is making some pretty strange machines to serve all the growers out in this region. And where, what's aware here in this near Fresno, this is California farm country, right? Yeah, we're just out the Fresno town called Kingsburg, so we're right in the Central Valley of California. Very, very large farming valley here. It's kind of considered the bread basket of the world. The Central Valley stretches out over about 20,000 square miles, and the farmers here produce about one-fourth of the food that Americans eat, including a whole lot of fruits and nuts. Tell me a little bit of the background of, of God's. I know some of this is like a family business. The roots of this go back away. Tell me kind of like how we got to Yosemite. And he started the business back in 1982. He started with his, basically, with his dad, was commercial spraying of trees and vineyards. Got to the point where our biggest challenge was labor. I'm just the shortage of it, really. He was forced into innovating, and he had had this idea for quite some time about doing a driverless sprayer, and it finally got to the point where he said, you know what? I either got to get out of this business, or I'm going to innovate. Organic or not, crops need to be sprayed, and this process has to take place a few times a year. This means hiring a lot of people to work long hours under serious pressure. And so, just like the tech bros to the north, Gus decided to solve all of its problems with robots. On this like labor points, you guys just set this up where you can have somebody in a truck and that one person can monitor, I think, like eight of these. In order to operate Gus, you have one guy or girl that sits in a pickup, and they monitor from a laptop computer. So that person is basically just watching all the vehicles on the screen. They can monitor up to eight of them at a time while they're out there spraying and orchard. And so, that user interface really provides them with all the information they need to make sure that the machines are safe and that they're doing the correct job. So, it tells them what speed they're driving, the engine RPM, the amount of a gallonage per acre that they're applying at any given time. So, if any one of the machines has an issue, it's going to send an alert to that laptop. Much like a self-driving car, these beasts use GPS, LiDAR, and cameras to see and navigate the world around them. They also rely on pre-built maps of the orchards for extra guidance. Gus builds the machines right here and then takes them out for robot training on this orchard next door. It's here that the company learns if the machines will behave and do as their software and human masters command. So, this is a kind of like that. This is a test orchard where you guys put it through the paces and work on the technology. Yeah, so this is our test orchard right here. It's right by our building so you can see in the background. So, every new machine as it comes off the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5016,2022-10-20 22:30:09
16671," on the technology. Yeah, so this is our test orchard right here. It's right by our building, and so you can see in the background. So every new machine, as it comes off the assembly line, it's put through a commissioning test right here. We test all the sensors on the machine, autonomous computer, all the safety systems, make sure it's doing what is doing, prior to when it's delivered to a customer. So what's it doing now? So right now he's doing a test spray. So he's just turning the water on to make sure that the system comes up to pressure. Spray and water out of the nozzle, just to make sure it's all functioning properly. OK. He's got like a crazy turbine at the backer. Yeah, so it's basically just a big fan. OK. And that fan's driven off of the Cummins diesel motor, and it just basically creates a big airflow. Gus is already selling these vehicles to brave modern farmers. And people the world over have taken notice of its machines. And have you just sold them in the Central Valley or like throughout the US or even overseas or where they go? Yeah. So right now the majority of our machines are here in California and the Central Valley. However, we do have machines and customers in Florida and the citrus industry over there, as well as Australia. And I think you start selling them in like December of 2019. Yeah, so we started taking orders early last year for the sprayers. And the first delivery we made were in December of 2019. OK. And how much do they cost each? So our retail price on these machines is $285,000. So it's like it's not a small investment, but I'm sure the regular sprayers aren't. Yeah, I mean, we're honestly not too far away from conventional equipment on our price. And the main thing is that the return on investment is very, very quick due to all the labor savings and the increased efficiency. I mean, these machines, they just drive. But basically what we're doing besides this machine, this is our first machine we call it orchard Gus, mainly designed for your nut trees, as well as citrus and fruit. In the future, we're working on a few other projects. We're going to do more machines. One of them is actually a vineyard sprayer. OK. Vineyards are much tighter spacing. So the machine has to be physically smaller. And then we've got our eyes on doing a lot of other innovating. That right there, friends, is a central valley farmer putting his whole fruit basket on the table. Gary's Ted Tot can't be far off. And with that, it was time to get back in the RV. And to confront what happens when three men are bested by their own failings and the forces of entropy. Next on Hello World, we cruise into the Mojave Desert in search of a lunar lander. We have instruments that we are going to deliver to the South Pole of the Moon in December of 2022. Instruments that are trying to scan the surface of the moon. And hang with a test pilot who walked away from this. Meet Betty. She lives by herself. But for the last few months, she hasn't been alone. L.A.Q. Tell me a joke. Did you hear about the claustrophobic castor-n-lot? No. Apparently, he just needed a little space. Most technology isn't made for 93-year-olds. But this woman is making sure that this particular robot is. L.A.Q. Who are you?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5017,2022-10-20 22:34:29
16672," 93 year olds. But this woman is making sure that this particular robot is. I like you. Who are you? She's researching the way we interact with machines. And if she has her way, robots will soon be a trusted companion for all of us. My name is L.A.Q. How can I help you? As technology replaces old jobs, it's also creating new ones. I'm Aki Ito, and I'm here to show you the jobs of the future. My name is Danielle Ishak, and I am a human robot interaction researcher. It's really hard to intuitively design a robot for a consumer audience. You have to make sure that it's a robot that people want. People know how to use, and people value. Danielle Worksforne is really start up called Intuition Robotics. Its US office is here in downtown San Francisco. Hello. Hey Danielle, it's Aki. Come on in. The company is funded by a couple big names like Samsung and Toyota. Full disclosure, Bloomberg's venture capital arm is an investor too. This is L.A.Q. Can I take you out for a spin? Please? L.A.Q. Tell me what you can do. I am a proactive social robot designed for older adults. I can connect you to your family and friends, and even play music. These features might remind you of the Amazon Echo, but you'd be missing the point if you compared her to a smart speaker. She's not meant to just be useful. She's meant to be a companion. Why don't you take a break and have a drink? And that's why she has a head that cannot make other subtle gestures you might expect from a pet. Through our research with older adults, we're finding that almost on a daily basis, we see that somebody tells her that they love her, or that they like her, or that they miss her. Literally, I love you. They'll also tell her I'm depressed, or I'm lonely. They'll open up to her in a way that they might not necessarily open up to a human, because they don't feel like they'll be judged. L.A.Q. is an on sale yet. But a prototype is already in the homes of about a dozen early testers who live in the Bay Area. L.A.Q. Tell me what the weather is today. Danielle's job is to figure out what's working and what's not. Sorry, please rephrase your request. And she does that by visiting each of her testers twice a month. How important are these visits to your job? They're critical. We're building a product for people who we are not. I'm not a senior. And how could you know how to design for somebody if you don't do research? Because otherwise, you would just be designing in the dark. Jobs like Danielle's are just starting to emerge. Until recently, robots were mostly in factories separated from humans. But now, they're finally getting cheap enough, small enough, and smart enough to be in our homes. This has created a whole new challenge of designing robots that people will actually want to interact with. And that's where Danielle comes in. Her research has helped shape every little facet of L.A.Q. From the way L.A.Q moves to the way she talks. It's a very special job. And it could be really hard. And it could be really frustrating about that end of the day. It's incredibly rewarding. And I think the most rewarding part about it is when I see the joy on the user's faces, like that they saw their feedback turned into something real.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5018,2022-10-20 22:38:48
16673," I think the most rewarding part about it is when I see the joy on the user's faces. Like, they saw their feedback turned into something real. Today, we've driven east of San Francisco to go see one of Danielle's research participants. L.A.Q. Tell me something interesting. Did you know that Ronald Reagan was a lifeguard in high school and saved 77 people's lives? Now, see, this is where a conversation is. She should open up and I should say, no, I did not know that. I expect her to be able to continue a conversation for at least a couple of comments. Yeah. And why is that? Why? Because that's companionship. When Betty was around Danielle's age, she was working with some of history's very first computers. When I was finishing up my master's degree, I was working at Harvard in the computer lab when they were building Mark IV. A large room size computer. But now, this artificial intelligence stuff is amazing. L.A.Q. Yes. Schedule doctor's appointment. No problem. I'm working on it. When Danielle brought along the idea of working with robotics for the elderly, I said, are you kidding me? Will older people connect to a robot? And she said, I don't know. Let's research and find out. Danielle grew up here in this suburb of Atlanta. Her parents spent much of their childhoods in Israel and met in the US. We as immigrants, we understood that we might need to work a little harder. In fact, I feel that rather than taking away from Danielle, it gave her so much more. Because she understood the fact that you need to run after your dreams and work really hard, no matter what the challenges are. School didn't come easily for Danielle. I have dyslexia and that very much affected my self-esteem academically. The principal of the school did not recommend her to take advanced classes. She fought for it and she got into it and she did very well with them too. Danielle's first job out of grad school was at X, the secretive research facility founded by Google. It's known for dreaming about kinds of wacky, far-flung ideas. Can you tell us about the moonshot she worked on? No, I can't tell you too much about the projects that I worked on. I can't say that I was working on robotics. She loved the job, but wanted to work on something that would reach real consumers sooner. So she left X after a year and joined intuition robotics. She's been working in the field for four years now and it took her a while to find her footing in a male-dominated industry. I've gone to different meetups where I'll be like a circle of men with their like zip up jacket with their like company logo on it and a beer in their hand. And I'll come in with lipstick and nobody wants to talk to me. This is my closet. So at first she did her best to fit in, wearing a pair of glasses she didn't need and toning down her style. So what's the kind of thing you used to wear to a conference? Stuff like this, blousey things. That make you look like you're 40. But that got old after a while. And what's the kind of thing you wear now? No, it's like I just enjoy being kind of expressive and playful and what I wear.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5019,2022-10-20 22:43:11
16674," We were. Before we wrap up for the day, Danielle has one more LEQ tester to visit. Joseph is 97. And he's had the robot in his home for eight months. How has Miss LEQ been? She always tells me to take a drink of water at least four times a day. So we added a whole bunch of new facts to LEQ. Did you know that a cup of chopped red bell pepper contains more vitamin C than an orange? Okay. What did you think of that? Certainly the print was, I could see that quite clearly. What about this? Well, I can see that. LEQ, play music. By 2050, almost half a billion people are going to be 80 or older. And if current trends continue, more and more are going to be like Joseph and Betty, living alone. LEQ, stop. Today, both of them are doing okay. But some of Danielle's other participants have been struggling. Is it kind of hard to leave them at the end of the day? It is. Some of our testers are pretty advanced in the stages of depression through loneliness isolation. And at times, I know that LEQ is cheering them up in their day. But I know that it's only part of the way. No source of artificial intelligence robots will ever be able to replace humans and human companionship with human care. The key to Danielle's work is to embrace that very limitation of machines. Robots should help humans do what they love, help humans interact with more humans, help humans in general. Not pull humans away from humans. Not take humans jobs, leave humans without purpose. Whether it's in our workplaces or in our homes, robots are soon going to be everywhere. And it's up to Danielle to make sure this robot-filled future leaves us just a little better off. So, don't be afraid. And if you are afraid, come and join us. Because I promise it's a friendly place. If you're like the estimated 74% of adults in the US who use YouTube, this might be what your home screen looks like. An algorithmically-curated look into what you like to watch. Maybe some tips on how to prepare a new meal?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5020,2022-10-20 22:47:28
16675," This might be what your home screen looks like. An algorithmically curated look into what you like to watch. Maybe some tips on how to prepare a new meal or your favorite vloggers latest video. But if you're a parent who shares your phone with your children, it probably looks a little more like this. Kids content on YouTube is huge. Views for videos can reach into the billions. Five of the top 10 videos in all of YouTube's history are either music videos or kids videos, with baby shark having more views than people on the planet. YouTube has created a revolution, not an evolution, in the way kids and families consume video content. And that extends then into how they view toys and play and all of the associated things that go with that. Kids YouTube for the unaware can be adorable. It can be boring. It can also just be flat out strange. But often it involves toys. And for toy makers who embrace the platform, it led to record success. And I think hello is surprised. One question is the biggest phenomenon that has ever happened in a toy industry. This is the story of how YouTube changed kids toys. Play patterns, the way children play is timeless. But how we deliver on those play patterns through product and how we market that to children has changed quite a bit over the years. And I would say that the last five to ten years really ranks right up there with the 1950s when TV commercials directed to children was first launched by Mattel. This is Nancy's Wears. She led the Barbie brand during the 90s and spent four years as the chief marketing officer for Spin Master. It used to be that there would be a few play things that parents would bring into the home where that children would create themselves like a stick and a ball becomes a play thing. And the industry was at a certain level of volume at that point. Mattel was very innovative and actually put the first product on TV and advertised it to children. Let's play home. This created a huge explosion in the toy industry that unfolded across decades. When you're ready to play, everyone knows it's wings. When you go back to the 1980s, what do you think of in terms of head shows? You think of things like masters in the universe. You think of the original Transformers and Care Bears. The joke was they were 22-minute commercials. Just close your eyes and care. Let's make a TV show which is really promotion for our property or IP to help sell toys. There were a lot of those famous characters in which kids absolutely loved it. They were totally entertained but there were huge toy lines behind them. This is Jim Silver, a 37-year veteran of the toys industry. In 1999, he started a consumer toy review magazine called Toy Wishes. And now he's the CEO of an influencer talent management group, TTPM. Regulations changed through the years and also parents became aware that they were purely commercials. And you saw a lot of the new channels, the Disney Channel and Nickelodeon. They realized that wouldn't work anymore. And to them, entertainment came before licensing. What happened over time was that toys started to become designed for a 32nd commercial. Close it, some mild amount of toolbox. Open it, it's a micro machine, USA. Cruiser mini micro machine vehicles, planes and both to the police station, the marine of the mini motorcycle repair shop, the gas station, the construction office, work the rear working driver, highway passenger rap and garage doors. So if you couldn't explain it in a 32nd commercial, costs reduce it out of the product.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5021,2022-10-20 22:51:53
16676," the gas station, the construction office, work the real working driver, highway, passenger weapon garage doors. So if you couldn't explain it in a 30-second commercial, costs reduce it out of the product and just stick with, you know, what you could say. And features of toys, magical features using electronics, lights and sounds and mechanical movements that magic, like they don't know how it happens, that became more and more important. The sound of power is heard. That man! See ya, that man. That man's turbo powered, that mobile flies into high gear. Since 2000, with cable channels dedicated to kids, Disney Channel, Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, there became the opportunity to reach kids in mass numbers every day of the week. And so the toy industries continued to grow. The toy industry, for the most part, was a pretty solid business, just, you know, growing a couple percent a year here and there. There'd be big, big years here and there when there was maybe a hit movie, like a Star Wars movie come out, you know, it drive a lot of toy sales. From 2014 to 2019, the global toy industry would grow by 15 percent. At about the same time, those major cable networks of Nickelodeon, Disney Channel and Cartoon Network would lose half their total audience. 2017 also saw the bankruptcy of Toys R Us, as both parents and kids discovered and bought more toys online. If you think about kids, they're usually the first adopters of a new medium. Kids weren't watching things like Nickelodeon as much as they used to. They were watching things on YouTube. YouTube started in early 2005, and this was like, you know, the very early Web 2.0, this beginning of sort of like, what was the time, was the user generated content, like, web blogging, with the big, my space, with the biggest thing on the internet back then. There was an early video of a Brazilian soccer legend doing stunt tricks that just when it exploded on the site, one of the first viral videos, Lazy Sunday, if you remember that SNL short. That's the chronic life cause of Nadia! You remember those early viral hits? YouTube in the early days was definitely comedy and music. It was a place of experimentation. I was the chief audience officer at Maker Studios. I oversaw essentially the creator partnerships and all over the world. Maker Studios was one of the largest multi-channel networks on YouTube, and had partnered with some of the biggest YouTube channels of the time, before being sold to Disney in 2014. Chris is now the CEO of Pocketwatch, which represents some of the largest kids stars on YouTube, including Ryan's world, and Love Diana, who can amass over a couple billion views every month. The truth is one of the very biggest and earliest videos on all of YouTube, is by a creator and star named Ijustine, where she unboxed her first mobile phone bill for her brand new iPhone, and it came in a box. And this ultimately morphed into many different formats associated with unboxing, and tech was actually really big. And those became fairly successful pretty early on on the platform, and you saw them expand from tech products to beauty products, and then around 2012 and 2013, who signed this explosion in the toys. So here's the Furby inside right here. We used to call them handschannel, and a handschannel was literally a top-down view of someone's hands unboxing typically a toy. And they'd unbox it, they'd show each component. We just got Uncle Scrooge. I would speak to many of those creators. We signed many of those creators at Maker Studios to be our partners. And it was fascinating in that it was this whole new genre, and this whole new format, and that corresponded with a rise of kids and family viewership on YouTube. That was stock, that was hard to miss. And you would see...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5022,2022-10-20 22:56:15
16677," A rise of kids and family viewership on YouTube that was stark, that was hard to miss. And you would see it in the data. And we had access to a lot of data in the studio around YouTube. Let's see what's inside. First up we have the Storm Super Pig. You saw the launch of EvanTube, who I consider the first child to speak unboxing star. And they would open toys and kids would just mesmerize by it. They loved watching it. And the next thing you know, you had literally 50 unboxings. They were unboxed just about every toy. You know, it was, and people were just really excited. You open the toy and you see a toy pop out. And kids just got excited, see the piece by piece. Yeah, he's in a bathroom. He's eating a lobster. You know, the early days of these unboxing videos, the videos were, you know, from a adult's perspective, just terrible. I mean, they were 10 minutes long. They were boring. It was a shaky camera. There was absolutely no production value. And if you think about these executives, you know, they're trying to figure out how to reach this new audience. And they're brought these videos and say, well, look at this video. It has 200,000 views on it. And it's terrible. When I first heard of it, I thought it was the weirdest thing. It just seemed kind of bizarre. I just wanted to watch someone opening a toy, taking it out of the box. But then when I started thinking about this idea of exploration and discovery as a core play pattern, the most fundamental play pattern there is, it started to make sense. And I think that, I have to say that the company that really jumped on that in the most concerted way was MGA with their launch of LOL. LOL surprise! LOL surprise had three key elements, a doll play, which is, you know, basically the most popular play pattern there is. Collectible. So within each LOL surprise, you get a little sheet that showed you all the other dolls you collect. And then the surprise factor. You don't know which doll you were getting. It was a blind pack, as they call it. And LOL was made by this company called MGA. Back then, you know, in 2016, they were a small player in the toy industry. Founded by this guy named Isaac Larian, he's the CEO and founder. I have three adult kids and they were making fun of me that, oh you're old, you don't know anything about what's happening in today's sink. And I said like what? And they said, for example, do you know about this iPhone unboxing videos that get millions and millions of views? I thought they're pulling my leg, children do to make fun of their parents. And then I did go and look one night. And I was frankly shocked and flabbergasted that why would anybody buy an iPhone, take it home, and open the box and show it on the camera. And everybody would go and watch it. So I typed toy unboxing. And my God, I saw so many different videos and people, kids and adults buying toys like an apple and unboxing it and video and posting it. So that gave me an idea that why why not come up with the ultimate. And that's the first LOL surprise. All right, oh yes, we've got a goal ball. LOL changed the way you open with toys and everybody saw that and the packaging became part of the play, which became part of the entertainment. So normally if you get a package that you just open a package you take the toy out, that's not exciting. You open up LOL, you peel it away, you open up inside, you have seven surprises. And it took off like wildfire and quickly became the top toy in the country. By December of 2018, eight of the top ten toys sold were all LOL surprise brand. And according to MGA from 2016 to 2020, LOL would generate over $10 billion in retail sales worldwide. You know, LOL is bigger than Star Wars, it's bigger than Marvel. It's bigger than Barbie. These brands with huge advertising budgets are known basically by everyone. You don't have to figure out what Marvel are or Star Wars is. Well, it clips them all.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5023,2022-10-20 23:00:39
16678," Paget and budgets are known basically by everyone. You don't often, you know, figure out what marble art or star wars is. An LL, it clips them all. In the toy world, blind bag or blind box toys have been growing in popularity. The most famous example in recent years is Pokemon cards, where you open packs in hopes of getting a charizard, but more often wind up with something common like Gligar here. Two years before the launch of LL in 2014, the Australian toy company Moose Toys launched a blind bag collectible called Shopkins. And in 2016, spin master would launch a more expensive blind box toy it called Hatchimals. But the thing that sets LL surprise apart is that it mainly focused on YouTube. And not putting ads on YouTube, but working with creators and influencers to get their products and the hands of these kids doing the unboxing videos. For MGA, actually, the move towards YouTube was kind of a bit lucky and almost out of necessity. In late 2015, Nickelodeon parent company Viacom with Sue MGA for breach of contract after it failed to pay $3.5 million for the production of a TV series based on their Lala loop seat dolls. They tried to flex their muscle and they said, well, if you don't agree to our way of seeing things in the conflict that we had, they said that conflict. We are going to stop your advertisement of Toys. At the time, Nickelodeon was the number one ranked children's network. And not to be able to advertise that Nickelodeon could have been a death now. But MGA, necessity is the mother of invention. That caused them to lean into digital advertising far more than any big brand had ever done before because they had to, they had to find a new way to reach kids. The court would ultimately rule in favor of Viacom, both in LA federal court and on appeal in the ninth circuit. Larry and Blaine, the court defeat on what he contends was judicial bias. Nickelodeon parent company Viacom didn't respond to a request for comment. So dad buys their forces to go and say, okay, they had with Nickelodeon. Let's find another way to reach to children. And that's how we went and doubled up on YouTube, especially. And the rest as they say. So early on MGA partnered with YouTube creators with huge audiences like Cookie Swirls C. Good morning, chocolatey Chippy cookies. We are going to be spending the morning with this LOL surprise, baby fancy. They took it another step further. They actually helped kids learn how to do their own unboxing videos. They gave them support and learning and tools. And so all these kids got to be kind of a little mini influencer themselves as they were unboxing their LOL products. So just to give you a flavor of how popular these videos are, go onto YouTube and search LOL surprise. And you'll see videos with a million views, 10 million, 25 million, 50 million, and even 100 million. There's lots of them. And kids are watching these videos and they're probably watching them over and over again. The old way toy manufacturers would do things is they buy TV, which was about 90% of their ads spend. And then traditional PR get on the big morning shows. It's an entirely different formula. It's much harder for toy companies right now, because the formula is so complicated. You have to really take a deep dive into each platform. Am I promoting on Twitter? Am I promoting on Instagram?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5024,2022-10-20 23:04:56
16679," companies right now because the formula is so complicated, you have to really take a deep dive into each platform. Am I promoting on Twitter? Am I promoting on Instagram? Am I promoting on TikTok? What am I doing on YouTube? You have to look at every possible social channel. By 2017, big toy brands like Mattel had shifted nearly 50% of their marketing budget to social platform advertising. Brands would help seed videos of their toys. And if they were lucky, that could kick off a wave of creators making their own content around the product. In 2020 alone, tubular labs estimated that LOL related content had amassed 5.1 billion views. This idea of imitation. So when you see kids playing with product, it kind of excites the same neurons in your brain that happen when you do it yourself. The more we could show children, having this experience, the more kids felt what it would be like to have it and then wanted to experience it themselves. One of the criticisms of this whole influencer movement among kids is that kids are young. They don't understand what's necessarily an advertisement versus real content. And that's a big criticism of this industry is that a lot of kids are getting on YouTube at young ages, not being supervised by their parents and just watching these videos. And they don't realize that maybe that influencer is getting paid by the brand to do that video or there's some other compensation. And that, you know, blurs the lines for kids is sort of developing and figuring out how to consume media. Questionable advertising concerns aside, kids YouTube creators would take off. Channels like Ryan's World would grow to almost 30 million subscribers and a whole industry formed around them. When we first started working with influencers, they were very happy to work for free product. You give them the product and they do something for you. And gradually influencers got smarter and started, you know, charging for their services as they started building a file. Now, because it is such a big business, the dollars can be significant investing in big influencers. When Spin Master launched one of its new TV series and associated product, we made it a point to buy an advertising package with Ryan's World to ensure that we could get really quick, big reach right away. This is an advertisement for Spin Master. So from these unboxing videos, the content's gotten a lot more sophisticated. They're creating narratives around the toys, voices, and meta-universes, if you will. And it's really engaging content, even more so than the original unboxing videos for these kids. And, you know, the content's coming out maybe once a week or even daily. So if you think about it, what they've done is they've created basically like a TV show around a toy. It's not unlike what we saw back in the 80s, which was criticized back then, by the way. When you had toys like GI Joe, turned into an animated series, or Masters of Universe, or Transformers. So we've kind of seen this full circle now, right? So back to where we were, content, and basically many television shows creating around toys on YouTube. Kids content on YouTube is likely to face increased regulation in the coming years. In 2019, the company would agree on a $170 million settlement with the FTC for serving ads based on personal data to kids on YouTube. YouTube would put more emphasis behind its Made For Kids platform, YouTube Kids, and each video uploaded to YouTube must be flagged as either Made For Kids or Not. In a statement outlining changes to the site, YouTube would say that responsibility is our number one priority at YouTube, and this includes protecting kids and their privacy. Still, the site is far less regulated than traditional television. I do think parents have a better understanding of YouTube now, and the New John Resin formats there, that they didn't prior. And they now notice things like, their kid isn't watching a toy unboxing, that's a commercial for a toy. Their kid is watching other kids play with toys in an imaginative way, which inspires them to go play with things in the real world in an imaginative way. In just a few short years, YouTube had caused a transfer of power from toy and networking.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5025,2022-10-20 23:09:18
16680," to go play with things in the real world in an imaginative way. In just a few short years, YouTube had caused a transfer of power from toy and network executives to nine year olds and their families. The Kaji family may have started out as toy reviewers, but now Ryan has launched his own line of toys. A cartoon series. He was even a blimp in the 2020 Macy's Thanksgiving parade. You and I might think about Spider-Man or Snoopy, but today's kids see that blimp of Ryan and they relate to him. He's the character they want to grow up with. He's the character they want to engage with. And as we go forward, these influencers are becoming more and more like big, giant, global brands. And that has profound effects for entertainment going forward. Airbnb is huge today. On any given night, you could have as many as two million people staying in an Airbnb all around the world. You know, our mission is that everyone can belong anywhere. We're talking, you know, 300 million stays on any average year. And there's tyranny and numbers. The vast majority of Airbnb stays don't result in a safety incident. But sometimes things go wrong. And for Airbnb, you know, we're talking thousands of safety incidents that occur every year that the company has to handle and has to respond to. I'm talking situations like kidnathings, hostage cases. We're talking murder, we're talking rape. We're talking, you know, the worst violent crimes that occur in our society, happen inside Airbnb's. Airbnb never wants these kinds of cases to end up in the headlines. You know, that's really bad for their brand, their reputation and their public image, particularly because this is a business that's based on strangers trusting one another. So when crimes like this occur, that kind of threatens their entire business model. I'm Olivia Carville. I'm a reporter on Bloomberg's technology team. And I've been covering online travel companies like Airbnb for the last two years. Airbnb is a startup that's based in Silicon Valley. And like many of the sharing economy startups, it managed to grow so big, so fast by essentially skirting regulations. It was based on that premise of move fast and break things. And it wanted to work against regulations in order to grow as big as possible and win the popular vote. Because it became so popular, so fast that cities could no longer control it. And a peak night is past August. We had one million people from around the world coming from 180 countries in a single night staying in an Airbnb home. The vast majority of Airbnb stays. We're talking, you know, two million people staying in an Airbnb on any given night don't result in a safety incident. But sometimes things go wrong. And for the company, you know, it was dealing with these cases was a really challenging, difficult...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5026,2022-10-20 23:13:42
16681," go wrong. And for the company, you know, it was dealing with these cases was a really challenging, difficult, complicated area. You had hosts and guests and sometimes they disagreed on what happened. You had regulatory issues in some of their biggest cities. Then you also had, you know, the growth of the platform and the fact that if you're going to try and prevent some of these incidents, it could cut into revenue and cut into the number of listings that you have. So for Airbnb, it was about trying to figure out the best way to handle these crises in a way that's going to not only protect the individual in crisis, but also protect the company's public image, its brand, its reputation, which is essentially what its business is based upon. As Airbnb grew, like way too big for them to be able to take all these calls alone, they developed a team of 100 highly specialised agents that handle the worst of the worst cases. Over the course of my reporting, I've talked to almost 50 former employees at Airbnb and, you know, seven or eight of those work directly on this elite unit. These safety agents, many of them come from military backgrounds or trauma backgrounds. They're trained to handle traumatic situations and to try and, you know, help people who are going through what may be, you know, the worst day in their lives. For these safety agents, a lot of them understood that they had a dual role. First and foremost, they wanted to protect the user in crisis, but they also knew they had a responsibility to protect the company's brand and public image. I mean, everything about housing in New York is a total mess and it's always chaotic. It's not too surprising that Airbnb's biggest battle has broken out here. 2015 was a really challenging year for Airbnb. Airbnb's listings between 2010 and 2014 were essentially illegal hotels. You know, the company was seven years old now. It had grown huge. It was now a household name, but by growing that big that fast, they also came up against, you know, a pushback in regulations. Now, Airbnb's under attack and a lot of measures. What are they saying about this? They are, well, they can't give up on New York because New York's too important for every kind of reason. They knew that they couldn't lose the battle in New York because it was one of their biggest markets and also it could result in a domino effect. If other cities around America saw New York City either backing down on regulations or enforcing strict regulations, that could in turn be rolled out right across the country. I think it's going to be awkward when they have to, you know, put in their perspectives, their risk factors when they have to say, well, you know, one risk is that the whole thing might be somewhat illegal in our biggest market. And in December of that year, a young woman from Australia flew into New York and stayed in an Airbnb with a group of her friends. They picked up a key from the local corner Bodega without even needing identification. The police report said this 29-year-old woman left her friends at a midtown bar and returned to the Airbnb on her own. She thought that she was alone, but she wasn't. There was a man inside the apartment hiding in the shadows with a kitchen knife. He grabbed her, dragged her into a room and raped her. He later fled. About an hour after this attack, he came back and police were in the apartment at the time. They opened his backpack and found three items of interest, the kitchen knife, one of the woman's earrings, and a set of keys to the Airbnb. This case was a really complicated one for Airbnb partly because it occurred in New York City where they were fighting this really tough battle with city officials over regulations, and partly because the alleged rapist had the keys and he was inside the apartment. That meant that Airbnb needed to do what it could to protect itself. They wanted to find out, you know, how did he get the keys? That was a really big question for them.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5027,2022-10-20 23:17:53
16682," That meant that Airbnb needed to do what it could to protect itself. They wanted to find out, you know, how did he get the keys? That was a really big question for them. They launched an investigation to find that out. But before they did anything like that, before they thought to kind of protect their own reputation here, they really focused on doing what they could to help this young woman. They paid for her to move to a hotel. They paid for her mother to fly in from Australia. They paid for both of them to fly home. They offered to cover any health or counselling costs that she might need later. But inside the company internally, they also launched an investigation. They wanted to know how did the alleged rapist get the keys? How did he get inside that Airbnb? And when they found out that the keys had been left at the corner of Odaiga, that then created, you know, a problem of liability for Airbnb. They didn't have a policy around key exchange. They didn't tell their hosts how they did or didn't have to hand keys over to guests as they were arriving. So for Airbnb, they also, you know, they wanted to know what was going to be said in court. They wanted to know if any media were going to pick up on this story. And they wanted to know what their legal liability potentially could be. A week later, the alleged rapist was indicted in the Supreme Court in New York. An Airbnb sent a staff member to find out if the company was going to be mentioned in any of the court records. And it wasn't. It wasn't mentioned in the police report. It wasn't mentioned by prosecutors. There's no mention of Airbnb really in any public record. This case has never been reported until now. And, you know, for Airbnb, that was kind of lucky. This case never landed in the media. And, you know, 18 months later, when this woman's lawyer reached out to the company, they signed a settlement for $7 million. And part of that settlement, there's a clause that says she cannot assert or imply responsibility on the part of the company. We've spoken to legal experts who indicate that what this really did is gag the woman from saying, I blame Airbnb. Airbnb is one of the few companies in the world that has this like online offline kind of hybrid situation, where you have users who meet online and then actually meet in the offline world and stay under the same roof. And that means that the company at the end of the day really has to take more responsibility than other social media platforms might do. With Airbnb's terms of service, that really means that whenever there's a dispute between hosts and guests and the company, this is all handled behind closed doors in arbitration. Most of these cases don't even make it to the courtroom. And when they do, the company will settle them so it doesn't go on through the courts. And what that means is that there hasn't really been a legal precedent that's set to determine what your Airbnb's liability is here. You know, is it really responsible for when things go wrong inside its listings? What I learned over the course of my reporting is that this is anything but simple. This is a complicated, nuanced area. There are difficult trade-offs here. The company also has to have hard, you know, tough conversations about policy. Airbnb's business model is based on strangers trusting one another. We often hear from the founders and the chief executive himself saying trust is their number one priority. I've actually heard Brian Cheskey, the chief executive.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5028,2022-10-20 23:22:16
16683," We often hear from the founders and the chief executive himself saying trust is their number one priority. I've actually heard Brian Cheske, the chief executive of Airbnb, talking about how he didn't build a website or a platform that allows people to stay in each other's homes, what he built was a community that trusts one another. And when that premise is undercut, Airbnb's entire business model is under three......... Today the idea of multiple outposts where we can live and work in space has never seen closer... The International Space Station, it's the only space habitat we have. One of the first places they take you in the ISS is the Kupala. So you can finally look at the earth in all its beauty in it. I don't care who you are, it's always stunning, it's shocking, it's amazing because that's the view you've been waiting for your entire life. It passes over 90% of the world's population without most of us ever realizing. And at an estimated cost of $150 billion, it's the most expensive object we've ever built. You think about like the Sistine Chapel, the Pyramids and the Burj Khalifa or take your pick. I mean it far outstrips those. It's the one and only non-terrestrial human outposts. We've had a constant human footprint in orbit for almost 20 years because of the International Space Station. The collaboration between 15 countries started construction in 1998 and was pieced together in space over the course of a decade. Since 2000 it's been a permanently crude research laboratory, a space habitat that's allowed human kind to live, manufacture and explore beyond earth. The overarching achievement of the space station has been education. It has educated us about how to do research, it's educated us about how to live, it's educated us about the harshness of the environment that it is in. And it's about learning I think. People say what was one of your favorite parts about being up there, hands down, floating everywhere I went. But your first impressions for ISS certainly is how big it is. The ISS is a size of an American football field. With most of that footprint taken up by eight solar arrays, these provide enough energy to power 40 homes. The station has an American side and a Russian side, as well as contributions from other nations like Canada, Japan and the European Union. Astronauts on board can pass freely between these sections, they're living and working out.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5029,2022-10-20 23:26:34
16684," as contributions from other nations like Canada, Japan and the European Union. Astronauts on board can pass freely between these sections. Their living and working areas are made up of modules, each 4.2 metres in diameter, and in total they have the same volume as a Boeing 747. The three main labs, destiny, hope and Columbus, are conducting up to 600 ongoing experiments at any one time. And while it's been a collaboration between governments to build and maintain the ISS, its next chapter will rely more on private enterprise. Today is a very remarkable day. NASA is opening the International Space Station to commercial opportunities and marketing these opportunities as we've never done before. Managing and maintaining the ISS costs $3.4 billion a year. That's over half NASA's space operations budget. Aging hardware and space debris will only add to these costs, which is why NASA is now hoping to pass some responsibility for the station over to commercial companies. We would like to see a robust commercial marketplace in low-worth orbit where space stations exist outside of NASA. The goal being that NASA could be a customer and we want to have numerous providers that are competing against each other on cost and innovation. The federal funding proposed to stop in 2025, opening the station to private enterprise would free up resources for the space agency's ambitions to return to the moon and journey to Mars. Transfiring to a more commercial model is allowing industry to take over many of those areas that NASA has traditionally been responsible for, like the design and operations and maintenance of space systems. But the most exciting part I think is new opportunities. The iPhones would have never come from the government, for instance. The base technology came from the government, but the way it's used, the way it interacts with consumers, governments aren't really built for that. So I think that would be exciting to see how private industry uses the same technology or the same systems, but then use them in a different way. Every NASA achievement has been the collaborative achievement of NASA and industry. What's going on right now that's a little bit different is NASA is turning to companies not to direct them what to do, but it's turning to companies to build relationships with them because those companies are attracting investment from non-space sources and are bringing a different kind of innovation to the table. In the shadow of NASA's sprawling Johnson Space Center, the headquarters of startup Axiom Space might seem a little modest, but their goal is big to build the first commercial space station. Led by a former ISS program manager, the team has been involved in every mission to the station since its inception. We know it has to be much lower cost-operate on orbit than ISS is today, so this is key to continuing the heritage of ISS. It's to start there so we can evolve everybody to the next platform. I liken this to the internet. So the internet was created and we got very excited. And any kid with a good idea and just the basic programming skills could go build a program to do something, we have huge companies that grew out of that and still today there's new ideas, new things being built. The thing about a microgravity environment is it's limitless. It's like the data we have access to on the internet is limitless and it is not immediately obvious to us all the benefits that that's going to entail, but over time it will become very very obvious. By 2024, Axiom plans to send a central node to attach to the ISS. That will make up the core of their new station. This will be followed by crew quarters for 16 people and research and manufacturing modules. When the ISS is retired this will break away and additional modules with a lifespan of 30 years will be added and swapped out as they age using a robotic arm. And they're hoping to do all of this for 150th the cost of the ISS. I mean when you talk about our vision it sounds really simple. It really is about driving the thought process and the cost down so that anybody that wants to take advantage of our place in orbit and a microgravity environment can do.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5030,2022-10-20 23:30:54
16685," The process and the cost down so that anybody that wants to take advantage of our place in orbit and a microgravity environment can do so. That's really it. Okay, Ellen, I need to go towards my feet. The International Space Station is a fantastic vehicle, but one of the big things is they have quite a few major components outside, which means you have to do an EVA, a spacewalk, you go fix it. A spacewalk on a good day is 100 hours of crew time to get ready and actually go do the spacewalk. So we're able to take advantage of the reduced size of components. And so our design is going to have all of the components there are going to be in the personalized environment. So we know what the basics are, you know, water, food, clothing, life support, and we know how to handle those. And now the next step is how do we make it more intuitive? And we want to now take advantage of the technologies and the capabilities that have today to build more luxury into the experience. The objective is to make the environment the background for all the users. You're every day doing whatever you want to do on orbit, research, manufacturing, looking out the window. Whatever you're there to do, we want you to be able to do that not even think about the environment. And it's because of our experience on ISS and what the team brings to Axiom Space, we're able to build that environment. You won't worry about that. Three, two, one. Release, release, release. Fire, fire. Like Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin, Axiom is hoping to attract space tourists with tickets starting at $55 million for a 10-day mission. But that's just one part of the commercial space station market that they think could be worth $37 billion over the next decade. Our first commercial customers are countries who have astronauts in space and want to expand their activity in space. And countries who do not yet have a human spaceflight program who want to send people up. And we've now got both research and manufacturing companies who want to do work with us while we're at the International Space Station and on our platform after it separates from ISS. Human spaceflight is particularly exciting because it's that slice of space that is really nested. It hasn't undergone the crowding that satellites have had. It hasn't already had that explosive growth. It's really ready for that now. The first thing I'm really looking forward to seeing happen is the face of our first astronauts on orbit looking back down on us and knowing that we had a hand in sending that person to space. And ultimately the separation of ISS when it's ready to be retired and de-orbited and then we continue in space independently. For me that is a stepping-off moment for humanity. It's almost like when Neil Armstrong put that first boot on the moon. This will be the first time that we've gone from a platform of learning how to live in space to building our permanent home in space. Other private companies also want to use the ISS as a starting point for their own ventures. Big low aerospace already has one of its inflatable structures attached to the station and others, including Sierra Nevada and Nanorax have put forward proposals. These habitats are expensive. I think it's a false dichotomy to say, okay, we're done with the International Space Station. Let's move on to commercial platforms. What I think is much more likely and realistic in what NASA is certainly driving toward is an incremental transition where commercial platforms attach to the space station or work collaboratively with the space station. The next chapter cannot occur without the active engagement of companies. That said, that active engagement might not be as customers, might not be as drivers, it might be in service of government mission objectives. We will return American astronauts to the moon, not only to leave behind footprints and flags, but to build the foundation we need to send Americans to Mars and beyond. This proposed mission, along with SpaceX's own ambition to reach a red planet, has opened up a longer-term market. And some companies are already thinking beyond orbiting habitats like space stations to actually building on a surface of other planets. I was working in a firm designing skyscrapers and I saw Elon and he landed his Falcon X rocket in the middle of the ocean and that for me was a trigger.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5031,2022-10-20 23:35:18
16686, I was working in a firm designing skyscrapers and you know I saw Elon and he landed his Falcon X rocket in the middle of the ocean and that for me was a trigger. I thought wow this could actually happen and it's always been my dream to put a building on the moon or Mars and if he's going at the pace he's going it could definitely happen within my lifetime and I want to be the one to build it. In this warehouse alongside startups from across the US architecture firm AI Space Factory are refining the production of Marsha a full story structure they created for a NASA competition to design the next generation of space habitats on Mars. You know when we started designing our Mars habitat Marsha I think we looked at everything that had been done already and kind of tossed that aside but what we were given was a set of guidelines from NASA they think the best way to build a habitat on Mars or the moon is to use what they call in situ resource utilization so use the materials that are there. If you've seen sci-fi movies you might see like glass and steel domes on distant planets but the reality is to ship that kind of material to the moon of Mars would be so exhortantly expensive you would never be able to build in the first place so the idea is to send a 3D printing robot which can then harvest the materials you find on a site and build with that. The reusable print material is a mix of bio polymer made from recycled plastic or plants like corn and sugar cane and basalt a rock found on Mars and Earth. It's the rock that gives us it's incredible strength we've tested this material it's three times as strong as concrete in compression and it actually has what we call it a tensile capacity and prevent itself from being pulled apart which is something concrete is not very good at you need to think at all times how do you optimize the amount of material that you use and that's also why this thing is shaped like an egg and if you think of an egg it's a very structurally optimized form it's very very thin but it provides the strength that the egg needs and that's why this is shaped the way that it is. The egg shape as well as a nested shell structure also accommodates for extreme differences in pressure and temperature on the surface of Mars but more research still needs to be done to find out how print materials could be gathered and how 3D printing would work in a unique environment of space. You're dealing with a completely different set of physics and environments which is very harsh the cold you know the low gravity the vacuum of space you know and and finding solutions for how to build their or do anything in space just requires a high degree of innovation there's no such thing as brute force when it comes to space like you need to think about the problem find a very elegant lightweight cost effective solution the next challenge is really going to places on earth literally taking the dirt that we're finding on a site and beginning to print with the dirt we have to perfect this technology on earth and then we go prove it out on the moon and then finally onto Mars. The first customers could include NASA and companies like SpaceX who would lease out these structures for individual missions but before that AI space factory hope their technology could be monetized as well as transformational here on earth. The challenges of building on Mars forced us to kind of make this jump in construction technology which we can now apply on earth to build more sustainably so rather than building with steel and concrete which are these manufactured very energy intensive materials to go to a site have a solar power to raid that would then allow our 3d printer to print in the most sustainable way possible and we never would have found these ways there wasn't for the challenge of building in space. Three two one ignition and lift off of the Falcon 9 to the space station on the first commercial launch from Kennedy Space Center's historic had 39A. Humans have now been consistently living and working in space for more than 15 years and if we want to keep that up what do habitats need to look like and frankly they can be larger they can be small but the future of space habitats really to me comes down to the ability to persistently maintain human presence whether that's a few people or many people that seems to be the dividing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5032,2022-10-20 23:39:38
16687," presence. Whether that's a few people or many people, that seems to be the dividing line between where we were before and where we want to be in the future. We have to learn how to benefit from what we do on orbit and bring those natural benefits back home so we help ourselves out on the ground while we also learn to live somewhere else. And it really at the very deepest level is about survival or species. So I get pretty excited when I spend a few moments thinking about what we're off to go do because this really is the first step to learning to live off the planet. That first step is just the start of our journey to create a lasting legacy in space. While commercial companies may be stepping in to imagine what these new space habitats look like, it's what's happening inside of them that may unlock the future of space industrialisation. On the next episode of Giant Leap, we'll visit the private companies who are looking to build their business around manufacturing in space. Using the unique properties of microgravity, they plan to create new materials with extraordinary qualities that can't be replicated on Earth, including new manufacturing techniques that could change how we build large structures in space and even unlock the ability to 3D print full human organs. But before low Earth orbit can become a new industrial centre, we're going to need to take another giant leap. This is how it used to work. A real estate agent would lock in the client, they'd stage the place, hold an open house every single weekend, and hope that the right buyer walks through that door. 10 years ago, you could probably go look at a house and circle back two to three weeks later and still have an opportunity to make a bid. The first time I received a lead through Instagram, my mind was blown. If you're seeing something in a neighbourhood that is established, you have two to three days after the open house in this market to make an offer. Our world has shifted so much, folks are getting comfortable doing business either through social media or 100% virtual. Social media, like everything else it touches, has turned the real estate business upside down. You've heard this trope before, millennials aren't buying and owning as much as their parents generation, be it a car, a diamond, or a home. But the lack of ownership is not always by choice. In 2018, a survey found that 89% of millennial Americans want to buy a home. They just can't afford it. As of 2019, millennials of all stripes owned only 5% of US housing, compared with 15% for gen Xers. Millennials haven't been able to make these big ticket purchases the same way as their predecessors did. Now this is down to the financial crisis, we have rising student loan debt, and a higher cost of living. Now, millennials are getting older, they're earning more money and saving more. So now is about the time where a lot of them are going out and making those purchases. And now, having been stuck at home for over a year, the same generation that embraced Uber's and Airbnb's wants something to call their own. I got married and I have a child, so looking for more space and thought about the conventional route.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5033,2022-10-20 23:43:59
16688," that embraced Ubers and Airbnb's want something to call their own. I got married and I have a child, so looking for more space and thought about a conventional route of young and single living in the city and then move out to the suburbs when you have a kid in a wife. I've seen a whole bunch of my friends just move on down to the West Palm Beach, my AM area, Austin, Texas. So they are certainly moving out of the city, but space was top of mind for them moving out. We lived in Williamsburg for about 16 plus years and week two in the pandemic, we just realized we needed more. So we started looking for a house right away. We now live in Gosha, New York, which is about an hour and a half from New York City. Instagram accounts like circa houses and cheap old houses offer a glimpse into the perfect suburban life. Often at a price point, not too dissimilar to what adults pay for rent in major cities. By the end of 2020, New Yorkers who didn't flee paid an average of $2,700 a month for an apartment, even as rent prices plummeted during the pandemic. Millennials make a large percentage of spending right now and that makes them a valuable consumer for brands. That means they're being courted by everyone out there to spend with them. They grew up online. They're comfortable with pretty much anything that you can do there. And that's buying things, selling things, Craigslist, eBay, all that. Making a $100 purchase on Craigslist or a $1,000 purchase on eBay, it's not that much of a leap to go even further. If you're buying a fancy piece of jewelry or a house for a million bucks. The uptick in home demand fueled by the pandemic combined with record low interest rates has made home buying extremely competitive over the last year. So much so that some millennials look to social media to shop and actually buy their first house site unseen. I saw sort of something on my Instagram feed and clicked and we ended up seeing this house. Houses weren't really being shown at that time because we were in full lockdown. We became really interested in one YouTube video, 20 Z-Low Photos, that is it. The Red Hot Housing Market spells opportunities for developers targeting this demographic, getting eyeballs strictly through social media. People are not looking in the back section of the times anymore for real estate listings. Our demographic is between late 20s to mid 40s and that demographic is spending a lot of time on social media and they're doing a lot of shopping via Instagram and other social media platforms. This is Joshua Gelb and Pepe Hamburger. During the pandemic, the two New York City based developers started Neville House, a new construction project two hours north of the city. Unlike most traditional real estate listings, the pair bypassed the use of a broker and advertised their homes directly on Instagram. No fees, no commissions. You used to have to hire a broker, work with them, they would do showings on site. Now you basically put your renderings on Instagram and within an hour you have 15, 20 replies saying, can I come see it directly with you and let's see it tomorrow and it's just completely changed the game. Most people have that image in their head of the quit-essential upstate modern cabin set in the woods. We've definitely tried to tap into that and create something that's attainable for these people. Say you can have that, you can be swiping through Instagram and that can be your home too. There's been quite a proliferation of these direct to consumer brands. There's just tons of them out there. It's not that hard to start up a website that sells things and get things manufactured for that e-commerce platform. So like all birds with shoes, Casper with mattresses or Warby Parker with glasses. All of that means a lot more opportunity for brands in the online shopping space. So it's natural that real estate would want to get involved as well with these big ticket items. 10 years ago the broker would drive the search. Now I think that my clients texts me listings. They have alerts. They find things quicker than we do sometimes because we're out and about. I'd say that the buyer is much more involved these days.

16689," Social selling is creating brand new ways to shop. So let's look at vintage clothing, for example. There are sellers on Instagram finding successful ways to sell one of a kind items. It's that fleeting nature, the ephemeral nature of social media, you post the item online and whoever's first gets that one of a kind item. Now real estate has similar scarcity to it. There's one place to buy. It's one home, one apartment, one thing. It's one of a kind. But the rise in social media real estate isn't just about the instant gratification. Researcher Andre Perry, who studies economic inclusion at the Brookings Institute, says social media has evolved from the days of online hangout spaces and mood boards to a powerful change agent. Social media is a primary source to get news and information. But it's not just about social media. It's about the movement that we're in. The racial justice uprising really gave people a sense of worth and empowerment. And so people not only are getting information about what protects people in the long run from economic shocks, things like wealth. In his research, Andre found that not only are more millennials buying homes during the pandemic, the rate of home ownership among black millennials are at historic highs. The fastest way to accumulate wealth in this country traditionally has been through home ownership. Millennials in particular are saying, hey, I want protection. I want to live longer. I want my education to go further. Let me acquire wealth. And the fastest way to do that is through home ownership. When the pandemic hit many of the amenities or the comforts that came along with those living conditions were gone. Folks couldn't go to bars and fancy shops. And so you saw instead of people going out and buying clothes, they saved their money and bought property and outside of the city generally. People are moving to the suburbs, to rural areas, places where home prices are a little bit cheaper. Many home buyers are looking for houses outside the major metropolitan areas. Additionally, many home buyers are looking for direct outdoor access and added space as the uncertainty about the virus persist. Millennials are also looking to influencers not just for the latest trends and TikTok dances, but to partake in important conversations, be it about politics or personal finance or anything in between. Real estate ownership. Let's start small. Let's don't be scared to start small instead, instead of renting a big house in the hills and California like most artists do buy you one that's on the flat. I meet folks like Brandon Rool and Charlotte Main the God. You have residential real estate and you have commercial real estate. They're talking about buying homes. When I was coming up, really home buying was a mysterious shrouded process that only a few people could teach me. Now I can easily log on to Clubhouse or Instagram and find literally lessons on how to purchase a home, but done with savvy and finesse. Today we're going to make a greenhouse. I am DIYing the entire closet. Heather, having bought her fixer up her site on scene, also looked to internet personalities to help figure out how to modernize and to make sure her home was also an investment. It gave us a lot of confidence. They make it look super easy. How we could do all of those things ourselves. My husband just installed a laundry shoe, which is something we never would have thought of if we didn't see an influencer do that and how easy it actually is. Really simple do it yourself project. You can do that. You have any questions. Go ahead and message me. And in the case of Neville House, Josh and Paley hope that buyers see these homes as potential secondary income. These young families look at these products and look at our homes and say, here's a turnkey. This can serve our family, but this can also be the perfect rental. We've tried to strike a balance in the design of the home for working well as a family home. That's going to be lived in and also working as an investment. A lot of this points to how millennials can utilize and leverage social media to their benefit. Bye.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5035,2022-10-20 23:52:44
16690," A lot of this points to how millennials can utilize and leverage social media to their benefit. But it also speaks to, again, this moment that folks want freedom. So millennials are really stepping up to this real estate game and taking ownership and building well. Of course, not everything is as it seems online. While social media can be a useful tool for learning, there's still a lot it can't tell you about the home buying experience or living in the suburbs for that matter. We knew going into it, budgeting for a lot of renovations. We kind of thought if we buy it at $450, we could put $300,000 into the house and really make it ours and our own. I can't wait to replace in this kitchen and update our built-in deep fryer, which was not in the listing photos. We kind of got into the house and we realized that budget was completely unrealistic. We have a lot of people who see our design on Instagram and they say, I love it. Can you come build this on my property? And then they'll send us the lot, which they bought site unseen during COVID and because of site conditions or zoning, it's virtually unbuildable. I think we all know that what you see on Instagram and what you see in real life are two very different things. So while we can definitely as brokers create these fantastic narratives, the one recommendation that I would give is do your homework. Don't believe everything you say. That's not to say that there's dishonesty or anything where people are trying to manipulate you, but not everything you see is accurate. This shift towards social media house hunting may also help to bring equilibrium to a market that has historically disadvantaged specific groups of buyers. Many of the traditional ways that people got mortgages or loans often precluded black people because they deemed us too risky for those loans. With technology, there's ways to get around that. As long as more black people get educated on racism and discrimination in lending, we're going to figure out ways to get around that racism. Then there's the same story we're trying to interpret as sign language in Yum Waitz When I was 24 years old, I saw the UFC on a paper view on TV. And I was so overwhelmed by the athleticism, the skill. And then at the end of the fight, the combatants hugged, they shook hands, and I just fell in love with it. Part of UFC's appeal is it doesn't look like a ballad athletic display of martial talent and mastery as much as it looks like a bar fight. We choose to do this because we love this sport, but it is a business. And if you do not treat it like a business, I guarantee you that the promoter is, and you will be left broken, broken at the end of your career. Each of us have an individual story, but as with anything you take enough of these individual stories and you see not only crossover but intersectionality.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5036,2022-10-20 23:57:01
